As a result, we concluded that the role was not a good fit for me and I left the company in my second month of employment. Thank goodness I hadn't moved to Amsterdam (yet)!

Pay raises recently have corrected previously low salaries
Lunch in the office (pre covid)
WFH allowance 
You get access to a lot of systems compared to other companies.","Lack of cross department coordination so escalating issues handled by other departments is a nightmare.

IT team has been gutted by layoffs and attrition and unable to hire replacements so workload is heavy. IT support has KPIs and SLAs but engineering teams have no targets so there is no incentive to resolve issues. 

Lack of promotions due to insanely high bar no one can reach & everyone has low morale anyway so no one tries. 

Lack of experienced techs and managers, too many old timers who don’t have experience running an IT department that supports thousands of employees.

Overall IT infrastructure lacks professional engineers & leaders leading to a frustrating experience for company users and engineers.

Company CEO and upper management are cut throat and only care about their bonuses & have been caught lying about layoffs so trust in leadership is very low."

The true test for this is what happens when things get tough. When the Covid pandemic started to hit profits, then they didn't hesitate to start cutting jobs including in engineering. 

Some engineers who where loyal where rewarded by being paid much less than new hires. I had direct reports who where experienced and good at their job being paid less than new graduates.

Career progression is possible, but highly bureaucratic.

Lots of legacy tech that's not nice to work with. 

Also don't believe the hype about doing the right thing. That only applies if it doesn't hurt the share holders. Example, is it right to sell accommodation on land stolen illegally by Israel from the Palestinians... no, but it's profitable so let's do it anyway! (this isn't my opinion, the UN regards Israels actions as illegal so go research for yourself)."

173,Booking.com,Do It For a Year and Then Get Out ASAP,2022-02-02,2.0,Account Manager,"-The salary is favourable compared to other hospitality jobs in the area

-You will gain the opportunity to improve skills such as reviewing data, meeting with clients, and maintaining an organised workflow in a high-pressure environment

-There is an occasional perk like free lunches/parties but this generally is the bare minimum compared to other tech companies

-Some of the local offices have genuinely fantastic people, and you will likely make some lifelong friends

-The actual clients (hotels, B&Bs, etc.) are often times a real joy to work with.","Where to start...

-The local management is generally very toxic. Every person who's been in the company for any period of time knows it is all about playing favourites and sucking up. With a few positive exceptions, they have absolutely no interest in people's mental health, goals, challenges, etc.

-Speaking of management, the majority of them are completely useless. Some of them can't even use excel or read a basic graph. It's hard to get training when those above you are so deeply incompetent

-The growth potential (unless you are in Amsterdam) is near 0. Some people have sat in the same position for 7+ years. New positions almost never open up (probably due to the incompetency point above). It's not a good company to grow with.

-Feedback is treated like it's saying Voldemort. People are routinely told by their superiors that any form of productive feedback is not tolerated and will harm their review score/bonus/chance of promotion/etc. 

-The amount of responsibility you are given will grow every single quarter with absolutely no upper barrier, and no change in pay or title. You will reach a point where hitting your basic targets while juggling 10+ extra responsibilities seems physically impossible. This is why many people work considerable overtime (but again, no extra pay or chance of promotion from this). 

-The goals are generally set on a global (or regional) level and often fail to translate into actually relevant outcomes. During the peak of COVID-19 we were literally leaving voicemails for deserted guest houses dozens of times a day, just so we could say we are 'building trust with our partners'. You will spend a lot of times working on tasks that clearly have no benefit to either the company or your clients. 

- As a tech company, Booking is transitioning more and more trust and tasks to AI. This would be great if not for the fact that their internal software is absolute rubbish (tech devs left in droves in recent years and they have had a brain drain). You will be given tools that are critical to daily tasks yet simply do not work. And don't expect management to help (see point above re: clueless) or care (see point above re: toxicity).

-Performance-related bonuses are a farce, borderline scam. You can do bare minimum and drag your way to the finish, or go all-out and go insane with calls/visits/reports/extras. Either way you will likely get the same 'meets expectations' score. Don't bother being an overachiever, as it won't get you a promotion or raise. 


In general, before applying you should be aware that roughly 1 year ago there was a widespread demand from account managers that the management start addressing mental health issues brought upon by the company's culture. I used to think that Covid-19 was the source of my depression and anxiety, but now that I am ~6 months out I've realised that it was the company causing this."

- Ability to work Overtime
- Overall good and friendly atmosphere
- Safe work environment 
- Every year we receive gift cards of 300 USD (Non-Withdrawable)
- Some nice and cute booking branded gifts","External teamleaders are super unprofessional, don't know internal procedures, didn't work as agents in the past. Some teams tried to report their TLs due to compliance issues to HR, but HR did nothing.
People who create guidelines didn't work as agents, don't accept any feedbacks from 1st line employees. 
A lot of Fraudulent properties. Booking Holding is loosing a lot of money for payouts, only due to unprofessional guidelines procedures and unprofessional external management team, who is aware of it, but does nothing everyday.
- Huge amount of severe bugs in internal system, sometimes we didn't work for 2 - 3 hours only because of bugs.
Cairo (EPS Office in Egypt) makes huge KPI, but in reality they make more huge and fatal mistakes, Seniors in charge can can only make a payout, since some problems remain unsolvable.
Orlando EPS makes huge mistakes and very rude to guests, gets more, but doesnt understand the guidelines."

The amount of training I received in my years of employment at Booking.com was one of the main motivators that kept me at the company. Their investment in my professional and personal development was impressive as I traveled all over the US and to Amsterdam to network and learn. They also utilize LinkedIn Learning for all employees (at least in the US), and encourage you to set aside time for development. Such a great trait in an employer and very strategic to increase employee retention.","Difficult to grow in career without relocating. Best opportunities are in their major offices or HQ (Amsterdam).

In the early years it was the people who made the place truly magical, but I am unsure if the same spirit has survived the growth.
During my time there I met some of the most inspiring and competent professionals I know.","I was there during the most intense growth period the company ever had. Our team expanded at high speed, our roles were not clearly defined, our responsibilities were increasing with no clear adjustment or compensation. Management was well-intentioned at best, unsupported, and severely disempowered through a combination of experimental structures and a total lack of understanding and follow-through from leadership.
This resulted in frequent and severe burnouts and contributed to the development of a toxic environment.
During a short time, the faces of Booking's leadership had finally started to look more diverse, but sadly this did not last. For a company flouting diversity and care for their employees I'd say: you can do better."

You make 10k less and do the same position. This may not seem like a big deal....but when you work as an AE for years, other companies you apply for think you just create new partnerships. You do not. you manage accounts. Booking just does that because they want to pay you less. And its extremely hard to move up to an account manager with the current management in Chicago. So you become stuck.

The Chicago office management is poor. Lack of communication. The system that tracks your performance is always broken. You have to fight to get a decent performance. If you go above and beyond in your position, you may not get paid more in bonus. You have to impact the entire region or USA (not being dramatic. Its legit). And after that, you may get around $500 more. 

I only recommend working here if you are unemployed or just really need sales experience....But do not stay here long."

536,Booking.com,Answer the phone,2021-08-29,3.0,Bilingual Customer Service Specialist,"- you get to use your languages on a daily basis
- communication with guests and partners, helping them and making their day, being there for them
- intellectually easy work
- home office","- intellectually boring work
- high volume of complaints and dissatisfied customers
- short breaks"
537,Booking.com,"One of those companies that say ""we are a big family"". You can decide if that's good or bad",2021-08-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Entry-level salaries are relatively high compared to a lot of other call centers around, and there are some perks (more about this in the disadvantages later on). You'll find lots of fun people to get to know (destined to happen in an office of 600 people)","Notice how the majority of negative reviews are about the customer service office and not the account management one? Something to keep in mind when skimming through reviews, because if you're applying for a job in customer service your life will be much tougher and less remunerated. 

Being promoted doesn't mean you'll get a salary increase. If you have been working there a long time and have had your salary increase over the years, you'll still be ineligible for more money if the position you're promoted to has a lower predetermined salary, which is devastating on the morale of the most loyal employees and rewards new employees who might have just arrived at the right time. This also seems to sometimes vary based on departments, which is clearly frustrating for everyone else.

The corporate culture is quite corny. Lots of cringey videos produced by staff to motivate employees, cheap plastic gadgets to boost morale, lots of corporate values that are repeated over and over and that everyone is supposed to follow, but management clearly doesn't. It's one of those places where ""you're family"" but it's more like, they're your parents and you're their child. You have to constantly change your status and follow a predetermined schedule (which might change during the day and if you don't notice you'll mess up your KPI, and your bonus as a consequence). 

Targets are often set high, and your bonus is based on an evaluation that your manager makes of you, which often means that if your manager likes you you'll get more money, and vice versa. Also there is no real alignment among managers, and it's well known that if you're lucky to go to a certain team you'll just get more money. 

The change of CEO a couple of years ago also started a decline in perks, and every update has turned into ""you can work harder"". Lots of workload disparity between languages without any consequence on the remuneration, so you might be getting as much as someone who's working much less than you.

The site manager is deaf to anybody's complaints, and there are a few managers who have been there since the beginning of the office and do not seem to have improved their abilities since. New hire churn in the first 6 months is abysmal, and the recruitment process is a disaster (1 person who needs to rely on several team leaders around, who are often not very good recruiters).

There are so many things that I could still mention, like the fact that you cannot ask for holidays any time you want during the year, and that for some languages it's almost impossible to get long summer holidays, also having both Christmas and NYE off is forbidden. But the reality is this: if you just arrived in Barcelona and need a job to pay bills this is a good option, if you can get promoted as soon as possible (you still need to be there at least 6 months, often even 12, to be considered for a promotion), spend some time there until you can move to a better company that will treat you more like a human being than a robot and might give you less fruit and mottos but more compensation and support."

As the leader, they are always improving the site and the tooling and changing keep up with the market. This environment was a challenge for those of us in customer service, who were the front lines, but it kept us adapting and aware of everything. In the customer service centers, you work in teams and that team became family. The people in these offices are the best part of working for this company. And because the company is worldwide, you never know who you'll speak to from around the world. Our teams were populated with people from all different background and experiences and I found myself with good friends who grew up in Brazil and Palestine and Russia and their life experiences really bring different perspectives to the office.","With the constant growth and changing in the market, things would change from one day to the next with little to no time to communicate changes to the entire workforce. In customer service, we would work one way one day and things would be completely different the next day and we would have to adapt on the fly and figure the changes out with customers on the line with the same questions. Communication of changes across the business was really the biggest issue I had with the working environment."

773,Booking.com,Wildly varied experiences depending on team/PM/department,2021-05-19,3.0,User Experience Designer,"• Interesting topic ... travel, who is not into that? ( at least one person I worked with, but they are at least, an exception )
• It's in Amsterdam, if living in a city that feels like some sanitised version of the Golden Age but with Van Moofs instead of horses is your thing ( it is )
• There are no hard deadlines so if you are used to working in an agency, this may seem low pressure ( it is - but that is a double edge sword, see cons )
• A truly diverse set of colleagues... if you are lucky and/or proactive, you can meet any kind of soul you seek
• In normal times, you get a decent lunch with an array of healthy and unhealthy options
• Your work can genuinely be seen by millions of people... meaning you can somewhat measure the impact of any changes you make ( this can also be depressing, see cons )
• If you are lucky and land in a good team it can be a really supportive and exciting job, you can organise exciting research sessions, collaborate with enthusiastic and easygoing colleagues, learn from people, share knowledge and be recognised, achieve steps which help our users,","• A culture that seems very good on the surface in terms apparent care for employees welfare, with assistance programs and strong awareness and encouragement to seek help ""from your manager"" or the ""employee assistance program""... but a working culture that breeds mental health issues: For example... 1. Constant reshuffling of departments/teams/tracks/objectives. 
2. Rarely a feeling of completion ... things get buzzed about, implemented badly and then dropped for the next shiny thing. It's like being a spoiled toddler, except less fun.
3. Obsession with 'objectives' ( Company/department/track/design-track/team) you have to ritualistically set each half, and then be held accountable to if you did not meet all of them... so you need to predict ( in a so called agile environment ) exactly what you will be able to do in advanced. 
4. An insanely complex and conflicting environment... bewildering amount of information on a daily basis (via internal Facebook and 4 other chat systems), and as UX Designers it can feel you need to keep up with it. You need to be ultra disciplined to not be bogged down by it all. Or just stop caring.
4. A top down culture... but without top down help. Leaders and even leads / managers tell you you need to do... and ""it's up to you"" how to do it. Think waterfall in an agile mountain stream with loads of dead sheep in it.
5. Showpony culture. They rightly removed one of their values which was 'no show ponies'. Now, you will not be recognized or rewarded or get good feedback from outside your team, unless you do a LOT of promotional work... slides, posts, presentations... you can spend majority of your time doing this. 
6. Mind shattering inefficiency... the end does not justify the means on so many things. Things that in other companies take a few weeks can literally take years at Booking because .... tech stack / politics / 'prove it with data before you've implemented' / 'small steps' can equal: build it badly and wonder why it failed' / Chaotic tech stack and insane team and depts organising etc.
 • You can certainly end up on a great team ( on the other hand you can end up on a team where everyone is burning out and/or leaving and/or coasting and you feel powerless to change anything. Having a good PM changes everything. Opposite is also true, and the standard varies. Whereas designers tend to be good/really good/really technical/unicorn.
• A dizzying amount of meetings. Fine if you are a PM or TL, but if you produce deliverable work as well, this is truly testing."

- People are friendly, open, and fun. Plus, the culture is quite informal
- Lots of freedom in how you approach your work
- Work/life balance - it feels like things are much more focused on results than hours put in. Long hours are the exception rather than the rule, and have (from what I've seen) always been self-driven. 
- Glenn Fogel (CEO) has brought in much needed clarity and decision making on the long term vision","- Many product teams and product leaders seem to be focused primarily on short-term results in terms of bookings. This makes it hard to invest in projects that take time to mature. 
- PMMs are welcome and wanted in some teams and despised in others. The quality of experience you'll have is a bit of a coin flip. 
- Product marketing isn't very well defined at Booking. If you have a manager or a colleague who sees things very differently it can be hard to settle the debate.
- Career development is usually entirely run by yourself. There aren't much structures in place to help you grow
- Performance evaluations and promotion processes can at times feel random and arbitrary. Success criteria are usually not clearly defined. 
- The Works Council seems to view itself more as an activist political party than a partner to the business. At times, they appear to be blocking things just for the sake of showing they should have a say."

962,Booking.com,The happiest since it ended!,2021-03-26,1.0,Customer Service Executive,"For almost four years, the only reason that made me stay is the financial part. Most of us on weekend shifts were paid around £2,000 per month which -for a customer service role- is quite high. 

However, this is where the good part start and ends.","First thing first, although premiums were paid every month, our HR always refused to include them in the employment letters that we asked for. They could have easily used a working that was only legally-binding for the current period but instead you had to explain to your bank or real estate agent why you declared £30K a year while the company states they only paid you £23K. Amazing, right? 

The Amsterdam office is a whole other world because that's where the company is from originally. Basically, thinking of it as in highschool, the Amsterdam office is the quarterback with the cheerleader, while other offices are at best the geek, and at worst the kid that gets locked-up in their locker. 

As an agent, it is really hard to keep up with the lack of consistency the company has throughout the globe. One procedure is handled very differently in Europe and in the US because, to put it simply, customer service sucks in Europe. So while in the US we had agents who covered many extra spendings from guests when their accommodation could not accept them (as far as flight tickets and/or very expensive hotels/refunds), we in Europe had to fight with a Senior role -who had the *only* power (you couldn't appeal it)- for a €40 compensation. Our offices in Europe were absolutely not customer-oriented. The first thing seniors checked when we had to decide what to do was the property's profile and how much commission the property paid and then how much commission was paid thanks to the guest who was making the complaint. This tells you how little they cared about people, and how much they did about money. 

Many -not all- seniors were very arrogant and patronizing on the phone. We had a senior who, instead of addressing the question from the agent, would litteraly send them a page and ask them to READ the page to the senior on the phone and the senior would then ask ""what did you understand from this?"" ... Both a waste of time and super rude. The senior was reported by many agents all over the floor many times and nothing was done because he apparently had good KPIs. Some of them were genuinely adorable, others were extremely condescending. 

The lack of consistency between different locations affects KPIs which were highly unrealistic as you couldn't obviously provide quantity and quality at the same time and be within your targets. The company would fake a tolerance, but one day you'd have a Manager who didn't like your face and suddenly you'd have a PIP and then be fired. 

Managers are rarely recruited within the company, which is non-sense as the best way to appreciate the work of agents is to have a knowledge of what they're going through on a daily. Still, the company mainly recruited our Managers externally. 

Agents refered as EPS (basically based in countries where labour is cheap) were very much prone to making very expensive mistakes (sending a legally binding relocation offer costing thousands of dollars, that the company would need to pay for because the mistake was theirs) but this mistakes enabled these agents to have better KPIs because of course guests will be very happy to go from a tent to a five-star hotel while we had to deliver the bad news and receive poor surveys. 

If you weren't a hypocrite, you wouldn't succeed in this company. In the London office, it was quite clear that favoritism existed. I had to fight tooth and nail to keep my job several times and the only thing that saved me was that I kept screenshots of everything. Others weren't so lucky. This company functions on ""what LOOKS good"" so we had a lot of training in regards to appropriate attitudes in the workplace while many of us experienced bullying, harassment (both moral and sexual), and racism, all that without having anyone to turn to in reality because the culprit had the right connections. A quality coach confirmed to me that when they tried to sack me, they ask the quality coach to listen to any and every call and to find one that would enable them to sack me. This particular quality coach refused, and another one accepted. I was lucky that the only call they found was not bad enough for them to dismiss me and that I had proof regarding bullying, harassment, and racism from my manager. 

If you didn't take part in ridiculous jokes that they had, if you keep to yourself, if you don't feel like you want to attend the company/your team events, this would have been looked at and you'd be labeled ""difficult"". 

There were a LOT of rumours about everyone. I had people talk to me and had opinions about me, while I didn't even know them but they chatted with my manager who -obviously- had an opinion to share. I had several managers throughout my journey with Booking, one was extremely moody, one was good, one sexually harassed me and bullied me every single day for months, one was a racist who tried to sack me and the last one was great. 

A witch-hunt took place about a year before we were made redundant and, the rumour was that they needed to save up money because the London office was too expensive to run and needed to sack about 100 agents. Consequently, a whole bunch of agents was sacked for things that had been tolerated for YEARS but that the company suddenly decided to tackle. 

I have to say the ONLY highlight I had in those years was when they announced our redundancy which literally made me cry with joy. I was literally paid to leave a company I hated for years. 

For that, I thank covid. Covid made me free from this toxic environment and these negative people where everything and everyone is fake."

- Big company with too many processes, everyone is in their ""box"", don't ask too many questions or they will blame you for not embracing change.
- They pretend to care about people but Covid showed many examples where there was no consideration whatsoever. Even though, we expected layoffs to happen, it was handled very poorly. 
Some typical examples such as : Demoting pregnant women (with lower pay of course, threatening them to take it or leave it), people who moved from a country to another for and with Booking suddenly stopped receiving any help with visa & immigration, therefore, we saw people who had 3 weeks to leave a country they were living in for 4+ years and nobody cared.
- More & more micromanagement
- They claim work/life balance is important but you still have to work 40+ hours a week with 50% travel
- Management in Canada is quite isolated from the rest of North America. the very few opportunities to evolve being mostly in the US and Booking won't help you for immigration there, so basically you are stuck where you are."

We have a habit of hiring “diverse” employees and then giving them “glass cliff” positions and setting them up for failure. Then they quickly burn out, resign, or get fired. 
The company scaled way too fast because leadership genuinely has no idea what they’re doing short of exploiting short-term fiscal growth at all costs (including human cost). 
The point is, the chaos at the highest level of leadership negatively impacts every aspect of working at this company. Not in a good way.
The burnout rate is so high it’s deeply concerning.

- Great Colleagues
- Central offices","1. There is a bad culture within the company, when it comes to favouritism. People who just work a few months within the company and have almost no people skills, are being promoted to different roles as they are friends (with benefits) or having a relationship with other managers. As example, Person A works 4,5 years at the company and is applying for a the role of her manager, who is leaving, and at a previous job was (s)he also a manager. Person B just works 5 months within the company and this is his/her first job, but (s)he is also friends with the recruiter and has a relations ship with another manager. Person B get the job and person A get told by the recruiter ""The other people had more experience for this role and with the company"".
2. You are being given targets what are impossible to reach if you work by the rules set by management, but if you got a (senior) manager who is willing to help you (see also point 1), then it is possible to get the targets, even if this means they will break laws (like the GDPR). When you will not reach our target you will have to explain why etc, but when you challenge the targets set will you get a standard response with ""But the were able to reach the target"", and when you advise why that was is it always ""Well we are not going to speak about how they reached their targets and if it was done correctly"".
3. FCA and Customer Privacy laws are broken on an daily base, and when you report it to the correct department, nothing will be done. People who kept credit card details of customers are still working for the company and only received a (paid) suspension of a few weeks.
4. The pay is not great at all, especially not for the stress caused by the role and the daily abuse you get.
5. You will hear the Company Values on a weekly base, and as a normal employee does the company expect you to know them by heart. Only to see management and the leadership team throwing those values in the wind as fast as they can."

1161,Booking.com,Booking is on the decline,2021-02-15,1.0,Manager Software Development,"- good pay
- good work life balance
- people are friendly (but mostly fake, due to 'compliance')","- 'we celebrate diversity' by requiring everyone to act the same. Leave your personality and culture at the door before you enter, and assume your corporate-compliant persona.
- 'leadership' team can't decide whether they want to be agile, or work warterfallish. One side of the org does one thing, the other side the other.
- no courage to take on new markets, invent new solutions. Only trying to milk more and more the existing stale website. 
- too many peopoe working on the same footprint, across all roles (Product Manager, software engineer, designer, data scientists, team leader etc). People fighting to find and fend of things to do as 'achievement' to get an 'exceeds' as perf score.
- completely broken performance review: obsolutely massive amounts of time are taken per manager per report (preparing their 'case', 'defending' the case amongst peers etc), and yet, managers are pushing for a forced distribution (even though they will vehemently deny it), leading to some people simply having bad luck, and being screwed out of a bonus. Not fun for the employee, not fun for the manager that has to deal with this.
- Booking.com institutionally applies doublespeak to many things: they speak of 'learnings' when really they mean 'faillures and forgets'. 
- Not acknowledging organizational weaknesses, or institutional problems is core to Booking's current decline: everyone just needs to march on in the an swamp of chaos and overbearing management (teams spend 4 weeks full time every 6 months setting up 'objectives, which are any way already fixed from the top). 

- Booking was fun and promosing when times were good, but now that Booking needs to actually start competing with other companies, it become clear that the con-men product people are still in charge and results are lacking. And they all try to con their way with upwards graphs, presentations and other fancy-looking presentations. This goes all the way to the top. 

- Booking will still be going string for a number of years, especially since the pandemic is wiping away small competitors. But with the current (lack of) direction, it is slowly fading into a place where you can find MySpace and Nokia."
1162,Booking.com,Weigh Your Options - Downhill Company,2021-02-14,2.0,Guest Specialist,"-> Generous PTO
-> 6% Matching 401k
-> Diverse colleagues
-> Quarterly bonuses

Great entry-level job to build experience. In North America, they only operate as a call center, so there will be little room for career growth. Your three options will be someone who takes the escalated calls, a team manager, or if you were on the guest side, to work on the partner side of calls. All of the professional growth careers, like coding for the website, are still in Amsterdam and Europe. To be viewed as a temporary job to give you great entry level benefits while you're working on the rest of your life, not to be viewed as a place to build your career.","Favoritism from management is rampant, which can be to your benefit, but means you'll be playing the office politics game if you want to move up. This job is for someone very social, outgoing, or did well in high school. Your daily life heavily depends on who your manager is, and you can have a vastly different experience than your colleague under a different manager, for better or worse. This is both good and bad as they shift who your manager is often. There is little incentive to be a rule-abiding employee after seeing how many of your colleagues will behave in bad practices just to meet their numbers quotas, and they do this because they are constantly scared of getting fired.  Fear is used as a management practice here, even though the job is already stressful enough.  At the end of the day, this is a company trying to make money, so understand this is a business, and don't be fooled by the sugarcoating they say about how different they are."

No real transparency from the Management (Amsterdam).
No real care in the customers in general, the procedure benefits mostly Booking.com, nor the partners, nor the customers! 
Booking.com = money. 
Was also hard to grow within the company as the keep asking you to be as you are (reserved, shy but still good at what you do!) but always ask you to show more in the workplace environment...

Up until the pandemic the company was cruising and growing, it was an exciting time.

The people I got to work with were really great and supportive. I had a really good direct manager and prior to that the same. Doing the right thing I would say was something that was at the very core of Booking, right up until I was made redundant.

I learned a lot from Booking and working there has to be one of the better decisions I have made. It has opened so many doors that I think would have been closed had I not worked there.

The redundancies were a sad time for the organisation but at the same time they should position Booking for when the recovery starts, back to massive growth, buzzing with activity. 

The offices were nice and the new building will be even better when it opens. We got to work with some really cool tech and I got to work with some incredibly talented people during my time at Booking, and that was priceless.","Of course nowhere is without faults, sometimes things could move slower than I would like due to the size and scale but that's all really."

1418,Booking.com,"Great place to work for, until the new CEO came in",2020-12-28,3.0,Customer Service Specialist,"Great place to work, due to the high KPIs the company offered many incentives such as high pay, different shift patterns and cashback for properties booked via the platform. Moreover, this is a great company to work for especially coming out of university, as the atmosphere is primarily young, active and diverse. I was able to constantly swap my shifts and have time off in the future without using my holidays, free food, free coffee and free healthy snacks.","No company is ever perfect, but please take this as constructive criticism. In order to have a good work-life in Booking, depends on the Team leader that you are assigned to. As micromanagement is at the forefront in this role, luckily my TL treated us like adults and continued to let us get on with our work, so long as we met the office targets; whereas other TLs will put a lot of high pressure on their agents in an attempt to surpass the min office targets, as a result, this is counter-intuitive and produces the opposite results. 

The TLs only want high results so that they can get higher bonuses and if that does not happen, they will find ways to make the agents work-life not so great, giving them an excuse to leave the firm and thus giving the TLs better stats, leading to another criticism, the firm is all about numbers. Whilst they heavily preach that the ""customer is at the centre of everything we do"", could not be further from the truth. I will not go into full details, but due to the firm being so stat driven and TLs wanting high team stats, this has led to agents cheating the system, in order to elevate the pressure that they are receiving and not be constantly threatened with a Personal Improvement Plan or dismissal. 

It is very hard to be dismissed by this firm, and that is a good thing however some of the TLs will try to find ways if the agent is not meeting their personal expectations, even though they are meeting office targets. Nonetheless, I do admire the organisation trying to find ways to improve personal development and hire from within, but unfortunately, Booking is also a victim of brown nosing and who you know, in order to be promoted or to be part of certain CRM projects. This company is a very LGBT friendly environment and that is amazing for being inclusive and progressive, however they are constantly shoving their own beliefs in our throats and it can be overwhelming at times. Some staff and Management as well need to be reminded that this is a workplace and not a drag Queen race or a club. 

I have seen some pretty obscene stuff and heard some pretty hurtful things for someone having an opinion or raising concerns. For example should a staff member that happens to be gay, is in the wrong no one will say anything as that person will scream homophobia. I strongly believe in equality and that we need to treat everyone the same, but we need to be professional and if there is insubordination, people should be able to comfortably raise concerns to management as this is a workplace. 

Lastly, the new CEO Glenn I would describe him as a Shareholders w3t dream, but just like when seeing a lady of the evening, the pleasure is only temporary and does not last very long. Some of the decisions that he has made are understandable, given the current pandemic; however in the long run, it looks like he will be shifting operations over to the USA due to its lax labour laws in comparison to the EU and closing some operations down and giving them to 3rd parties instead. 

Working life was great under the previous CEO Gillian, who recognised the importance of work-life balance, however as I cannot go into detail, some of the decisions made are highly questionable and that has led to a mass exodus of staff leaving the company, whether this was intentional or not, we will never know but staff retention and satisfaction were very high under Gillian, but the trend is now declining under the new CEO. Finally, I would still recommend this company, it is a great place to work with great people, however due to an American CEO who not only knows how to please the shareholders but also taking over a European company; please be aware that you are now a number and expendable, only work for Booking if it meets your personal criteria and goals."

There's a bunch of perks - terribly badly advertised - which can be used and having a yearly bonus is always a good thing but definitely not enough with remuneration (more on that later). 

The tech you work on can vary wildly, but some of the teams do some very interesting stuff but you may end up working on the legacy parts of the company which I have no description to it other than hell.","- There is next to no autonomy. Teams don't get to choose what they will focus on, people gets removed and added to the teams like it or not and as a manager I get 0 say over any of it. Managers are there to ""report back"" but the reality is your opinion doesn't matter unless you're a director or above. 

- Salaries are well below the market average. Engineering Managers are easily 15-20k under market standards, don't get me started about developers. Unless you have newly joined or come with some better negotiating salary so you're good then. Being in the company for more than a year is NOT rewarded. 

- Roadmaps are driven top down. I'm not a product manager but if I was one I would not want to work on this side. I don't know how it works with Amsterdam but in Manchester roadmaps are presented to the team and PMs just have to do whatever they can with it. 

- No manager autonomy (cont). As a manager I can't decide much around my teams, no salaries, no notice periods, hell I sometimes I don't even get to interview people coming into my team. How are you supposed to do anything is beyond me. 

- Even though there's a lot of talk about feedback culture, feedback when applying for internal promotions is next to none and you move up if you know the right people."

They gave us no opportunity to question why or to refuse the decision. Responses from HR in the meantime is to repeatedly send the same canned response not answering specific questions.

- Good place to meet new friends for life.
- If you know the right people within the company, will you be able to progress into other roles quite easily.","The following is based on my experience and it can be different in other department within the company:
- Targets are being set by (senior) management what are unrealistic due to the tools and programs we have to use (15+ year old, unreliable, and unable to get the right data). You are only able to reach the targets by pure luck or by fraud/bending the rules.
- Consequences are worse for not reaching your targets (read: losing your job) then committing fraud to reach the targets (read: a non-formal warning). 
- When reporting fraud being committed or a GDPR breach having held place to the correct departments, will you get an response that they do not got the proof to take further steps (even while you sent enough proof to start an investigation and or even take the steps needed), and will there sometimes even be an investigation started against yourself in how you were able to get the proof (read: retribution) instead.
- In the 5 years I've worked for the company, have I also reported several issues customers are having on a regular base; during the booking process, terms and conditions on our website etc. Most of them have never been picked up, and so are still an frustration to this day for the customers, even while one of the mottos of the Leadership team is ""Think Customer first"". And the points that were picked up (most of the times 2 or 3 years after it was first reported), went back to the way it was within the first software/process/website update, a few months/weeks later.
- If you are not willing to start an relationship with someone within higher up in the company, nor have family or friends within management or recruitment, then you will notice that it is (made) as good as impossible to progress any further.
 * as examples: 
E1: Person A worked already for 8 months in an secondment, when a permanent position came available. Due to the process (what is done in double standards, as some people get the full time automatically after an secondment, others have re-apply for the position) did Person A apply for the role again to be able to get the permanent position. This was only given to Person B, who never working it that role before, as recruitment told Person B had more experience within the role Person A was already working in.
E2: For a certain role were 3 position availed, during the recruitment did you had to do an test where you had to workout examples of the daily job and had to answer skills-set questions during an interview. For the test did Person A score 85%, Person B 80%, Person C and D both 60%. Person B was also told that all the info given during the interview was correct. Only did person B not get the job (as well D as C were friends of the recruiter/manager, know to every one)
- Due to the above do you got people in management positions, without having the skills or knowledge to be able to do that job. You will notice this quit easily with some of the responses you get from Team Managers. Senior Managers, Head of Departments: ""You do what you think is best, as you know more about the issue and process then I do"", ""If you say so, then it will be so."", ""So in al those years I worked here, I did look at the wrong numbers?(read: targets)""
- Even while it is being said it is an equal opportunity company, the recruitment department for the call center (where 500+ people work) is quite clear that their internal policy is not to hire people with an disability, and is also being made clear to people who start working within the department. (Maybe this as the call center has not even toilets or emergency exit facilities for disabled people).
- The pay is okay, but not great compared to what other companies offer now days.
- You are most of the time just a number within the company, easily replaceable and easily being ignored f you got any ideas, requests or questions. 
- As most people see the company the same way as I've seen it, is the overturn higher then an average supermarket. What causes a lot of good people to leave the company at the first possible option."

This office always been in the hands of a few British employees that have been hired more than 10 years ago, they took over the best positions and did not give any chance to progress in the career to all the foreign staff that been employed during the years up to now. Bullying, micromanagement at its best (one second of lateness in breaks could have costed you a formal meeting), sexual harassment, scuffs and drunkenness during social events/staff parties, discrimination at work (team leaders shouting at staff to only speak English or threatening posts on the work platform by HR of the same content while this is not allowed by the English law), pressure on achieve KPIs by team leaders that used to spend almost all day smoking outside or on Facebook or Tinder, poor or no knowledge at all by Customer Service Managers or Human Resource about work regulations and employees rights with the result that plenty staff has been unfairly dismissed while others had to refer to lawyers or Unions in order to fight for their rights and not lose their jobs. It is sad that plenty valued staff are going to lose their jobs in one of the worst periods of British history because the company decided to close this site and the one in London but, in the other hand, it will hopefully teach some humility to other members of staff that made the life of employees become a nightmare (can not count all the people that reported sick for stress and anxiety in the last six years and more)."

- international environment, you can learn a lot about other cultures and work with many types of people

- excellent work/life balance, and some business travel involved (at least before 2020)

- some processes are okay, you can learn some procedures that will help you in your future career(s)

- you get accustomed to fast changes, which is a great thing in today's world

- if you're lucky to have a good direct manager, it will be a very good experience, but unfortunately, managers are often changed in some departments

- some managers can teach you many things about the industry, and share a wider business perspective if you're interested in it

- visits from other offices/countries, from several roles, are great, you get to know how the business works and understand it better - in some offices, you can change roles after a while (especially horizontally)

- if you keep an open mind and are inquisitive, you can learn a lot about how the biggest OTA in the world works on many levels, and the tourism industry is very interesting","A lot of great people left the company in the last years. In my opinion, one of the main issues is the institutionalized hypocrisy. No company is perfect, but constantly claiming to have great values, yet distorting them in countless ways is among the most annoying things here.

- most departments work autonomously and sometimes without considering the needs of other departments, or even overall business needs (each one fights for their own targets)

- procedures change too often, are improperly communicated, and do more harm than good in some cases

- there is a constant lack of transparency for essential issues in some cases and a strong resistance to change when it comes to local improvement proposals (at least in Eastern Europe)

- the performance evaluation is completely subjective: they rate how you stick to the company values (hardly objectively measurable) and base the overall performance score only on that. There were always cases when people good at their actual job got minimum scores based solely on this, or people not doing their job got maximum scores thanks to this. The score can be whatever your manager decides it is, it affects bonusing, career opportunities etc, so it's a backdoor to all kind of discrimination

- very little support in terms of employment documents for smaller offices, HR processes are centralized or outsourced, so things move slowly either for lack of local knowledge or difficult communication

- HR is biased when it comes to mediating hierarchical conflicts. In many instances, they supported the managers at all costs, while claiming to be objective

- middle management is quite toxic, and several useless layers have piled up, making it frustrating for those doing the actual jobs, slowing down communication, etc.

- there's a lot of (hidden) favouritism (based on nationality, friendships, etc.): promotions are almost always based on how nice you are to the managers or who knows who (I have seen this on all roles), and sometimes young and/or unsuitable people get people management roles

- salary and benefits are in the middle towards the low range in many countries"

Many complaining people where you can only follow the guidelines given and cannot do much on your own initiative. They say they care about you and about the customer, but all they care about is how many contacts you do and how much money you save them. Customer service satisfaction results and quilaity results are the less important at the end of the day and they only prize the contacts per hour and productivity ones. You don't need much of a brain here, you just need to be a robot and a slave. Otherwise you can forget about changing your position or succeeding. You have scheduled breaks and lunch times and if you are a minute over, you might get in trouble depending on your TL (most of them are brainwashed/booking blue and complain even for 10 seconds over). You also have 10 minutes personal time but you will periodically receive company emails saying that you cannot use those as an additional break, cannot use them to go to smoke, cannot use them.... so it does not feel like a personal time at all. I guess that if you like that kind of work and beeing constantly monitored, not having any resposabilities and work to take home, it is good for you.

Bonus & equity make the reward very good. 
- Great secondary benefits (training budget, awesome lunch, drinks & parties, smart and nice colleagues, great office locations, solid HW). Most of these benefits are currently on hold due to the Covid situation though.","- There was a very strong entrepreneurial and open culture ""where everything was possible"" that is disappearing due to the successful company growth. Different kind of people are now being recruited and multiple (mainly Dutch) VP's have left in a relatively short time frame. The company is hence becoming more and more a corporate with more senior mgt & more processes and rules in place. 
- Booking Holdings VPs are taking over and this leads to more (short term) shareholder focus. 
- Some colleagues are pretty spoiled. Work/life balance is balancing to the wrong side as ""minimal effort is often good enough"" and amount of hours worked per day is minimal (especially within dev / data science roles).
- There is a very diverse & inclusive culture that is very nice as it reflects our values (eg gay pride initiatives + US is for everyone campaign) but at other occasions the inclusiveness is going too far. Eg removing a picture of a piece of meat from the canteen wall as someone took offense. Everyone's opinion is deemed as important as the majority. Booking.com is very risk averse with this and seems to adhere to vocally strong & entitled minorities. 
- Covid is making a big impact on the business. This has currently a lot of impact on the current working atmosphere & motivation of colleagues. I expect that this will improve after the 2020 reorg and when a vaccine will motivate people to travel again. Lots of the secondary benefits are hence now on hold due to Covid."

1652,Booking.com,The most modest review you'll read. I suggest it.,2020-10-26,4.0,Customer Service Guest Specialist,"- The ""company culture"" does not nearly seem as fake as Apple, or Disney, or even Universal tend to over-sell on. There is a lot of diversity, and everybody sticks to their own group of people, but are so inclusive and welcoming towards each other in any opportunity. The managers, team leads, and even human resources truly feel like allies at your job there. Free avocados, okay. And starbucks. Yeah. They also have a lot of training opportunities, like really fun ones not boring. This is a job where, yes you are at a call center and it is customer service, however you really can grow and take your job seriously-- because it can provide you with so many positive impacts on your own personal life that you may not take advantage of if this is ""just a job, and a paycheck, not tryna live here."" That's cool, you don't have to. But, it is a great job when you realize how unique and impactful it is. The company, even from the CEO's heights, really look out for you and care for you. They handled some heavy decisions during COVID very professionally, compassionately, and conductively. It was handled with so many resources and so much notice given to help facilitate changes a lot easier. The environment is very lax, and micro-managing does not survive nor thrive there. Although their benefits aren't all that great-- they offer amazing travel, and other third-party related benefits, that truly make it feel special working for Booking.com. The pay is also very good and the schedule is great. The attendance, although there is no strict, or formal, process (sorta), there are expectations and observations of patterns. So if it becomes a pattern, it becomes an attendance problem. Be honest, and transparent, this company is a safe space for so.","- This is hard, because I feel like the only cons I experience are just from one specific area in the company's operations. And it mainly has to do with the workflow-- the duty, our job, our tasks, what we have to do. Basically, our job feels rather pointless when we're not just making modifications, or sending cancellation requests, even some relocations here. However, a majority of the calls are from guests who don't understand how Booking.com works. And there is not enough guidelines or accessible information to help you feel confident on all of your calls. You have to really be tough and cold sometimes, because policy is policy and it is strict. Especially now, during COVID-19. Please keep in mind that I have only started working shortly before COVID, so my experiences are much smaller in perspective however I like to believe that I am speaking from a truthful observation. It is hard to be trained for this job. My only advice is to learn and keep up with the guidelines. Simple as that. Follow them step by step. Listen for the keyword in your guest's conversation and know which guideline can help you with that. You tend to get a lot of complaints, from all different types of guests, because we don't have much power to do anything. The hotels are also not adequately trained to handle inquiries so a lot of the time, its the hotels going back and forth with the guests when really they do have a lot more power than they think they do. They are usually quite stubborn, some can even be rude. That's hard to deal with some times. The job is constantly educating the guests on how the system works-- but after you've first calmed them down and got them to understand that you're not at fault here-- and also negotiating with untrained hotel employees that feel like they dont need to take Booking.com reservations seriously. And then they find us annoying when guests are now asking for refunds to the property when they were the ones who neglected to go about the reservation (And their own policies, which they dont even know more than half the time), in the way that it was booked. These are just some annoying things to deal with."

We used to be rentalcars.com and the culture was great. We would have a lot of say in the systems we would engineer and the tech choices that underpin them.

Now we've merged with booking.com and management has decided to go to the cloud, without consulting the engineers who have to build the systems or do the work. The decision-making for everything from team structure to technical directions seems very rushed and badly thought out.

- Open atmosphere.
- Very good colleagues from very diverse backgrounds.
- Nice offices and events (at least pre-covid)
- Good compensation.
- Good resources.
- At least in the past and maybe in the future, this was a place where you could come up with an idea, build a business case for it, convince people to invest there time in it with your data, and then make it happen. Recent changes threaten this, but I hope the culture is strong.","- Recent changes to make the company top-down really threaten a culture where people felt they could make meaningful contributions. This can also mean that not all decisions are data driven any more. 
- The company has made changes which make it more difficult to switch teams and roles (specifically blocking these changes for a year at a time). 
- The promotion path is slower than it should be (recent changes seem to be designed to slow it down) and I have seen good people turned down for promotion for questionable reasons. 
- The company leadership underfunded the bonus pool for 2019 providing very little incentive to push extra hard.
- There is a big clash between the CEO pushing a top-down culture with an American work-life balance culture and a primarily bottom-up Dutch company. 
- The quality of your work experience can vary drastically from team to team (some teams have recurring burnout problems and/or terrible managers, others have great work-life balance and/or really fantastic managers), yet the company does not have good resources in place to help fix these teams or at least get the employees into a healthier environment."

Unfortunately it has deteriorated into a politicians' playground, which most of the competent workers and managers preferred to leave, some at a financial loss.

New CEO replaced Dutch top managers with his American buddies, turning the company into a typical US-style corporation. If that wasn't bad enough, the expectation of impending layoffs, cancelled promotions, and the virtual impossibility to change teams finished off workers' morale. It's no surprise that Booking keeps hemorrhaging talent at an accelerating pace.

If you think of joining Booking right now, think twice. You'll end up working with crazy management and systems that are falling apart with no one in sight to help."

Booking.com provides a good  work environment with free fruits, coffee tea, food in some offices. There's a Generous Profit Sharing Bonus at the end of the year in France.

By leaving this company, I'm leaving a family!","Employees are treated very well and clients are kings of course... For suppliers, it's another story. In my opinion, this company doesn't honour partnerships and support suppliers as it should. A lot of pressure and responsibility is put on accommodation partners who are hard workers, trapped in an aggressive commercial system and facing very exigent clients. 

Not so easy to grow in this company due to a very large number of employees. It's a hard and LONG process to get access to another role and many times you'll get back to your initial role after a few months because new positions are often opened temporarily."

We are doing progresses but unless you are on a good project with newer tech, dev experience can be a pain and growing from a technical point of view can be limited.

These values (typically) promote a healthy work environment with team members who are kind, and deeply concerned about the well being of their coworkers. That said, there are some bad eggs -- but they usually don't last long and are rarely promoted at Booking.","Booking offers such a diverse working environment as teams are usually comprised of employees from 4+ continents. Many new hires are recruited directly from their home countries, making Booking their first international experience. This creates some growing pains for onboarding new employees to life and cultural norms outside their home countries, and some setbacks and burden for longterm employees to withhold (and often enforce) Booking's cultural values of inclusivity and equality."

They pay well as per Dutch standards.","There is a long list of cons, most of them are because of incompetent leadership and middle management. At some point in the past, they removed all the team leads and came up with this autonomous team concept, after a year or so they realized that it was a bad move, then they started looking for team leads desperately, so anyone who said that they want to be a team lead became a team lead, they got two days training and done. Here are some of the stories that my colleagues and I experienced first hand:
- Feedback process is a joke at this company. An example: one of the managers of software development was giving random annual Performance scores to the developers because she thought that not all developers can perform good, some have to perform badly as well. So no matter how hard you worked through out the year, if your luck is bad then you will get a bad score. For getting promoted, you need to exceed expectations for one year. Oh and not to mention that manager is now a director.
- Retaliation is very common in this company. And if you go to HR then be ready for some more retaliation. HR doesn't do anything, except looking pretty.
- 25-30% of the employees are on burn out or stress leave.
- promotions are random, they are based on feedback. Your colleagues can write anything about you without any examples and management just believes it, without cross checking. It is to screw anyone's career here, just write some lies in the feedback, no one is going to check if there is any truth in them.
- Ass kissing all over the place. If you are good at ass kissing then this is the perfect place for you.
- the way they conducted the whole layoff procedure is ridiculous, they just did the bare minimum and left the employees jobless. Booking family is a lie."

You have to be vocal to get what you deserve especially if you don't have a good relationship with the managers, directors, etc (basically the favoritism is involved in promotion processes). It's also similar for internal hiring processes, there is no consistency between what's in practice and what's written in guidelines. For example, if you want to be TL, the guideline says you have to go through the internal hiring process but a few months later you can see that some people become acting TL without the internal hiring process or you can see people are promoting during the hiring/promotion freeze period due to COVID. And there is always an excuse from HR for these exceptional situations. In general, analysts are really undervalued in terms of the career path but also compensation wise. There is a huge salary gap between data analysts and data scientists. I don't recommend Booking for an analyst especially if you want to grow in this role. Besides the role-specific Cons, the transparency in the company getting worse and worse. Most of the communication is done by the sake of saying "" we're an open, transparent company"" which is totally opposite, there is no concrete explanation on time with most of the important changes. Important decisions, that impact employees directly, take too long (months) for LT to communicate clearly, such as COVID related layoffs."

Also, for 2019 and 2020 there will no be any salary increase. The management has said that it's the Work Council's fault but it's not the truth. They always try to blame the Work Council only because it exists but this means that they are aware of all the illegal things that they do. I'm completely attonished!!!

1935,Booking.com,Don't work at Booking.com if you want true fairness,2020-08-14,2.0,Customer Support,"Colleagues were mostly nice, salary is decent in some locations","If you want fair treatment, don't work in this company, unless you are applying for a higher position. As the lowest chain representative, I can honestly say that not only most of TLs and HR people are shady, they will not provide you with any relevant information as to why you were not paid the same amount as other people working for an even shorter month. 

When you're leaving, they promise to pay all the quarter benefits that you've earned and then disappear as you no longer work there 🙂 I personally left 2 days earlier before the month finished and that's why they've decided not to pay me. In general, they will find every reason to not pay you as long as this multi-billion dollar company saves. 

Other than that, obviously, you will not be treated with respect. Not only will you not be informed properly about what's going on with finances, but they will also keep thanking you for your support while pretending that they did good management work where in reality, you will be forced to work hard while they chill and keep repeating their nice words.

I was proud once to be working in this company until I saw the reality. The saddest part is that most employees are afraid to speak up as the job is indeed quite well paid in some offices, and they don't want to anger the management who is trying to keep this 'diverse and happy' image.

Promises made during the interview process are broken within the first month of employment. If you're lucky enough to be working on a language line, such as Russian or German, you can enjoy and relax as these lines have a low volume of calls, whereas if you are on the English, Spanish or Italian lines, you will have to sit on calls 24/7 and get the same salary for a much more stressful work.

Again, they promise you that all the workflow is equal but in reality, that's not the case.

And last but not least, motivational bonuses. Like most companies, they check your performance and reward you with bonuses, sounds nice right? Well, I was one of the top performers for a while, working double if not triple the amount of a regular employee I'm the same position. All I got is 'good job' and a 30 EUR bonus."

Benefits (apart from pay) are also good and the company is putting a lot of effort into improving managers' skillset. 

Also, talking about corona, I believe the work and transparency of the leadership team (Especially the Transport one) deserves credit and I feel the company is dealing with the people side of things fairly well.

Great work/life balance: not pushed into overtime - a lot of support during problems","Work generally lacks structure and poor practices are embedded in most departments as a result of the impressive growth the company has gone through (wasting resources is not a big deal when the company brings in so much profit). 
However, this is starting to change and I believe corona will force Booking to improve quickly.

On managers, this is a hit or miss. There's plenty of good managers that will enable you to make the most of your time here, but bad ones are still in their positions despite extensive evidence (high turnaround - poor KPIs - HR grievances - poor performance reviews) 

On compensation Booking.com continues to underpay at most levels compared to industry average, losing a lot of great talent as a result. I expect this will just get worse following the financial hit from corona."

The job itself involves taking complaint calls for 10 hours a day. There was literally a ""wellness room"" where lots of people would use to have nervous breakdowns and cry in private. That should have been the first red flag. The training person was miserable, disrespectful and rude and made the month of training hell for people. The office was freezing all year round so you had to wear your winter coat in the summertime. Every second is monitored, your pee breaks, your ""mental health"" breaks and the time you're taking to write up your call logs and you get shamed to be fastwr, sacrificing the quality of your work which you were later shamed for. Constantly being watched and evaluated, sometimes they would listen in on your calls (without you being aware) to check up on you.

1985,Booking.com,Nothing but a skin-deep facade of nice words,2020-07-17,1.0,Customer Service,"Canteen was good and subsidized.

Paid Training.

Daily meetings to check the team status as well as longer ones, happening weekly. I personally disliked those but I can see the usefulness in them.

Various subsidized mental health services.","Training, though paid, is 90% useless and isn't really all that applicable.

The company puts emphasis on how easy it is to move up/around in the company. This is absolutely not true.

Everything is micro-managed to hell. One example is that you're asked to put yourself on ""unavailable"" if you need to go to the bathroom or going for a coffee. Your ""unavailable"" status should not exceed 15 minutes per day. Our team was next to the bathrooms and kitchen so that was initially not an issue but when we got moved to the opposite side of the room, we got into trouble for going over those 15 minutes. We pointed out that it took an extra 2 minutes to even walk back and forth, that was promptly ignored and not seen as relevant.

The manager I had was simply awful but I recognize some other managers were good people.

The people whose job was to provide extra assistance (not managers) were often extremely unhelpful and downright condescending.

People who're supposed to manage various aspect of customer service employees and their jobs have never worked in customer service and have no understanding or care about customer service employees' needs.

Rentalcars/BookingGo brag about being progressive and pro-active but it was very clear that this was simply for show. All their progressive policies were barely skin-deep. A great example is how they tout lgbtq+ positivity and openess but when a memeber on the lgbtq+ had his poster, that encoureged people to wear pink in support of the lgbtq+ movement, repeatedly vandalized and complained about it openly, that person got into trouble.

In the Pros section, I mentioned regular meetings and how I personally didn't like them. Those meetings were usually nothing but a waste of time, especially the weekly ones that tended to take the form of those bonding exercises you did in school.

Again, in the pro section, I mentioned subsidized mental health services. That is perfectly true andI got the service I needed. Unfortunently, I needed that service due to the mental damage working at RentalCars/BookingGo did to me.

In conclusion, my time at RentalCars/BookingGo, about 6 months, was simply awful."

It can be challenging to get promoted, it took me several attempts. Try not to get discouraged. Seek feedback take it to heart, it will help you in the long run.

Senior Management are definitely detached from the day to day goings on of the business. I've heard reports of shouting and belittling in OKR meetings. 

Top down hierarchy - Decisions are made in meetings where nobody with any knowledge or expertise is present. As an Engineer, you're expected to be a good monkey and do what you're told.

Work for the sake of work itself - People seem to dream up new needs within the business in order to justify their role and then force it upon the rest of the business. 

SOx Compliance - This is possibly the worst of them all. They expect you to follow processes which are ever changing, and then when you make a mistake because you've been implenting the ""old"" process, you're threatened with disciplinary action.

Towing the company line - If you're not a poster girl/boy and do what you're told, you won't get anywhere. Free thinking and constructive feedback is prohibited, as is public discussion."

Some teams are really nice but most of the teams work on super boring and uninteresting stuff with horribly low quality code, some teams are super toxic and this is allowed by bad, inexperienced and unethical management.

Everything related to ethics and code of conduct is only here for marketing. We have to spend hours watching mandatory compliance training. But I was victim of harassment, defamation and then retaliation when reported (the author was friend with our manager), and HR and compliance sided with manager, removing conversations from our communication tool that I pointed as proof of defamation, took 3 months to finish their ""investigation"" and at the end did nothing. The bully and the manager got promoted less than a year following my report.

Performance evaluation, be it good score or bad score, promotions and sanctions are mostly about politics. It is a place where it is not safe to speak your mind as you are risking retaliation.

Your compensation depend on your performance score. The process is really bad with no clear expectations, it is all vague and subjective and at the end of the day it is just a forced ranking in disguise, where 70%++ of people will get an average score and cannot be promoted for at least 1 year and without any concrete reasons given, that is just the default score."

No one cares about you: once I had a panick attack during my working hours and my team leader blamed me because I went to the toilet because of that. Promotion is just a lie, it's all about politics and if you don't know the right person in the right department, you don't have a single chance. Growing in the company and branching out in other departments is impossible for the afore mentioned reason. Your cv and your skills don't really count. Some colleagues were fired because they were outspoken about the problems in the office (50% of employees is in burnout, team leaders are way too controlling and lack of respect for their team members). It's all about the numbers, if you don't reach your monthly target they kick you out. Management is ridicoulous as they just fire people who try to communicate about the problems in the workplace. Many people point the free food as a pro, but only in one of the Amsterdam offices there have been countless food poisonings. Should I go on?

2117,Booking.com,THE WORST COMPANY TO WORK FOR,2020-03-12,1.0,Account Manager,Some people in different offices are nice,"The company has lots of guidelines how it protects its employees from unfair treatment and retaliation, how they can report any abusive behaviors, how important they are for the company, but it is all FAKE. Management does not care about the lower-level employees. Favoritism and unprofessionalism are very common in the company. I worked in the company for almost 3 years and I was fired immediately without any notification or clear explanation. My rights were totally violated. I even had to call the police in the office due to inhuman treatment and ignoring my basic rights from the management. But violating human rights is not a problem for Booking.com. They can ignore any national or international law in those countries where the company operates, like it is still happening in case of Georgia. The company conducts illegal business activities in the conflicted territory of Abkhazia which is occupied by Russia against the bunch of the national or international laws, pleasing Russia. Protesting this became the primary reason of termination of employment with me. I was a subject of serious oppression, psychological pressure and retaliation for months from the management with the support of HR. Actually, HR and ethics and compliance are just tools for management to justify their decisions. You can never ever approach them. They never keep things confidential even when asked to and they will anyway disclose it. I approached Top Management and asked them to investigate the case, as they cannot be aware about every violation in every office. However, they ignored my request which makes me think that they support this unhealthy environment in the company."

2137,Booking.com,brainwashing,2020-02-29,1.0,Customer Service Representative Guest,"average pay (1000 euros net in Lithuania), free lunch, friendly environment","This review is for the office in Vilnius, Lithuania.

 - Lunch of only 30 min. 2 breaks of 15 min, 10 min personal time. Very strict schedule. You cannot arrive late even if it is 10 seconds. if you need to go to the bathroom outside the break time during multiple times per day, you will surprass the personal time. then this will be discussed with your team leader on 1-1.

- The quarterly evaluation at times is not fair because they compare the KPIs of all the office. There is agents in the russian line that are all day emailing while the rest of us are on calls. 

- you feel like some employees in other positions are with a superiorirty attitude which is not very friendly, especially team leaders

- they hire external team leaders who have no idea how to be team leaders and have no experience  in the job and will never be at the same level as some agents, therefore cannot give support except saying that you are not doing good enought

- not matter how much effort you do, it seems that it is never enough for your employer to be happy

- the job itself: in the beggining you are happy because you are tallking to people on the phone and learning a lot of new stuff. after a year, you are bored and emotional drained because there is almost nothing to learn and you keep saying that same things over and over again on the phone. people on the phone come with the same problems and you keep saying the same, like multiple deja vus. There is a big emotional tireness because you get calls from people who are wrong but think they are right, you need to fake and be nice, cannot say what you think. Repressing true emotions is the worse. I believe this job is for people with no ambitions in life.

- I never applied to another position (because there is nothing interesting), but I had colleagues who were preparing for another one for over a year and got their application refused right from the beggining (and while meeting all the KPIs).

- yearly raises are a joke, you are almost receiving the same money as someone that was just hired

they try to brainwash you and pretend that this is not a call center, you feel like a robot easily replacable and therefore feel no value in what I was doing. this is only a good job as a first job and only for some months."

2139,Booking.com,"Good Company Culture and Benefits, Inflexible Otherwise",2020-02-28,4.0,Account Executive,"Company culture: 
Managers (NORAM, revenue-side) care about their teams and want to change what's within their ability to change to keep team morale high. Feedback was always constructive and and a two-way street. Retaliation was not a worry.

Surveys:
An annual company-wide, third-party survey was followed up by team workshops to address management issues and employee satisfaction; this excludes salaries and yearly bonus gift, which always comes up with poor ratings but were rarely addressed unless all salaries were adjusted across all career bands.

Benefits:
Aetna medical, Delta Dental, and vision insurance were good. Quarterly bonuses can be the equivalent of 1-2 paychecks if an employee exceeds all bonusable targets and Exceeds Expectations in their quarterly review. Also, 401K employee match of 6% is good. Paid volunteer days were provided to help company-approved non-profits.

Other perks:
Team events and lunches were budgeted and scheduled based on employee availability. The half-year themed summer party/event usually means great food and music. Booking Annual Meeting (by raffle only). Fully stocked breakrooms with free healthy produce, snacks, and beverages.

Work-life balance (as hourly, non-traveling FTE):
Managers have always been very specific to not take work home and were open to constructive feedback regarding keeping proper work-life balance. Salaried employee experiences may differ.","Booking Annual Meeting in Amsterdam:
BAM (2 days of workshops, trainings, and a themed party) was almost always guaranteed for sales employees in good standing, but was cancelled for 2018. Employee morale suffered. Then, BAM was turned into a disappointing 1-day kick-off 2019 event, no trainings, no workshops. Later in 2019, the Amsterdam BAM was reinstated for 2020.  Attendance was raffled and uneven across offices.

Trainings:
Multiple quarterly trainings in different NORAM offices, one DNA training in Amsterdam, and regional reunions were cut for non-management and restricted to online trainings.

Other benefits:
Travel reimbursement was offered on personal bookings up to EUR 1000, but only 25% of a booking was reimbursed at a time. Yet, salaries were till low-to-middling compared to other online travel companies.

Low career mobility (from NORAM offices): 
You don't want to be an account manager, senior account manager, key account manager, etc? Too bad because that was the dominant Partner Services career track in NORAM. 

Telecommuting:
Applying for a job in a different department/country felt hopeless. EMEA postings require applicants to already have a work visa prior to applying, and visa sponsorship was rare. Yet, EMEA had the biggest job variety. The company was inflexible on telecommuting from any one of the 198 offices. 

Job duties can be 100% changed at any time, but pay may not be increased:
Account Executives were operational and took care of partner inbound via phone, email, and tickets. Account Executives also helped meet sales targets at times depending on the office. In 2019, the AE role was ""commercialized"" meaning we now managed our own accounts, provided partners with strategy/advice, and ran partner meetings without account manager pay because AE travel was forbidden. New AEs were hired at a higher pay rate compared to AEs who worked years at Booking.com.

Targets:
Sales goals changed to include itemized tracking of all calls and emails like a call center. Calls and emails were not bonusable targets, but could've negatively affected quarterly reviews (which affects bonuses), even if all other sales targets were met or exceeded. Bonusable product target tracking was faulty at times, then targets were thrown out of bonuses mid-quarter, only to be re-introduced the last week of the quarter."
2140,Booking.com,Quickly turning into the stereotype of a call center.,2020-02-26,2.0,Customer Service Specialist,"Insurance benefits

25% compensation for accommodation stays (€100 + 25% on the first booking of the year). It doesn't apply to flights or car rentals though. 

Getting to talk to people all over the world is really cool. If you work a later shift you'll communicate with more guests and partners in Asia, Australia, and the Middle East.

Yearly raffle to go to Amsterdam where the company's HQ is located.

A set schedule allows you to make plans well in advance, and overtime has never been forced.","Open office layout - I'm not sure how this could ever work for a call center. The customer you are speaking with hears not only your voice, but the voice of everyone around you. 

Changes - Employees joke that Booking.com is Booking.changes because everything changes so often. It's very true. Obviously the company needs to change at the same speed the travel industry is changing, but this should be taken into account when training and evaluating employees. I have personally spoken with a large number of new-hires that were trained in procedures and policies that were outdated or just wrong. 

Changes Pt 2. In the 3 years and 9 months I worked at Booking.com the way customer satisfaction was calculated changed 3 times, as did contacts per hour/interval. The bonus structure was changed so that employees were awarded less in the short run, but after 4 quarters you would be benefiting. Unfortunately it was changed after 3 quarters in a way that no longer benefited employees in the long run.

Bugs - I could say ""everything at Booking.com is broken"" and you'd think I'm exaggerating. I'm not. The ticketing system used by customer service was built in-house. When originally created it worked pretty great. However, as new products and features were added the reliability of the system quickly fell. Of course, you will be expected to maintain ""good scores"" regardless. A great example is how they track performance. Entire months of data have been thrown out because something bugged. You'll quickly find yourself running out of breathe trying to reason with your manager that a quarter with 3 months months of data shouldn't be compared to one with 2. 

Criticism - The company stresses the importance of taking feedback in a professional manner. However, they don't like it when you provide feedback or critique internal processes, procedures, or products. I once disputed a quality score I was given for a ticket where I was clearly correct according to procedures. I was given quite a bit of pushback, and in the end had to deal with the score I was given to begin with. 

Quantity - Booking.com has moved away from a customer centered focus in the last 3 years. How many tickets you start is far more important than how many tickets you resolve. Work avoidance by colleagues trying to save their ""numbers"" runs rampant. 

Employee Wellness Facade - The actual problems employees have are never addressed. The company will do a lot to push employee wellness and will provide resources, but won't actually change anything. 

Pay - Glenn Fogel, the CEO of Booking Holdings made $20,459,184 in compensation in 2018 while the average customer service agent was paid $15/hr. Mark D. Okerstrom, the CEO of Expedia pulled in $13,089,562 of compensation, yet his customer service agents were paid $16/hr on average. Also, as of late February, new hires are being paid more than employees that have been with the company for years. The cost of living will increase far faster than any pay increases. 

Advancement - There is very little room for movement within the customer service department. 

Unethical - There seems to be no quality control for new products and questionable changes have been made. While I was employed the company partnered with another company based in India called OYO. The procedures of OYO were vastly different than ours and resulted in quite a bit of conflict. It seems that a multi-million dollar contract was signed without ever discussing the logistics of Booking.com and OYO working together. 

Overall, the company has fallen quite a ways in the last 3 years. Unless you are a robot, I do not recommend working here. They simply do not value you or appreciate the work you put in being the voice of the company when support is needed."

You are literally not part of the any process or decision making, what’s expected is your manager says “jump” and you reply “how high” 

Company culture changed significantly over the past few years, turnover on all levels is insane.  From a place of “challenge one another” to reach better ideas, goals, etc it became a place “you do as told you” which would have been ok if managers knew what they were doing but mostly why are doing it! 

Its a global company but there’s zero to none chance to move beyond the office (at best cluster of countries you are part of) due to the so called “succession planning” which is not bad generally but here is a synonym of “favoritism” . 

There’s minimum alignment across the business units which often results in situations where one team is building a bridge and another a tunnel to get to the same place. Excuse my metaphor! 

Although there are established norms of what good behavior means, managers still interpret it they like. Too many of them judge your character vs your results and deliverables. 

Most managers care about you bringing the numbers in, no matter what it costs. 

Travel time is insane because driving/flying to your market doesn’t count as work time. So you end up spending weekends traveling back home for example. 

It’s all about speed and volume vs rigor and quality."

Data  is still always part of the conversation, but it isn’t used intelligently - at least not very often. 

There is a strict hierarchy with those in HQ above all the rest in power and authority - although usually not in intelligence. If you work with HQ, you will have to spend a lot of time sucking up to your peers and superiors in Amsterdam. While the company preaches diversity, this exists mostly at the lower levels.

Sarcasm, badmouthing, jealousy. These are only three of the bugs that spread around the office(s). And it is such a shame by the way. Yeah, feel free to go to work with your high heels, colorful skirts, pink hair, tattoos and piercings, but the truth is that the only way to feel free is to not care about the others, just like any other place in the world.

Nothing but another corporate growing too fast. Too big to be small and too small to be big. Quantity over qual...people. Colleagues more keen on challenging you just because you’re not giving them what they want, rather than having any sort of work ethic.

The main issue of the company right now is the total incapability to the feedback on board, forward it to the right people (well of course, due to the huge lack of communication) and actually do something with it! You think someone is going to sit in a room and discuss the so much wanted and requested feedback, but the truth is that they already have it all planned and you can't do anything about it. And you'll get laughed in your face about it by those who are in charge of weighting your performance. I wonder who's weighting them...

Everything comes from Global. Nice way to avoid taking ownership of actions, classy. 
Agents will have about 4-5 main changes per year in their role, with no chance to speak up (again no space for feedback). Seniors are...what do they do again? I'm pretty sure at this point they don't even know where they stand. Team leaders? A bunch of high school kids. Not all is bad out there, but most them are. CSMs. Well, they are Team leaders with more power so basically anything can happen.

WORKPLACE. Let's talk about it. You have people posting pictures with their partners, creating groups absolutely NOT WORK RELATED like some kind of fashion show and you just don't do anything about it and you just let them use the company hashtag #b.""anything-that-pops-in-my-mind"" in the wrong way. Even who doesn't care about Workplace is annoyed.

No matter how many reports, complaints, emails, chats and comments will be forwarded against someone, they'll generally end up leaving simply because a better opportunity came up for them. Instead of admitting that they're just incompetent, patronising and poisoning for whoever work around them. Well, at least they leave. Sometimes.

If you have an idea, a good one, make sure you register your patent before bringing it to someone because they will know how to take it, put their name on it and get all the credit while they're listening to you talking. And then leave, cause they will become your team leaders.

If the CEO intend to even remotely consider this review as constructive,  please rethink the company you’ve now taken FULL ownership for and listen to what you hear, cause your employees are complaining, crying, speaking up and your management is just choosing not to listen to them. Quoting your words about BAM 2019 ''It didn't work''. You have the chance to make it work now.
Booking.com is nothing but a good student that has potential and just doesn't care enough about it. With our previous CEO we’ve lost the human touch that was what made Booking.com different. Oh, and by the way, telling your employees worldwide that <>, it’s really not. Whether this is true or not, you gotta have the ability to give a bad news keeping your staff motivated and starting 2020 with the message that all our hard work was ‘’ok’’ was like a thousand knives in our hearts.

The biggest mistake it's been starting a company open minded and ready to welcome everything and everyone (yeah, maybe you should've set some standards in the past about this) in this magical loose world where there was barely a rule and now is all about restrictions, scripts and customer satisfaction. 

How about your employee experience first for a change?"

2223,Booking.com,"A melting pot of expats, a handy start in a new country. Also, a place of incompetence + burnouts.",2020-01-15,1.0,Commercieel Medewerker Outbound,"I gained some truly nice friendships over the past years.

I got a permanent contract which enabled me to by real estate in the Netherlands.","I had been performing monotone, meaningless and very often totally nonsense tasks in the so called commercial outbound department in Amsterdam. 
Believe me when I say, performing these tasks were the best part of the job. All the rest comes in a list below.
Feeling useless:
If this department would close from one day to the other, then nothing, absolutely nothing would go wrong and the business would not miss it. The overlapping departments would then take over what makes sense to perform.
0 trust culture:
My working day was hardly about work. It was about how to ""show and prove"" that I am working well. Doing a great job was never that obvious to the team leaders, who had trouble managing their good workers, unless the magic numbers were in the workers favor. These numbers have been measured in a quarterly modified performance management dashboard and with a constantly changing logic. They had an influence on our personal bonus and on the mood of the performance evaluation meetings. 
One head does not know what the other head does:
Random targets are being set by a separate department, like ""Big Brother knows everything"" - style. The Big Brother team can be imagined as 3 (or more) brothers, one is in charge of performance, one of tooling and one of commercial tasks, etc. The brothers do not talk to each other and therefore no one gets a full picture of what is happening and why. The overall influence of the Big Brother team on our department has been so successful that the performance logic and dashboard have been changed in every quarter in the past 2.5 years and this constant, forced, troubled change had driven my colleagues nuts. At the end, the department management tend follow all the silly orders blindly without trying, questioning, feedback and real initiatives. 
No one in charge:
Our managers are never in charge of any real decision because the “Big Brother team decides it all”, they say. The team with multiple heads arguments that our TLs should manage our expectations better. As a result, pointing fingers, doing nothing well and not being responsible for all, that is the game.
Development:
We had a meeting with HR as part of a development-week more than a year ago. HR told us that the chances that we get internally hired into an advanced role is close to 0. But we can switch sideways into a similar, slightly less useless job. Also, advancing in our amazing department into a good-for-nothing TL role and become part of the neurotic TL team had been definitely out of question. My colleagues who made the sideways move are unhappy or overworked or on a burnout. 
The empty office:
Colleagues on long-term sick leave, plenty of burnouts, no contracts extended, colleagues quit cause fed up, quit cause got depressed by work, quit for better opportunities (any opportunity), quit cause the boss does not allow part time in a department in which the majority of the coworkers work part time and the job is definitely not that responsible and brainy one that could not be filled in part time. 
Forced everything:
The worst were the forced interactions. There was a childish department employee behavior framework to comply with, a bunch of useless meetings to attend, useless knowledge exchange huddles in which we were forced to act active and motivated, stand up meetings which every executive would love to avoid because there is a difference between knowing in our heads that our department is a failure, and experiencing this failure in a face to face forced stand up meeting with everybody incl. management. 
Watching our tired, demotivated, hardly competent team leads standing in front of us and playing the role of the small boss and acting like they would be a real management team for 10 minutes, but after the meeting they delegate basically all their responsibilities or just simply fail to perform them. Watching the big boss, who commutes in the office like a silent ghost and has 0 people skills, standing in front of us in silence cause he delegated all the talking to the TLs already. He speaks only when he “has to” underline the importance of our targets and the department bonus (his bonus, his reputation).
Degrees, true knowledge and valuable experience:
Forget it and watch how external people with less of everything apply and get jobs which you would want go for but are not able because you are from internal, where the caste-like system rules apply."

- Monthly parties and quarterly team outings 
- Nice office, located in a nice area of London 
- Decent salary, with quarterly  bonuses depending on your performance (however, your bonus will depend on your TL, so it's not about the numbers, but his/her very personal opinion of you) 
- Many benefits (from  health insurance to glasses allowance, canteen with ok food) 
- Free coffee, fresh fruits and drinks.
- Opportunity to learn a lot about the travel industry (on your own, but the knowledge is there for the taking)
- Globally speaking, the company is great 
- Some good TLs (the exception to the rule)","Booking.com is a company that has everything it needs to be a GREAT place to work, but sadly is anything but,  at least at the London office (and particularly if you're a customer service agent)

The problem stems from management. When I joined the company, I was lucky to have an extremely professional TL (there are very few left in London). This person was organised, hardworking, very supportive of her agents and kept everything professional. The rest of the TLs on that area behaved in a similar way, so I  spent 6 months in relative peace, learning everything I could about the job.  My TL motivated me and my colleagues to go the extra mile and supported our development within the company. 

However, my TL was re-assigned to another department, I changed my shift-pattern and that's when things started to go downhill. I realized many TLs were barely qualified to lead. No empathy, no real knowledge of the procedures, not helpful when dealing with HR matters, and many passive-aggressive ways of communicating news or changes. They are basically glorified nannies, who think less of their agents just for being agents. 

Also, some had an unspoken agreement to cover each other's backs. While agents worked non-stop answering calls (afraid of not hitting the targets, constantly being yelled at by angry customers) many TLs would do the bare minimum. 

A lot of them befriended or dated their agents outside of the office (something strictly prohibited, since the TLs have way too much power over agent's performance evaluations, bonuses and career progression). There have been several sexual scandals, many linked to favouritism or simply things that should be reported to the authorities.  

Some shift patterns will affect your physical and mental health (weekends or 10-hour shifts for example). 

So, if you want a stable job for a couple of months (just first job in London, for example) I'd recommend Booking. Do you want a career and progression? apply somewhere else. They want you to stay on the phone/chat as long as they can."

Recently dismissed after ""lateness"".
I've been fired by my TM after some instances of lateness has been found on my schedule. 7 ""new lateness"".
Lateness like  1h and 45 mins and other minor lateness. WOW, I must suffer of some kind of amnesia (me and all my colleagues) for being late 1.45h and not realizing it. Or simply it never happened?

Eleven months ago, before the ""lateness policy"" was introduced I had some lateness, that after the introduction of the new policy lead me to a correct it meeting (which is not totally correct IMHO, because if u change a policy u can't apply it retroactively). After that, I hadn't another lateness instance for more than 7 months.. except on one occasion due to the fact that they'd given me the wrong code for the door so I was stuck outside and arrived 1 minute late. But that was THEIR fault!
Then recently I had some mental health problems, due to some serious personal issues I wasn't able to overcome.
This lead me to have 2 instances of lateness in a short period (but NOT SEVEN as they said!!). I've been able, thanks to emails and calls to prove that 2 of those lateness which had ""appeared"" as by magic on my Teleopti schedule were bogus, but unfortunately, I had no evidence in the form of emails or calls made for the other 3 - although, I repeat, I don't recognize them.

On top of this, I had a lot of issues with my line manager. He acted like a bully, violating my privacy at work (trying to overhear private conversations, even following me around when I asked to have a word in private with another manager etc). When I told him that he had no right to do so, he simply replied ""I'm ur boss i do what i want"" and continued with his bullying and mobbing! Some people (not just agents) knew and did nothing, which is just a disgrace for a company that likes boast about its ""ethical values"". What a joke.
As you can imagine I felt constantly threatened and unable to defend myself.
I wasn't even given monthly 1to1 and a coaching session, like the other agents, this despite me asking for them.  Not one in 4 months! And of course I couldn't talk about my mental health issues to that person...  imagine that... he was already bullying me enough as it was. In short, I was never supported and actually at times felt that he was setting me up for failure.
I kept working showing as always my intention to deliver results. I could go on but this is becoming boring... :) I'll just say this: when I was into a different team (but in the same role) my csat was 4.3. Is it a coincidence that when I was moved to his team my csat plummeted to way less than 3? Don't think so 
Another example just to prove my point: while that person was on holiday for 3 weeks (during peak season, btw!!) my team was top of the division. As soon as he came back things got worse, stats and team morale: that person is the problem, not the agents! 
What I can say for myself is that I  always tried my best and had excellent results to the point that straight after my probation period I got a secondment into another department.. which I asked not to extend.
Now I regret that I turned down that possibility... To think that I would eventually end up with him!

Anyway, when he fired me I appealed to the outcome, as it was unfair IMHO, to be fired for inexistent latenesses or because I used to stand up for myself whenever this person was trying to intimidate me.

It took 2 weeks to have a meeting and a further 5 weeks to have an outcome.
7 weeks of being not paid, I was ok with it as I knew I had email as proof of his mobbing, tons of ppl willing to speak to say what they saw.
I asked the same day I was fired to have access to my emails in order to pull out the ones I needed to defend myself, but I was told that it was not possible and that I would have been provided with access in case I appealed the decision.
This did not happen, they never gave me access!!
Also, I was told that the appeal meeting would have been with ppl who were not present at the meeting where I was fired and/or people related to me at work.
So as you can imagine I was quite confused when I discovered that the appeal meeting was going to be held by the same guy from HR who was present when I was fired and MY SENIOR MANAGER. But the thing goes on: at the meeting, they refused to give me access to my emails, then after 5 weeks of waiting, I was informed that they wouldn't change the outcome for the following reasons:

- They had not found any of the emails I was talking about (of course.. the fact that I was denied access to my own inbox is very convenient and just a coincidence, I guess??)
- My colleagues did not confirm my ""version of the story""

I'm not upset, im not angry because the whole process was a joke, I'M UPSET BECAUSE I KNOW THOSE EMAILS EXIST BUT I HAVE NO CHANCE TO DEFEND MYSELF AS I CANNOT ACCESS THEM! I'M UPSET BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUES SUPPORTED ME AND CALLED ME AFTER THEY WERE  INTERROGATED AND I KNOW WHAT THEY SAID!

Waiting 7 weeks for the outcome lead me to financial problems and depression. Stupidly, I had faith in the company to find those emails and treat me with integrity.
Now I've been forced to leave my house and move back in with my parents. I am also seeing a therapist to cope with all the stress that this situation caused to me!
I will be back on the 9th of Jan and I will take actions, legal if needed, in order to be sure to have access to those emails and being able to speak to my colleagues in front of other persons recording everything.
I won't accept to be fired by a bully who thinks he can play the mafia boss and I won't accept that a company who keeps talking bout mental health then fires an employee who is struggling with it.

PS: I do also want to know why, when I was so fed up with this TM that I asked to be moved to the Barcellona contact center, my senior told me that it was not possible at all, for anyone. If this is true, then why other colleagues were granted this ""privilege""?? One of them was an agent just like me and made the same request I did in the same period. I was trying to escape from that team and the clutches of a bully without making a fuss. but no, I had to stay and eventually be fired with a poor excuse. What a joke of a company.","Friendly environment

2273,Booking.com,Flawed company with some diamonds that are overshadowed by Seriously damaged people,2019-12-15,3.0,Sales,Some honest people work on nights. They do their utmost best and you can tell by just they way you look at them.,"Hello, I am only writing this review as this has been occupying my mind for a long time and I can't believe there people like these still exist. It's about to be 2020 and you don't make jokes especially about race.
I was a phone agent on nights and the confirmations nights team were located on the opposite side to us. But we would use their side to go on our break or go downstairs and also chat with a few of our friends on that side or go for res support. This incident happened when I asked help from one of confirmations agent. They have a few Spanish speakers and my native language is Spanish and I heard one of the Spanish girl  say the racist word about the African guy to her boyfriend or partner I don't know their relationship and they were laughing. They saw me and realised that I was there and then they stopped. I previously heard one of them also make a joke about the same African guy in Spanish about similar things. What's more sad is that their colleagues don't understand them and don't know everytime I was around, I could hear them call other guys in their language. This has been a complain before and obviously it's not been taken seriously so it continues.
I believe in a company as such as bookingGo used to be rentalcars.Com this kind of conversations shouldn't happen. I know some of the colleagues heard them but I am not sure if they went to HR about it but I know this person, thinks her and her partner hides behind the fact that her colleagues can't speak their language and talk about someone like this. They constantly call others names. Again I would like to point out the fact that the name calling has been highlighted already. But name calling and being absolutely ruthless racist are 2 different things.What's more funny is that some of my friends said she is now a senior agent to these people and her boyfriend or partner. (Conflict of Interest). How can a company mention Ethics all the time and allow conflict of interest. 
Apart from this, this company is great and I wish I didn't have to go back home otherwise I would have liked to have worked here for years. I am sorry that this is the platform I chose to express myself and inform all of these but I don't know the email addresses for ethics. I thought you had ethics to protect, a name to protect by keeping a couple racist people you won't get anywhere.This seem to be the common complaint here on glass door about Booking Go.I will also forward my complaint to Bryan Batista and Gillian Tan because I believe racism is a serious subject which is not being taken seriously here."

Perks are good, not silicon valley, but nice offices, travel discounts, food, coffee, mortgage interest discount.

While they are rare, there are a few truly exceptional managers if you're lucky enough to get one.","New CEO is embarrassing, when he speaks in public he makes us look bad.  New high level positions were filled by people who didn't respect our culture and what parts were working.  Suddenly we run like a top down company and they make changes with huge negative impact on employees without going through works council.  When you flag concerns you will be belittled and bullied by a minority of people here, but they have their buddies and work hard to keep others down.

Honestly if I didn't love my colleagues & Amsterdam so much I would quit. Therapist worries I am on the edge of a nervous breakdown 100% due to my job and says it's common for people who work here that she sees.

Middle mgt is political and obsessed with creating their own kingdom in the company. 

The performance and promotion process is nebulous and opaque, and mostly relies on constantly tooting your own horn to senior people. 

Management has no idea what innovation really means, and make it impossible for me teams to really get anything done coz teams are constantly held accountable to 'impact' which is impossible in the time span of a quarter for new and innovative products. 

Leadership just constantly repeats tired industry tropes that competitors came up with ages ago, as if they are totally new and nobody will realise they're just the same old thing.

Systems are ancient and buggy, adoption is too little too late, you are by no means qualified for the outside world once you quit, opportunities are there only for HQ people while local offices try to look global with occasional parties. So called inclusiveness is only with the condition that you do not try to prove you can do more. Then you are no good, better stay at your no future role with a funny amount of income. Mobbing is so real, people are incredibly underqualified and try to convince you that going the extra mile is worth nothing because they feel threatened to be challenged out of their comfort zone. If you still continue to be a high performer, they simply shun on you, that is how inclusive they are. Your manager says jealousy is normal and does nothing for your mental wellbeing. HR is a joke, they simply try to tell you you do not have the legal rights that you should have and the only way to convince them of your legal rights is to bring official confirmation from the authorities, saying they will be penalized if they insist on depriving me of my rights."

Then booking.com is the perfect place for you to work at. The lack of professionalism and transparency from management is embarrassing . The constant harassing of good employees drives many people to quit the job more often than not, while the managers are allowed to get away with everything. They can do whatever they want with your PTO and say you missed days when you didn't. The policies are inconsistent and vague, things change regularly and employees are never informed, and our benefits are either taken away or reduced. Our insurance recently went up, yet a pay increase is apparently impossible. You can be here for 3-4 years and your pay won't even increase by a dollar per hour. For a multi-billion company their most ""important' employees (AKA the agents) don't get paid a living wage and will have to rely on part time jobs and credit cards to get by while managers and executives fill their pockets.No one really ever knows what's going on, people are told to do one thing and then are told to do the exact opposite by management and support staff, the system constantly crashes and there is a multitude of bugs on a regular basis. They want you to believe that we are innovative and advanced, but are just rolling out things that other companies have been doing for years. They promote healthy living, yet the canteen fridges have had black mold and smell terrible, on multiple occasions we get food that's already expired or has mold in it and they could care less about the mental health of their employees.  If you want to advance within the company, don't even bother. Most internal openings already have a name to them and they are opened to others only for legality reasons. HR will do nothing to favor the employees and instead fall into the high school mentality with management, ignoring issues that few are brave enough to report. If you report something anonymously, somehow the person you're reporting will find out and retaliation will ensue even though is prohibited. Favoritism and bootlicking will get you everywhere. Good numbers, good behaviors and work ethic will ensure that you are stuck in the same job for years on end and even risk termination.  
Do yourself and favor and don't bother applying here. This place is not worth it."

This is a place to work while you transition to something better.
It is a dead-end job. I recommend to stay a couple of years and then leave with the skills you've obtained.
Management is basically mini Brazil.
Every team lead manages their team differently. Some VERY strict that give you pressure because they do not know how to lead enforcing their authority and micromanaging  without considering the long term effect on agents. Others more lenient which is greatly appreciated because you are treated as a human and an adult.
Networking is important. It's who you know you will help you get the promotion. They call it ""visibility"".
If you are in the reservations department people will be yelling at you most of the time for something they didn't read. The hotel/partner side is a lot more chill and orientation driven.

I worked for CBG office for more than 5 years, and at the start, there was strong management, quite strict but strong, and their decisions were based on the benefits of business (promotions, career development, team structures), not on the basis who is your favourite in the office. Basically, there was a vivid intention to stick to the company's code of behaviour and meritocracy. Thanks to changes of the site managers, (a person got the position based on CV that was, let say, inaccurate), from bad to worse, once a good place to work, in 5 years changed to a place that was unrecognizable! From the best to the worst HR practice!","Customer service jobs are always difficult, still, as mentioned before, if the company has the right culture, providing enough support, training, downtime, and not pushing unrealistic targets and KPI's year on, it could be a good place to work. Just to sum up the main negatives: Team leaders are 90% local people that forged a strong connection, protecting each other no matter what they have done! Most of them are not highly educated (no degrees), on the other side, most of the employees are foreigners, with a strong international background and high education, they speak several languages, combined with good IT skills and master degree in various subjects. Still, the majority of employees doesn't know UK employment law. The management is fully aware of this fact and constantly takes advantage of young and vulnerable employees. 
The result is that incidents of bullying and sexual harassment were never handled properly. Just one example: during the post company's social event, a team leader sexually harassed an employee, a member of another team. The best practice, in case of young and vulnerable, would be to put the team leader in another office until the investigation is done (to prevent his influence on people's statements), and actually, the company should have advised the victim to go to the police and report the incident. 
None of that was put in place, the victim was silenced, and the team leader still works in the same office. 
 HR is one of the weakest links in this business operation, and they just serve one purpose, to aid team leaders whilst firing employees. In spite of that, all serious official complains, submitted via regular company's channels, were never upheld. Even in the case when the members investigating the case and finding that the complaint was based on solid evidence, no appropriate action was taken to make things better. The sick leave policy is appalling, there were instances that employees with cancer were bullied into leaving the company (there is always disciplinary procedure), hence if you have young children, or occasionally suffer from flu or cold, this is not the place for you."

Think again: good looking, good at networking but yet mediocre at their work colleagues will be promoted over you every single time. Before you'll know, you will be stuck in a role and with a company that is full of empty words about inclusive work environment and growth opportunities. When you're going to be on the brink of burnout, the pressure will start.

- Thus, making 45k a year on an entry level, no-degree-required customer service job was entirely possible.

- PTO + floating holidays amounted to 20 days off per year.

- Generous 401(k).","- Management is a joke. Every week everything changed, with new guidelines that directly contradicted previous ones being implemented without notice or training.

- Some of the managers and team leads should look for psychiatric counseling. Their negative energy is palpable. 

- Everyone desperately wants to get a job elsewhere, but the ok pay and the good benefits are a factor. So a lot of people stay, even hating what they do. 

- Most hotel owners/managers actually despise working with Booking. Some feel scammed by it, others are unable to understand and/or learn how the site and the interface work. It's mostly not their fault, as everything is overly complicated and technically cheap. But their bitter dissatisfaction with Booking eventually contaminates most calls, and the job becomes excruciating."

More disheartening is the pay relativity between different roles; why be a dev when you can earn more facilitating standups for a living.

Corporate cargo cult agile in full swing. Metrics which should be team internal only are being used to judge teams across engineering. Of course this leads to teams doing all kinds of crazy things to manipulate the numbers. Teams will just trash tickets to pretend they have a zero-defect backlog.

Antiquated team & personal objectives system which is heavily linked to bonuses or promotions. This only leads to everyone going for the ""under-promise, over-deliver"" strategy. There's no incentive to set risky/hard to achieve goals if failure means financial hurt; it's much wiser to play safe. This contributes to...

Stuff moves at glacial speed. Whether it's politics, meetings, lack of resource or just not in the objectives/priorities, things take an age to get done. Everything needs a Jira ticket. If you're looking for a fast paced environment this isn't it.

Too many contractors brought in to work on new feature work while existing devs do maintenance and have little to no involvement in what the future looks like. Doesn't matter if you have years of domain experience, contractors will be brought in to rebuild the system you know inside out.

Quarterly objectives setting leads to an extremely short-termed vision and a constant shift in direction. Serious lack of long term thinking.

More and more red tape being introduced to satisfy an overly-restrictive SOX implementation. You will constantly lose access to the things you need to do the day to day job. Welcome to the world of service desk tickets.

Senior management are mostly non-existant apart from the quarterly Q&A appearances. Q&A questions are answered with so much denial they sound like they're from a communist state. Struggled to even accept that having a gate as a meeting room door meant the room was too noisy.

2482,Booking.com,On a downward spiral as the years pass. Terrible place to work.,2019-09-12,1.0,Senior Customer Service Executive,"- Paid lunches. 
- Enough employees to find some nice people to get you through the day.
- Salary was competitive for the field. 
- Booking.com(as a company) is not a bad employer, it's specifically the Cambridge office that is a bad place to work.","The management over the past 5 years have taken this office in a really unfortunate and negative direction. Looking back, it was a great place to be, nearly everyone was happy to come to work. However, due to a steady influx of negative/idiotic changes, it's been turned into a joyless machine that churns through staff on a regular basis. 

My main points of contention are as follows:

- High turnover of staff due to unrealistic expectations. And the ones that are left are thoroughly miserable and looking for other work. Horrible atmosphere in the office due to this.
- The management have no sense of what it's like to be an agent, take no care in the wellbeing of their employees and just push them to edge of their sanity. It's as if they have come to an agreement that they don't want anyone in the company to last more than a couple of years(most likely so they can keep hiring cheaper new people rather than pay loyal, hard working employees a higher salary).
- If you do manage to struggle through and survive the unrealistic targets set by the management, you're not rewarded for your loyalty. Being a long standing employee garners no benefits, the management don't want you there for long.
- Equal opportunities doesn't exist. The only opportunities to be promoted are given to those who can consistently fake a positive attitude. To those who consistently tell the management what they want to hear. The hard working people, who add constructive criticism are punished for speaking out. 
- Very, very harsh handling of sick leave. All employees are under extreme pressure to never take a day off sick. If you are sick, on your return you have to justify that sickness and are asked questions like ""How could you avoid being sick in the future?"". They literally set targets such as ""Don't be sick for the next 6 months"". If you continue to be sick, it's highly likely that you'll be dismissed. 
- Clear favouritism towards Team Leaders, HR and Management. If you are a team leader, you can essentially abuse your position and get away with doing very little for a lot more money. Quite the opposite to that of agents and senior support staff. In my time there I saw many turning up late with no repercussions. Saw team leaders quite literally bullying agents, targeting agents that they didn't like to push them out of the company. HR are supposed to be impartial and there if you feel something is not right or not fair. The problem is that HR protects management and team leaders. They are far too friendly with them to remain impartial and professional. Due to being protected, they can do no wrong, as far as the company is concerned. 
- Planning/scheduling is all that matters anymore. Adhering to the ridiculous schedules is the only thing that management care about. There is no flexibility with your day. You're told when you can take a break and will be punished for being minutes out of adherence. Even if you're forced to be late for a break due to a difficult customer shouting at you on the phone for ages. 

I worked there a long time. I have near unlimited further points to justify why I think the Booking.com Cambridge office is a terrible place to work. But frankly, I've already given too much of my life to this company. Even airing my complaints is tiring. I hope that I've at least made it clear to those reading this that they should not apply for a job here. And to those who are currently working there, hang in there, keep searching, you'll find something much better soon enough.

Avoid this office like the plague."

2495,Booking.com,Unsettled in Manchester,2019-09-10,2.0,Account Manager,"- Access to some really great hotels
-  Good car hire
- Fantastic Regional management","Booking.com is clearly a fantastic company for the end user. There is a huge amount of love from a UX perspective. The company has grown insanely quickly in the last 10 years or so and therein lies a problem. 

There are some wonderful area & regional managers at Booking.com, however the ""Senior Account Managers"" are controlling & devious. They are in their position on the back of time served with the company, rather than any form of people management. My senior account manager was clearly out of her depth with regards to people management, and was extremely temperamental. 

The role at Booking.com is also not communicated effectively at the interview for an Account Manager. Make no mistake about it - this is not an Account Management position, but customer service. You are required to answer hotel enquiries all day, every day. It feels like an old fashioned boiler room - with much emphasis placed on how many calls you make per day. It may work for some people but for me I was not aware of the customer service aspect of this role before I started.

The atmosphere within the Manchester office is also toxic. There are a number of issues with the team, who are regularly kept on their toes with ""one-to-one"" meetings about the most petty of incidents. Managers will ask their staff why it was that they weren't as loud as normal in meetings, you will be questioned as to why you were 5 minutes late back from lunch & you will also be instructed to make that time back up at the end of the day.

At the heart of the Manchester office there is a power struggle. The two Senior Account Managers when I left were desperately clinging to power in any way they saw fit & would lash out at anyone unfortunate to be within shouting distance. 

It is a cloak & dagger office - if you play the game you'll be well suited - if you don't then you'll be out."

After 6 months working at Booking Go, I am improving a lot my battle with depression, because I feel happy to share my time here with colleagues (almost friend a lot of them) and managers' team. When I apply, I was afraid to tell ""I am suffering depression at the moment"".

I will always be grateful for the incredible people I met while at Booking.","This may have changed since I finished my time...but not a lot of opportunities to growth within the admin/people team department because it is quite small.

* The other booking.com staff are excellent and always quick to assist you when you need help (huge shout-out to the seniors! Their jobs are arguably the hardest)
* Browsing the booking.com website itself while assisting guests on the phone has truly instilled in me such a powerful desire to travel to as many different places as possible in the foreseeable future; not just in my own country, but in every other country!","* This is more of a personal con, but sometimes dealing with the overly negative and hysterical guests was difficult and often triggered my anxiety. If you suffer from the same issue, then you may need to find a way to deal with it while under pressure - and sometimes there is a LOT of pressure.
* Sometimes it was difficult to maintain a good set of metrics (I struggled the most with receiving positive customer satisfaction surveys back - but this only is because I had trouble with pushing for the CSATs and encouraging guests to fill them out). If you just get into the habit of pushing the surveys, then you have nothing to worry about!
* This may have been exclusive to the location I worked at, but there wasn't a lot of recognition from management for the agents who worked harder and went above and beyond to deliver that authentic 'wow' experience to the guests. My location's management in particular also really struggled with keeping their favoritism under wraps, and it made some of the agents feel left out and unimportant.
* Agents at my location also did not receive the Pay For Performance when it was rightfully due to them. Again - this was only an issue at my particular call center.

*** Disclaimer: Most of these cons ONLY apply to the location I worked at. The location I worked at was a third-party outsource, and was NOT an actual Booking.com location. I am not educated on the condition and atmosphere the actual Booking.com call centers, but I imagine that they were significantly better. The agents and seniors from the other sites that I got to speak to were wonderful and very easy to work with. The positive ratings found throughout this survey apply only to my experience with the people employed at the official Booking.com call centers."

 As per my manager , If you don't ask your team mate to go out for lunch this means you are arrogant. 
 Its an offence if you ask same question again if you didn't understand. I have wasted 5 min that was the reply I was getting from my team mate and my manager. People are not humble but they are much more arrogant.

- salary increases are good
- booking freebies
- quarterly bonus if on target.
- possibility to have more days off for annual leave or more money.","- pressure to stay on target was unreasonable when a change of circumstances affected employees
- even when on target, constant warning of going on a PIP (personal improvement programme), varied from TL to TL. 
- higher management failed to support when mental health was being effected (not all Team Leaders were bad, but some could make you feel uncomfortable). Mental health really needs to be supported especially when it is caused from stress on the job.
- regardless of how long you've been in the company, there was not a sense of job security. I would advise all employees to join a legal union not matter what company you join but especially for Booking.com. 
- hard to trust some team leaders as some were two faced towards their own colleagues let alone agents. Never go alone in a displinary meeting. 
- once locked into pension after a certain time period, I was personally unable to leave however was told there was a way but clearly it wasn't made clear to me.
- sickness- a TL once said to me to prove I was sick if I was sick and wasn't in work at the time if this was within the time period of the sickness period before having to provide a Dr's note but not all TLs needed to see you looking physically unwell. 3 sickness within a year max before going on a displinary.
- TLs told me conflicting information of the companies sickness and lateness policies based on personal opinion without a proper source of proof online. (If ever in trouble, proof is required). 
- discount - 25% capt to 1000 EUR a year for friends and family, takes 3 months to recieve in paycheck so it's not upfront repayment.
- overtime rate was always given with uncertainty, overtime was only available during peak and not for all languages.
- everything is monitored, so follow you schedule, you can only be around 3 minutes off according to your schedule, 6 minutes is pushing it. This is a global statistic
- if you get the wrong TL, things will not be easy, but having being there for may years I had the best and worst. 

 A TL once said to an agent ""you cannot become a Team leader, you don't have it in you, you're not ready yet"". This agent then applied elsewhere for a more flexible position than the team leaders and is still building herself there within the same company, different office. That team leader still works in the office as it goes to show, your potential is what you make it, don't let people knock you when you're meant for bigger and better things."

- flat company structure with little micromanagement and the ability to prioritise your own workload
- regular paid-for staff events from drinking to rock climbing to archery
- an ability to make new stuff and see the results really quickly
- a support network to help you move to NL including movers, estate agents and free accommodation for up to 1 month when you arrive while you look for your first home to rent
- Amsterdam is a wonderful city and an amazing place to call home
- I love my work
- work/life balance is highly prioritised. If you're constantly working late people wonder why you can't manage your workload better rather than patting you on the back for having your butt in the chair for longer than you need to","- open feedback culture - also a negative because Booking really does treat its staff incredibly well. And when you treat people incredibly well they sometimes don't realise how lucky they are and become spoiled
- internal Facebook -  just like normal Facebook, the internal social media tool within Booking often serves as an echo chamber and polarises users into extremist camps for and against an issue, with little room for nuance. It can even lead to witch hunts. This is what allows many of the negative opinions of what is a fantastic (but of course not perfect) company to find an audience and grow into something that doesn't represent reality anymore. Also Facebook is a terrible company 
- The Amsterdam HQ is bursting at the seams with people. The rate of hiring has lead to overcrowding"

• Your peers are very friendly and you will learn alot from them 
•Benefits are great","When I first arrived at Booking.com it was a really up and coming job in the Orlando area. The pay was really great for the work you did and the metrics where very attainable.  It was a fun atmosphere and there was a family kind of vibe that you got at work. In the last year this changed drastically but it seemed to be only the US offices. The disregard for the CSP department is honestly disheartening. Due to the fact that we are not unionized we do the busy work of 5 departments and growing. We have to deal with upper management mistakes and then have it adversely affect our satisfaction score while still being held responsible. Meanwhile whoever's mistake it was gets to say ""my bad"", this is not an exaggeration this actually occurred. They do an awful job of keeping up with competitors as far as platform options and I am not quite sure who their programmers and developers are but they do an awful job. The site will have a major crash once a month and its riddled with bugs they are slow to fix or just never do. You are informed in the beginning that there are quite alot of changes. This is true and to be expected but this also does not just mean changes to procedures. You will have a new Team Lead, a new desk, a new seating area every three months. The most impactful of these is the Team Lead aspect as this is the person to help you with your metrics and development to grow in the company. One day you will have a great team lead that wants to help your grow and the next you have some new guy that is just stressing over metrics. The comments about favoritism in promotions is very true but with the number of people honestly growing in the company as they promise you is not a possibility. Lastly, upper managements (CSM's) expectations are contradictory and expectations are unreasonable."

-  there is unfair way of distributing the shift pattern of calls and emails for the agents , which cause huge pressure on the agents and the opposite on others , being on phone all day or working on emails all day is not the same at all .

- Some team leaders are so unprofessional , there is not communication or leadership skills  to see team leader jumping and running around like a child , there is not strict rules for the TL around the office or their schedules , some TL skip their meetings one to one to have some rest ,and some are not bothering to deal with their agents or their issues .  

- The system used to calculate the performance of the agents is not accurate and make huge pressure on the agents accordingly , 

- All CSMs cares about is the stats and reaching the targets of the contacts due to the pressure from the head office

The company is afraid of what they don't understand, they probably have twice the workforce they need for what they deliver (you see a lot of people arriving in the office at 11 and going home at 15 being in a 40 hours full contract, the worse part is that this is the kind of people that is promoted). Vacancies are created without needs analysis, so don't be surprised that they will hire you and won't have anything for you to do during a couple of months. The company works in silos with their own ""kings"". B.com is not transparent when people leave or is fired and also when they decide to reduce costs (like cutting BAM and other benefits), everything related to this is always communicated like a ""Santa Claus"" story.  Another interesting fact is that booking is structured in order to create place for people, departments appear and disappear if people leave, the structure is not based in what is needed. Also they use not global standards for names of departments and functions, so do not be surprised of going to an interview and do not understand what they are talking about, also a perfect match of your CV with a vacancy can in fact mean that is not a match, because at B.com even this is a mess.

A lot of initiative outside work like bootcamps or volunteer program and so on. The salary is good compared to other companies.","The above-mentioned points seem great but in reality, the company is so demanding and have crazy standards that a certain point you won't have the energy and mindset to enjoy all of this. During my years in Customer Service, there was pressure from all managers to work more, better, faster. They forced us to spend most of the day on the telephone without having the possibility to hang up the phone and keep on working on your computer. We had crazy security procedures which made us scare to pronounce the wrong word on the phone and being penalized. We were asked to do extra work and being updated with company procedures while we didn't have time for that. If you will work for them, you won't even have the time to fo the bathroom. I left the company after having a huge burn out and the management didn't do anything except calling me one day yes and one no, asking me to work, without giving me time to recover. Finally there's some attention on the issue. Mental health is very problematic in Booking and completely neglected. We were 10 in my team and 4 of us went burn-out. Specially if you have a past with mental problems, any kind, don't go to work there.
The worst part of it, at least in Customer Service, all the people who were promoted used to go out a lot with management to drink and party. Booking keeps on saying that networking is above all forgetting about actual the actual skills a person has to offer. Many people I know who went burn out worked a lot but are introverted or have a family or social life so did not spend much time -networking-. I could go on longer trying to make my point but I think you understood that it's not worth it."

Micro managing has become a trend in the office 

Managers train their team on how to do their jobs when they dont get involved and do the job themselves (how can you train best practice when you dont get your hands dirty)

Benefits have been cut back (Yearly meeting in Amsterdam cancelled and monthly social outing cut to £5 per person.) This would have been better received if senior leadership did not make false claims about the cuts.

You can progress fast at Booking.com but you need to play the corporate game to do so 

The fact that Booking.com is the number 1 accommodation provider has got to some peoples head both internally and externally and there is no longer that play to be the best attitude

Everything is rotten: management is so incompetent and simply ""got there by mistake"" that it horribly fears smart people with innovative idea and credentials. 

All the best talents are leaving or about to leave because they're pushed out by idiotic managers who play games with people's lifes. Do you know people get hired from outside Europe (they call it diversity but it's cost saving), uprooted from their previous life, then parked in a limbo where they have no scope, no team, no goals? I know of at least 4 or 5 highly paid positions especially in Product Management that literally have no work to do and left on the bench: the best part is that nobody told them in advance! Bad situations like this can happen TO YOU because management doesn't exist here. The only way to survive is to obliterate your professional dignity and become a 'yes man' drone: do not buy any of the recruiters' lies about the company culture, they are well known for being the most incompetent of all workers at Booking and are rewarded for their ability to just lure people with lies and hit the quotas.

I cannot but stress how you should STAY AWAY from this company which completely lost its direction and strategy. Nobody knows what is going on and top leadership is panicking. 

Booking.com, once the most efficient PPC machine to sell hotels, has entered its senility and won't find any rejuvenation potion anywhere: its tech is decrepit, its management fears innovation, its best people are leaving. Over the next few years the company will have theee options like most old people: slowly dying at home on its own bed surrounded by family; dying in a hospice under a heavy amount of pain-relieving drugs; euthanasia.

There is a toxic environment  which has come from decisions taken differently, based on subjective views and there is no equality between employees. It is absolutely right to ensure that attendance policies are adhered to, however those policies only seem to be applicable to customer service agents only and not senior members of staff such as team leaders or management. Examples of this are people losing their jobs or put under pressure for formal meetings and warnings, however team leaders are blatantly arriving late themselves in front of agents on more occasions than those people getting fired. Sometimes they try and cover it up saying they were in a meeting room when you can clearly see them running into the building. Agents are not able to see when their managers are late on the same system where every single customer service agent latenesses are shown to all employees. Also people are actually losing their jobs or having formal meetings led by those same team leaders. 
Another important thing is that employees wellbeing has been completely forgotten because it’s all about numbers and there is no human touch or empathy in any way. There is no appreciation or values for the agents which are the heart of this company and this obviously reflects in the quality of the performances as well.
Investigations are performed on certain agents but not on others that have a really good connections with managers or team leaders and this has absolutely brought the situation to another level.
Is no coincidence that employees have successfully sued the company multiple times. 
Also, imagine your job being on the line because customers voice their feedback over issues such as booking.com policies  or hotel complaints via a  questionnaire that is sent to determine their satisfaction on the interaction had with the agent.
Career progression is extremely slow and it could take several months or years. Who is cheaky is rewarded against who works honestly and hard.

Finally, employees want to raise their concerns as this is what this office has been going through lately but are scared of being targeted or victimised. This has to stop because something serious could happen and it could bring many people to mental breakdowns or even worse."

2613,Booking.com,A new Nokia,2019-07-14,1.0,Engineer,Some people are really wonderful,"The problems Booking.com faces now have been present and growing for several years. To anyone inside of the company these points are so familiar they're cliche: 

Any suggestion of customer focus is a falsehood. Metrics were invented which were supposed to be a proxy for customer satisfaction, when even the most inexperienced of people could see through this even as it was being introduced - the real intent of these metrics was to offer an illusion of success to an hapless executive. And yet in quarterly meeting after quarterly meeting the leaders of the business sat silent in either disbelief, or in complicity. As bumper organic growth delivered generous executive stock grants, everyone won. It was never going to last. 

Fast forward several years and this numerical falsehood has become dogma, and not subscribing to it is to limit your career prospects severely. One need only look at the upper ranks of leadership to conclude that the best career move is to leave your ethics at the door, refuse to engage with the concerns of the rank-and-file, dismiss consistent and cacophonous user feedback and do what mercenary and self-interested product leadership demands, no questions asked. Oh, and be a white Dutch man. That’ll also help. 

The lack of customer focus manifests itself in multiple and pernicious ways - from discriminatory pricing and pseudo-discounts to predatory sales techniques, inflated urgency, inflated review scores, hidden fees and buried small print - not to mention the selling of settler properties in occupied Palestine. Classy.

Even having demonstrated that their aggressive sales techniques caused measurable physiological stress on customers, the company still manages to find a way to dismiss this and trot out the user centricity lie. It is impressive to have somehow convinced thousands of people to believe they are doing good things for customers when they are objectively doing bad things for customers - and yet even as the ethical baseline sinks, so does the previously rock solid growth rate. 

Management was a dirty word for years, and a legacy of being uncaring about people now means that even worse than having no managers, we are surrounded by bad ones - young men, mostly, who lack both business nouse and the emotional intelligence to understand people; what motivates them or how to provide an environment for people to do their best work. There is a smell of desperation coming from the technology organisation as they scramble for control having irreversibly lost it when their leader was removed from his post and was not replaced for far too long. The search took so long that the damage done will take many years to repair.  Not a soul amongst the leadership have even the faintest idea about how technology works. No, this is not a tech company - it is a second hand car lot selling dingy hotel rooms in an antiquated programming language via a system of opaque policies and pricing strategies. 

The leadership team cult of personality is centred around a triumvirate of ethno-identical pen pushers who crave control to go with their multi-million euro salaries, and they in turn surround themselves with sycophantic yes men (yes, almost all men) - amongst them newly minted Vice Presidents who have demonstrated an aptitude only for long-term, repeated, expensive failure; adept at taking credit, cash and cachet, but not responsibility - but never fear, we are only ever one reorganisation away from figuring it all out. Project Oranje, indeed. 

This group will never lead this company through the critical phase it finds itself in after 3 years of false starts. Unfortunately, when it all comes crumbling down, they will still be millionaires, whilst the rest of us will be left with little more than a stain on our resumés. Emergency flares sent up to the skies above Norwalk fail to catch the eye of the elders. If only they knew. 

The greatest tragedy is that whilst the company swells the ranks with well paid consultant-types and low-paid CRO fodder, there is a core of utterly disengaged veteran employees who are tied to the company by virtue of a cruel compensation structure which asks for longevity over loyalty, quietude over conscience. And so these formerly brilliant people who have been tossed aside for daring to disagree are left to wilt whilst waiting for their next vesting, hoping beyond hope that in the meantime the market doesn't start to ask questions about the growth of new business units, or the scaling of rentalcars.com, or booking.com for business, or any of the myriad still-born product initiatives to have withered and died in a company which has the chutzpah to still call itself innovative - a label which coincidentally benefits it to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros in tax waivers from the Dutch government on profit almost exclusively generated overseas and funnelled back to to the Netherlands via a network of shell companies designed for this specific purpose. Experience the world, pay in Gilders. 

One day in the not too distant future, an MBA class will replace the classic example of Nokia with that of Booking.com - an incumbent beaten by nothing more than it's own arrogance, complacency and incompetence. You should decide if you want to be a bit part player in that case study, or not."

2618,Booking.com,Mediocre engineering culture with severe lack of ownership,2019-07-10,2.0,Software Developer,"This is a tech review, so I'll focus on that.

Booking's scale is big. So if you're into large amounts of data, interesting A/B testing, scalable architectures then Booking has a lot of potential. Be aware though that almost all of this is made a lot less interesting by the mediocre and half-baked approach to almost everything in technology.

If you like getting paid for 40 hours but only want to work 32, then Booking is also great. Show up at 10:30? Leave at 17:30? Fine. Happens all the time. 

If you love Perl, then this is also a great company, because like in Perl there's more than one way to do it. So prepare to see every arcane Perl operator you ever knew, have three chat clients open (because there's more than one way to reach someone), prepare to work on lots of technologies that don't work together well and prepare to see many different management styles / ways to organise teams.","The engineering quality and technology is mediocre. A lot of teams are very business focussed (which is great in principle) in their particular domain but without anyone maintaining any kind of overview.

This means that the default strategy is to just cram a feature in the existing code in the fastest way possible. That is, look for the piece of code that needs to change and add an ""if (my_cool_feature_enabled) {} else {}"" construct.

Rinse and repeat until you have Perl functions that span 5000+ lines. No kidding. By that time everybody and their mother have touched that code, so no-one owns it anymore.

Meanwhile of course some people have gotten frustrated with the spaghetti Perl code base that is impossible to navigate and is an archeological record of two decades of mostly uninspired hacks and copy pasting code (the latter happens to the extreme). So new technologies have been added.

Which ones? Well, it's booking so no-one owns this process. So there's Java which is the only 'official' second language for that matter. But of course the data scientists use Python. And R. And there's Go, which is cool. And Kotlin, because it's also cool. Within the Java world most popular (web) frameworks are being used. And so are all protocols you can think of. Same on the frontend, React, Angular, it's all there in various places.

This freedom is nice on the one hand, but it just doesn't work. It also leads to resentment between teams. ""Why do they do their own when they could have used Spring boot"", ""why do they do this in Java when 3 lines of Perl would have been fine"". Because no-one takes ownership or dares to make decisions, people do what suits them best. This is very pragmatic, but it leads to loads of islands of different standards and tensions between these islands. Standards not only in technology, but also in quality of people.

Pointing this out invariably leads to an explanation along the following lines: ""Well, yes but in order to understand this you need to know the context"", and then a war story comes to defend the mess. And that's fair enough, but no-one cleans up after themselves."

Clueless management with TL's who do not even have basic human skills let alone work ones. Biased treatment of employees, rules will be applied to some but not to all.

Company procedures lack common sense or any other purpouse than making the work long winded. Quality team evaluation are a complete sham, based more on personal perception than on looking at the real quality of the work done. At least in London the quality team is made up by a bunch of brainless individuals which were chosen for the position precisely for that. You ask questions and the answers given are unrelated and do not make sense... just talking for the sake of it. The system on wich the platform is based is complete rubbish. Website crasshes constantly, information is misleading or plain wrong, bugs are a daily accurance... basically just a rubbish product which employees are expected to consider  (and the company as well) as the best thing the planet ever had. At time the whole atmosphere in meetings and events is so creepy and self celebrating it reminded me of  cults. Manegement was investigated for sexual harassment and bullying but in the end all stayed the same. I was personally discriminated and when i raised this up nothing was done.

2632,Booking.com,"Good Benefits, Fake ""Family"" Environment",2019-07-04,3.0,Customer Service Guest Specialist,"Free food, free coffee, location is convenient.  Chill environment. Pay is decent only if you work the night shift where you can get paid almost up to $16.50; regular pay is $14.25. If you do OT, your checks can average about $1500-2000 a week, but of course that's working 10-12hr shifts 5-6 days a week. 

It starts out wonderful. The first two weeks of training they make you do for the first part of your position (Customer Service Guest Executive). They are very hands on but only give you about 10% of information for you and then send you out to the floor for a month.","If you're not used to Customer Service, working in a fast paced environment, or used to teaching yourself, you are thrown to the wolves. While there are plenty of employees around that could help, you are assigned to a specific team and if people don't know you, they make it seem like you're a bother to them.

I, unfortunately, was 1 of 6 others who were not assigned to a team once we officially started. We were all placed on different teams as ""Foster Kids"" as they called us. The team I was put on were only there for about 2hrs of my shift (I worked 5pm-1:30am) and by then, everyone was gone. Who did I have to ask for help all those hours? No one except the other 3 girls who also had no team or we had to call the Senior Line religiously to make sure we were doing things correctly. We all had to help each other get by and figure things out.

A month later, they bring you back for two more weeks of training to be a Specialist and you learn more about the things you couldn't work on as an Executive. The third month they finally hired a Team Lead and I was assigned but they did not start to actually coach me on things until halfway through the third month.

This place likes to talk about being empowered and lifting people up but it has a very fake Family Corporate feel. Promotions are given to those that are loyal to management. If management doesn't like you they'll set you up for failure to create a situation where they might have an excuse to terminate an otherwise great employee. I was fired by someone in the company who I was ""friends"" with on social media and they reported my posts about celebrating my success for completion of training with the company and also several praises I received from guests as well. Whatever jealousy or personal vendetta they had against me worked. Of course the company won't admit that for the persons protection but, I had made those posts months prior and I had recently not had good relations with the person who reported me.

I have never worked for a company that disciplines people for celebrating success with the company they work for. My advice, use this as a stepping stone to increase your customer service and problem solving skills. Unless you are a ""teacher's pet"" and fit in with the high school clique feel, by all means, they will welcome you with cake and cookies...literally."

Feedback culture is a disguise, a top-down approach is dominating everywhere.  Unclear reading of procedures by the Quality Dep and unfair evaluations of agents. Seniors are not competent and confuse bugs with A/B tests.
Outdated internal software.  

Problems of Berlin offices:
The war between the management and the Works Council created a hostile and unhealthy atmosphere in the office. The company lay off over 300 employees in Berlin, giving to some teams a very short notice (1 month before the end of the fixed-term contract).  All this led to the power abuse, disrespectful treatment of employees, double standards and lack of transparency for other offices of B.com.

2699,Booking.com,Not a place for independent thought...,2019-05-29,2.0,Senior Manager,"Good office environment, (mostly) friendly people, opportunity to migrate to EU if you're from overseas.","Booking has a business model that works, for now, and they follow it to a ""t"". You either fall in line like a lemming, building alliances with and kissing up to the people ""above"" you, or you leave. 

To Booking's credit, they do frequently (copy) and introduce best practices from other tech companies. But when contexts are not exactly the same, nobody knows what to do. Booking doesn't hire for independent thinkers or intelligence, they hire for ""loyalty"" and people who won't ruffle too many feathers. When someone is a challenging type, they are typically ""show ponies"" who just state the obvious in overly confident terms and unnecessary decks. 

The ""humble"" culture that Booking likes to advertise based on it's data-driven decision making is rather the opposite--I found a certain arrogance in always following data in a bubble without considering long-term consequences or contexts. 

In all, I saw far too much nepotism, friends-hiring-friends, and stating of the obvious to really consider Booking a serious tech company with a straight face. Their founder made a business model that worked, they optimize the hell out of it and have more money to spend than anyone else. So it works, for now, almost in spite of many of the people it hires rather than because of them.

If you're a fresh graduate, it's a great place. You'll do rotation programs, and most likely be given a leadership position within a few years (so long as you brainwash yourself into the lingo). If you are a mid-career hire, you will likely end up reporting to one of those inexperienced former fresh graduates, who have no real-world business skills or experiences outside of Booking, and suffer for it."

-Management is not honest with you: they will tell you what you are good at, but not what you are bad at. They will keep a positive mindset up until you reached the point where you wanna progress. Then suddenly they will tell you it is not possible but they won't give you a reason. Same happened with a guy who wanted to be rehired after he hated his other job and they said they cannot hire him back because of unknown reasons but he had statistics that exceeded any expectations.

-Unrealistic statistics: they literally measure your service in reviews of the customers which is not right because most customers are unhappy and complain about the company, not about you. They will still give you a bad review because they are unhappy with Booking.com and the company tries to blame you for it, doesn't matter how good you have been. This is super unfair and unrealistic

and an agency services to help you find a home.
- The lunch is good, and it costs around 2.5 euros, already included in your payslip, which is a great deal for the Netherlands. 
- The offices are quite nice, usual perks such as fruit, coffee. 
 - If you are lucky, you get a good manager that will help you grow.
 - *most* of the teams have a good work/life balance","- This was the company I've been disappointed the fastest in my career, realised it was not a good company after 3 months being in there.
 - The company embaraces and promotes people that firefights issues in production, the type of people that can find the bug on the spaghetti code put into production and fix it fast. On the other hand, if you are a person that likes to be preventive, tries to push for better coding practices, promotes the development of tests in order to AVOID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE future issues in production, you will get nothing. I had a manager that told me that ""writing tests was slowing us down"", and I must stop writing them. 
 - There is a big monolith written in Perl. Having a monolith is not bad per se, coding in Perl is not bad per se. Having a monolith in perl without proper ownership of teams through the code, with people pushing changes without even testing them, with people making deploys and not caring about anything during the process, is horrible and painful. If I had known this before joining, I would have not joined at all. 
 - All the people I referred had a horrible experience on the interview process, which tells me that 1) I was lucky in the recruitment process, and 2) there are a lot of unprofessional people working in HR. 
 - I did not experience it myself, but there are a lot of burnout cases through the company (I personally know 2 cases). Most of them are a consequence of bad managers. There are a lot of good managers but most of them will not shine, as they are not showponies. 
 - There are a lot of retaliation cases, also did not happen to me but it did to a close friend. If you decide to join, do get well with your manager. 
 - If you want to grow in there, you need to have 3 things:
        - excellent communication skills 
        - excellent commercial awareness. 
        - speed coding and pushing changes fast. Quality of your code is not important at all (unless you get a good manager). 
 - Being a team lead sucks, as you will have way more responsibilities than the developers, but the difference on the payslip is between 0 and 5%. 
 - During the interview process they will tell you that they will support your partner on finding a job. That is a huge lie. The only thing they do is give him/her a couple of CV trainings."

I had the opportunity to travel to 7 different cities and 4 countries while working at Booking. 2 years ago I was full of aspirations and goals for my professional career. Booking is a great place to begin.  You have a great work life balance and flex scheduling. As a credit controller you learn how to negotiate with partners, soft phone skills, team work, and account management. But over the last 2 years that has drastically changed. I made some great friends at booking and most of the people are very friendly.","Booking has slowly declined over the last 2 years. Management is all about office politics and they only help their ""favorites"". The bonus structure is terrible. For example, a top performing employee receives 1% higher of a bonus than an employee that does the bare minimum. Management has cut bonuses to save the company money because of the slowed growth. For Christmas we did not get a gift or a bonus but rather we received a cookie for our hard work. There are a few managers that will undercut their employees ideas and act as if they are their own for their own gain. They also began taking away our 2 15 minute ""allowed"" breaks during the day. Booking continues to pay their employees poorly and their are limited opportunities for advancement. The credit control position is becoming more automated and more customer service like."

Their bonuses are based on your stats 

Overall, I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy unless it was a simple case of you need to pay your bills and that's it. 

You gain no hard skills except maybe your customer service gets a bit better because of the amount of hassle you have to deal with everyday because guests and property owners are so annoyed with the service that basically your job is to be there to receive punches in the face intended for Booking.com. They make empty promises of development but this did not happen once while I was there, and you see a lot of people staying in the same customer service role for several years, making you far less employable if you want to leave because you don't learn any tech skills besides learning B.com's own internal system.

- bonus, benefits, local discounts ( arranged by the work council)
- good work-life balance
- full time is 7 working hours per day + 45 minutes of lunch","- what made the difference in Booking.com was the QUALITY of the service and the approach to the job together with the skills and competentes, now it is all based on NUMBERS - ok the company is growing and also needs to standardize a service in a certain way, however being only focused on numbers change also the human touch that had always characterized Booking.com - as a consequence also the relationship with the Team Leaders has changed a lot and most Tls doesn't have the time/the competences/the means to understand the value of an agent and most of the times is not able to interpretate the numbers. 
Most KPIs are against each others as it is impossible to reach the target in all of them and provide at the same time a high quality of service, and the feeling to became always more close to a ""robot"" is always increasing. 
- There is a lot of pressure from the Management and you feel you are always under threat to be on MUP and being fired, no matter if you gave your energy and your dedication to the company for years
- Of course we have to thank for having a space to eat and a Canteen with food at normal price, however the quality is very poor, people got sick more then once, and the service is low and slow. Sometimes you can spend more then 20 minutes of your lunch waiting for new sandwiches to arrive
- it was hard and now is becaming  harder to get holidays or request unpaid leave ( unless you are and agent working on small languages and you don't have to compete with many other agents) - also LILLE office is the only office that can't arrange the swaps with other offices
- when Quality Team started to listen the phone calls regulary I thought it was a nice improvement of their work and could be really helpful for agents to receive detailed feedbacks and advises on how to handle the cases or on the other side recognize a very good agent and his ownership/ going extra mile, however their job became robotic as well and they check and they are asked to check only short phone calls and they are so  schematic that often they make mistakes in the evaluation or give even RED FLAG without double checking ( disputed then by the agent)
- you can take only 1 day off or half day off but if you need 1 hour or 2 hours it is not possible
- ""flexibility"" to start a shift 15 minutes before/after and finish earlier/later, however there is less flexibility if you need a day of or a swap and the system doesn't allow you or you can't find another agent to swap"

There has been cases when new hires (product owners) relocate from distant seas for Booking to discover that everything that Booking promissed is one big lie and the only option they have is to sit quiet or return back to their homeland.

- Engineering Leads do not care what engineers have to say, With the exception of one.
- Engineers themselves tend to ignore advice on a new project when other engineers have designed and implemented the exact same solution elsewhere.
- Quick to blame, even when the engineer is not at fault.
- Engineers do not care about platform security (Although the actual security team do.)
- I have seen multiple cases of constructive dismissal. Including getting staff to become friendly with other staff to gain information."
2873,Booking.com,"Don't believe the hate (at least, not all of it)",2019-02-26,4.0,Copywriter,"There are a lot of great things about working at Booking, starting with the people. The 'Booking culture' may have changed somewhat over time, but that doesn't mean the things that make it fairly unique in the tech world are gone. It really is an open, inclusive place. People can be quick to forget that there are many companies that would never give employees as many platforms to dissent against decisions made by leadership as you get at Booking. You can challenge, you can be heard. Maybe not all the time, but if you want your voice heard, it can be. I never experienced that at a company before. The people around you are really lovely. Most of them anyway. You get bad apples everywhere. You also get bad managers everywhere and Booking is no different. Yes, there are bad managers but you'd be hard pressed to find any tyrants. And I have worked with tyrants. I suppose that's the thing about Booking. If you have worked at an average, run of the mill company before, Booking is brilliant. If you've moved from FANG or some super cool start-up, it might not seem like paradise. It's all about context. You will get to do some cool stuff. You will meet smart, friendly people and talk about interesting, innovative ideas. You will if you want to. If you don't, no one forces socialising on you. And again, i've had that before too and it sucks.","Ok, so yes, there are some bad managers. People forced into management positions because they're good at what they do and need to be promoted but that doesn't mean they are necessarily good for management or the people they manage. Communication across the company is pretty thin, this is mostly because it's a huge company. The start-up mentality lasted far longer than it possibly should have and that has impacted the formation of the business, but it also kept an entrepreneurial spirit alive that has helped keep the business relatively hierarchy-free. The problem with being so big is that at times you can feel like a very tiny cog in a giant machine. Or maybe that's just me."

If you speak more than 1 language you make more money. They are always busy so there is often overtime availability.

Also, they throw great parties. My office had two yearly parties, plus the Booking Annual Meeting which was so fun.","It's customer service, so you spend all day answering calls and sometimes dealing with upset customers in bad situations. You basically are a middle man and don't have a lot of power, which can be frustrating. There are a lot of metrics and sometimes you don't have control over them, and of course those metrics affect your bonuses and potential raises. 

Also it's a call center, so you and your time are always being tracked. 

I would say there is very little chance for advancement and promotions, which is hard if you like to move up."

-Very good salary compared to Dutch companies (and Europe in general specially if you qualify for 30%)

-Very good overall package

-Nice locations in the middle of Amsterdam

-People seem nice (and ""seem"" is the key, watch for the cons part)

-Nice cafeteria and good lunch for a very cheap price

-Good benefits (booking hotels benefits, discounts on many things, etc.)

-One of the few places where you can learn how to do things at a very large scale

In short, I will personally pack my bags the moment I get an offer from somewhere else.

One more thing: I am actually neutral when it comes to the CEO, not sure why it's marked as ”disapproves CEO”","Well, where should I begin?

-Very outdated technology. Outdated here doesn't even describe it. If you work on backend for example, if you work long enough in Booking, you may not be hirable anywhere else!

-People are nice as long as you don't do or say something against what they religiously believe (and I am not talking about religion), for example, if you ever get into a discussion about why not use Java more instead of Perl (and Java is surprisingly supposed to be an official supported language), someone could ask you to pack your bags and leave in public without any shame about it!

-No one really understand what would it take to get promoted or get higher stocks/bonus. Very vague, very politically motivated. You can see people with 20+ years of experience who do most of the work and never get promoted and on the other hand, you can see someone who became a principal just 3 years after getting out of college! So go figure!

-No testing and no code reviews. Company stats that we have ""monitoring culture"" instead of testing culture, which is fine, except that a developer wastes half of his productivity on roll-out and chasing crappy errors forever because of that!

-No consistency in anything. You would have products and teams what people are fighting to work for and other products and teams that people are fighting to escape from!

-Company thrives on the fact that people in there are free to work on whatever they want, but reality wise, people who are senior to you can shut you down any time, either directly, or by shaming you enough to quit what you are doing!"

They even monitor how many calls you make per day; as an Account Manager, that is very  degrading, as you should be trusted that you are doing the right thing for the company and for your own role, especially when you have challenging KPIs.
As the pay is very low, the team is too focused on meeting/exceeding their KPIs, as that affects the bonus. This results on  people doing things just to show off to management. 
In the UK office, The management is very bias, they will support the staff that suck up to them and don't have an opinion; they happily let go great  talents that voice their opinions.
The account managers are being chosen based on personality (chatty and extreme extroverts), experience and skills seem not to be  valued."

The environment is exciting compared to most boring offices / contact centres, they have so many great perks which are easy to take for granted - such as free hot drinks / fruit, subsidised (great quality) meals in brilliantly unusual canteens, great colleagues and free parties, good perks all round, and every time you think they couldn’t possibly get any better they consistently improve. 

The company as a whole aren’t afraid to make mistakes and learn from them, and they have a great learning culture, with some really useful and interesting learning facilities.

Great location in the city centre, and that’s only going to get better in the next 1 or 2 years as we move to a purpose-built office on the site of the old Granada Studios - so things can literally only get better. 

There are plenty of opportunities to progress within the company and the Leadership are fantastic at keeping you updated on how the company is doing at regular business updates.","Currently some of the offices are getting a little bit rundown, hopefully they won’t neglect this too much with the new office around the corner.

Also, doing workshops, trainings and courses(especially Linkedin one has been brilliant) are really beneficial to make progress as individuals. Free coffees and tea etc is great but not that particular perk since there are loads of other perks from perk box, booking.com or company disc. Way to go!","First, the HR(people team) has got lots of room for improvement. I have started in SLH and now working in FS. The process was too long and had lots of redundancy. I guess people on review already mentioned promotion issues and the team’s trying to be more transparent. About suspicious transfers, maybe there should be one more step to check if the applicants are capable of the positions before final interview. It’s great to see that but still the communication between employees and HR is still poor. I have many colleagues in four buildings complaining about the lack of active communication. If you want to progress and achieve something in this company , probably you’d have to chase people till the last minute before interviews. 

Also, the targets for each department should be attainable. Misunderstanding and friction between managements happen when the goal is only set by one side. There are few people in our department leaving due to this dissonance. Maybe this could be resolved by planning with more people from different departments as task force rather than by only few relevant people."

Targets are unrealistic and create stress e.g. we were constantly pressured to improve our targets as an office (Berlin) - but my own personal targets were met.  It is absolutely unrealistic to ask an employee who is taking calls 8 hours a day to somehow be able to improve the targets of fellow colleagues.  There is no sense of satisfaction as the job is never done, the calls/emails are endless and focus is always on doing better.  For a call centre it isn't bad at all but don't be fooled.

Subsidised dining in canteens means hot meals in winter which does make a difference.

- Streamlined promotion process with clear competencies and expectations outlined to help you progress.
-Company listens to employees- conducts an annual anonymous survey with feedback for the leadership team and management. Last year invested in learning and development, this year invested in benefits and are trying to be more transparent with strategy as a result of feedback.
- Good benefits (pension matching, booking.com discount, €300 to spend online, bonuses)
- Modern tech stack (in my bit of the business- see cons)
- Always pursuing better engineering practices (with input from devs)
-Mostly relaxed and fun culture- no dress code and you can joke around with colleagues (obviously within reason, but I've yet to offend anybody), parties twice a year with fun events for christmas, halloween etc
- Good work/life balance encouraged, focus on good mental health. Managers don't think you're a better employee just because you work longer hours, I was discouraged from it by one manager because they don't want people to burn out.","- The internal IT services can be pretty meh. The internet connectivity can be a bit iffy, and we run into problems with accessing different accounts (linked learning, email, safari books)- internet issues can block you for an hour or so max, the access stuff can be fixed within a couple of hours if you report it
- State of the codebase/tech stack varies depending on what part of the business you work in- it's good in my area, bad in others.
-You don't get pay raises (aside from adjustments for inflation) unless you're promoted, but they do regularly promote people who meet the competencies
- In my bit of the business we've had some team instability, mine have been changed around every six months or so (when a lead/product owner leaves, or new ones start, teams can be merged together or split up). Whenever a team changes they do try to keep people together though.
-Culture can be a touch corporate at times with ethics meetings and the like. Sometimes feel there isn't much of a social aspect (get togethers, team building) but that partially depends on the team/department."

The facilities are good; offices are maintained to a high standard.","After a promising start, I've become disappointed working here. Having worked in similar roles for a few years prior to joining, I took a pay cut to come here on the understanding that Rentalcars would allow me to develop valuable technical skills. Ostensibly the company places importance on developing its people.

However, I've struggled to achieve any success (either personal or for the business) because of a lack of good management. When approached about this, managers gave every indication that they were keen to address the issue, but repeatedly declined to do so (e.g.: not following up on agreed actions; failing to take on board key messages so that I've needed to outline the same problems and solutions each time we have the conversation). 

After protracted discussion over a period of several months (during which I haven't seen any attempt at amelioration) managers are now beginning to blame me for the situation - in one case citing a perceived issue with the standard of my work which they claimed to have been made aware of some months prior, but had not shared with me. This has diminished my confidence at work, and trust in senior colleagues. 

While the company can lay claim to some laudable initiatives (regarding, for example, ethics, professional development, and diversity & inclusion), it's the management that can make or break a workplace - unfortunately I can't recommend this one."

2959,Booking.com,London Office: Good and Bad sides,2019-01-10,3.0,Customer Service Guest Specialist,"- Free daily meals cooked by a chef. You are entitled once a day to one hot meal, soup, access to an unlimited salad buffet, bread and one dessert. 

- Free teas, coffees, hot chocolates, and fruits always available. 

- Opportunity to learn several useful skills or improving them (ex: problems solving, complaint handling, communication, coaching, data analysis, leading a team meeting etc..) 

- Great flexibility: You can book holiday last minute and have it approved up to 2 days before the date you need it without filling a written form or speaking to someone / it is all on a system that you can access even from home. You can also swap easily your shifts with other colleagues of the same hired language as you which is very practical to save up on your yearly holiday quota.

- Workplace is well located (2 min away from South Quay Station) and near shops like Pret à manger, Tesco etc..

- London Office is in good condition and well decorated. 

- Company offers paid downtime hours during your shift to work towards your personal development on a monthly basis  except during their peak seasons. 

- Company gives quarterly a budget of 35 pounds per agent towards doing a team outing which team members can organize themselves. 

- Desks can be lifted up which allows agents to work sitting as well as standing. Also walls in the office are mainly made of huge transparent windows which is helpful if you are claustrophobic.

- Big Summer and Christmas parties. 

- Helpful and friendly office reception team. 

- Working with people from various cultural backgrounds and nationalities. 

- 121 with your team leader on a monthly basis. 

- Variety of shift patterns to match your lifestyle: Early / Late / Night and more recently the 4x10h which allows you to get weekly the same 3 consecutive days off in exchange of working weekly 4 shifts of 10h instead of 5 shifts of 8h but the downside of this one is that you will have to work every weekend. 

- Company used to organize an amazing yearly business event called BAM. It was a trip with flight, food and hotel all paid for to Amsterdam where about 25% of the staff worldwide gathered for a great time of learning, entertainment, fun and party. Unfortunately they replaced last year this great asset they had as a company to a pale version of what it used to be.

- Christmas gift every January (but I think this benefit is stopping from this year as it was alongside with the BAM).

- Quaterly bonus and possibility to do overtime quite frequently.","- For most people the role of customer service guest or partner specialist gets unbearably repetitive and boring after 1 year max. It is definitely '' a must '' to try moving to a different role within the company as soon as possible to remain engaged and stimulated. 

- Although it should not be like this, your whole experience in the company will depend on which team leader you get. The way the company is structured gives a lots of power to team leaders over their agents. The danger of this is if you get a nice team leader who is friendly and supportive it is a big plus for your journey in the company but if you get the contrary, you will probably have a hard time there. 

- Targets and KPI's are unrealistic, it is almost impossible to reach them all consistently on a monthly basis. Although officially the company used  to say  '' the customer is at the center of everything we do '' in reality they prioritize quantity (even if job is badly done) above quality. The most frustrating target is CSAT which is judged on surveys customers will receive after their interaction with agents, half of the time if not more, the guest doesn't make any difference between you as an agent, the accommodation and the company so even if you was great with him or her, it is most likely you will still get a bad survey which will affect you to the point of being put on what they called ''performance plan'' this can lead to a formal meeting and warning depending your team leader. 

- The system they are using to measure if agents are on target has changed 3 times during my time there. The latest one is some kind of artificial intelligence that no one fully understand including those who made it. So basically if you think the system is wrongly registering your points which is very common, you can't prove it to your team leader. 

- There is a very negative atmosphere of complaining in the London office. Lots of agents are there just for the money and hate their jobs. The few people who are genuinely passionate about their jobs and great at it have to be very strong mentally to remain positive. 

- The main system agents are using to work changes almost every week and many times without agents being notified in advance which can be stressful. Also bugs are very frequent on this same system. 

- Company uses a Facebook at work system called Workplace to create a social life in the office and promote company events or sharing information. It is helpful however this same system gives you sometimes a feeling that you are in a virtual world, it does not really make you feel you are building real relationships with your colleagues and also all those notifications after a while can really distracts you from your core duties. 

- For your salary to be interesting, you are forced to work unsociable hours (nights, lates and weekends). 

- Progression in the London office is very hard because variety of roles to grow is very limited, unless you are willing to relocate to Amsterdam office where you will get more opportunities. Another issue with progression is that the competition is high because the number of internal vacancies in the London office is very small compared to the number of agents.

- Most of the seniors (older staff trained to help agents on cases) are friendly and supportive but some of them are lacking active listening skills, those one seems not interested at all to help, they rush you on the phone by robotic answers without trying to understand your questions.

- HR is great for simple queries and requests but inefficient and very frustrating when it comes to big issues.

- A/C system is dysfunctional all year long and it has been the case for a long time. The office gets often freezing or boiling inside despite the temperature outside. Lots of people are getting sick because of it but company will not take this into consideration when it comes to apply their sickness policy which used to be getting a warning after 3 instances of absence. Last summer you could see in the office very often agents having to work with blankets over their shoulders and coats during their shifts while it was 30 degrees outside."

I worked there 3 years and had to leave because they hardly offered new shifts. When they did, it always seemed people that sucked up to team leads and management would get morning shifts. Everything changed! 

When I started it wasn’t stressful and our main goal was to provide great customer service to our guests. Now they are numbers based when this job doesn’t require any sales or retention of guests. 

They make you worry about your talk time, customer satisfaction, your adherence, hold time, your contacts per hour on phones and email, finalize and then make you track every reservation you worked on. Basically the job is being micro managed and are just money hungry. 

Booking offered a trip to Amsterdam for conferences but that was cancelled. They are open 365 days, they do not close for any holiday. So chances of you working important holidays are high. I spend my New Years at work when the clock hit 12:00 am, January 1st.

I love how the company has been structuring its fields, all internal tools and work around this to improve. The company does everything, go above and beyond to offer the best support ever to partners and guests booking through. Benefits are amazing, getting a percentage off in bookings, help with external trainings, and managers helping with PDP.",The company should be more flexible with locations to work and expand some interesting positions to others countries/regions beyond Amsterdam.

2975,Booking.com,Poisonous culture - mediocre managers,2019-01-06,2.0,Site Reliability Engineer,"More than average compensation compared to the local market.
Good support for relocation and post relocation. 
Lunch.","Booking has overgrown their manager's abilities. It was fine some years ago but it has grown so much more than the managers' abilities and skills. 

If you are a developer who has no passion for technicalities then  there is a place for you as a team lead and gradually you work your way up the management ladder. Their growth forced them to accept whoever they have as leaders and managers regardless of actually having managerial knowledge, skills or abilities.  While actual managers who I have worked with in other companies were people who studied management explicitly and had technical background beside it, booking is a place where you only need to be sweet mouthed and declaring that you want to be a team lead to be accepted as a team lead. 

Booking now is one of the most reluctant companies to change I have ever seen (I have worked at  many other companies before including one of the FANGs). While other companies I worked at were much larger than booking they were not so scary of actual change as booking. In booking, any thing that touches how people work or operate is a total no for management regardless of how effective the change could be, even just trying it (and sometimes even just a meeting to discuss it) is refused by the management. Sometimes people making a meeting to come with suggesting plans to change something, at the very first evaluation and experimentation phases gets an email from higher management saying (please stop the discussion). All they accept is some mackup on the old technical / managerial culture, even if it clearly doesn't scale and even if everyone sees its short comings. 

So now the company is piggybacking its old success and just continuing by inertia. Its growth rates are declining, no major new products succeeds, just some sub products that piggy backs the old mature hotel reservation business, major initiatives like payments and containers failed miserably more than once, the list goes on and on. 

So now the company is about show ponies. When managers fail one of the symptoms of their failure is unability to present the achievements of different members of their teams higher up the management chain and failure  in pushing their reward. This resulted in people pushing their images through useless posts on internal facebook platform, fighting and negotiating for nothing except being in the larger picture. Actual technical abilities and achievements have lower importance than people loving you, and by loving you I mean total subjective words you get in review with general failure to present actual objective evidence, events or solid actions of improvement.  

One of the clear symptoms of decision making stagnation at booking.com is their failure to hire a CTO for a year and half. Yes the company stayed for a year and half without a CTO with higher management failing to find a replacement from inside or outside the company. This resulted in tons of middle managers competing together each pushing his own agenda without any unified process or direction either technical or managerial. This resulted in multiple competing projects, vaguely defined promotion process that each manager applied and understood in totally different way, and inability to clearly define new roles like site reliability engineers. 

To give a solid example: I got 5 quarters in a row of (exceeds exceptions) evaluation. I changed the department then I suddenly started getting (meets expectations) 4 times also in a row !"

Colleagues are cool and I'm looking forward to the 2019 benefits.","Incorrect understanding and execution of the company values.  Writing new values without following them will not make BookingGo a great company. On a daily basis you'll see:

- Managers dismissing concerns by either saying ""that's how it is"" or ""let's wait for next year - it will be solved"". 

- An internal recruitment process regularly bent and disregarded to promote friends and family. 

- Poor divisional management who focus on personal interests rather than running the department.

- Recognition starts and ends at a 'congratulations' piece of paper. Salary reviews below inflation rates. 

- Contact centre left out compared to other offices within Manchester in both terms of benefits and management.

Discounted healthy snacks","Watch out for workers who are too lazy to fully devote time and effort to researching the best solutions to customer service issues. Often times they will assign  tasks they believe are beneath their status to a junior colleague without providing proper support. There are people who routinely pass the buck because they do not want to take ownership for a problem and resolve it. Often times people will intentionally set up junior colleagues for failure by divulging incomplete information and then cover their tracks to ensure they do not look bad.  Forget discussing issues directly with superiors because you're just another cog in the machine. They frequently ignore small issues which later snowball into much larger ones because no one takes enough time to figure out what's the source of the problem.  Rather there's a put up or shut up mentality from lower management who do not give a damn about anyone but themselves and others in their clique. Warning: If you speak up through either formal or informal channels, expect some sort of social reprisal generally in the form of social ostracism and admonishment from colleagues and management."

For example, I was assigned one of the worse managers - focused heavily on numbers and doesn’t treat her team like they’re humans that sometimes have personal issues they need to deal with that come before work. Micromanagement is abundant, and like I said, if you don’t know someone important or have incredible numbers, they just want to get rid of you.

2995,Booking.com,A good stepping stone.,2018-12-29,3.0,Customer Service Guest Representative,"Decent pay for the city of Orlando for unskilled work. Free fruit ( apples, orange, banana, and grapes ) readily available at all times. Free coffee, including espresso. Massage chairs in the break room. Quarterly bonuses based on performance and how much your team lead likes you. Fantastically diverse company. You get to talk to people all over the world every day. Your co workers teach you every day, as they are all from different cultures and speak different languages. They are lenient about performance and give a lot of chances - you really have to screw up your performance to get fired for this. As long as it shows you are trying, they will not fire you for performance even if you suck. Free parking on premises, and those that do not have cars qualify for a hefty travel expense bonus. A constantly changing company that listens to its employees most of the time and changes what needs to be fixed most of the time, even if it takes a while. They are constantly trying to engage, whether it be with parties, spirit days,  Booking.com swag, or encouraging posts on the work social media.  They usually give you cake on your birthday and frequently attempt to lift spirits with pizza or contests ( depending on the team lead ). 

It is a good, encouraging company that tries its best, but has gotten too big for the attitude it used to have towards employees and is struggling as it has to adapt to the fact its growing too quickly and taking on too many changes. 

There are ways to move up if you would like to be a Senior Executive,  a Team Lead, a Quality Executive, or a Customer Service Manager. 

This job gave me quite a bit of skills in patience and problem solving. Thinking on your feet is essential here, and they absolutely give you those skills if you work at it here.","Over the time I've worked here, I watched it go down hill. When I was first hired, we had fab Fridays twice a month where the company gave us free food or gifts. We were able to listen to music while working. Their motto was numbers don't matter as long as the guest is satisfied. They had a yearly meeting in Amsterdam you could be chosen to attend, all expense paid, that everyone worked towards, and if you weren't chosen, there were parties at your office with games, food, and gifts. 

Before our eyes we watched this all change. The meeting in Amsterdam was discontinued, fab Fridays faded to one Friday a month, and then disappeared altogether. Music was banned, and suddenly it felt every time you turned, someone was pushing numbers. The system of bonus structure changed, making it harder for employees to get a high bonus, if any. You get heavily impacted on your customer satisfaction scores, despite the fact that most of the time, the guests are rating the hotel or the situation, not you. How your lead sees you and how motivated they are to see you get a bonus is how you get one. 

The PTO system is wack. They give a massive amount of PTO ( a month ), however, they give it to you all at once, and that is all you get. Sick? PTO. Vacation? PTO. Emergency? PTO. You can't ask for days off unpaid, you can't give them doctors note to get unpaid days off, you can't even give shifts away. You can switch to have days off, but that's it. Although PTO is supposed to be used at the employee's discretion, Booking.com forces you to use yours in order to get a day off at all, even when sick. Although they have FMLA after a year, it's nearly impossible to get and constantly denied. It's a broken system that needs to be fixed, as no other company forces hourly employees to take PTO for a day off or does not allow them to opt for unpaid days off. Even when telling them a year in advance about a vacation, if you don't have the PTO for whatever reason, you will not be able to go or will lose your job.  Even if you have a doctors note letting them know you physically can not work, if you don't have the PTO, you're either coming in anyway or getting written up. And if you get written up, it lasts forever and never falls off. 

In the long run there is one thing a prospective employee should remember about this job title - it is a call center. It is also the complaints department. You are going to be yelled at. Screamed at. Blamed. Sometimes Booking.com's system screws up but they will adamantly deny all responsibility and point fingers at hotels that have no idea how our system works, leaving the agent forced to stammer and stutter out excuses to both the guest and the hotel to try to spin blame when we all know really who's fault it is. Guests are angry and they're going to take it out on you. Grab your patience, your softest, most calming voice, and get ready. 

Quality and coaching is vastly dependent on the Team Lead and the Quality Executive you have. I had several teams during my time, and some quality executives would ding me for things others had told me to do. There was no winning unless you hone yourself to exactly what THAT quality executive wants. 

The parking is free but lately there have been break ins and a few people's car windows were smashed. My own tire was slashed in the parking lot.  They got extra security, but it was like pulling teeth to get it. 

There are ways to move up, but they are so few and far between that the entire building goes for them when they pop up. Anywhere outside of your building is barely worth hoping for since you'll most likely never get it. All of the good jobs are in Amsterdam. 

It's a good job for now. If you can't see yourself in a specific position there, it's best to get the skills and the name on your resume and go somewhere that will help you grow and excel into higher positions after a while"

It is also very difficult to move up in the company since the promotions are not based on merits but companionship with other team leads/CSM. They would much rather hire someone new instead of giving the opportunity to internal candidates and I saw this many times during my time there. Management is not very transparent, in the Orlando office anyway.

2999,Booking.com,“I am Woody Woodpecker and I am the sheriff of the Town”,2018-12-27,1.0,Customer Service Specialist,"Good training;
Flexibility at work;
Great international colleagues;
Decent pay + quarterly bonus;
Monthly party.","Customer/Partner specialists very well pressed to reach unrealistic targets. The job is stressful per se like in other call centres; some agents speaking some languages are most of the time on the phone listening to both realistic and unrealistic complaints(really demotivating task), whereas some others work on the picklist only (which is equally bad for the PSAT/CSAT, KPI related to the quality of the job as it is related to unresolved past cases) and listening to the music.
-Changes of procedures occur continuously.
-Quarterly bonus set to meet expectations  only (almost impossible to exceed them).
-Booking Annual Meeting (BAM) in Amsterdam “transformed” (read “cancelled”);
-Many positions (Guest Reviews, CRA etc) disappeared and or fused with other departments within few months, forcing many employees to leave the company;
-contact per hours (the second most important KPI which shows the productivity of the agent) is measured on number of calls received, not any more per single item. Good luck!
- small properties heavily strangled by the rules dictated by the company.
- A lot of Bookers do not know how to use the website to reserve rooms/apartments. Not user friendly at all.

Internal Promotions: 

the pre-selection is based on the above-mentioned KPIs. Absences in the past might influence the final verdict. However, it is the grade of connection you have (networking inside and outside the office with the key players) that will give the opportunity to grow professionally inside the company, despite the ridiculous videos prepared in the headquarter want to persuade you that meritocracy is key.

Seniors:

Most of them are not very approachable, they undergo a metamorphosis once they leave their previous job as simple agents.

Team leaders:

Their main duty is to report who complains too much in their own group to their line managers who know how to get rid of them. No leadership skills, no technical knowledge of the software, no knowledge of the easiest procedures (this is especially true for those hired externally). Most of them belong to ONE NATIONALITY.

Customer service managers:

They are in competition among themselves (and the rest of the offices worldwide) they push their team leaders to get from their teams the best KPIs in order to get bonuses. 

Also here, only ONE NATIONALITY. Does the obsession of their motto “The right people in the right place at the right time” want to suggest that other nationalities are not good in managing a call centre office??

HR:
 
They work for Management, despite they hypocritically claim to support agents (which is the majority part of the offices)
and that the internal promotion process is clear and fair.

This department has the courage to send to some of its former employees an email to refund the company some money (the amount varies from €50 to €500 and sometimes more) as they calculated their last payslip incorrectly and blackmail them in case they will not give money back. 

Here again, only ONE NATIONALITY."
3000,Booking.com,Do not apply,2018-12-27,1.0,Customer Service Team Leader,There were some TLs who where amazing as well as people... most of them are gone from Sloterdijk of course...,"I was working for more than 3 years at the Sloterdijk office.

They will cover each other even when they know they are not doing things right and will ask anyone that does try to change that leave. They have 2 awful senior Team leaders, the senior team is sick or leaving cause of the poor management and CSMs or site leader do nothing. Site leader ask for permanent contract for friends even though this people have work avoidance and cheat the system. If you do not think like they do, you are not worth their time. They do not want new ideas, they want sheep...I made a mistake and went to ethics ambassador and HR within the office.. noone listen to me, I should have gone to HQ to get something done.. my bad really... I got one CS manager putting me against the wall and asking me to kiss him, no one cared, i flagged work avoidance and people not doing their job.. they do not care, and started saying I was not communicating properly (I have checked with several other people, and they saw me and disagreed wwith the managers as my communication was on point, professional and so on). I am happy all this happened as I am in another company with a much higher position and they love my style and accept my ideas... they are not afraid of different points of view as the people in ASD is. 
Senior management do not comply with values from Booking, they do not care.. they tell you the opposite of what the videos from compliance from HQ say... ethics, zero, willigness to work, zero...

-Paid Holidays- You get time and a half plus 8 hours of PTO or you get double time pay. You also get paid 8 hours if you don't work
-Pay is somewhat reasonable- not a living wage in Orlando","What began as one of the best jobs I've ever has turned into a complete nightmare. The company initially reaped of benefits and managerial staff had empathy for it's employees, we had end of the month catering- noted as Fab Fridays, for the holiday's they would provide food, we had an annual, all expenses paid trip to Amsterdam to learn about the culture, and meet global colleagues. Flash Forward 3 years later, our Fab Fridays are non existent, for holidays they request that we, the employees contribute the food now, they've eliminated the Amsterdam trip and have created a local ""Roadshow"". The employee experience has gone from 5 star drastically down to a 1 star rating. Something that has shocked a lot of employees because the company is growing exponentially and making tons of money, yet the employees benefits have been slowly taken away.

Another negative of this company is that as it is currently growing, trying to become a monster hospitality website, it lacks in consistency with its guidelines, procedures and even its security guidelines  . As a Customer Service Guest Specialist, rules, procedures, and important security guidelines change constantly with just an email telling us to review the material and compelling us to learn it ourselves- sometimes our team leaders just tell us about the change but they themselves aren't given enough time to even study the guidelines and therefore provide effective counsel on such changes.  The quality team than reprimands you, which in return results in threats by your team lead with Performance Improvement Plans because you didn't adhere to such guidelines. Before there would be training sessions for such drastic changes  and they would be discussed in workshops- these workshops are also non-existent.

The structure for reprimanding employees is inconsistent as higher management doesn't have a proper checks and balances system to ensure that their team leads are treating employees fairly. An example: Someone that i knew was late every single day for two months and only got a write up, he was favored by his team lead, yet an agent the other day had 3 late occurrences and got the same level write up. The policies are biased and unfair. The environment at this office has always been encompassed with favoritism, what you read in other posts in regards to favoritism is all true. Team leader's have favorites on their team and therefore sometimes sanction some differently than they do others and keep in mind that this can also affect you from growing in this company- again no consistency. 

The Human resources department is also a joke. They protect the team leads instead of actually listening and INVESTIGATING the concerns brought to their attention by subordinates. There is nothing kept anonymous as Team Leads and HR representatives have close bonds.  The code of conduct states that Retaliation is forbidden, but the same employees who reach out to HR in confidence that their concerns will be heard, addressed and rectified eventually end up at the bottom of the food chain and well, let go or fired for ""other reasons"". Strict scrutiny, i have come to notice, is placed on these employees. Human Resources does nothing about it! For solutions we have to perhaps reach out to Amsterdam to get a positive result but I personally am not certain how effective they do their jobs."

- Subsidized lunches are good.
- You can meet a few smart people there. Will find x5 more idiots though...
- Work-life balance is good - you can do nothing for many months and no one will notice it. 
- Good salary and bonuses according to the local job market(which is very bad)
- If you always wanted to play a ""House of cards"" IRL this is your chance! Don't read further, apply immediately.","First of all, I beg you to believe and I swear everything you may read in negative reviews here is absolute truth. If still you decide to join after this please have a clear understanding of why you are doing this and always keep in mind a backup plan in case you realize you can not stand it anymore. 

- The company doesn't make any profit because of successful tech products. The only things that make it work are lack of competition, heavy usage of dark patterns and google ads. 
Obviously, if you don't have a need in tech people who can do more than moving buttons around a form you don't want to waste your money and efforts for them.
I believe this attitude is the main driver that leads to all the ugliness Booking has inside.

- The middle management is deeply rotten. All around the company, you will find managers and product owners who only care about what is good for them to get a bonus or a promotion and don't care if these actions make sense for the company. No need to say they will evaluate you in terms if you are helping them to achieve these goals. 

- The first line managers aka Team Leads is nothing better. At one point a couple years back anyone who was willing to be a team leader was promoted. As you can imagine this led to many brown-nosers in TL position. Nowadays it is normal to see former UI designers and copywriters leading dev teams. Obviously, they have no clue what their people are doing and how to assess their work. 

- The higher management is either dumb or, what is most likely, don't care about this issues while cash-flow keeps going.

- Almost any manager or product owner will retaliate over your badly in case you disagree with them. Don't worry, they will do this without violating the code of conduct. And believe me, they will make your work life miserable from that point

- A noticeable part of your compensation is a bonus which is not guaranteed and can be cut off by a wish from anyone from your management line.

- The company is corporate ""nonsense"" driven. From higher management, you will never hear anything except politically-assured answers(which are usually not the answers). For the middle management, you will easily notice a huge difference between what they say and what they do.

- No need to say your technical skills and achievements worth nothing at Booking. Most likely you also won't learn anything new. After a few years there no decent tech company will hire you. 

- I will not elaborate on this but here is a huge amount of politics on every level.

- There are quotas in recruitment and promotions. Which may be good for you if you are a girl.

- Recently started a cost-cutting which is nothing good. No one knows which benefit will disappear the next month.

- Local Amsterdam job market is very bad. You will hardly find a company who can pay you comparable to Booking, which makes you sit in a golden cage if you were committed to this move. Booking knows this so they will squeeze all the forces out of you until you are empty, then they will throw you away."

PS
Things might have changed since 2016.","(This is a summary of a review I wrote before, and then deleted out of fear. I will let this one stay).

When people scream ""Booking can destroy your life!"" on this and other websites, it's not an exaggeration. If you cross the company (and you won't even know it at the time), the retaliation will be absolutely insane. The abuse I experienced during and after my employment is unbelievable, and to this day I'm afraid to share the details publicly. Before Booking I was a traveller and a developer, now I'm unemployed for almost 3 years, with no opportunity to lead normal life at all. 

The level of cynicism is what makes Booking special, compared to other giant companies. Your colleagues will write blog posts about ""empathy"" and ""kindness"" while simultaneously helping to turn every day of your life into a nightmare, both online and offline. Once you are The Enemy, there are no limits. They will mock any illness or disability you or your family members had. All of your internet searches, social media posts, online purchases, email etc. will be presented in some negative light and used against you. Even if you've been a good colleague and a friend all this time, the Ministry of Truth will make sure nobody believes you (popular fairly tale cover stories for employees leaving abruptly are burnout and depression). In the end you won't be able to prove a thing - people aren't so stupid to say your name explicitly while abusing you. Any supporters will be silenced and any friendships destroyed. The negative effects will continue long after you've been forced to quit. To be fair, they will give you a good-bye bonus, to make sure you have enough money to move out of the country, if you are an expat.

It's a five-star company if money is all you're after, but zero-star if you want to have a meaningful life in the process. You can succeed if you disconnect you private and work life *completely*. No personal devices, accounts, conversations, phone calls at the office. No friendships at work. No work in your free time. Be a good 9-to-5 citizen and everything will be fine.

I'm aware how different this sounds from the official company mantra about openness, care, inclusiveness. The company has deep roots with some rich folklore and is well-known for its parties, but the start-up days are long gone. What's left is propaganda and a shiny image. Don't trust that image: Booking is a multi-billion giant and has enough money to do anything it wants with your life, including taking away your most fundamental rights to privacy, safety and security. Most likely it won't happen to you, but it can. Be aware."

3065,Booking.com,Please be Aware,2018-11-20,1.0,Customer Service Specialist,"-Awesome colleagues! like a family!
-International environment","-Absolutely No Work–life balance.

-A business based in new arrivals: staff usually leaves after 7-9 months, as soon as they manage to find another job.

-You are promised a career, but you find yourself in a meaningless job. and not a good one.

-Impossible to get holidays in high season (if you are applying for the Spanish-Portuguese line, think about Latin America and Europe's high season)

-If you have experience in the accommodation industry, you will feel bored and extremely useless. since the position requires: 5% knowledge regarding reservations and technical application, 95% just to absorbe and try to reason with unreasonable customers. (customers = guests and properties)

-The so-called ""B.home"" or as we call them ""overbooking.com"";  will be the cause of 90% of your cases.
B.home is a program to include private properties to compete with airbnb. 
the issue, is that b.com system, is made for hotels with a channel manager and a reservation department. since on b.com once the reservation was made is confirmed automatically, instead on airbnb the property get a reservation request that they can accept or deny. this simple confirmation process avoid lots of issues. 
but probably B.com is ok with that, since thanks to this, b.com gets a double commission, from the overbooked property and from the alternative reservation to relocate the guest.

-Everything is about numbers, how many contacts per hr, customer satisfaction, the time you need to finalize your case..... You will be monitored and evaluated on a daily basis on calls, emails and procedures. So get ready to feel like a lab rat.

-8hrs shift feels like forever: you have to check the clock every 5 mins. 
You have to follow a daily schedule that will change within the day, which unfortunately you cannot modify or adapt to your needs.
If you don't follow the schedule your numbers will be affected. so remember to check your schedule every 5-10-15 mins to set the correct status manually. since apparently your status is the only thing that cannot be updated or synchronized automatically. 
What is the issue with this? that an 8 hr shift feels like 16 since you have to constantly check your clock. 
 
If after reading this, you're still accepting the position, please at least choose the morning shift. The morning shift is by far easier: better work-life balance, easier cases, less angry guests, more picklist, more calls from hotels and the time go faster.

1)Booking.com is not the worst company to work for. as soon as its not on CS.

The free fruit is just 1 piece of fruit per person per day. C'mon you guys have enough money to stop being weird like this.,"The London office has a horrible environment. Team leaders are a joke, especially on night shift. They are either having sex with their agents (who get moved to other teams) or they're making racist jokings or they're hiding from their team by having mysterious (work free) meetings constantly. They've no idea about procedures and just pressure you to hit KPIs like you're a robot. 

After your probation ends your team leader can decide to extend it if you didn't hit just ONE of your 6 stats, even though people from other teams were able to pass with worst stats. They also give bonuses based on if they like their agent and not on your actual performance. 

The job itself was exhausting when they put you for 8 hours straight on phones while coworkers get lots of picklist (emails).

Procedures change every week and alot of times you'll have customers screaming at you over things that are not your fault. they pretend its just peak season that's super busy, NOT TRUE. That's just the period of time when it can take a MONTH to reply to customer. And you have to deal with the angry customer wondering why.
 
 During the training you get told ALOT about the premium pay but when you begin you get rostered as close to midnight as possible so they can cheat you out of as much premium pay as possible. This only happened to new staff because they changed the contracts to make you start whenever they want. Daytime pay sucks too because the job is super stressful and underpaid. They also pretend there's a high chance you get promoted but in reality promotions are decided unfairly and the only contracts they give out are temporary ones where you can have NO job security for like 6 months. 

Most people leave bitterly and don't last more than a year so they staff turn over is super high. Whenever you have an issue the team leaders turn into robots and can't have a human side AT ALL. The sickness and absence policy is crazy because you can only be sick OR late up to 3 times a year. I don't know anyone who doesn't need at least 3 forgivings in 12 months. After 3 instances I couldn't even help I had to have a formal meeting where my team leader told me I could be fired for gross misconduct if it happens again. Seriously?? 

Team leaders and managers also get fired randomly and an email will be sent to everyone explaining that they broke the code of conduct. Yet if you complain that your team leader has a racist sense of humour it can get downplayed?

Team leader also follow you to the kitchen if you go for some water and ask you (with a nice smile) if you're on break or 'personal time' (10 minutes a day that you can use for your own time, that they discourage you from using because it messes your adherence).  I truly wish I read an honest review like this before I started because I would not have wasted months of my life in a stressful job being treated like a slave. Good riddance."

Lunch
Work life balance","After the CTO(Bank) left, company culture has fallen hard.
Incompetent people got promoted(Directors) in management because smart people left the company and there was nobody senior enough to fill the void.
Most of the Product owners are incompetent with no real world experience. 
Management subtly force people without a future to become TLs, to do their dirty work.
Most of the engineering teams are led by designers who haven't wrote any code in their life. Nowadays, even copywriters are leading engineering teams :) 
Flexible hours is a lie as they will literally put your ratings to 4(Partially meets expectations) or 5(Needs immediate improvement), if you're late in just a few standups. 
Your technical expertise holds no value here. They don't need it and they're very open about it. 
HR is completely useless and will only support management decisions. 

Advice to people: Be very very very careful about  selecting your Team Lead, it can make all the difference. Some guidelines I used to tackle that:
- Shouldn't be a designer/user-researcher/copywriter; won't ever be able to understand your tasks
- Should be actively involved in coding (ask his/her teammates about it; not him/her). Check git logs.
- Should've more working experience than you (check LinkedIn, if no good companies there it could be a bad sign)
- Should've atleast 5 years of corporate experience (don't count freelancing & self entrepreneurship ventures)
- If talks too much random without getting on the point, bad sign!
- If puts too much stress on communication then engineering, bad sign.
- Should've empathy; find out how to judge that. This one's most imp."

But there are also very few people who can help but rare to find them.
In most of offices there are zero career opportunities so not many people last more than a year. 
It's all about visibility and with whom you are a friend and who likable you are. Most of the manager don't do more than just have meeting which no one knows what they are about or spend the day on Facebook at work.
There's lack of communication across the company, not many people know what they are doing including management. 
I believe there are much worse jobs out there, however I would definitely think twice. Few years ago this was a nice place to work, but with all the cost cuts, huge staff turnover and management it became a place where not many people want to be. 
Be prepared to spend 8h per day on the phone arguing with people who cannot read, unless you are on a language line which is closed and receives only emails. If you are looking for a job and need money go for it, but if you looking for a career or want to progress than rather choose something else as that's not going to happen unless you applying in the head office."

They constantly hire externally and there is no way to move up in the company unless you kiss butt and agree with all of the incorrect things they say. 
-They constantly ask for feedback but when it’s given, you’re in a vulnerable position because they WILL use what you said against you and a target will be on your back. Its all about FAVOURITISM here not experience, skill, drive and hard work.
- The managers and Team Leads are always gossiping amongst each other.
- They let go a lot of great staff over the last year because they voiced their opinon and replace them with people who are desperate and will take the job just to get their papers. This office is now filled with people on VISAs. Nothing against the employees just the management because they know these people will stay. If you ask people in the office on VISAs if they like the job they will tell you that they really dont but they need to stay in this company in order to help with being able to stau in the country.  Very sad. 
- They constantly have an eye on you and make sure you KNOW this.
- They say things like its not about the numbers but that’s a lie. When it comes to bonuses or shift changes its ONLY about the numbers which causes people to cheat the system and yet they are the ones that are praised. 
P.S The free fresh fruit only applies if you work the early shift (if you’re lucky) or when the VIPs come into the office...

The job itself is very tiring! Mostly because you have no control to help these poor  guests who call. The policies and procedures are so disorganized and/or incomplete and so most of the calls we get are complaints we can’t help with. Where are the Team Leads who are supposed to help during these calls? Probably in a meeting. They have about 5 meetings a week where the staff is left without assistance while they’re getting catered lunches. 
After your shift you just want to go home and cry. The next morning, you contemplate calling in sick.

The quality role gives you an opportunity to coach others, getting to know several different people and growing your experience whilst doing so. The role gives a good level of autonomy when managing workload.

You get the opportunity to join and manage different projects towards your own and your colleagues development.

It's a fair place to be working in for some time","The job itself changed dramatically within the last year, being now focused on evaluating hundreds of calls every month, in which recurring issues are rarely addressed when solicited.

Quality Executive performance is measured in a (quote) ""Holistic"" way, there is little to no objectiveness as to what is not meeting, meeting or exceeding expectations.

The sickness policy of the company can have you receive a verbal warning for feeling ill as little as three separate days within a 12 months rolling period. Lateness is also counted towards sickness instances, needless to say these have nothing to do with each other. Discretion of the Team Leader applies when interpreting this policy, resulting in some employees being held up to completely different standards than others.

Whilst Customer Service Agents are micro-managed to a ridiculous extent, management has little to no control whatsoever.
I have been working to support different team leaders in different teams. I have seen very significant cases of management not acting in a professional manner and reported some, nothing tangible has ever been done. On the contrary, on a couple of cases promotions were given within a month of reporting.

Almost all internal positions given within the last 12 month have been temporary roles. Those who apply for positions have to go though extensive interview and preparations processes, for positions on contracts that last at times three months. When approaching the end of the contractual period, the employee is told if they will be getting an extension or be returned to their old role. Thanks to this process the company can save an amount in pay, and keep all temporary employees on edge, having them fear for their future and work twice as hard."

The opinion of engineers are completely dismissed by management when is time to set the strategy and that create requirements that are almost impossible to achieve with this old legacy system.
The management change primary focus every 2/3  quarters making really difficult to achieve something meaningful.

3148,Booking.com,Not a place for excellence and passion,2018-10-14,1.0,Product Owner,"It's an ok place to see how a global business works and to get some experience working on an environment with people from all over the world. Good work/life balance.

You will be pushed to be data driven and if you never worked like that, you will learn to think this way.","The company is on a moment many people in the product/tech organisation are demotivated by the focus on short-term wins that no one is sure are actually wins. The experimentation methodology Booking is famous for doesn't follow best practices and there’s little training to understand how to be data-driven.

There’s a lack of leadership and strategy in middle and upper management (CEO included), which in turn got promoted because they continued this culture. As a Product Owner, you have little contact with upper management (CPO, SVPs, Directors), and unclear guidance on strategy. More than once you would hear different opinions from CPO, Senior Directors and Directors about important topics, vision of the company etc.

When the company says it's data-driven, it really is, to the point that most decisions can be deferred to A/B testing. Most people have a simplified knowledge about how to do experimentation and middle management knows this but very little has changed. This creates a culture of superficial thinking about the customer and no deep understanding of customer issues. If you try to work on big or bold ideas, you’ll be told to break this down into smaller steps and find a way to validate it.

On a career level, there's little to no clarity on promotions and yearly bonuses, but there’s a clear political and favoritism bias. Performance reviews (every 3 months) are based on feedback given on an internal tool and that are ""calibrated"" with others that also do the same thing. This can be gamed by asking feedback from people that like you and by ""selling"" your work more than actually bringing results. If you challenge the feedback you get from your manager you'll be retaliated in subtle ways. Specifically for Product Owner, the only career path is to become a Senior Product Owner and become a people manager. If you don’t like that or you don’t have the traits of a people manager, you’ll stay in the PO role for a really long time.

Technical or design excellence are a second and third class citizens. There's little investment to improve the quality of how things are done and there's no support to create new technologies or go open-source. The same applies for design, and the result as a product you can see for yourself."

I decided not to as the company has already shown its true colours by having HR post a biased and rather humorous review. Please do scroll down and have a read! Needless to say, named review is beyond false and biased and it goes to show how unprofessional management really is. Sexual harassment is a real problem, despite it being brought up time and time again and managers being fired (some are still currently under investigation), HR had the audacity to call us ""small minded few"". Upon reading this, the majority of us found it outrageous, insulting and there's a general feeling of hopelessness as such bold statement should have never been made by an HR professional . HR is meant to be working hard to ensure integrity and yet we are being called small minded for bringing the sexual harassment issue up. It is demotivating and utterly disrespectful towards colleagues who had to endure and face frustration and sexual harassment.  No one should go through this in the workplace. No company should have an HR department trying to blatantly cover up the truth and call us ""small minded few"" only because we had to courage to report unethical behaviour displayed in the office.

Me and another colleague's contract were no longer extended after 2 years of working there an not receiving any negative feedback - the reason to leave was 'you don't fit the team'. Our team was made up from 6 people and we just received our 6th Team leader that same year and she just didn't even want to hear our side. After asking her to talk to my previous team leaders she said 'i am a person who trusts my own instinct and will judge myself, however from what i see now, i surely will not receive any good work about you.'  After hearing this i wanted to run away and had lots of self problems thinking that something might not be right with me.

Free lunches (although very unhealthy) and coffee and fruit 
Regular work events","When I first joined in 2016 the office was smaller, I received a decent training and felt as if I was a part of a team. There was always pressure and strict lateness/sickness policy - but manageable as the team huddles and other outings partially made up for it. Last two years the office has steadily become worse, to the present time where (I hear from former colleagues) the work environment has become unbearable. Many of the team leaders are not qualified, I have heard several of the male team leaders talk inappropriately about people in the office and even one of them describing having sex with an agent. This was 1.5 year ago, some of the misconducts I have heard about while being away are just utterly shocking. Being promoted is all about networking (did not use to be) and same people get ignored time after time. The TL (especially externally hired) have close to no knowledge of what their agents jobs are and they also do not care. It is all about how long you keep your customers on hold or how many you manage to get through in an hour, encouraging copy/paste replies and sloppy efforts when there are complaints. If you are hired for a smaller language you can be forced to work on the English line, even when your language has a caseload for you to work on. Explanation being, demand on english line defeats enquires in your language? This is clearly poor management as then recruitment will constantly encourages you to refer more people to your line due to demand.

Lots of wonderful events going on all over the business but what is really being delivered other than the business as usual?

Bloated workforce with poor leaders leading to poor communication, progress and innovation. The business is too slow to react to changing circumstances, probably a symptom from having too many people involved in the most minor things with a lack of clear direction. Workforce needs to be trimmed but HR will block.

Innovation in the business is poor. Biggest innovation is supposed to be Rideways but the department is mess and morale is low. Things are over complicated before the basics are in place.

3202,Booking.com,Everything Is Awesome,2018-09-18,5.0,Human Resources Business Partner,"Ignore the poor reviews which are obviously written by a small minded few Booking.Com is a fantastic place to work!
We have first class senior leaders who display the most amazing leadership qualities it really is a privilege to work alongside these people.
Our Team Leaders deliver fair and consistent management always displaying the upmost respect for their managers, peers and agents alike.
Feedback is a gift that is a joy to receive, people are actively encouraged to provide feedback both positive and developmental.
This truly is an organisation in both London and Cambridge who are committed to developing their people.
Great Benefits include freaky Fridays where teams are actively encouraged to spend time with each other and senior leaders, TL's and CSM's facilitate enjoyable conversation and social time.
Flexible holiday scheduling allows you to take your holidays pretty much when you like a the drop of a hat -never any problems getting holiday off.
Agents are treated fairly with respect and even though the targets are easily within reach for people that need a bit of extra help all managers are patient and accommodating.
Great Sickness policy where people who are off ill are supported and not punished like in a lot of companies these days, you can go off sick and genuinely not fear a disciplinary when you come back which is nice.
BAM - Booking Annual Meeting is a great event once a year in Amsterdam which everybody gets the opportunity to go to every year so that they can share ideas and meet people from other offices around the world.
Fantastic HR Teams That Put Our People First our HR Teams are among the best I have worked with, taking onboard feedback and offering positive suggestions to senior leaders in order to ensure that people are at the forefront of the mind of our leaders and that people are treated fairly.
Job applicants are treated with respect and diversity is actively encouraged, there are no temporary roles here not try before you buy with this management and HR Teams once you are given a role that is your role, people do not get put in roles and are then told to reapply for them later on like in a lot of business'.
This really is an awesome place to work and anyone who says otherwise is perhaps misguided with a small minded opinion. I love it here and I don't really think there is improvement to be had, how do you improve perfection
The above is not just London but Cambridge too, it's the Booking Way","I  am not sure there are any, I genuinely think this could be the best company with the best teams in the world"

Free lunch 
Events at work or outside
Summer treats at work 

It was a lot more relaxed when I first joined but went downhill afterwards. 
They provide opportunities for internal candidates but they always already know who they are going to hire.  

My direct managers have been pretty good to me so I have no complains for them.","It got very strict which made agents very stressed and people started leaving. The benefits provided by the company no longer mattered because people were unhappy coming to work.  

Applying for an internal position is quite easy but you will need the support from your TL. However, they always already know who they want to hire but will continue having interviews for the sake of it. 

Booking.com is supposed to be a very relaxed company and you can wear practically anything to work as long as it's decent enough. A lot of internal candidates get rejected because they do not look presentable ""wearing slippers at work"" which is ridiculous. There's always lots of negative gossips going around making the environment so intense & awkward. Some team leads are pure toxic , either trying to make your life miserable or trying to make theirs better at the expense of yours. 

The company is looking at the money at the moment & not too much on the employee's welfare anymore. Hence, the huge pressure."

-Okaish salary and lunches","-Extremely outdated techstack, as a backender you may get a chance to work on some cool systems, however still most of your day will be focused on digging in the spaghetti perl code, you'll not be able to transfer your knowledge (almost) anywhere.
-A/B testing obsession, making a smallest change will require running weeks long experiments to validate if it's useful for the customers, not worth it if you like to iterate quickly.
-Incompetent middle management will put you down, never before have I seen so many people struggling with mental health issues (depression/anxiety)
-Non-existing HR - the salaries are so screwed that new hires can get up to 15k EUR/year more than people who work in the company for 5-8 year. Recently some of the developers left, and came back within a few months to get their salaries readjusted. 
-As a frontender is a NO-GO zone, you'll not do ANYTHING useful.
-You'll be working with tons of people from 3rd world countries, diversity you say? Not really, we hire them because it's harder to change a job quickly when you need to worry about your visa/family.  Most of them wait 7 years till the magic barrier of obtaining a Dutch citizenship.

*Unsocial hour pay & overtime availability during busy times = more £","* Favouritism, limited opportunities, freaky Friday does not cater to all. Management can be disingenuous + act like spies: lack of trust.
* Everything is timed and monitored (but guess that's the only way it will work because of schedules)
* Conflicting advise of what to do when you want to progress: being overly friendly with management get some people favours and little 'awards.
* Patronised and advised to flirt on the phone for good CSAT scores by 1 or 2 TLs.
* Too many changes and high expectations of quick adaptability which is not always possible immediately. Schedules change so many times a day which is quite off-putting = makes you robotic and quite tiresome.
* In CS you're just a number, they don't mind if successful and strong people leave because they can't offer you much else in the role/office.

The free fruit and discounted food items are awesome and most of the employees are hardworking and kind. It’s not a bad company overall,"1.All of the on-site Team Leads (literally all of them) that direct the employees are corrupt, two-faced, and cliquey, preferring to cause unnecessary drama and spread rumors instead of supporting and directing their subordinates. Few are ever available because they’re always stuck in meetings if they’re not making false accusations toward those they dislike for no reason, often lying to and bullying perfectly good workers into quitting, which only adds to the company’s astronomical turnover rate. The job is doable if you work hard and try not to take other people’s words on the phone too seriously, but the management makes going to work a living hell. 
2. There is no real procedure for protecting oneself from harassment and those who do so are punished far too severely. 
3. Employees are constantly belittled for not doing better at satisfying guests when the job consists mainly of handling customer complaints, being yelled at or bullied and harassed by angry guests over the phone. The most your work/effort is celebrated is when you get put on a tv slideshow next to the bathroom for perfect attendance or a good customer review once a quarter. 
4. The senior specialists that you’re required to call for assistance or approval have a tendency in some offices to be condescending and egotistical. Many will continuously talk over you and refuse to help if you’re new or untrained in complaints, some will go as far as to instruct you to do things that are against company policy and sometimes even the law. Senior specialists aren’t always useless and unhelpful, but a great deal of them are not properly trained, checked on by management, or given proper feedback by anybody that matters."

If you just want to sink your career while earning okayish money, Welcome to Booking.","Bear with me for the long list with Real Examples as well.

1. They live on experiments for everything which is the reason for not much feature development and You will just end up changing if conditions or so just small things.
2. They have an obsession with Perl which is the dinosaur Language. If you think well how bad can it be. Just google it man!!!!
3. This Company used to be great and had developed some awesome systems but that is not the case anymore. Any company mind you, any company can easily take it down with aggressive marketing and tech development.
4. You come in and run and talk around like stupids to people and again interviewing and begging them to take into their teams.
5. They will ramble about open culture and in fact people prefer their own team members to be of their own country people or races. So much for open culture.

6. About helpful culture and all, Noooo you keep pinging people here and no one replies. Never ever in my past 5 companies I saw this much hostile environment.
7. Do yourself a favour and don't ruin your life by coming here... In the end they don't even pay that well to be able to bear all this nuisance atleast. So, run for your life
--------------------------------------------------------------
Example:
Apparently these guys have an onboarding program which they boast about but actually is a complete waste of time, skills and resources. 
The so called OnBoarding Leads will tell you that they will find you the team and some even dislike the fact of you going and talking to people for teams.
But apparently after weeks, they will be like what!!! You didn't find the team. Should I worry????
So, you have to able to read people minds before landing up here.

3 - the whole concept of Values ecc is basically gone. 
4 - the new working agreement has been modified without agreement with Works Council and many part time colleagues had problems to obtain their preference for schedules
5 - the managment is doing nothing to improve but only to ruin the atmosphere in the company, creating more pressure for Customer Service Agents and Teal Leaders.
6 - The company is huge, but the chances to have career opportunities are close to the 0. I had change and all the requirements to be a Team Leader, but the HR department advise me to withdrawl my request to be a Team Leader as I was hopeless and I was ( they said literally ) losing my time. 
7 - many problems for vacation requests. Basically, the work load is divided in languages, but either you're from a small country with few workers on the line, or an agent from a main language, your chances to have holidays are low. Summer : Forget about it, you should book in September of the year before. Christmas and NYE you have to choose really in advance and is not granted, and you cannot have both period together.
8 - the company is squeezing the employees as lemons for the peak season. The company is only customer oriented, so whatever you received from an angry customer you should take it. 
9 - kpi's becoming harder and harder to reach - with consequent pressure on employees and Team Leader
10 - Food is lamentable, considering that, despite for what management said, we actually pay for it. I also found a fly in my dish once.
11 - the company is creating external partner providers which create a drop in the quality of responses for both Booking.com and the customers.
12 - benefits are low, only the Genius status, which is a 10 % discount on booking through Booking.com, but is not even accepted by all Hotels and properties.
13 - they're firing people and not renewing fixed contracts basically giving 0 security.
14 - they're creating new rules and procedures which are causing delays and less quality.
15 - they ask for feedback but when you provide a feedback nobody cares."

For others, like me, the Booking becomes a transitional bridge between their job outside EU and their next job in EU.

The London office must have the hardest working recruitment team in the world because retention is a serious problem due to the level of toxicity.

The irony is one of the company values is ‘it’s not what you say, it’s what you do that matters’ 

Under the bright streamers and promise of monthly outings, office parties and free lunch, they will try to convince you to sip the Koolaid that Booking cares and values it’s people, but this is all smoke and mirrors. 

The reality is you are under constant pressure to keep demanding statistics up. Regardless of how good you are at your job, if your numbers dip, you get disciplinary action.

The sickness and lateness policy is inhumane and exploitive.  There is strict 3 instances in an entire year policy. 

The illogical thing is they are tied together. so two lates and one sickness in a year counts as your three strikes. 

Employees who are unwell or have chronic issues operate under fear and uncertainty in managing this.  There are horror stories floating around of this. 

For the above reasons, everyone bar a few unicorns resent their team leaders because they serve solely to uphold these rules and keep the pressure up.

This is all because of bad leadership. They are being managed from another country and are a number on a screen to someone. The only way they can justify their existence is to keep the stats high enough to seem as if they are working. 

To do this, obviously they have decided to operate a blatant work mill."

- Strong diversity within the tech department","- You need to be physically in the office from 10 to 17, your manager will lash out on you in your face if you don't. Of course WFH is not permitted by the company (though some managers still allow it). Even taking sick leave is stressful, because your manager will ""discuss"" your health situation the day after your absence, and claim it's not that serious enough to affect your daily work then threaten to give you bad review scores.

- Toxic company culture, management bullying and retaliation is pretty common in the work place due to broken performance review process, where only the decision of your direct manager counts. So you'd better listen to them and do anything they want you to do, or you'll get screwed over your scores.

- Promotions ultimately depend on your personal relationship of your direct manager and track manager.

- Burnout is quite common in the company, yet management doesn't consider it a mental health issue so people continue to suffer from it.

- The lack of proper manager trainings and good promotion reviews cause almost if not all the people problems in the company. Yet HR/People department and even C-level management doesn't care about this at all.

- Tech innovations and best practices are not valued within the company. C-level management even states that ""we are not a tech company"" publicly in all-hands events."

Instead, they expect you to join their herd of sheep >> develop a fake smile, kiss up everybody and absolutely adore everything the company does - basically adopt their robotic mentality and forget about your common sense. I actually don't know why they just don't use bots for their customer service as when you communicate with customers, you're forced to use their templates that often don't make sense and sound silly and are so obviously just copied and pasted when customers read the response.

- Dishonesty. Before you join the company, they reassure everyone they don’t care about quantity but quality but then it's all about targets. I think they could be honest about it from the beginning as there's no reason to lie about that but I guess their pretentiousness won't allow it.

- Incompetent team leaders who play favourites and who often only became team leaders because of that and because they’d been working for the company for years. They keep repeating their nonsense even if you prove them wrong as they automatically think they know everything better than you just because they’d been with the company for longer. However, I must say there are also some nice and relaxed team leaders, you just need to be lucky to get allocated to the good ones.

- The information you’re given is inconsistent - when you ask about something, everyone will give you a different answer all the time.

- Don’t you dare going to the toilet when not on a break or logging in to your computer 10 seconds late.

- They say everyone makes mistakes and that’s how you learn. However, if you make a mistake, they suddenly forget about how you were before and never give you a chance to improve yourself as they will immediately put you on their blacklist and forever use the one thing you once did wrong against you.

- They watch you all the time, every single thing you do is monitored.

- The company doesn’t care about their employees who are just numbers to them. They can fire anyone they want at anytime and quickly find a replacement.

-possibility to swap shifts with your colleagues","A workplace of contradictions.

Please note that this comment is related to the London office only.

- the targets are the same for everybody, however each language agent has a different workload, therefore if you are on a busy language line you may spend 8h non-stop on the phone, struggling to keep up, while your desk-mate on a different line is listening to music or watching youtube videos for hours, with no one noticing. Ah, and of course the pay is the same: highly motivating.

-you might be VERY good at your job, but no one will actually care or notice it. This because they judge your performance based on your numbers. This is partly understandable (being such a big company), however the job itself gets completely forgotten. You might save a customer's holiday or maybe just avoid that a customer sleeps on the streets by doing everything in your power, but still no one will ever know. But if you're late even 1 minute from your break/lunch or your numbers are not in target well.. you will have a few words with your manager about it.

-also, by being very good at your job you won’t have time to participate to the office’s activities and promote yourself, as apparently this is the only way to get promoted. So the results is that people who don’t perform well but manage to get involved will step in and become your manager. How great is that.

-they claim they are a multicultural company, however the senior management is 99% British and not really understanding of the different cultures in the office.

-you might get really lucky by promoting yourself and pretending to be someone that you aren’t and be included in a program to become Team Leader (possibly within more than 1 year and multiple projects to be completed in your own time). During this period they will still hire Team Leaders from outside the company (who most likely will be fired after a few months for gross misconduct), while potentially great employees who have been in the company for years (who are never late, never sick, very knowledgeable and already with management background/skills) remain in the shadow, glued at their desks.

-your job might be 99% related to your language, however your Team leader (who most likely doesn’t know your language) will evaluate the quality of your job based on the remaining 1%, as it’s the only part they can physically understand.

-the sickness/lateness policy simply is a joke: you might face disciplinary actions/bonus reductions if you are sick 3 times within 1 year (even if single days), and the absurdity of this is that the office itself is the main reason you might get sick, due to the air conditioning continuously blowing glacial air no matter the weather outside or the season. But no one will do anything about it, ever. Even if you complain. 

-the team leaders are not team leaders, in a sense that they don’t manage the teams. They walk around the office with no actual purpose, jumping from one meeting to another and when you actually need them to do something for you, it might take weeks for them to complete a single task that could actually be done in minutes. If any customer service agent had the luxury to apply the same approach towards their job, well... the office would collapse in one day."

- Employee discount of 25%,
- Loan for travel,
- Gym discount,
- Hot drinks stations, free teas and coffees,
- Annual summer party,
- Freaky Fridays (Basically going to a large pub and having non-stop drinks for a couple of drinks)","- Favouritism , they basically love Italians, if you are Italian and smile a lot, you got a potential to get a promotion,

- Low Basic salary in compare to Tripadvisor (in Tripadvisor the basic salary is 25 k),

- Very hard to hit KPIs, so some agents cheat to get the KPIs and then you will be compared with the cheaters, obviously you end up also cheating in order to keep up with the others, otherwise you may face disciplinary, as you cannot afford to fail the targets in 2 months in a row!!!

- There is no peak season, everyday is very busy, unless you got hired for 'small' languages, then your line is protected and your life is easier, but you get the same salary as us, how fair is that?

- You are allowed to be late JUST twice within 12 months, by the 3. time, you will be send to the disciplinary (but teamleaders can arrive late more than 2 times, nothing is happening to them)

- You cannot develop any career in this office. You can work as an agent for 2-3 years and nothing will be happening with your career. 

- I have this feeling, the only time you may get a promotion is:
1) Either you are Italian and smile a lot , joke  a lot.
2) Or sleep with a manager or team leader (you can hear stories people are having sex after freaky Fridays)
3) Or you are very charming, sweet talk to anyone and everybody and get on very well with the team leaders as well as CSM.

For example let's say you got 2 candidates to become a team leader:

Person 01: A hard-working agent, manages all of the KPIs, was never sick and comes always on time to work and dedicated, but therefore he doesn't go to freak Fridays, doesn't chit-chat, just a traditional hard-working person.

Person 02: An average agent, average KPIs, a few days of sickness during the last 12 months, but therefore very charming, very good with the ladies as well as generally speaking he is the best made of majority of the team leaders and GSM is also approving him.

Who is going to get the promotion? Of course Person 02. Is that fair? In London office, this is the bitter reality. Sad, really sad."

3333,Booking.com,I just hope not all managers are as bad as my manager was,2018-07-06,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I actually enjoyed this place until it got to a certain place. I loved the people, I loved the old and more approachable leadership team. Sorry, but whatever will be responded back, I didn't find the leadership team from the last couple of years as approachable as it used to be. Too much red tape these days compared to what it used to be.
Colleagues were amazing and I made friends for life. A lot of career opportunities, but unfortunately not for me (which I will eloborate on in my cons).
Great social events - this used to be better when we were all on the same floor in Sunlight House rather than when all departments were moved to different floors on Foutain Street. Logistically, I see why this was necessary due to the growth of the company. 
I did learn A LOT, got to be involved with loads of creative and interesting work and work with cool technology and got to work with some amazing people, but in my cons I will explain why I can't rate the company higher.","My manager was the worst manager I ever had! Simple. Since I've started managing people myself, I use this person as the example I don't want to be, so I suppose I can turn that positively around. At the time I was probably a bit naive and may have thought that this was the right management approach as I didn't have that much work experience, which is why I never raised it with either their manager or the HR team.  Looking back I should have raised my concerns though.
This was a manager who was abrupt, judging when they were meant to listen. It was so obvious that this person didn't like me on a personal level and rather than trying to be neutral and workplace professional, they let their emotions get involved with the working relationship which eventually broke it down, as I lost all trust in this person and they had already decided they didn't like me. I was actually going through some serious personal issues during the last 5-6 months of my employment, but this person's management approach meant that I didn't feel confident speaking to them about this, as every conversation with them felt like an interrogation. It also meant that I had very little chance of considering my career even if I would probably have liked to stay on longer.
In the end I saw no other option than leaving.  Rather than showing any type of support, I feel like this manager was always working against me.
The move from SLH to Fountain Street made it a less fun place to work although a lot of improvement still happened around that time. It was just a lot less corporate and more departments were on the same floor and it made you feel like you were part of something and everyone was a big team. A lot of the fun, after we moved and the most massive changes happened, was all very 'staged'.
The sick pay was a joke and I hope it's changed as it created a lot of presenteism in the office, as people couldn't afford being off ill from work and would instead stay and pass their illnessess on to the team.
They used to make you think that this was the only company in the world to work for and make it seem as if there's nothing after Rentalcars. Not sure if this was the intention, but would probably think of how this gets worded.
I left the company with a completely broken confidence and it has taken me a long time to build a trustful relationship with my manager because of my experience at Rentalcars.
I don't know if there's still massive letting go off call centre employees after peak, but if this is the case, it's embarrasing and not worthy of a company trying to be a fair and amazing employer."

- Monthly outing where you have free drinks for two hours.
- The international atmosphere. 
- Possibility to do overtime from time to time.
- Discounts in your reservations.","- Medium and high management positions are  given to English people in a huge percentage. The favouritism there is so obvious that is extremely upsetting and frustrating.  Specially because the international staff are highly qualified (and of course, all of them are bilingual, whilst the English colleagues aren't) and some of them went from high school to Booking. This creates a negative and irritating experience for the foreigners. Talent,  diplomas, international experience, etc are all wasted because you don't have the right nationality. At some point, we did even had a regional manager visiting the office to see why this was happening, and after this visit ""what a coincidence"", foreign colleagues were promoted.
- Bullying, harassment, xenophobia, degrading people in monthly meetings, etc unfortunately happens but management bury their heads in the sand and they never see anything.  This applies of course only of the wrongdoer is English or friends with the management. None can touch you then. 
- Another big issue is micromanagement. If they ever want you out, they will start a proper witch hunt and you'll be gone. Fact. 
- Hypocritical HR department who claims they are there to help, but it's quite the opposite. If you get too ""problematic"" with your requests or get sick quite often, then they'll try to get rid of you, one way or another. They will take advantage of the fact foreign people don't necessarily know all their rights in the workplace. One HR associates has confessed in her previous job the role was about retention, whereas in this company it is actually how to get rid of unwanted people. 
- Targets are unrealistic, putting employees under unbearable stress that brings about illnesses of all sorts. 
- There's a maximum amount of time that you are given for toilet breaks. There will be questions asked if you go over this amount. 
- You can get sacked for being late a couple of minutes, but they still employ a team leader that touched inappropriately a female colleague at a work do. Need to say more?"

Healthy lunch - Almost for free, €40 per month for an outstanding beautiful buffet where the selection feels endless.

Decent pay - Not fully competitive salary but still decent paid, also had quarterly bonus which was appreciated.","Poor management - My bosses were strongly influenced by the opinions of certain colleagues of mine instead of creating their own, which shows low leadership skills as they based their decisions on biased opinions. They did not understand how to give feedback constructively and right on the spot, but instead collect material to throw it in your face weeks later. When receiving feedback, colleagues and management waved the critique away. Management does not appreciate if you have own remarks or ideas, or if you want to have a say in how you work and what you work on; if you start questioning the work and how it could be improved, they will tell you that ""it is not the kind of attitude we have at Booking"". The leaders have extremely poor judgement, shows favoritism amongst colleagues and are two faced, as they say that they embrace ""innovation and diversity"" but their attitude shows something entirely different.

Credit Controller tasks - During the interview stages, the role was sold to me as ""autonomous, total in charge of your own country/ledger"". However, you are micro-managed and people watch every step you take. In fact, I was shocked by the amount of customer support work, which stand for at least 50% of your daily tasks. Partners call/messages for a lot of inquiries that should be taken care of by customer service. Also, credit controllers in Amsterdam are forced to take care of customer service line items during high season (summer months), which is disappointing when you've signed up for a credit controller job. Old fashion programs, did not live up to today's standards as one tasks required 4 different tools.

Company culture & working climate - Did not feel particularly welcomed even if everyone uses the phrase ""it's so fun to have you onboard!"" Truly felt like middle school, certain colleagues only speak to each other and use the excluding method. My area manager only did high fives with other male colleagues, and chose to barely have any interaction with female colleagues. Extremely patronizing and suppressing technique as I was spoken to/referred to as ""girls"" in groups with other women and ""sweetie"" when alone by male colleagues/leaders. 

All in all I was baffled by the patriarchy, poor management skills and judgement, and customer service tasks (under the title of credit controller).

I've never been in such a toxic work environment.

Management does not know how to manage their team, does not know what's going on within their own team, does not have any sense of responsibility,  does not take ownership, and simply does not care about the people -- management only cares about looking good to higher management in HQ.  

Hard work and dedication goes unnoticed. Quality work does not matter, as long as it looks like you achieved something.

- There are nice people from all over the world","This place has been running with an obsolete technology stack since forever (mid 2000's, since the company started in 1996?), but at least when the former CTO and CEO were there, there was a coherent strategy. Now the place has been taken over by several mafias that promote amongst them, it's a highly toxic environment where tech skills don't matter at all, only who you know, which egos you stroke and how good you are at personal marketing. All the processes devised to reduce political biases are now reinforcing them, while mid and senior management hold  ""Ask me Anything"" sessions just to shrug it off and reassure everyone that everything is fine.
It's impossible to learn any new skills which are transferable nor to build anything which is relevant. Spend too much time here and you'll get rusty and lose your employability. The only thing you'll learn or get good at is their own internal game. You might get a good run if you play it well, but forget doing it anywhere else unless you want to become a politician. It's a classic giant who became obsessed with himself and forgot about the outside world: customers, partners or similar companies. Failures pile one after another across new initiatives but there is no accountability; if you are part of the in-group everything is considered learning. If you are out though, don't even think about trying to speak some sense. The better you can do is try to get in.
Graduate developers which join right after college are the best fit, as they don't know much about the broader market and quickly adapt to the ongoing craziness. If you had experience developing anything before at any average-to-good company, best to avoid."

Many senior leaders lack trust and try to lead results via intimidation;  
Although the company brag about diversity, diversity is not accepted in the Grand Rapids office. Despite all different cultures, most leadership are white Americans. Anyone that doesn't follow leadership blindly get on their blacklist. There is no appreciation for different ideas. 
Education is not valued at all. Education is actually feared by small minded ""leaders"" (task managers). 
HR department is completely useless. Don't ever think about going there about anything. I've seen people be retaliated openly despite annual campaigns and encouragement to report any issues to the compliance team.  
I have never seen so many negative people in one place. They gossip and complain about everything and everyone all the time in their breaks. Booking.com should definitely make better hires.

3372,Booking.com,"Come for the experience, not for your aspirations.",2018-06-16,2.0,Customer Relations,"As far as call center jobs go, it's not a bad place to be. Solely because you get to work with some of the coolest people from all across the world with different backgrounds. If you're a sociable person, you'll suddenly have hundreds of new friends. This, however, is a slowly deteriorating feature; as many good people have uprooted and left since Brexit, with the new recruits really scraping the bottom of the barrel.","Here's the full anecdote: throughout your training process, you're led to believe that you matter. It's only after a few months in that you begin to wake up from the hypnotic state and realize that your job is to defend immoral policies of a corrupt industry and the company that fuels this injustice. The very fabric of the infrastructure is set up so that they are prepared to expel your crushed soul and replace them with another naive one. It won't take very long for you to realize that the whole of the company looks down on you, and that non of the backend departments care about the real end-user experience, and anyone whose job isn't being jeopardized by the lack of whatever it is that you're trying to accomplish will care nor contribute towards your accomplishment of that goal. Prepare yourself if you're being hired pre-peak, as you'll be witness the mass layoffs in the autumn seasons just before the end of peak party. If you manage to make it past peak, you'll see that the cheerful glee from the faces of those you were in gradbay with will have been wiped out. These always come in stages without a single exception.
Do not expect miraculous promotions if you don't already have the qualifications required for more commercial roles. There are plenty of mainland Europeans with a masters or above, just in the call center to get a foot in the door. This is not one of those companies that'll provide the funds and training in exchange for your dedication and hard work. 
Don't underestimate the complexity of the role compared to the other call center jobs. Other call centers design their policies to avoid complaints wherever they can - this one is designed to sustain other priorities.

People get low salaries and even when they get promoted they get salary increases that are almost an insult. There is a massive wave of employees that leave the company because of financial reasons, but the company refuses to admit it. On the contrary, they ask for people to “talk to their manager” if they are concerned, as if their manager is allowed to give them the salary they deserve.

Also, on another topic, the company claims to “Love straight talking”. Well, apparently they don’t love it that much when the “straight talking” is questioning someone from the higher management. I cannot see how a company can improve when they do not listen to our feedback. Speaking of which...

Then an employee works hard on his/her limits. And in the end of the quarter the manager says: ""You did not do enough. Next quarter work harder"". And when you are already on limits, you get a burnout.

The management is cruel and hypocritical.  If you say something to them it would be used against you. Be aware that there are ""special"" people in managers who speak only to each other. All is working on favoritism and personal relationship.

Working in Customer Service is very few people's dream job, but the majority of colleagues are what makes the difference. During my time at Booking I made some lifelong friends.

The company also provides employees a chance to give back to their local community.

Transparency is encouraged.","If you don't work in Amsterdam (and aren't able to move there) your chances of progression are very slim. It often seemed that employees in other offices get overlooked. 

I've seen the company grow exponentially and whilst there was always some effort to try to listen to the opinion of all employees in terms of innovation etc, it's simply not possible that everyone's opinion can be heard in a company of this size and so often individual initiatives are discarded/don't work out. Because of internal procedures, positive changes can be delayed. I'd consider this to be an issue with all large companies though, it's not a problem that's unique to Booking. Just something you have to come to terms with if you are going to work in a company of this size.

My biggest criticism is that there's not really any opportunity for meaningful self development. Indeed the company tries, but again due to the vast number of employees - and the primary focus, of course, being on the key tasks and meeting the service level - opportunities and encouragement for other projects are sparse.

At the end of the day, it becomes pretty clear that everyone is replaceable."

Freedom to navigate the company as you wish.,"Truly poor leadership. The majority of management across all roles are people who have no life experience outside of Booking (usually in a sales capacity), lack educational credentials you'd expect, etc. In some cases, the leadership teams of entire departments are a group of personal friends with no credentials to have comparable level jobs outside of Booking, but their aligned interest to protect each other and their understanding of ways to manipulate Booking's ""data"" culture covers their tracks. HR pays lip service to things like this (there is literally a line in our compliance handbook that says managers cannot be involved in hiring or management of personal friends), but nobody actually cares enough to step in and enforce (or even investigate) it.

If you come in as a fresh graduate with no experience, this can work in your favor--you will work on interesting projects quickly and advance quickly (unfortunately to be one of those very inexperienced people in a high level leadership position). If you are a mid-career transfer, Booking is a dead-end unless you simply want to live in Amsterdam (my case, as they took care of relocation, etc.) and fly under the radar until you find something more interesting or decide to go back home.

I can say that a significant proportion of managers/directors are dependent on personal friendships, ability to manipulate data in front of others who are equally incapable of critical analysis, or both. There is nothing more discouraging than being recruited for your experience and running into directors who are less experienced than the people you used to manage but also unwilling to listen because of the positive-reinforcement they have gotten for so long in this unique culture. 

When business is good (the Google machine still works to drive business), quite frankly it doesn't really matter--the incompetency and inefficiency throughout management is hidden. If the business environment ever changes (i.e. Google tweaks their business model), chaos will ensue."

3420,Booking.com,Very Frustrated - Rentalcars.com Barcelona,2018-05-18,1.0,Customer Advisor,"Nice people, good location and multicultural atmosphere.","People are treated like kids, system is terrible, website tries to fool customers - very dishonest business, compliance on the phone is strict, while in the website is okay. A lot of pressure to keep on strict schedules, short breaks and no room to manage your time. Awful company overall."
3421,Booking.com,Run away!,2018-05-17,2.0,Partner Support,"Flexible shifts 
Free Lunches","The previous comments on the London office are sadly true. 
Management can at best be described as unprofessional or inexperienced and lacking people skills. In many cases though it actually seems they lack basic common sense or humanity. Agents are expected to work incessantly like robots and are judged not by the quality of their work but if they are late a couple of minutes from lunch or they take their break a bit later than schedule because stuck in calls. 
The company allows 15 minutes of flexibility with the start/end of your shift timing as well as 10 minutes a day off the phone extra for bathroom breaks or any other personal matter. However some London TL's produced a cringeworty video in which it appears that, even though those things are allowed by the company, it's strongly suggested not to be done as it affects ""adherence"" and at a certain point it was actually hinted people can train their bladders so as not to need the toilet often!!!! 
Weekly results are posted online and written on whiteboards on the walls for everyone in the office to see what could be seen as ""naming and shaming"" practice as effectively nothing is done by TL's to assist agents who need improvement. 
The internal recruitment process is flawed, with very unclear standards and definitely in favour of people who are friendly with management regardless to their actual skills. This is quite sad as there are talented and experienced people in the office who could do a much better job if given the change. 
Also the company pretends to be open to suggestions however if someone points out that things could be improved or done differently they are branded as having a negative attitude.
And let's not even get started on the many errors made by other departments...
Toxic environment can describe the place"
3422,Booking.com,DONT WORK HERE,2018-05-17,1.0,Customer Service Executive,"The culture is fun, the office is nice, and the atmosphere is very relaxed, some of the people are great as well…those are the only pros.","Where do I even begin. I was a customer service executive, and they say they focus more about on-call behavior rather than metric goals, HOWEVER, do not believe this. The job is very metric driven, and the team leads pressure you to meet those goals. Over the last 6 months, the bellevue office has gone through some drastic changes that made employment unbearable. Changing the pay structure and so on. After 6 months, you are eligible for advancement, but you won't get it. Some customer service executives had been there 2 plus years, and no promotion. The room to move up is small, and the job is just demeaning. People yelling at you on the phone for a problem you didn't cause is not a way to spend your day. Do yourself a large favor, and apply somewhere else, like Expedia."

3432,Booking.com,False promises and a suck-up environment.,2018-05-14,3.0,Customer Service Executive,"Free fruit, tea/coffee, occasional parties and lunches, generous PTO package, modern offices. Decent hourly rate.","Team Leaders are incompetent and generally know less than the employees they manage but you can never correct or inform them of anything unless you want to be disciplined. They are all either external hires or people who've been with the company so long I guess they finally took pity on them.

During training you will hear constantly ""This isn't a call centre! We care about you! Promotions will be yours!"" These are lies and they want you to sip the kool-aid so you suck up to upper management during your entire time there. Of all the promised promotions, only  a handful of Quality Assurance jobs come up, half of which you won't qualify for no matter how good a CSE you are because they will be for specific languages. You'll commonly hear the phrase ""We are creating new positions which you can apply for soon, we don't know what these look like yet but you will all be eligible"". Absolute hogwash. TL positions will go to external hires. They want the CSEs to remain in their inferior positions,handling the crappy end of the business while HR, partner services and even the receptionists are treated like royalty compared to you (and are the only people who get to go to Amsterdam so don't even get your hopes up).. CSEs mean NOTHING to this company.
The only way you have any chance of promotion is if you spend all your shift (whilst taking calls constantly) praising the company on Workplace (work Facebook) and posting inspirational quotes there daily. Sucking up is the real ethos here. Any slight hint of criticism or unhappiness in your work will result in you getting a warning or being told you're not a team player.
They claim to not care about metrics during training but wait til you get on the floor and all you see is whiteboards around you with KPIs and numbers everywhere.. 
You will only get 10 minutes a day to use the waashroom. Every minute is monitored.
Don't expect to get praised for doing a good job, a customer could write you a glowing review about how you saved their life and the TL will barely mention it in your 1-on-1. 
Its all about favouritism here. People with awful attendance, poor attitude and average metrics will get CSE of the Quarter and other such NONSENSE rewards because their TL has the hots for them or they are buddies outside work.
CS Managers will offset their work onto CSE ""focus groups"" to research things like improving customer service for certain languages and countries and expect you to do this during your normal work time on top of everything else with no extra pay.
My particular TL took no leadership whatsoever, just passed the buck to team members to actually plan outings and events. Wouldn't even get involved in celebrating birthdays for team members. Basically had to beg him to spend team's quarterly budget.
The website and procedures are changing CONSTANTLY and there is a real lack of communication on these changes. You are expected to sit on Workplace all day every day to catch the updates and too bad if you don't. 
Adherence is monitored strictly. You're nothing but a number to them. They hire overqualified people and then treat them like dirt. Don't waste your time here, its nothing but another call centre.
The calls can be extremely stressful and you must take the abuse without any form of respite. You can never hang up, even if racial or homophobic slurs are used by the caller. Escalating a call to a senior staff member or TL is frowned upon and recorded every time. For someone with anxiety, this job ruined my mental health so much so that I quit. There was no support in handling stressful calls or building confidence and negotiation skills. 
Every single call is recorded."

3435,Booking.com,You can find something better,2018-05-11,2.0,Customer Service Executive,"Best colleagues I've ever had, great food and parties","The job? With all the fast changes and the unrealistic KPIs  is simply becoming impossible to do your job. The company is outsourcing everything to low-paid call centers, with people that don't even speak the language they are hired for. There's especially 1 site that has been reported by so many agents (executive, specialist, senior and TL), but the company does nothing. You know why? Because they're cheap. It's all quantity over quality and this is how Booking will destroy itself in the long run.  Plus, the competition with other websites is getting ridiculous. 
One more thing, forget being promoted, unless you know someone. HR doesn't come back to you in MONTHS, the positions go to people that have little to do with the job description. And let's take a moment to talk about the job description itself. Especially the internal ones are full of mistakes and copy pasted by others, and forget to mentions stuff like ""oh you want it?

When this was raised by both myself and others it was claimed that these staff were ""top performers"".

Hit and miss career paths - I felt there were opportunities to develop and progress through the business, however it was down to your manager somewhat whether you'd get the time to pursue this, not ideal in my case.

People team are really useless, they never know anything, it's unbelievable they depend on external companies, they never take responsibilities of their mistakes, it's always someone else's fault. Also, office in Bcn shouldn't depend that much from Manchester, Real time and resource planning are not there to help, and schedules are not equitable at all. They are more worried about doing stuff ""together"" but they do it the days half of the office is off, they say they love straight talking but that does not work both ways, only one. A lot of pressure, you're just a number for them, it's a lie if they say otherwise. With the excuse the office is new in BCN, they think it's ok to work this bad.

3447,Booking.com,A company with no future,2018-05-07,1.0,Tech,"- Working with some very nice people
- Regular cool parties (monthly drinks + the Booking Annual Meeting at Amsterdam RAI)
- International environment","Management does not listen to employees. It seeks quick wins where there aren't any to be had, and will selectively pick evidence or listen to those employees that promise those easy wins. When wins are not delivered,  the predictable utter failure is proclaimed to be a learning and thus a success. At this point the management will pivot and repeat. This is not an exception, but simply a routine that most teams seem to go through.

No one really knows what performance evaluations or promotions are based on. It is definitely not the work (e.g. product features) you deliver. And it seems to mostly correlate with how much noise you make. It doesn't have to be anything profound, new or even meaningful - simply opening your mouth, attending as many meetings as you can (and scheduling some more) will bring you the necessary exposure to exceed expectations in the eyes of the managers. And don't be surprised if a manager gives you a very low performance score just to teach you a lesson (while openly admitting to you that your performance wasn't actually deserving of the low score, and that it's there just to draw you attention to the improvement points).

The company says that they want you to #B.Valued and #B.Compensated fairly. The claim to pay for performance (thus justifying the low base salary).  But then if you look at internal salary discussions, you may either realize you are either making a lot more than others in your role, or a lot less. Usually it's less. 

The culture is supposed to be flat and open. So it should not be a problem to ask your manager or the leadership about the strange discrepancies between salaries and claims of fair and competitive pay. And it's not a problem to ask! Just don't expect a direct answer. Tech employees have been complaining about low salaries for years, and never received a straight answer. In general the answers boil down to ""you don't understand how lucky you are and how well you are paid"". The low salaries are justified by the low Dutch taxes applicable to expats.  Most people join Booking.com and wait until they get a Dutch passport, or until their low taxes expire - everyone knows this, but nobody, especially not the management, admits this.

While there are some truly talented and hard-working people, to grow fast and cheap the company hired many subpar people. Many of them are now Seniors, Managers and Product Owners. As a result, there is neither a good vision, nor a good execution of that vision, and people switch teams all the time to escape incompetent management."

Well, what do you expect when the last two C-level executives were fired due to the same problem. Although, it is much harder to do anything against mid-level management, since the target on their backs is way smaller, even though this is the level that causes the most damage. Good developers, designers and product owners are forced to leave, since they know their market value and can only waste so much.

However too much favouritism. Unless you don't fit into certain ethnic backgrounds hard to get promoted. Also if you attend every Freaky Friday/Social Event you are one of their favourites. Some staff have so much potential to be TL's and work so hard on their personal development even committing themselves out of their usual work schedule and doing more than required however management end up hiring 80% of TL's from outside who have no knowledge of procedures. Too many changes which do not even benefit anyone such a calling the TL line for advice. Most of the time they are not seen at their desk or do not know the answer. Understand they will receive training however when the change was implemented noticed that many TLs would avoid being at their desks or even being seen.

Need to stop focusing too much on statistics to measure ones performance. Just because one agent has near zero finalize does not make them better than another. Remember the Finalize Code is still productive (when used wisely). Also management too much on adherence. One cannot help going on break 2 minutes later than scheduled due to a lengthy call than can go on for more than 20 minutes. Not very professional to be told to inform the customer they will be called back. This comes from a Team Leader. All CSMs are of white origin. 

Management think a few sweets here and there and spin on the wheel will keep employees motivated.

10 minute Personal Time should be reviewed.

3472,Booking.com,Decadent monopoly,2018-04-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company is good for people coming from non-EU as a chance to live and work in a normal country. As the company is still considered big and successful it makes sense to have it on the resume. There is chance to learn how “big” companies work and gather experience. There are perks such as free lunch, monthly and yearly parties, but they are considered part of the total package (reduced from your salary). Many people complain that salaries are low, but if you look at total compensation per year it is about average.","As software developer is impossible to get work done, especially in frontend. Coding and software suddenly are least important part of your job here, no idea why are we interviewed you for it in the first place. You are encouraged to “communicate” and “think about customer” every day, which actually translates to “figure out how to make some sense out of this chaos we made here”. That is both in code and organizationally. There is constant pressure from product owners to improve the metrics and little creativity is left for people. Quarter after quarter there is panic in product organization to find ways to improve the metric. Metric, which is deeply broken, misunderstood and manipulated to create image of success. There is very little thinking on the long term product vision or the real customer needs. Development work is repetitive and uninspiring so many people feel low and demotivated. Frontend basically re-implements the same website for years now! Work conditions are crowded and noisy open spaces, impossible to get any concentration for actual work. There are literally hundreds of people working on same web page so chance of error and degree of conflict is high. What about testing? Naah.. that is not agile enough. Tasks are tiny and not challenging, you have to maintain impression of velocity and quality of code is nowhere. There is lot of A/B testing to “measure customer impact” but in fact it also prevents tech teams from making serious damage to the company,  which they would, due to general incompetence and lack of inspiration. As these tests can turn bad or don’t make a difference, you can just revert your hard work back. Delete, that is. Basically we “learned a lot” and you could have better stayed at home. People in tech get tired after 6 months of doing many tests each day, and they start to look for a way out. Either promotion or they want to move to different team hoping it is better. It is not. Some people also misunderstand this concept and try to achieve velocity what is expected hoping for high rewards, but chance of burnout is high.
As leader and manager it is possible to make progress, but it is not related to your effort or quality of work, it is related to circumstance and politics. If you are working hard you are wasting your time. It very much depends if your department is growing and relationship with your manager. Once you get promoted to lead or manager there is ton of repetitive work, performance calibration, administration and reports. There is actually very little meaningful work to do, unclear goals and limited chance to influence things. You will find your team members troubled and have difficulties and most of the time you will be their counselor helping them to preserve sanity in this organization. You will not have any good answers to give, and will be expected try to persuade your team member he is not seeing things right, and that this is actually a great company, it’s just they need to change. You may beat yourself to deliver on some vague project goal, and it will not be appreciated. Actually you can do exactly nothing, and it will be okay, nobody cares, as long as all the reports are made and placed in correct folders. Decisions are made on the top in the leadership team or in the product organisation, who knows, and you just execute the “vision”. Lot of the management work is to communicate unpopular bad decisions that someone else made, or “clarify” changes you don’t always believe in. All the good news will be shared from the higher level, you will just get the dirt. In recent times HR has recognized these problems and started to take over the core of the management by trying to fix it, by turning everything into a process, it is ridiculous, and as a manager will make your work even less meaningful and relevant. 
To reach the senior management is game of politics and tenure. If you have joined the company 10 years ago there is high chance you can be in senior leadership or being a principal. It is not related to capacity, education or work ethics. If you have obvious qualities, ethics and potential you will be marginalised and given something to grind in the corner. These people are jealous and sensitive to healthy competition. Leadership is incapable of delivering on promises, even the interesting projects that have actual potential get somehow ruined by incompetence and we have another case of “learning from failure” aka “we learned a lot”. Chance to work on anything interesting or fun is very low. Job satisfaction depends on how well you play the game. For most techy people job is very boring and frustrating running in circles aka “work horses”, which is what you are actually expected to do.
Culture wise company suffers from rapid growth and dissolution of ethics. People initially are implicitly made to believe that they can make it and get rich fast as the company notably gives ridiculous high rewards, but in reality you better be in the “club” of the “right” people. Bias towards certain ethnicities and nationalities is high. There are many problems and there is very little real action on those and accountability for making things better. There are some presentations that the company “cares”, such as all hands, fish bowls and etc., but the topics discussed and proposed solutions evaporate from present leaders as soon as the meeting ends. Follow up is not done. The only discussion might be on how to manage the noise and find out the sources. As an employee, you may temporarily feel better after such a meeting, yet to find same topics and discussion repeat in 6 months. In 5 years I have never seen anyone get fired or de-ranked for incompetence, or failing to deliver, but promoted to different project, yes. It seems that there is little capacity to think critically and maintaining status-quo is encouraged. You can benefit a lot if you have talent to explain same things over and over and make it look like progress! People are great once they join everyone is very enthusiastic, until they realise that reality differs from what is served. Disappointment and frustration hit around after 2 years when many people leave, so there is constant churn in tech and general sense of instability. Sense of chaos is made worse by constant re-orgs which don’t change anything other than giving some people chance to take some positions or make someone look better - that is it. There is no measure of success, no accountability, and they never got rolled back even if it was obviously making things worse. Not a single time.
What makes this company a lost case is difference between sad reality and how some of higher leaders talk and think. There is no critical judgement or decency, as you will find inflated egos trying to rationalize their narcissism and find approval for it from others. If you are onboard with that you have a great future, you just have to stomach it somehow. Announcements, all hands, and deep dives are meaningless, as it becomes obvious how many layers of manipulation and dodgy logic are smeared on top of some of the carefully crafted propaganda messages. The sane and decent people don’t last long here, now the only question is how each one normal person deals with this reality, and how one should proceed with their unfortunate life."

You will easily find some stupid and incapable colleagues get promoted out of nowhere since they are good at office politics. As a result, lot of good employees with hidden potentials will be leaving this place to be more appreciated with their actual efforts and talent on work. Company is extremely micromanaging employees and pushing to them limit although they are already exposed to suffocating environment from both customer and managements. You are forced to put your personal effort decorating office for welcoming higher managements traveling from Headquarter in Amsterdam. Wow, you guys are exactly same as North-Korea hailing Kim JeongEun with parade of missiles and soldiers. Instead of doing that kindergarden stuff, higher management really need to support your employees and pick up the phone together to figure out what's really going on inside your business. 

Among high managements in Singapore office, there is one team leader who are most amazing human being that I've seen in my entire life. It is still so mysterious how this stupid woman could be promoted and manage colleagues. This woman always bring books such as 'how to be a good leader' and doing exactly opposite to it which is so scary. Just talking to this women is extremely stressing and her stupidity will bully you mentally forever as long as you are working under her.

- Free fruit (1 piece per person)
- Staff discount
- Multicultural environment
- You can do shift swaps.
- Working at weekends and after 7pm has a special rate per hour.","- Practically impossible to get promoted unless you are friends' with management.
- Very repetitive job
- Most of the time there is not a balance between being on ready (on the phone) and picklist (emails) which means that a lot of agents will be the majority of the time on the phone, and some others (specially smaller language lines such as Turkish or Danish) all the time on emails. Still, all the language lines have the same KPIs and same salary even though the amount of workload is not the same at all.
- A lot of owners that register their properties with us do not get proper training. This is because there are more accounts getting opened than people who provide training (aka coordinators). What matters here is to reach the 2M properties, quantity over quality... Then most of the calls you will receive are because the partners (property owners) are clueless due to lack of training or just because they are not computer literate as there is not any type of filter or criteria to join Booking.com
- Some agents do not have a good level on their second language which results in customers' frustration. We have had customers calling us because the message they received from Booking.com had a lot of grammar mistakes and misspellings. 
- There are a lot of changes going on and they do not tend to be communicated properly which causes lots of confusion and misunderstandings.
- They expect you to have a 80% partner or customer satisfaction (PSAT or CSAT) even though people who call you tend to rate the company and/or the outcome rather than the service you provide. This has been raised with Team Leaders but not much has changed.
- Micromanagement. Your TL will push you to get to a certain target (sometimes even expect you to do more) because they will have their CSM (Customer Service Manager) pestering them, and so on and so forth. Very target based, not focusing on people's skills but their stats and figures.
- It feels like you are in High School again. Very controlling environment. Every call is recorded and if you are in the wrong code, you will get a call from a RTC (Real Time Coordinator) to ""kindly"" remind you that you are not in the right code. Similarly, if one week you don't meet one of the targets you get a slap on the wrist from your TL without even allowing yourself to give an explanation.
- Your experience in Booking.com totally depends on your TL. It could be a bliss or an absolute nightmare depending if s/he likes you or not.
- If you don't mingle with your team enough or go to the team outings (or any social event) you are seen as an outcast and are frowned upon.
- Bad communication between departments. At Customer and Accommodation Service we deal with different topics such as invoicing, reviews, content, registrations... and getting in touch with the right department can be an odyssey. When you forward messages to some of them, it may take them several days or even weeks to get any type of response.
- Some of the TLs are clueless and unaware what customer service agents deal with everyday. However, they are very unempathethic and push people over the limit.
- If you are sick/late 3 times over a period of a year, you are required to attend a formal meeting and could be a reason for dismissal. You will still have this meeting even if you have talked to your TL about it and the reasons are justified properly.
- Computers are very slow and can take you up to 10 mins to log in into one for the first time, and this will happen often as there is a hot desk policy in place."

3484,Booking.com,This company has lost its way,2018-04-10,1.0,Product Owner,The environment is an international one. There are some great people working really hard.,"This is an awful company to work for. It has stagnated, it is in a state of panic devoid of any clear direction and many, many people are in a state varying between numb, angry and sad. The executive leadership team is made of teflon. It’s a mess and while many can see this, few understand how a company that is doing so poorly in both spirit and results can leave these people untouched and blame free.
 
The supposed innovation hub, the teams who will take Booking.com into its next golden age, sit in an actual ivory tower in a separate building. This is where the true work takes place. Here is where you’ll find the real product geniuses. Unfortunately, their genius is only legend; as of yet many are still waiting to witness it. This org has been set up to never have to interact with people who have actually touched the product before or may have been around a while, or indeed anyone who might challenge them on direction. They play by a different set of rules due to their (secret) product super powers so they don’t have to show progress or talk to anyone outside of their bubble. Due to their arrogance, many prefer this. Their original innovation weapon of choice and one revealed with such pomp and circumstance was based on giving stuff to people for free but they forgot that this involved numbers, math and actual careful thought and because no one had worked that part out it all went horribly wrong. The mess was quietly swept under the carpet without any pomp or circumstance or reflection or talk of learning, and no one spoke of it again. Now it is the constant surveying of tired and fed up customers who just want to book a room for a family of four but don’t understand our website and don’t understand why we can’t stop screaming at them with intrusive messaging. They ask vapid obvious questions and largely ignore what the results say so that they can just execute whatever the so called product VPs running the show want. No one is really sure what success looks like, either in the org or outside of it.  Nothing significant has been achieved in over 2.5 years of work in the area nor is it close to being. Although perhaps adding breakfast to the confirmation page was a real high-five, crack-out-the-champagne product win. We could hear the back slapping across town. KPIs, results and any actual progress would surely reveal the sorry state this innovation hub is in so these stay well buried. The strategy, however, is rolled out time and time again in company meetings and events.  The audience is numb to it and no longer asks questions but does their bit to keep up the Emperor’s New Clothes charade. Everyone in that room knows it’s all smoke and mirrors and the corridor chatter is harsh.

The leadership team are leaders in name only. They comprise of a group of individuals so out of their depth, so incompetent and so uninspiring it is truly staggering. They ride on the coat-tails of the company’s past success and pat themselves on the back for jobs well done while we stand in awe of how little they have actually achieved and how much damage they are inflicting on their departments. When they do a truly bad job, they often get rewarded with greater responsibility. They think they are doing everyone a service when they come out for yet another redundant All Hands or quarterly business meeting yet these trite appearances are usually met with eye-rolling, mockery or pure anger since they never actually answer a question. Because they don’t want to or can’t simply because they don’t have the EQ to understand the questions being asked of them is up for debate. A real high moment was when the millionaires were sat on the stage and heartily laughed at a question posted about why people are paid so poorly at the company. It’s easy to laugh at anything when you’ve got that much money in the bank.

People are rarely managed or developed and this is widely acknowledged across multiple levels and strata of the company. This is because the senior management team hate…management. They are the worst managers out there and some of them actively avoid contact with their direct reports. It is disgusting. As a result the safe ones who execute their dirty work or the better drinking buddies get further and further up the food chain. Vague sentiments about what they’ve achieved are lorded via company’s biggest time wasting facebook at work platform while fake congratulations are doled out by colleagues who are generally just scratching their heads in utter bemusement.

Performance reviews, when they bother to do them, are painfully awkward because they are based almost entirely on nothing. The employee writes most of it themselves then reads it aloud while a vacant manager mainly just sits there nodding. Self reflection is fine and necessary but a review is a two-way street. Occasionally they will chime in with the most benign and generic advice possible. You gratefully accept either their criticism or praise just to get it over with but inside screaming “how are you paid this much money to have no original insight and no ability to challenge me in any way?” Then it dawns on you that they haven’t seen you in months, they’ve not bothered to speak to anyone else who has been working with you so their one contribution to the review is one (usually biased) data point that has lost all relevance. Plus they just don’t care and are as eager to get it over with as you are. If you challenge them on this you will be seen as ‘difficult’ and unable to reflect so best to keep it to yourself. 

Anyone who has woken up to what this company is and has become will be tarred with being too cynical or not being able to keep up with the company’s pace of growth. This is just a further excuse that allows those at the top to sleep a little better at night."

Be prepared to be stressed, to be yelled at by customers and still expect to remember the 1000 things you have to say in a call after 7 hours, keep your metrics up, don't have human interactions with other teams because you get distracted and try to get liked, otherwise they will hunt you like a dog to find any mistakes you made.

3503,Booking.com,A company without conviction,2018-03-27,1.0,Product Lead,"Some people are excellent, tirelessly working to improve the product for the customer.","This is a company without conviction. A company that has truly lost its way. Here are a few of the reasons why.

The leadership team are dominated by a Dutch cabal of naive, ridiculously fortunate people who have removed themselves from direct contact with the product and people. The incongruity of them parading their badge of humbleness along with their celebrity status at events is lost on them. 

Having never led a business through any serious challenges and bereft of ideas, the current strategy is as ill thought as it is limiting. 

The CPO is dangerous. It beggars belief that he has risen to this level given his paucity of industry experience. He excels at giving an opinion with both an absence of wisdom and a lack of conviction. He appears to be labouring under a mistaken belief that reading a few business books will raise him on a par with industry product design champions. 
He is widely known for the cynical removal of experienced product leaders who might have challenged him, the avoidance of accountability and an utter disregard for his direct reports. However, he does like a drink, so opportunities for career growth can be found outside the office with a willingness to plump up his ego and play to his insecurities. 

It aids him greatly that the CEO has zero interest or capability for product insight and vision. Instead she trots out vague sentiments heavily laced with company nostalgia. This is not inspiring. 

Some people are pretty good. You’d expect that in a company of this size but every one who racks up a decent tenure here has their own list of shocks and weird stuff that happens. Be it poor decision making, inappropriate behaviour against women, volte face reinvention of bad ideas or the uncanny, continual meetings where people talk in a clunky mix of meaningless business jargon and plain balderdash. 

Restructures are common, these keep several tiers of managers in their jobs. There is a lot of busy work. Most managers and leaders of the technology teams may have once been competent developers but are now responsible for people management. That they are woefully under schooled in this, especially in the critical skill of good old fashioned empathy, is another marker of promoting people beyond their emotional intelligence. 
With a deeply political environment do not expect promotions will have a rational or equate with demonstrable ability. 

For all the desperate promotion of the company values, the massive growth of recruitment led to dissolution of the culture and radical dilution of experience. The hiring bar was surprisingly low for a very long time. 

This perspective is not an outlier. It’s recognised by most who have spent at least a couple of years here. There are many, many people clocking in and checked out. All waiting for another windfall from vested stock. Plenty of people are looking over their shoulder to check they are still under the radar. You can drift, you can collect the salary and you can hide. It’s a shame because there are still those who really want to make a difference.  Some more cynical folks rub their hands in glee at the thought of the company being subpoenaed to release archives of internal communications. There is so much gold. 

Meanwhile, the delusion of a hive of innovation persists in desperate attempts to build out new product ranges. These are woeful in their conception and implementation. Further evidence of an anti-Midas product lead. With nothing of worth or impact being delivered the illusion of success is masterfully presented. It is all smoke and mirrors. 

The company has a collective amnesia on how to build a valued and effective product from the ground up but it is brilliant at finessing a mature product lathered with persuasive patterns (continually straying over the ethical line), monetising the traffic and selling hotel rooms in established regions. 

On the factory floor, the tropes of being data driven are reductionist as the dogma approaches dangerous levels . Citing persistent customer feedback or indeed voicing an empathy for the customer falls on fallow ground. 

Expertise in the analysis of data is presumed by everyone yet practised by a few. Target chasing of a pointless metric has led to decisions that have crippled the product yet the rise of customer dissatisfaction remains ignored. If the line goes up to the right everyone is happy. 

Good tools in the wrong hands has led to the wrong metrics being measured and sometimes these aren’t even measured accurately. Collect all the data you like, if you can’t interpret, apply insight or try to understand why something is happening then you are left with the fallacy of being data driven whilst your short term success is built on sand. 

The company is moribund but such is its size the death throes will not be realised for years. There are better places to work."

Our engineering function seems to have a real sense of community with a properly thought out and achievable career progression structure. Some of the management in engineering are great but sometimes fall victim to the constant changing priorities in the business.

Pretty open working environment where people for the most part speak their mind - even if if we don't get listened to. 

Staff in the contact centre are actually treated like people, which is great. I've seen many places where they're just employee numbers to be moved about.

Nice offices and in the centre of the city, some of the rooms are a bit rubbish to actually use due to rubbish furniture but most rooms have audio & video, a conference phone, writeable walls and whiteboard pens. 

Relatively open environment where everyone knows whats going on in the business - if we're ahead or behind. We have quarterly get togethers as as business to see its performance and we're given opportunity to ask hard hitting questions which our directors will answer.

Free beer on a Fridays once a month if thats your kind of thing.

We support local tech community meetups, I think we're hosting maybe 5 on a regular basis now and people keep adding more.

For the majority it isn't really a place where you'll be working for more than 40 hours a week (but that depends on the area).","The product area in the business is completely broken. I can see that most people in that area of product are unhappy and stressed out, whether you are a UX Designer, Insight Analyst or Product Owner. This is mostly down to the constant crunch management style. If you are currently the one in focus you very much feel it. We never really celebrate success and as soon as we have a win, its straight onto the next fire we have to put out. 

Pointless meetings that have mandatory attendance - our community is massive now and they are often a waste of time. 

Conflicting targets and priorities, engineering might have some goals one quarter and product might have another. This not only causes internal conflict within the product teams themselves but conflict between teams. Its very hard to collaborate and push the BookingGo strategy when there is so much conflict in goals. Whilst i have a great relationship with my colleagues in my product team, as a community its becoming toxic.  There isn't a ""we're doing this for the company"" vibe, its all ""we're doing this to meet our own targets and get people off our back""' workplace. 

A lot of autonomy has been removed from the teams. You are often asked to do something and then asked again, and again, and again until you do it with no opportunity to discuss it. Management say they don't tell you what to do, but they handle things in such a way that it becomes next to impossible not to do it. 

Completely shifting goals - what is important in the business at this moment in time might be gazumped by something else within a matter of weeks. This means it makes it very difficult to actually deliver anything of value, or expected growth of certain teams doesn't happen. Some teams have lost out on backfils for people who have left because of those priority changes but are still expected to deliver those really stretching results. 

We focus way too much on short term wins instead of strategic long time opportunities. This is starting to change somewhat as we've broken our into ground transport - but the bread and butter of the business is short term rewards. I don't actually feel like i've delivered much value during my time in the business vs other places I have worked out. 

Seems to be a real variance in people who are stretched and people who aren't. I regular work 50 hour weeks with meetings booked in until 6pm, yet other areas in the business definitely aren't feeling this pressure."

Some team leaders under investigation for sexual harassment

Team leaders and certain senior managers getting too drunk at the freaky fridays and are basically embarrassing themselves in front of their own agents

Some senior managers are either socially awkward (totally not fit to do a people management job) or they think they are the captain of the army by terrorising their team leaders. I have overheard team leaders talk in the kitchen on how stressed and unsatisfied they are.

Unrealistic targets. I think that team leaders and senior managers should do a full week of ""taking customer calls"" to finally understand how ridiculous their targets are. 

Sometimes team leaders are expected to help their agents by handling customer emails during busy seasons, but team leaders avoid it because they think it's beneath them.

The system that collects performance data is often down or shows wrong data. It makes no sense that the company expects agents to reach their targets if the systems are unreliable.

You will be promoted if you go to enough beers with your manager, or you are Dutch or a Woman who travels all the time, you are in the grace of one of the directors and you are not a Person of Color.

Show Pony Culture: Hard workers are critically evaluated while social chill club organizers rake in top bonuses or top performer rewards. Sorry, the company doesn't function by people writing Facebook posts and attending conferences. It functions more by people writing code. In this company, the easiest way to find out who is about to get promoted is by looking around and seeing who is traveling and who is writing lengthy Facebook posts.

Nepotism: Please make your promotion process a bit transparent? Being a favorite or having a friend in management can help you climb very quickly. Some people get promoted in 4 months, yes 4 months while others are stuck with a so-called ""core"" role for a decade."

- good perks","- The probation is extremely long (6 months) and it is up to your Team Leader to decide whether it will be renewed or not (meaning if you two don't get along, you will either say "" Good Bye"" or accept to be renewed unfairly 
- Your experience depends on your Team Leader and nothing is done to minimise this
- There is an unfair hierarchy contradictory to what you're told regarding feedbacks to your colleagues and if you make the mistake to feedback a Senior, you end up having a meeting 
- Your stats are known not to be accurate but still, they count to judge your job and sack you if necessary. All agents complain about the questionnaire sent to the guest as being unfair since the guests often judge the company rather than the agent, but NOTHING is done. 
- What you're told when hired is NOT what will happen. Everyone is told that they will work one weekend in a month and not very late. Most of us started on late shifts (meaning you finish at midnight) and work at least 2 weekends in a month 
- I know someone who was told by a hotel that the hotel didn't want to speak to a Muslim agent (!) and when the agent spoke to the team leader about it, both the team leader and the quality coach sided with the hotel and blamed the agent asking how the situation could have been prevented
- The recruitment process is not good, they don't test your abilities to type PROPER and PROFESSIONAL emails 
- We have to deal with agents outside the company who do very poor but yet, nothing is done and we're told to feedback them although it doesn't change anything.

I, along with the company, went from strength to strength and I owe a lot of my learning and progression to this place. It always had a fantastic culture and a really enjoyable family environment.

I thoroughly enjoyed the first 3 years of my employment. I went through multiple promotions and always felt like myself and my work were appreciated. 

The product team structure, initially, worked well and the ever present idea of cross-functional teams was efficient for delivering work.

Senior Management we’re a great bunch of people and excelled at company communications, though sometimes things specific to a department could be more cryptic, secretive and sudden, to detrimental effect.","Sadly over the course of the last 6+ months of my employment, that started to change significantly. 

New Senior roles were created, to detrimental effect, owing to the accompanying attitudes of individuals, within the product world and unfair expectations placed on individuals. 

Reporting lines became blurred and professions that should be equal partnerships started reporting into each other, making certain areas of the business inferior and at the behest of others. 

Despite my continued success and feeling of appreciation over the previous years, I know felt pushed out, backed into a corner, under valued and underrated. It was as if newcomers to the business built an instant picture of me based on limited exposure and stuck to it. 

Morale across the team was down, significantly, and so many conversations in and around work turned sour and talked about everything that was now wrong with the company. 

It’s a real shame because so much has been done at a company level to try and improve the culture across the business— and that’s been great work! But, ultimately, all of that has been overwritten and made redundant by the fact other influencers within the product environment have made the culture so bad. 

I did think the compensation package was good, and I guess it wasn’t bad. However, upon leaving I’ve realised there are much better compensation packages available! 

Senior management would get a higher rating in my following scores, had it not been for recent changes."

- Poor salary compared to competitors (much below Warsaw average)
- Very little choice of benefits in comparison to other big companies
- Every year before Christmas some people are getting fired (especially in 2017!) without any serious reson. They have been picked by Management because they just simply did not like them.  The process of fireing people is just humiliating and takes unsuspecting employees by surprise. 
- Working enviroment is just destructive and getting worse,  due to Management. Employees are just often affraid and SCARRED of it, no one even dares to give a motivational feedback either to Management  ( which is STRONGLY required from all employees) just because people are afraid that they will be fired afterwards. 
- Management requires that we give each other feedback, but Management will regard it as a personal attack if the feedback is given to them
- Seniors' management style is immature! They have no idea how to manage people. There is no way to have your own opinion as Seniors want to hear only what they think (or their managers told them to think), and if you differ with your opinion they will tell you that you do not follow the companies' values. Naturally it will most likely affect your quarterly review, which has impact on your Bonus. In result if you want to have bonus you HAVE to flatter them
- Management is two-faced especially seniors who tell you one thing and then something totally different to Area Manager just to cover for themselves
- No prospect of advancement or promotion within the Polish office, from time to time there are some senior positions opened but you get very little pay increase for any of those promotions"

3570,Booking.com,Non technical managers are ruining the company,2018-02-16,1.0,Software Development Engineer,"Great relocation to Amsterdam.
Amsterdam is a beautiful city, living with the Dutch is amazing!
Some developers are smart (they usually don't stick around sadly)","The way I see it, there are those who work here, and love it. There are those who hate it. It depends upon your core values and belief system. If you are honest/hard working developer, you won't like it here. If you are incompetent, and can BS your way to non technical managers about your ""make-believe"" technical difficulties,  you'll love it. 

I've seen coders, who have hardly write 10 lines of code in a quarter, and these people have figured a way to game the system, and get promoted. 

My team lead manages a team of software developers, but does not write a single line of code, never worked as a programmer. Why write clean code, when you slap 2000 lines of Perl and get it done? (About code reviews... if you review code, it's a sure shot way to get kicked out of the team). 

Promotions are not done on the basis of who works hard, but based on how much you suck upto your bosses. You cannot speak your mind out, without the risk of retaliation. 

If you read reviews on the internet, you'll hear people say they do monitoring, and that's something Booking does very well. Wrong!! 

Some teams don't get enough volume of visitors/users to test edge cases on production. We pray things don't break when we release it.  

Mid management is completely incompetent. If you are thinking of moving from your third world country like how I did, please remember there are tons of great European tech companies that would value your engineering practices, Booking isn't one of them. Amsterdam is a great city, but working for Booking.com hurts your career."

2. Transparency 

3.  Free lunch

4. Familiar communication tool for everybody

5. Generous annual leaves + special leaves","1. Too many changes. There were updates every week. Too many experiments. It is ok the company changes their policies and system and try some experiments to improve the services. The problem is CS agents becomes the sacrifice of those experiments and changes as partners and customers call and complain when they do not like them. Besides, as there are too many of changes and test when CS receives the complaints, we also do not know what they are talking about(the website CS is looking and the website the customer is looking can be different cos the test does not apply to all users). 
Sometimes, the website contents are already changed when Booking.com CS internal system and agents are not ready. When customers contact us, we cannot answer them but apologize multiple times. 

2. CS does not get rewarded/compensated or recognized. 

3. No Bam trip - Only selected ppl(very few) can go to Bam from CS whereas most of all ppl from other departments can go to Bam. They can even extend the trip when CS  cannot extend the trip at all. We do understand CS team need to stay and work due to business needs unlike other departments, but no special reward for it.

4. Micromanagement - You have no idea

5. Managers - lucky or unlucky. Some are very nice, and some are horrible. You will get a lot of stress from customers, you don't want the manager adding up your stress. No consistency. You will just need to pray for the good manager. 

6. HQ seems to have all the career opportunities. 


Overall, I think Booking.com is a good company if you are not in CS. Ppl in CS are dying to find another jobs and leave.  If you are in HQ, you will have opportunities to move to other departments. Otherwise, very difficult."

- Social events
- Nice office in a well transports linked area
- Extra money when working on week-ends, early, late, etc..
- Good budget for team outings
- Good name on the CV
- Eyecare voucher and refund","- Do not expect any progression unless you are from the UK, Eastern Europe, Italy, or Spain. All the seniors and managers are from those listed countries.

- When they hire you, they told you there's a possibility to evolve after 9 months in the company, but when the time comes, the manager has the possibility to refuse your application, especially if you are not in his/her paper.

- You have to fake everything with everyone if you want to progress 

- Everything is monitored. If you are finalising an e-mail, and your break has started since 5min but you forgot to change your log-in code, someone will call you to ask to change that. And not always, let's say never in a polite way.. 
Once, my break was over since 2min and I was in the kitchen, someone called and I missed it, when I came back, the person went to my desk and said something like ""next time I call you you better reply"" .. Well sorry the coffee machine was busy !

- They are using your weaknesses against you. You will feel like they cares about you, because they want you to confide, but then, they will use it to dismiss you, or to make comments about you with the others team mate or team leader (you can tell by the way suddenly everybody looks at you) 

- If you are shy, or not in the mood (which can happen sometimes), they will think that you are disinterested and will take you to some training  room where everybody can see your (next to the canteen), where it's overwhelmed, and there's someone watching behind your back

- Everything is recorded, so whenever you have an issue with someone (staff/partner/client) you should send an e-mail straight away to your team leader otherwise this will be used against you in a meeting.

- They can dismiss you after 3 call-in sick, so basically, forgot about having a flu and go to work even if you are dying at your desk. What's funny though, is that if you are the manager friend, you can be sick few times, you won't get any meeting at all.

- Colleagues can leave feedbacks to each other, and it's the best way to make issues bigger than what they are. This is used against you, especially when you want to apply to a higher position.

- If you worked for the Customer department, you can't apply for a position within the Accommodation department because you know too much.

- No general email are sent when there's updates on the procedures (but be sure you will receive some when there's events at the HQ) so you have to follow everything on workplace (Facebook for the company)

- On workplace, if you comment something and it is reported, you can get a disciplinary meeting and get dismissed.

- We never received our written confirmation that we passed the 6 months probation, after 8 months within the company, only an oral confirmation, and so they used this to fire you whenever they want because there's no proof you passed that probation.. Smart eh ? 

- If you are not going at every events, be sure there's no progression for you.

- Always be sure to have another solution as soon as you think things are getting worse, because you can be fired without further notice, which gives people (sometimes with families) hard times to pay the bills, eat, the time they find something else.
If you are fired, you have to go back to your desk, with the manager, and get all your stuff in front of everyone. Lovely. Absolutely not humiliating at all.

- If they want to get rid of you, they will, they will find some excuses or some mistakes you did months ago and will used this against you. And obviously, you do not have access to what they have against you.

- The company has a huge turn-over, they do not care about people, as they are hiring every week. Not surprise why half of new hires left the company before the end of their probation

- Unsocial hours. Sometimes you can finish at 10pm, then start at 7am the very next day, and if you complain, be careful ! you can also work 10 days in a row, and no one will care.

- You can not plan having holidays months in advance. You can only book few days for the month coming. Example : In January, you can book days off for March, in February you can book for April, etc etc, but you are usually waitlisted for few days, even weeks !
In July I asked for 4 days in the middle of September, I had the approval for these days the beginning of September, and so the tickets to go home were overpriced. 

- The Team Leader are mainly external and so not trained on what agents do, they don't know about the software nor the procedure, and have to ask someone else almost everytime. Being a team leader here is just sticking stuff on a board, and having meeting reading powerpoint made by someone else.

- The open space is crowded and you do not even have the right to sit somewhere else if it is not your team space.

- People are screaming over the phone, sometimes taking of their shoes or eating stinky food at their desk, but that's alright !

- Only 30min lunch (for shift of 8 hours and more you are entitled to one hour break. Here it's 15min break in the morning, 1 hour lunch, 15min break in the afternoon. Obviously you do not choose when are the breaks)

- Phone and personal use of the computer are forbidden, except you're a team leader, a senior, or a friend of the management. 

- Targets are ridiculous. Quantity over quality.

- overpriced pension (like 60 per month, then you're a little above the minimum wage, lovely) and you do not even have the choice.

- Promotions are random.. Someone from Time Management (the one who calls you if you're not following the good phone code) can become a Team Leader without experience as an agent."

-Colleagues are for most very welcoming when you start and along the months/years, you can make very good friends. It counts when you don’t speak french and when you’re a foreigner landing here without knowing anyone.

-If customer service is your thing and like to work in a fast work place with plenty of different nationalities, you might like it.
-You work 35 hours per week which is less than agents of other offices in Europ
-Office environment is not too bad but very noisy at time. You won’t be cold during winter nor too hot during summer (don’t know what else to say guys, sorry …. !)","I feel like I work for a new company every week due to lot of changes in procedures and system. don’t see it as negative to be honest, but they happen so quickly and with minimum information given before hand (sometimes none.) that guests will be the ones informing you of things booking does rather than the opposite. Take it easy and smile !. Oh, and, don’t be sick or off holidays, or it will take several weeks to catch up.

-The workload can sometimes be very intense and even overwhelming. Be ready to face abusive customers who will not hesitate to use insults when not happy with the conditions of their bookings or from accommodations owners who are fed up. Do not forget to come with your tissues as, if you’re the type who can hold tears, you’ll see how they will be useful for others.

-My team leader look after me (for my case at least). Generally, these people are good but not all are very knowledgeable. They are available if we need help. When I arrived in the company, I was lucky to have one who even help me with personal things and facilitated my integration in france and believe me, it can be a nightmare (for instance when needed to register to bank or to local health insurance. Nice stuff). I’m also lucky to be in a team where everyone helps each other. But watch out as low performance are not tolerated. You still tend to be warned before hell falls on you.

- System is inconsistent and we have loads of problems (also with phones). When reporting one, it can take a long time to fix. Just inform guests to be patient! … Rrrright !

- Work schedule changes every week and this can be tiring. Be always careful t check it to make sure you don't come on day off ! You will work some weekends but you will be double paid on Sunday.

- We are evaluated with targets and on performance. It seems to me it is more if you don't complain about anything. I don’t understand as every so often, the targets change and we need to work on a specific target and then change again while we have not yet completed the initial instruction. This last sentence might not make sense, well… to me neither don’t worry. It explains everything !

- After several years here in Tourcoing office, I’d say (and maybe most would agree) that the work atmosphere has recently worsen at light speed.

Director changed few years ago and a new management team was created several months ago. And… guess what, if it was not great before, I would not be surprised if our office would now be awarded with the worst work environment ever super hard gold medal. But don’t worry, you won’t see them often unless your station is on the ground floor where they are hidden from the real world. They will still keep in touch with the “floor” by posting messages, on our internal facebook, destroying your mental health and trying hard to play employees off against each other. Don’t know if the big directors in Amsterdam are aware (I cannot imagine they are or they will do something) but if were they will totally not believe how we are all badly treated. People recently got sacked for things that you don’t understand and more than anything, in an inhuman way in front of all colleagues. Director doesn't care about anything. He raises his voice against employees (I witnessed it and I would not have liked to be talked as such).

I feel pretty safe (I hope I am actually) as I never say much nor complain at work because it would quite difficult for me to find another job around anyway.

Overall, it was a good company to work before. Work was not harder before but ambiance, god, it was.

If you want to apply, a website called workatbooking give you the positions available.

The opportunity to attend the annual meeting in Amsterdam is really fun - however it is not guaranteed and still promoted as part of your overall comp/benefits. Free monthly lunches and team socials were nice.,"The base salary is very low - don't let them tell you otherwise! Management will say that they are on par with the market and data was studied but will not explain any further.  So you are left to blindly accept them at their word. They will include other benefits in your overall deal but they are standard and often not monetary so it doesn't help you with your actual life. If you can tell me how to invest apples and pay your rent in coffee, I would love to know the secret!

Bonus structures can change at any time and will become increasingly hard to achieve. 

If you are not part of the in crowd, you will go absolutely nowhere in the company. Just like high school, it's a popularity contest to see who they will invite to sit at their table.  Managers even have the same inflated sense of power and importance as a 16 year mean girl.

The company expects cult like  devotion and adoration from all employees. They will find various ways to mold and shape you into what they want - carbon copies of the same person who stare blankly, do what they are told without question and passionately display adoration during team meetings and sessions. Don't drink the kool aid!

Managers in Toronto and the NA Office Team senior team management are wolves in sheep's clothing.  At first they will appear friendly and will encourage you to open up to them and feel free to speak up. WARNING - Do not confide in them, never challenge them or speak up in any way that does not align with their plans.  Doing so will create a target on your back - they will find ways to make your job more difficult, you will suddenly be told you are under performing during 1:1s or reviews, placed on performance improvement plans, and asked to consider whether the job is the right fit for you.  They will incessantly harass and bully you, find non-existent problems to blame you for, and ignore any of your achievements because they do not like you - not because of your job performance. It has forced great employees to leave so that they can work in a place where they are treated fairly and with simple respect.  

There is an expectation to do anything and everything you are asked of regardless of your own workload or if the person asked last minute. which often happens. You are seen as not being a team player if you don't always say yes.  

You will learn a lot but will have no where to apply your knowledge/skills. There are little to no opportunities for promotions at a local level. If there are promotions, they are not given to the right people : external from the company or not from the local office, unqualified, unprofessional, and immature. Basically an employee would only be promoted because a higher manager liked them more than other candidates and not based on professional merit.  

Managers in the Toronto office will gossip among each other and continue to play favourites. Also, it is often a very uncomfortable and unprofessional environment when some managers decide to speak in another language while others are present and part of the conversation. Just plain rude.

The office team is expected to do many tasks that will not be recognized, rewarded or compensated. They are often the tasks that don't fit neatly into someone else's role and it gets dumped onto the local Office Manager.  Upper management of the Office team is a joke - they are unqualified, have no people management skills and act like a clique."

The first 2 weeks of training in the classroom is very good and you learn a lot quickly, then you are just thrown into the phones, email, livechat and it can be overwhelming. There needs to be something between classroom and on the job training because although staff are available for support you loose confidence that has been built up in the class room and can feel out of your depth.

Sometimes it can feel that some management are quite 'clicky' which makes it difficult if you feel you are not getting enough support and need more help.

The multilingual, multicultural diversity among staff members is awesome.","All your calls are recorded. ALL of them.
Customer service executives are encouraged to put - and keep - callers on hold, because it benefits the statistics (not the customers, or actual solution quality). 
The organisation prides itself for being young, and in that culture some people in leadership positions forget or simply fail to treat employees as adults. The immature culture this breeds starts grating after a while, especially when you find yourself spoken to like a child, or feeling unsupported as a member of staff in times of need (calling in sick 3 times in a year leads to disciplinary meetings and possible dismissal, even to employees getting injured in accidents or suffering from cancer). 
A lack of mature people combined with extreme focus on processing as many calls as quickly as possible does not benefit high-quality, genuinely empathetic customer service. 
The first few weeks in customer service, when you're still in training, you'll feel supported and coached. After that, you get reminded of your performance stats almost daily, which feels like doom hanging over you all throughout your six months (or more!) probation. 
Personal use of company computers is understandably restricted, but you are expected to fill up your personal smartphone with all the apps the company pushes on you to monitor your schedule and keep up with internal news and updates, and keep up with your team's group WhatsApp.
You're expected to show this loyalty and commitment to the company, but the company doesn't show much of it back - it just thinks it does, by way of posting inspirational quotes on Facebook for Work and covering offices in posters for endless in-work and after-work events."

Toxic environment, office politics are more important than actual competences. 
Very bad and uninspiring TLs, only able to micromanage people, gossiping about colleagues and their team members among them and making decorations and stupid games during frequent, mostly useless team meetings. 
Cult-like environment, unclear and grey rules, hypocrital attitude, PC culture and tokenism at its best. Only desperate people and brown nosers can fit here.

- Immature and just plain BAD management, especially on team-level. People get promoted to TL positions just because they've been working at the company a bit longer than others or because of plain favoritism.
- Challenging each other goes as far as people at your own level (and not always)! If you try to challenge or argue a point with someone a bit higher than you, you're doomed. Especially if you are a female who tries to challenge a male... good luck with that! 
- No guidelines, no consistency, no design procedures in place and with 200+ designers working on  the same product, CHAOS is what you're going to have to face working there. Only recently the head of design department is trying to create some sort of guidelines and tools for internal use.
- Good work goes usually unnoticed and if you don't parade it around to own it, someone else will get the credit for you!

Overall... if you have a chance to work here and you're in your early steps in your career,  take the opportunity to learn from a large scale organization, get as much as possible and then move on.

It used a great place to work but all the management is changed and now it a full of non techies running the show. 

Expect things like super strict work timings, 8 hours excluding lunch hours. 

Working from home is a luxury only available when your house is on fire or be prepared to be scrutinized. They don’t believe in people doing their best work at different hours. Very tight on these as of end of year 2017 and made it super hard to work. You will find many of your colleagues complaining and planning to leaving soon.

mostly micro management from middle management is driving this place to the ground. Soon this is turning from tech company to an online sales front.

There are no such thing as perks for working here. The bonus is heavily dependent on you reviews and this is controlled by the manager in your team, so guess how that goes if you step on the wrong toe or stand for your rights! Not even lunch is free, it’s from your salary!

The tech stack is not something I want to get into, read other reviews.

The pay isn’t competitive in any way with companies of the same scale. Tax is huge if you don’t get 30percent ruling. Even then there are taxes on house you rent and many others not mentioned anywhere. It’s upwards of 150EUR each bill you get from your first pay check.

You DONT get insurance from Booking.com so expect to pay minimum 100 EURO per person in your family. This price increases exponentially with benefits you add like dental, maternity etc. Also expect at least 350 EUR needs to be covered by you every year even if you have insurance on your medical bill."

Booking.com hires employees with university degrees but fail to offer a decent compensation packages. Where I was based (EMEA), one can earn more taking a job with no degree required. HR department states every year that they will re-evaluate the compensation packages, but there's never a major change.

- Unless you're based in Amsterdam, there's is no room for career progression. Your career will practically move horizontally, not vertically. 

- Brain drain. Many skilled managers and senior employees are leaving due to lack of decent compensation.

- Amsterdam (HQ) is the key to everything. HQ believes that what works in The Netherlands and in Amsterdam must, without a doubt, work in other countries too. This is wrong and basic business - there is no ""one size fits all"" strategy. B.com pride themselves in being ""locally relevant"", but ultimately fails to look beyond Amsterdam. Unfortunately, this is a bit narrow-minded and exactly the opposite to what Booking wants to be. 

- Dutch business culture. Many senior positions are Amsterdam-based and the Dutch communication style is applied everywhere, even when not culturally appropriate. Giving feedback that is bad, negative, and/or completely absurd when it comes to numbers/targets is hidden behind ""this is just Dutch, I'm being direct"". But guess what; there's a difference in being direct and just being passive aggressively rude.

- Targets. Setting targets the Booking way is practically by over-promising, under delivering. You will be forced to set targets you cannot achieve and be held accountable when not achieving them. This will, for many employees, have a negative impact in their motivation."

If after work, you do not go partying with some boss, who is almost every day, they think that you do not want to be part of the team. They do not care if you have family to attend to.
You can report sexual harassment within the company, by your immediate boss and human resources not take into account your complaint.
It is an compliance department, but they do not take into account your compliances, regarding many topics, such as the way your direct boss, insults you and offend you verbally.
Maybe you want to grow inside the company, in another department; but your boss can oppose and block the possibilities.
You work as a slave and they measure the time you're on the phone with a customer, if you're not on the phone at a time, they think you're not producing enough. That counts the time you take to have lunch and go to the bathroom.

Confirmations associate: Poor ethics, management can be upsetting and rude towards the staff. 
Shift patterns are badly designed and some of the trainers do not seem to know the concept of respect towards their coworkers. Patronising and sometimes even shouting at their staff. Stressful environment and wages that do not meet the workload and the unsociable hours.

I believe that Rentalcars.com is not always fully transparent (must advise that this issue has been improving though) and the not well paid staff needs to speak with angry customers for a company that does not prepare their customers to the worse most of the times - terms and conditions not clear.

30 minutes lunch...food is free but taste like prison food. Better to eat outside the office.

Management sleep with employees and only get a little slap on their wrist meanwhile customer service agents can be sacked for any reasons : was sick more than 3 times in 1 year (!!!) , was late more than 3 times in 1 year. You are considered late when you start 1 minute later than your schedule.

It is very hard to get a promotion unless you are friends with the management and kiss up to everybody. If you are shy, introvert, quiet : it will be perceived as lack of interest and management will suggest you to make an effort and change your personality.

Most of the team leaders are clueless and treat the employees like robots and expect a lot of them. They don't know what agents in customer service go through during one day as they never never did this job. So how can you be their team leader if you dont even know what they do ?!

There is an intern social network (Facebook but company only) on which you are required to be active and constantly monitor for news and updates. It's very distracting as employees use it to make fun of customers or create meaningless groups that have nothing to do with the work. They should get rid of it and use the official channels for news and update.

This company asks a lot of their employees : very early start, mixed with late shifts, you work most of bank holidays and it is a nightmare to get your holidays / days off accepted.

*The offices on Fountain Street are quite new.

*Colleagues are usually quite friendly and willing to assist when you need help.","*First and foremost, this company is very cheap! The salary is way lower than other businesses in the similar field. After the ""Your Voice"" survey, the whole company only scored 35 out of 100 satisfaction in terms of the salary but nothing significantly enough has been done to address the issue. 

The company did cut down on the working hours to 37.5 hours per week but in all fairness it doesn't justify the low pay you are getting. Although one of the core value of the company is ""We Love Straight Talking"" but they are very shy when it comes to the underpaid salary issue and they avoid it at all cost. 

The turnover ratio is one of the highest I've seen and there are yet many more talents who want to leave due to the bad pay. The company gives us Perk Box, a new learning platform and cheap freebies but that's nothing like giving a practical pay rise, they actually save more by just outsourcing these minor benefits that can be applied to all employees. 

The CEO said that we smashed the targets set by them during peak season and asked us to work even harder next year but there is no significant pay rise planned for its employees, only a small 2.1% pay rise which doesn't match the inflation rate.

*For the company party, the company asked us to donate to a charity organisation otherwise we wouldn't be able to attend it. Donation is not a bad thing but it shouldn't be mandatory, the party is held in order to thank its employees for their hard work but the way they force  you to donate has made a lot of colleagues feel uncomfortable. The tone when they were communicating this is also inappropriate.

Booking.yuck; Senior Management is extremely unprofessional. Your peers and the company will be tolerable, however, you will be over worked and under paid; they give you food to compensate. This office is a complete disaster. Though, it is a multi-cultural office, speaking in other languages in front of others is rude. If the companies primary language is English; USE IT! Do not have a voice because it will be silenced. A very reactive environment though they claim to be pro active. This place operates like a call center. Great for new immigrants that have been exposed to sub par working conditions and have low expectations. Benefits are awful and minimal. Staff are young and docile. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"

Data-driven approach.","Software engineering in Booking.com is very clearly just a business tool, e.g. refactoring, testing, code reviews, proper software architecture are rare and not encouraged, the mantra is ""being pragmatic and getting things done"". You will not learn how to be a good software engineer here, except for trainee/junior positions.

The codebase is a giant monolithic ball of Perl with all of its drawbacks. Technology is very conservative and often shortsighted. The company is hostile to non-iterative and breaking changes.

Values of the company are good on the surface, but shortsighted, oversold and often have a lot of real life drawbacks (although effective enough to earn good money). The attitude ""we don't care about what customers do not see"" is steadily hurting the company from the inside, and huge network effect allows the company to sit on top of its huge hotel/user base."

3810,Booking.com,The best company I've had the pleasure of working for.,2017-08-31,5.0,Software Engineer,"I recently left Booking after working there for almost a year in our Seattle office, however, I have nothing but great things to say about this company. The reason I left was because of some restructuring that heavily impacted our office and I felt like we lost a lot of what made our culture there so great, but that doesn't change my outlook on the company. As an employee, I always felt respected, trusted, and valued by management and the company in general.  I felt like I had the ability to make a noticeable impact on an enormous company and that the work I did never went unappreciated.
        Booking is one of the few places that I can say with confidence genuinely cares about each individual working for them, and they prove that by investing in their people, listening to feedback, and following up with any concerns. They treat their people like, well, people, instead of just some cogs in a machine. The company itself is very flat, which I loved. The leadership is really involved and the managers, at least in my experience, always had their team's best interests in mind and did their best to communicate everything with us. There was a good level of transparency compared to other companies, although there is still room for improvement in that area.
        The work I did felt challenging, fun, and exciting. It was right where I wanted to be, where I was directly making an impact on our products and our customers. There is a lot of opportunity to move around quite easily and get experience in a lot of difference aspects of the company. In general, I didn't feel like there was a lack of growth opportunities and I felt that movement was always encouraged. 
         Perhaps the greatest parts of Booking are its culture and its environment. It's young, fast paced, diverse, and really welcoming. There is a lot going on all the time and there are opportunities to meet and connect with people from all over the world. BAM, their annual company party, is a great example of the company's effort in maintaining its culture and morale. They even offer to bring you to Amsterdam once a quarter.
         Overall, I really miss working here. If it weren't for the restructuring that happened to our office, I would have stayed for the foreseeable future.  I really enjoyed the people I worked with, my managers, our office, our happy hours/office gatherings, the people I met, and everything else in between. If you get an opportunity to work here, take it.","There really aren't a ton of cons that I can think of. The biggest gripe I had was working with Perl and sometimes feeling like some of the technologies used were a little dated. It was never a deal breaker though because there is room to grow in other areas as well. Another con for me personally was our office mostly moving out of Seattle, but I understand that things like this could happen anywhere due to business necessities. I think the company handled the transition well enough and was generous throughout, but maybe could have provided a little more warning."

The current management team provides every opportunity for personal development and encourage out of the box thinking. This department isn't for everyone though - if you are slow to adapt and unwilling to work as a team, you may want to look elsewhere. Negative reviews on here for this department likely stem from those who were not quick to adapt and outwardly talked poorly about their colleagues. There are often travel opportunities that take you all over the US and Canada, even overseas to Amsterdam. There is an onsite gym, 401k matching, and fresh fruits and vegetables every day. There are many other pros, but if I started listing them, I'd likely never stop.","The HR team members are rarely on the same page.

Secondly, while all the other departments gets to have social events quarterly (having drinks at a bar etc..) after work hours, we in CS probably had some ""small scale"" event  among just ourselves.

Same for the Quality and Training group - best of the best.  Wonderful CSE and TL staff.  Collaborative, supportive, highly motivated, positive.  Extremely diverse.  My impression is the company itself, and other offices in this region and globally, may not have the same issues that are prevalent in the Seattle office.  At least not to the same extent, as many employees have transferred and report much better circumstances.","CSM staff and higher tout (and demand) the ""culture"" reputation be paraded daily, but it reveals itself often to be a carefully crafted facade.  Get behind closed doors and it can be brutally toxic.  If you come with any past leadership or call center management experience, leave it at the door, it will only cause you pain.  Employees are appreciated for being completely moldable with no experience, knowledge, suggestions, ideas or questions.  

Pay was recently increased across the board for this site, but is still famously below comparable companies, and not a living wage for Seattle area, especially for CSE (entry level).  Management has a lot of behind closed doors anxiety and pressure about the attrition and ""poaching"" by other Seattle area companies, including right within the same corporate complex.  Teams are managed with unclear expectations and at times, goals and expectations that are unreachable, especially for the evening teams.  Call center reps are always under incredible pressure, but this site manages team metrics and expectations particularly poorly and inconsistently.  For example - the CSAT survey.  Many centers can take into consideration survey feedback that is clearly unrelated to the agent's service by pulling those scores from the reporting.  Not here.   There is a lot of time and effort put into the appearance of managing to company values vs. KPIs -
 however it's heavily KPI driven, just quietly.  Really confusing and so hard to manage teams and motivate people when the goals are clear as mud. 
 Demoralizing and stressful to say the least, and opens the door to management massaging and manipulating the results and the quarterly performance reviews - and the quarterly bonuses.  Zero checks and balances, accountability or consistency."

They hire managers/team leads with no experience or personality because they're very mold and will just follow ridiculous orders.  They categorize the employees, or you do what they want you to do and they like you for being a follower or you are done! 
And don't even think on moving up in the company if you are not sucking up your Team Lead or Manager, or if you think different, or if you are not ""popular"" forget it! it doesn't matter if your stats are great! It's all about being popular and to be the chosen one...."

Good work life balance.

Great support for moving to Netherlands and in general.","Majority of product development teams are focused on a single conversion metric, often divorced from truly solving customer problems.  Ideas are retried over and over, with very little fresh progress in solving legitimate problems.

The Booking values dogma - goes unchallenged, and managers are happy as long as the primary metric graph is going in the right direction, despite its foundations often being rotten.

Customer feedback/research is unilaterally screaming to stop using misleading content + psychological manipulation on the products, which is ignored.

The scale of growth in the product organisations, results in having hundreds of people working on a very small product, resulting in huge amounts of repetition of ideas + mass amounts of conflict. 

Career progression is a box ticking exercise - reserved for those who want to play the game.

Being on the inside gives you the idea that the management have no idea what they're doing. This is a company that changes a lot (they claim to do so based on data) but, when you realize they keep changing the same 3 things back and forth, it seems really unlikely they're actually looking at any data at all.

No interdepartmental communication. This makes everything super hard when you need to sort things out and part of the problem needs to be looked at by another department (infinite waiting times). 

Product owners. I've actually had a product owner tell us we could do a bad job as long as we did it quick (just because his product wasn't good but needed to be used anyway).

The pay is good but in the location (Bellevue, WA), others offer much higher.

Spirit days and Fab Fridays were fun but they never offered a variety of food and it can be boring, too. Nothing more special than other companies.

Other offices, especially non-customer/accommodation service really like their jobs... they get more benefits and aren't treated like children who need to be constantly watched.

The CEO and other executives higher up on the ladder are really nice!

Amsterdam trip for almost 25% of the company based on tenure!","You can't be yourself - be who your manager wants you to be. You have to really suck up to the higher ups or you won't go anywhere.

They hire managers/team leads with no experience - assuming because they're very mold-able and don't have a preconceived idea of how to actually treat/manage others.

They categorize the workers to focus on some and not the others - if you weren't ""chosen"" by the almighty ones, you'll probably stay in your position for a good while.

Work hard constantly but still no reward (other than bonuses but my bonuses were rarely based on my performance.) They expect you to answer 8 calls in an hour with only 25 seconds between each. If you can do it but don't suck up or fall into their mold, you get a pat on the back or maybe some chocolate and a balloon... other than this ""reward"" your work goes unnoticed.

I was a strong team player and had very good statistics but was constantly told that I wasn't meeting the standard of the TEAM rather than the standard of the goals set by corporate.

Managers don't resolve issues, they sweep it under the rug (GO STRAIGHT TO HR WITH ISSUES). Sometimes, HR isnt' helpful though either - they will erase any proof you have of any claim (for example, the HR site may say they offer a benefit but if you ask, they'll take it down and act as if it never existed).

Their Values are unclear and leaves management unsure of how to lead. The values don't seem to be important and is definitely doesn't align with the atmosphere of the work place.

SOME TEAM LEADS YELL AT YOU IF YOU GET OUT OF YOUR SEAT. It seems they lack respect and an understanding that we are actual adults with actual working brains."

Then they wonder why employee engagement is dropping. 
They expect groundbreaking and disruptive innovation to the travel space yet have no one inspiring or worthy of great ideas to lead this. 
A ridiculous short term metric that is not about customer experience at all and cannot be directly tied to business growth is the pinnacle of success on which all product teams are judged. If that number goes up. Plus people are fast running out of ideas, which is why the restructures help to make it seem as if there's progress.
Try and question whether it's truly good for customers and you're out. 
The tech org doesn't know what the product org needs or wants and vice versa. It's a mess. 
It used to be easy telling people why I worked for, and loved Booking.com but at the moment it's about grinning and bearing it until the shares vest. 
There is no regard for people from the leadership team. They promote themselves around the company as caring individuals but its fake. This company has a crisis with its culture and they are the root cause but they don't care.

Team Leads are exploited for their labor - they are salary, but all the benefit of that arrangement goes to the company; Team Leads still have to work crazy shifts, holidays, precious little flexibility, vacations denied for silly reasons, it is looked down on to request comp time for meetings outside of shift/overtime. There should be some benefit to the employee when moving to salary, but it's clear that the company was just looking for unpaid overtime and that's the focus. Although I will say that at the time I left, they were making baby steps and allowing TL's to take half days from time to time and comp time if our overtime hours became excessive (although this was open to interpretation by direct managers) - that is how it should be, so good on them!! 

There was also a weird amount of competition between some of the TL's that was encouraged from the top - rather than working together toward common goals, it was very much about getting ahead at any cost. This resulted in more than one really tense meeting with people shouting - quite bizarre in a professional environment and wholly unnecessary. Some TL's did thrive in that kind of environment - if you're a competitive person by nature or prefer to work individually over teamwork, this could be a great fit for you. 

It was also a bit disturbing how the (unspoken) expectation was for every employee to have the same personality - employees were indeed evaluated on this quarterly (the company values, which are great on paper, were often interpreted as teamwork = loud and talkative) and this was also a consideration for who to promote internally. If you already fit into this mold, great! If you are at all reserved/reflective, this will likely be viewed as a flaw. 

There was also quite a bit of mixed messaging around metrics - although we were told that the focus was moving toward coaching to the right behaviors, there was still in practice a huge amount of pressure to meet metrics. This was confusing and made it difficult to manage teams.

Additionally, I didn't feel particularly protected as an employee - it seemed the agents were able to speak to us however they wanted with no recourse. Don't get me wrong - most of the agents were so wonderful and I'm not so thin skinned that I can't take standard criticism between a Team Lead and their direct report, but when I start to feel unsafe being alone in the same room as one of my agents, there needs to be some recourse or protection for the TL. 

My impression that a lot of these issues are unique to the Bellevue office. Booking is a great company overall, they do great things and really work hard to support their employees and make it a great place to work."

Sick policy is a joke (verbal warning after third sick leave in 1 year) 
Team leaders are to busy decorating the office and inventing kindergarten style games thinking that in this way they are motivating staff to assist one in any useful way in the day to day work. 
Recruitment team seems to lower standards progressively in relation to who they hire. Once gets promoted only on the basis of how much he socializes with middle and upper management not on actual skills. The sad think is that they keep on trying to promote the company values however they treat people in an unfair and unprofessional manner. During my time I sow some investigations on performances treated at best with dilettantism... but more resembling the Spanish inquisition than what  a modern company should do towards the employees"
3993,Booking.com,Where Careers Go to Die,2017-04-14,1.0,Product Owner,"For people with very little work history, Booking.com can be a great experience.  Starting your career here will expose you to a couple of fundamental concepts in the online business (such as how to run a basic A/B test), and you’ll get to meet people from around the world.  

Others who have potential to thrive here are ones who need the instant gratification offered by Conversion Rate Optimization.  In terms of CRO, Booking.com enjoys a substantial amount of traffic on which people working in IT can easily access to run experiments.

Financially, Booking.com will be fine for the foreseeable future.

Finally, the work life balance in IT / Product is quite good (though this is partly because nobody seems to be passionate about the products they are building).","For anyone other than those mentioned above, including those with any measurable work history or those who enjoy building great products consumers love, you will almost certainly find Booking.com to be a nightmare.  The company is very political, title-driven, obstinate in its way of operating, and arrogant because of its past success.  From a product perspective, Booking.com leadership seems unable to think about doing anything that might take longer than one week to build.

Apart from doing A/B tests, the company is also not very data-driven.  As a result, people who rise through the ranks are often those most adept at playing politics, who spend a lot of time talking over people’s heads and trying to sound more intelligent and actionable than they actually are.  Booking.com doesn’t hire particularly strong, well-rounded people, so many people, when encountered with the show pony, foolishly trust that the show pony knows what he or she is talking about.  In the end, nothing of value for the Booking.com consumer gets done, causing great frustration for results-driven employees who genuinely want to build great products consumers will love.

Financially, Booking.com employees are highly undervalued. The company pays extremely poorly compared to anywhere considered a major tech hub, but extremely well compared to Eastern Europe, where no significant tech presence exists.  As a result, the company relies greatly on the intra-European income disparity (as well as the 30% ruling) in order to be able to say it pays a competitive wage.  The reality is that any of the top talent at Booking.com could easily go to the US West Coast and earn at least 3x the salary.  The comp structure is also incredibly one-sided (three-year cliff vesting on stocks is the legal maximum, and Booking.com takes full advantage of that)."

There are issues around racism. HR doesn't seem to understand confidentiality (the one in the office is consistent) , they share confidential information with people who are not supposed to know.  Jobs promotion is based on if you fit and what you look like especially where senior management is concerned.  Please bear in mind these are things I have witnessed, nothing traumatising has happened to me personally and this also came through in our surveys but leadership choose to ignore it. Maybe it's just the London office. They don't follow any of what the CEO suggests the company is about.  It's a shame, because the company stands for some great things.   
Also by lack of diversity I don't mean the CS employees I mean leadership . Its clear how people are treated differently based on their looks and their heritage.

4059,Booking.com,Vile Workplace Bullying and Poor IT Security,2017-02-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There was good pay which I earned from the sales bonuses at a time when jobs were hard to get. The good pay is the main reason why I continued working for a company where so much bullying occurred.,"While I worked at this company, I experienced some of the worst workplace bullying ever meted out on a human being. I was unjustifiably bullied by some of the members of management at this company. There is an major incident of workplace bullying which happened to me at this company which still seriously negatively affects my life today. I was also a victim of some very poor IT security at this company which is connected to this incident of workplace bullying. Because of the bullying which I experienced at this company, I have mental health problems. I have been taking doctor prescribed medication and I have been to counselling because of the bullying.
                                                                                                                                                                           I am a passionate advocate for the prevention of workplace bullying because I was bullied at this company. While I was at this company, there was a time when I was told of by a manager for speaking out about the bullying. Workplace bullying has hurt so many people. It's not fair that I still have to suffer for crimes which were committed by other people that I worked with at this company. If you want to know more details about the devastatingly poor IT security and the bullying which happened to me at this company, I would advise you pay attention to the press in the coming months. The bullying which I experienced at this company is so heinous that I am anticipating that there will be a lot of TV, newspaper, radio and social media coverage in the months to come. I would not be surprised if the authorities from various agencies were to investigate the poor IT security and intense workplace bullying which was experienced at this company.
                                                                                                                                                                       As a surviving victim of workplace bullying, I have taken it upon myself to make people aware about the seriousness of the long term problems which workplace bullying causes. Workplace bullying is something that needs to be dealt with effectively. Sweeping it under the rug is not the right solution. I recently wrote to this company in regards to the bullying and poor IT security which affected me and I am still waiting for a reply."

• Management sets ambiguous KPI and cannot commit nor provide the metrics used for performance review (how can employees meet/exceed expectation without knowing the benchmarks)
• Bonus is ""discretionary"" - meaning management will find excuses to prevent full payout even if employees exceed target
• Work flexibility (start/end time, ability to work from home, duration of breaks) depends on personal relationship with the manager, not business needs
• Employees are often on PIP with little time to demonstrate improvement before they are terminated"

It is a European based company, so they are very generous in the amount of PTO (18 days), but that's standard anymore with most tech companies. The health insurance is good and the company pays a large portion of the premium.","Booking.com acknowledges that they pay below market average, but justify this by saying they provide you extensive training (which they should if they want you to perform in such a specific manner) and free snacks (apples, bananas, granola bars) in the lunch room. Having friends who work at Expedia, I found out that they pay nearly double to what Booking.com does. 

Note that the turn-over at Booking.com is high; most people don't stay beyond a year. Unfortunately this means that most of the high performing/talented colleagues end up leaving and the ones that stay are consistent average or low performers. You received your quarterly ""bonus"" based on your overall office performance, which means that low performers are rewarded equally as high performers (they say that high performers get 1-2% more on their bonus). I also found it interesting that we consistently missed our office goal by .2 to 1%, which deducted from us receiving a full bonus.

Management is very, very, very green; most have never worked at another company and were promoted because they've stuck around the longest, not because they have management or leadership talent."

Fun fact, both were supposedly written by employees in Bellevue/Seattle which is also home to Americas HR leadership.

""Keep doing what you're doing. We're winning with customers and we're winning with employees.""  

""Awesome culture - empowering, autonomous, caring. Management cares, and I feel valued. Compensation + everyone qualifies for bonus. The only reason you don't get bonus is if you're significantly under performing. This is a strong growth company that puts people first.""

If you are in a sales/account management role be prepared to move in order to grow your career .

Unfortunately team leaders do not really care about agents as their only goal is to be promoted themselves so if you are too good they will cut you off.. and if they do not like you as well.  . they are basically allowed to do whatever they want as you do not count anything for he company. they usually hire over qualified people for the job and those are the first to leave as they are not treated with any respect. rules are not clear but if you dare say anything or ask the wrong question you'l get fired. for real! they usually do not even give much feedback. their favourite sentence is ""you do not fit the company"" .. and if you don't.. well, that means you have a brain :-)"
4078,Booking.com,An open and honest assessment about a great place to start,2017-02-03,4.0,Customer Service Advisor,"- Being part of the world’s leading travel group: Priceline - Booking.com, Rentalcars.com, Priceline.com, Agoda.com, KAYAK and OpenTable

- Network creation, making friends and who knows find your other half (countless cases in-house)

- Multicultural casual environment and opportunity to refresh the foreign languages learnt in mid/high-school

- Amazing offices and parties, great central location, free breakfast, fruit, juices and coffee machine

- Priceline keynotes and Rentalcars quarterly presentation of results

- Open communication from leadership team and ability to have an open discussion with direct (I was lucky) and senior management

- New director brought some fresh air with new strategy heading the contact centre in the right direction

- New head of customer service division is an amazing person to work with, supporting agent's development and overall happiness with a sharp eye for improvement and detail

- The pleasure of being able to work with some great colleagues and managers

- Facebook at work is a powerful and friendly communication tool for company's development and relations between employees

- The company's values. ""We love: Being Different, Getting It Done, Doing Stuff Together, Having Fun, Straight Talking""","- Stressful job, rotas don't allow stability. Some gradual changes for better are happening but slowly.

- Agent's are requested to take ownership of customer's issues but need to ask permission for pretty much everything, in order to fulfill the contact centre objective: helping the customers. Lack of trust on employees or ineffective control strategies?

- Although the lack of internal knowledge, formation and use of IT systems, some low level managers stick to the job title while others use their in-house time to empower themselves, instead of coach and empower their agents and subsequently the company's growth. No names on the table but the fact of only having experienced this with managers from UK is a strange and sad coincidence.

- Internal spam received via Outlook regarding non real time KPI's and motivational quotes without great impact.

- ""Hot desks"" and constantly changing team's seating areas (understandable but still a con), alongside with the dirtiness of some colleagues.

- Lack of follow up regarding internal applications that in some cases are completely ignored, even when a simple reply is chased. Ragged excuses show that our CV has not even been read. Really disappointing!

- Improvement ideas and solutions developed with great acceptance from colleagues, don't receive proper feedback neither follow-up from the adequate departments, even if they're supported with numbers (hours, £) that can improve the overall performance of internal operations. Why?

- High number of people with high education doing low level tasks with non-managed expectations, associated with an inexistent/unknown employees development strategy, generates demotivation and high turnaround."

- low pay compared to what the company asks from you
- favouritism in the office. Brown nosers are promoted
- it is hard for your career progress. Applying other position is actively discouraged,  maybe because of the incapable people fear you are taking their job. Before applying other positions you need to contact your direct manager and get approval from the direct manager instead of contacting HR.
- very strict on the schedule, you can not be late for 1 second even because of the computer problems. Meal time is tight and has been scheduled for you. They even said during which time is not 'suggested' to go to the toilet. Every lateness is counted and affects your salary 
- the unrealistic target which makes you really hard to have the full bonus

  --The following concerns the office in Tourcoing.--

The company might be a very well established one, though it's unfortunate how much improvisation informs all ranks in management. Decisions and all sorts of information are rarely explained and lack the transparency a naive soul might expect. 

The office itself is a travesty: it lacks room and it's oftentimes overcrowded, the hardware is just ridiculous, old and poorly maintained, and on any given day you'll find something not working. It doesn't even have sprinklers in case of fire...

Management is mostly numbers-obsessed and generally uninspiring if not incompetent, and any form of dissent or critical thinking is discouraged if not openly censored; hierarchy and fragile egos are meant to form a deadly combination.

Brand loyalty equals various forms of brainwashing, and employees are generally treated like kids."
4171,Booking.com,Inexperienced and horrible management - don't waste your time!,2016-11-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The annual conference/party in Amsterdam is a nice perk. Trainings are fun as you get to meet new people from other parts of North America. My new hires training was top notch and very professional, best I have ever had in my career, but it has been eliminated and now done locally with managers who have no clue how to train and be mentors. Snacks and Freaky Fridays were fun, but if you do not participate you are not a ""team player"". Hours are standard (9-5 M-F) but this is just another job. If you have invested $$ into your education and looking for a meaningful career this is not the right place for you.","Where do I start? 
- Local talent is not valued. People are hired from other offices and let them work even before their work visa gets approved. The reviews below are 100% accurate about the language issue! It is very uncomfortable when a couple of the people in the office sit together at a desk and speak in another language for hours on (esp when the higher up isn't there). They can't be talking about work the whole time!
- Compensation is embarrassingly very low. Apparently salaries are re-evaluated often to make sure it is competitive to the market, but it's a complete lie. Bonus structure keeps getting worse and the easier it gets to reach targets the more difficult they make it to reach next quarter.
- Management encourages you to speak up and ask questions, but when you do, they yell at you and tell you to figure it out on your own. Or you are harassed and bullied to the point where they chase you out the door.  Or you are threatened to be put on a ""personal improvement plan"". Don't speak up in meetings, especially with HR there, or you're on the chopping block!
- The office is a call centre. Every second of your time is micromanaged. Every call and e-mail is monitored and tracked closely. You are not recognized for your projects, creativity or innovativeness - only the number and length of calls you make. You are not trusted. This is a known complaint, so management decided to give everyone an expert role with unreachable KPIs and expectations with no increase in merit/pay. It also lead to even more tracking via google docs. Sometimes tracking would take over an hour and then we're asked what are we doing with our time when we're not making calls? 
- The company tries hard to brainwash you. There are so many juices and snacks in the office I'm surprised they don't give you free blue Kool-Aid to force down your throat! Quarterly meetings, visits by upper management and BAM keeps reminding us of how fast the company is growing and how they are going to be the best in the world. Don't fall for it, their competitors will always win.
- Management/seniors are very unprofessional, amateur and power hungry. Instead of telling us what we are not doing, look at how you are viewed by others in the office. Lead by example or you will never be respected. Managers are nit-picky, emotional and do not value your personal development (only their own). They don't like people who are more educated and smarter than them. They get a kick out of putting employees down and the more miserable you are the happier they get.
- The list of cons can go on forever. Just look at the previous reviews, they are 100% accurate. Any review you see 2 stars and over is probably written by management to increase the overall score."
4172,Booking.com,"Lots of good, not great.",2016-11-04,3.0,,"- Despite the fact that the company at this point in time has well over 10K employees, there is still a lot of freedom one can enjoy in his or her role, to make that role fit you and pivot it in a way that fits well with your qualities and interests.

- There general workforce is relatively young and super international; so in that way very techie which for me is definitely a plus.

- There is a good work-life balance with decent work hours and no expectation or peer pressure to sit onto way in the evening in the office. If I would around the building at 18:30/19:00 almost everybody is gone.","- Despite the fact that I feel Booking really wants to see itself into a league with tech giants like Facebook and Google, the company just doesn't have the same buzz, nor excitement. Not so strange, as the core goal of the company is not a lofty goal to change society or the way we interact with each other, but more focused on creating a great accommodation experience 
when traveling.

- I feel that the company is not very forward thinking when it comes to the creativity of its work space, the ability to work flexible or part time from home, etc.

- Due to exponential growth over the last few years middle-management is generally speaking not very good and impressive.

- There are a whole bunch of mostly extended leadership folks or the management layer below that whom are between 6-10 years with the company. They walk around feeling they own this company, have a smug attitude and do not realize that at any other company of our size their qualities would push them down three layers in the organizational pyramid. (this might be different in the Tech side of the company on which I do not have a good view, my view comes from the commercial part of the company)."

It's quite common to hear a Team Leader getting a position without knowing anything about the structure of the company, just because HR thinks he's/she's cute.

Works Council is a lie, they are on the hand of management and even a member of HR is part of Works council.

Team Leaders can be power-sick, they lie to you in order to keep your numbers so they results are good, but later on they'll fire you because they don't like who you are (didn't happened to me because I decided to quit).

When you come to work you need to live the lie that you are happy at work, but after 3 months you know how sick the office is and you'll just stay because you can't speak German so there aren't a lot of job opportunities."

If you try to grow - you will be denied on every possible stage. You have to fight with incompetent management every day if you do care about the product and people in your team. They never admit their mistakes, but they do make them a lot.

This is a great company for a young person looking for some experience and a great time.,"The pay is really not comparable to other companies. It is much lower and I can see why the company is only able to hire new immigrants. One of the B.com values is to challenge each other. Whenever an employee challenges a manager, the employee is either spoken to or receives a written warning. Managers do not truly embrace the values of the company and only work on advancing themselves. One of the managers constantly tells her team to ""play the game"" and you will move up. Nothing else really matters"". This is not very encouraging for someone that wants to work hard and be valued for their work. For anyone that does not want to ""play the game"" with this manager or any other manager, the only outcome is to leave. I understand why so many of my colleagues have left in the past few months. The managers are all Portuguese and constantly speaking in Portuguese. It creates an uncomfortable environment for the rest of the staff and many have raised concerns but it does not seem to effect them. It is inconsiderate as many of the employees speak other languages but they care to respect others and the managers do not. Managers have also spoken badly about employees that have left, calling them trash, worst, and many other names. I find this unprofessional and off putting. This is not a company I am proud to be working for and I find it difficult to respect my managers when they behave like this."

Free snacks and team lunches don't pay the bills.
I enjoyed the people I worked with (except for the managers that currently work there) and have made some lasting friendships.
The health benefits and RRSP contribution were great.","-Very low Salary 
-Phone system that tracks everything with TV monitors on the walls (just like a call centre except our office wasn't one)
-Too much tracking  (multiple Google docs for tracking everything you do.  You spend so much time tracking that you lose time that you could be doing actual work!).  If the managers were any good they would actually be more hands on in their job to see how hard the employees work instead of being out of the office or in meetings all of the time.
-The job got boring quickly and there was not many job opportunities unless you want to relocate which not everyone does.  
-Too much brainwashing. They really force the Kool aid down your throat and try to change who you are.  If someone is quiet during a meeting and doesn't have anything to share they say you need to be more visible and try to force you to say things.  In my case if I have something to say then I will say it.  If not, I am not going to talk just for the sake of talking.  It also works in reverse, if you speak your mind and the managers don't like what you are saying you will hear about it later.  One of the values is to challenge one another yet when you do it is held against you later.  This is the reason why some people don't speak up at all.

I used to really enjoy working in the Toronto office at Booking.com.  In the last few years, there have been a lot of management changes and the current managers are terrible. The last 6 months of my employment, in particular, were literally unbearable.  The current managers micromanage, nitpick on everything you do and are completely unprofessional.  They are thankless and I constantly felt undervalued.  Nothing was ever good enough for them.  They were quick to point fingers and make assumptions instead of listening and getting all of the information first.

I would still recommend the company to others as I have heard that there are lots of job opportunities in other countries and that people actually like their jobs and managers. I have no problem with the company but I would certainly never EVER recommend anyone to work in the Toronto Office.  Most unpleasant office I have ever worked in.  The fact that so many people have resigned in the last few months should say it all."

Most company's base the employee's knowledge of the position and or performance on whether a promotion will be granted. Well unfortunately, that is not Booking.com's approach. At Booking, you are graded on what market you run, if your senior is ""acceptable"", if the area manager is in a good mood that day, if you are of a different sexual orientation.

There are other ways to make sure that employees do not 'just' take days off for sickness e.g. by rewarding them for not being sick vs punishing them for that.
My last point is training.. Most companies of that size usually have a whole department/team who provides the employees with different and interesting internal trainings, there's not such a thing at Rentalcars."

You are expected to take call after call and listen to complaints all day and have no tools to resolve the issues. It makes you feel terrible knowing that the caller needs help right away and you can't help them at all. You have your lunch and two breaks and if you need to use the restroom any other time too bad. Don't work here, the yearly trip to Amsterdam is not worth especially because you are there working. It's not a vacation as they make it sound."
4275,Booking.com,Recommended for singles only,2016-08-01,4.0,Customer Service Executive,"More so than customer service, you're actually playing the 3rd party or middle ground between Hotel and guests who booked through Booking.com. The normal phone calls consists of cancel reservation requests to answering questions about the hotel the potential guest are trying to book. There is a set of procedure you need to follow regarding complaints, so if you memorize and know it well, this job is no challenge at all.","I enjoyed working at this place, but the attendant policy was too overwhelming. The company uses a point-formula where you're basically given 6 points to lose until you're terminated. For every time you call in, you get a point taken away. if you happen to call in on a weekend when you're scheduled, you lose two points. You can absolutely regain your points, but you'd have to have perfect attendance (no tardy or absence) for 30-days in order to gain back one point. 

Ridiculously, when you get 3 points taken away, your team leader would ask you for a one-on-one talk and basically warns you on what's going to happen if you keep losing points. Also, you are basically put on a probation for 1 month until you gain back your point to drop it down to 2. What probation means is that you cannot bid to change your schedule or even consider changing department/promotion opportunities."
4276,Booking.com,Not as good as they make themselves out to be - processes and spreadsheets!,2016-07-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There were some good colleagues from all over the world, offices are nice and it's generally a fun environment. Couldn't complain about the casual dresscode.","I don't recognise from these reviews how amazing this place is supposed to be. There used to be straight talking, but around the same time the values were launched, the place started becoming political and the transparency which used to be there started disappearing. Some of the treatment I have seen of people has been horrendous and more and more employees who actually know the business are being pushed out. It used to be an innovative place with room for everyone's opinions. This has been swapped for long and tedious processes, meetings about meetings and endless amounts of backstabbing. Not exactly about getting things done. The company covers themselves in choirs and a subsidised cool canteen to make themselves look better than they actually are. It was a better place to work before they tried convincing everyone how amazing they are. If you are willing to never question a manager's decision, say ""how high"" when a manager says jump and to stick your nose up the backside of managers/directors and play a constant polictical game, you will fit right in. For non-robots, no amount of free fruit and porridge will compensate for how Rentalcars is being managed these days. Unfortunately, there is not much support from the HR department, or the People Team, as they have re-branded themselves as. They do investigations without giving any prior notice or allowing employees to bring a witness. I've seen this happen to several people and it doesn't make them very trustworthy, but just seems like they take part in the political game and expect to be consulted in even the most trivial decisions. I've also know people who have complained about certain things regarding the management, which they pretend to take seriously, but nothing happens. It's not as unique as they think. It's turning into the corporate wafflers they claim not to be. Just look at how many people have left who made it the success it is today. It just seems like a lot of people don't care about the business in the same way they used to."

Parties are Super Good. Food is not only a toast on midday like most Dutch companies.,Non professional approach in many cases. Indirect insults/ judgement without justification. Many people that work there have don't even a University Degree in Finance or even other Financial Background. Some of them are in Management. This means that they can't drive change.

-The pay is incredible low compared to the industry and competitors.Most of the trainings I went to with other employees we continually talked about how we could be making substantially more at the major competitor
-Mid level manager are absolutely terrible. I was overachieving all targets which is incredibly rare and was scolded multiple times about not making enough outbound phone calls. 
-All you can offer to your ""partners"" is more discounts or the option to pay more. With the current state of the hotel industry this is the last thing they want to do. The company/all OTA's are in a very turbulent time and I would not want to be around one in the next 5 years
-Their really isn't much career growth here. They tell you everything is flat so their are no many steps to the top. Thats not what young professionals want to hear who want to climb the ladder. Company has a lot of side steps not steps up
-Also travel benefit is terrible for a travel company. Half of the employees do not use it as they still have connections to old hotel chains and can get better rates. 
-Way to many accounts are given to certain account managers. The expectation is that you talk to all of your top accounts once a quarter. This is impossible when you have over 850. as many of these accounts have not been talked to and once you do they will always want contact.
-Finally, they constantly ask for feedback but never want to hear it. We address many of these points in a engagement survey. When these point were brought up management turned it back around on us instead of communicating up the ladder of how it could be improved."

There is NO plan or program to grow in the company. Since we are growing so much the growth structure is not there, it just happens and that brings problems on promoting people that are not up to the needed skills.
There is no training program once you run out of the internal training. You ask for external programs and they deny them. 
Growth in your career only happens if you play the right political game. Be nice to the ""right people"" and you will move forward, even if  you managed people in the worst way. 
There is no structure on developing and hiring leaders. Senior management place such a high expectation on internal hires but when they bring someone external to fill that position it is nothing like the previous expectations.
They say it is easy to move from one country to another but the truth is that they make it so hard that is easier to find a job in another company for that country you want to move  than move internally."

Chill office culture, there's very rarely a feeling that you're under pressure to complete something. Developers are professional and good to work with. Completely flat structure of IT department. Meaning, every developer is pretty much equal and allowed to design features and make technical decisions. Success of a feature is determined by results of A/B testing. So you can pretty much work on anything and noone will tell you that your idea is wrong, especially if it's successful on metrics. This is great if you are full of ideas and feel that management won't let you run with them.","Other side of the same things. Flat department structure means there's absolutely no plan and no control. Everyone can quietly implement a feature that doesn't fit with the rest of the code. On the other hand, if they get noticed, they are immediately harassed by every other peer developer who has something to say. Getting people to agree on anything is practically impossible, because there's no authority and someone always has an opinion against it. Every code change has to run through time-consuming A/B testing, which creates huge technical debt and makes it really difficult to deal with it. All of this is viewed as a feature, not a bug; the company actually hires even more developers to run as many features as possible."

I had a legitimate request according to Spanish law that I address to hr and my manager: they came back to me after weeks claiming that they had consulted the lawyers in Amsterdam and they considered my request invalid without any explanation regarding the reasons, because obviously they did't have a clue. If you have greater issues (e.g. Maternity leave, mistakes in your pay slip) you are basically left alone or told that 'it can wait' or 'it is not important'. The three  Customer Service Managers who run the Barcelona office are frankly incompetent, making difficult to understand what qualities you (don't) need to possess to advance in your career within the company. This also applies to some team leaders who are well known to have the position just because they were friends with other TLs. Every month they make every employee fill in a sheet of examples of how they made their best to bring the company values in their daily work. Given the fact that the management  is constantly mocking these values it is difficult for an employee,who is required to show a virtuous attitude at all times,  to ignore the hypocrisy of all this. This is also a very iniquitous way to evaluate someone's performance as in most cases it favors those who have a good personal relationship with their manager rather than those who are making a good job."

Shifts flexibility (you can swap shifts), lots of benefits, Freaky Fridays, 25% discounts on Booking's accommodations for you, your family and friends, coaching sessions to help progression, 3 weeks training quite efficient (even if a bit short, you're sent to the floor without being really ready), nice meals (they have a canteen).","I barely see my colleagues and people of my team, so feeling pretty lonely. We all have different schedules, with different break times and different lunch times. And because you are pretty much the whole day on the phone, you can't really talk to your neighbours, the people sitting next to you. You have 2 breaks of 15min each per day, one in the morning, one in the afternoon. It's a fixed time, you have to go on break at that time. Same for lunch, which is 30 min. So it's really hard to have lunch at the same time as friends, you have to have exactly the same shift as your mates. And anyway for me 30 min break for lunch is way too short, so I can't really speak to anyone during my lunch break, because I'm way too busy eating. You also have 10 min of Personal Time per day, that you can use whenever, if you have an emergency, a phonecall or if you have to run to the toilet or whatever.
Salary is really low. Don't really understand why, as this is not especially an easy job, it is very tiring and very demanding, having to satisfy everyone, all the Booking's partners and all the Booking's guests.

I'm currently working in one of the ventures inside Rentalcars.com and so far it's been a whirlwind of an experience. You're given an opportunity to grow yourself and contribute to the business in a big way from recruitment to working on any of the platform you should wish.

Traveling is cool, and if you have a desirable territory, it's really cool for a while. If you do not, it'll be a challenge but try to make the best of it.

I do credit Booking.com with teaching me a lot - running successful meetings, selling, upselling, managing accounts - I achieved all of this and I appreciate that.","This is a mediocre place to work, and it'll never be more. However much they preach the importance of the EES (employee engagement survey), the company will not change in order to boost morale. The company gets very mediocre scores on the survey each year (employees on average rate it a 7/10 or so, but when it comes to compensation, the company gets murdered, as it should. Management will act surprised, and send out an email stating they're going to do market research to determine ""the average"" that someone with the title ""account manager"" makes, and then you may get a $200 per year raise (wow nice!) or you'll never hear about it again. Despite Darren Huston (now the former CEO) claiming we have millions of dollars in the bank, and also having enough for countless acquisitions, somehow the company can't afford to pay a decent wage in some of the most expensive cities in the US.

Year after year you'll hear outlandish claims like ""booking.com wants to be the best place in the world to work."" The problem is that becoming the best in anything (school, sports, any profession, etc.) takes investment. It takes time, money, effort, etc. Booking.com literally changes nothing, despite claiming this every year. It's offensive and sad.

The pay is disastrous and quite embarrassing actually. A market manager at Booking.com's biggest competitor (Expedia) makes more than an Area Manager at Booking.com, and an area manager manages a team of people managers, who manage market managers.

Each year Forbes releases a list of the average starting salary for recent college grads in major US cities - it's very sad, but this list often times proves that NEW COLLEGE GRADS - 21, 22 year olds, make more than an Account Manager at Booking.com after 5 years. An AM of 5 years gets an annual merit increase of about $500-1k per year - that's 1-2%, and doesn't quite cover the cost of inflation - for you Econ majors.

Lastly - despite what a recruiter might tell you, the bonus potential is absolutely poor. If you hit 110% to target EVERY SINGLE QUARTER, your total bonus amount will equal close to $6,000 - that's annual - not every 3 months. I know this, because it's happened. $6,000 might actually  be generous too."

Somehow this company manages to continually attract enthusiastic, passionate, genuine people with a lot to offer. 

Space for learning and experimenting if you want that. 

Other than that, I can hardly think of any pros to mention, as all things I initially thought were pros turned out to not be what they initially seemed. 

The only thing I can still think of is the Booking Benefit (25% off reservations).","Where to start?

Probably the root of all evil is the fact that people get promoted for the wrong reasons. You're reading this a lot here and it's actually absolutely true across all departments and I've seen it so many times in the 2 years I've been here. The most dedicated and talented people almost never get promoted and they end up being pushed away by the ones who get promoted. As I read somewhere, the actual company values as opposed to the 'nice-sounding' values are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted or let go. 

They promote the ones who are best at working the system, the champions of sucking up to the right audience. It's never about what you do, how much or how well. It's about how visible you make yourself to the right people and about packaging everything you do in the company's ""values"". These values sound great but here's the catch: the ones who get promoted don't actually stand by them, they just use them as keywords in their speeches. 

In an environment where passion and excellence are valued it's very hard to work under clueless, mediocre people who recite a management recipe from the book every time they need to show some leadership and inspire people. 

Next in line: evaluation. They have a horrendous evaluation system where you are assigned to a number and a letter, according to your ""potential"" and your ""performance"". The criteria for assessing this is purely subjective, not actually based on performance / achievement and it always boils down to whether your manager likes you or not. With a manager who's limited and mediocre it's never possible to excel in your assessment because they're not able to understand your vision and the importance of what you do. 

The positive attitude. If you want to do anything in this company, you need to show the almighty positive attitude. All well there, only they have become so obsessed with this positive attitude that they shut down all critical thinking. It's a very thin line, you never know when your critical thinking is being considered ""negativity"". You just see it at the end of the quarter when your manager decides not to grant you the bonus despite having overachieved your targets, because of ""negativity"". You may try explaining the difference between critical thinking and negativity, it will only make it worse. Yes, that happened to me and yes, my manager couldn't actually grasp the concept of 'critical thinking'. :)

The specialist / manager bucket. According to this company's Illuminati, a person can either be 'specialist-material' or 'management-material'. Once you've been thrown in the specialist bucket you will die there. If someone who's important has subjectively passed this judgement on you, no one will ever again consider you for a management role. Seen this happen to at least a dozen people during my time here. 

The Booking Blue police. This reminds me a bit of the secret services police in authoritarian societies, where people need to adhere to the propaganda if they want to advance in their career. Your manager forever watches your behavior for signs that you have fallen off the Booking Blue wagon. You used to be very enthusiastic about the company but are showing signs of less enthusiasm these days? Well, this is reason for you not to receive your bonus too, despite of having overachieved your targets. 

The truth is Booking.com doesn't give a damn about its people. It's trying to sell another story, but you will feel expandable and replaceable here. They won't invest effort in trying to make employees feel satisfied. You either have to fake it, or leave. Salaries are not negotiable and very small for a company venting such high profits. They make no effort to retain talent, they just replace it if talent asks for a raise, for example. 

All this boils down to promoting incapable people with a narrow vision who then get to steer and evaluate all those brilliant people who eventually end up leaving in sheer disillusionment. But hey, let's look at the bright side. Some are off to far better lands where true innovation happens, like Airbnb for instance."

Try to amend your work schedule and they will find anyway to not let you.

I have also always genuinely admired the athmosphere in which speaking up is encouraged a lot. I felt to be part of something really big, while keeping the startup vibe. The culture totally sucks you in, in a good way, very energetic. Had a lot of fun, learned a lot, and the experience was totally worth it.","Managers. Due to huge growth the company started hiring and promoting the wrong people. Low and middle managers are underqualified and are not just overstretched but they simply don't even necessarily understand what's expected of them. You can actually witness people fleeing away from teams with incompetent team leads who would either cause significant impairment in the fuctioning of the team or weren't able to solve any of the existing problems. Speaking up to the relevant higher level managers unfortunately does very little, as they are overloaded with too many teams, thus they end up having little or no time to solve actual issues. So you're pretty much stuck.
Additionally, some product managers have been losing focus, and instead of trying to help the user, they are making up projects that they 'think' is great - it's very demotivating to work on ideas you don't believe in. 
Also, they have weird and not transparent ways of dealing with long term mental illnesses and burnouts. Pay is not super generous either."

The company has grown a lot the past year and management has not handled it well.  People that have been working there for years have been screwed over for promotions as they keep bringing in (under-qualified) people from outside of the company.  You really have no voice there if you are just an agent (or anything else really.) Their demands have changed a lot and they often talk about how our voice matters and la-di-da but it's really all talk. 
It used to be a great place to work and you really felt a sense of belonging. But now, it is a struggle just to get through the day - especially when your supervisor came from outside the company and knows nothing about the work you do (that they are supposed to be supervising.) 
Keep in mind that I worked at the Grand Rapids, MI office. I watched the company change a lot over the last few years and the Grand Rapids office is definitely seen as the ugly cousin of all of the other offices now. 
Procedures are not the same in all offices worldwide so you are often left cleaning up other peoples laziness. 
It is quite sad because the company used to be so great and still has so much potential but the leaders are just playing a guessing game at what works best - there is no actual thought process. 
So many people have been forced out the past year - it is insane. 
You cannot go one work week without hearing another person got let go. It's really quite sad. 
 My opinion - they need to stop giving out all of the free stuff to their employees and just listen to them, it would probably be a cheaper option than to bribe them with all of these ""gifts and goodies."""
4409,Booking.com,Management/Leadership that's not listening to the right people,2016-03-22,3.0,IT Team Lead,"Company is trying to change for the better, and over years there were some positive changes.

Few examples would be that people now get permanent contracts from the start - which was not the case a couple of years ago, introduction of pension & life insurance for everyone in Netherlands (not just IT) and graduate program is working out great for both graduates and the company.

Even though it's corporation size big - you can still get a lot of stuff done without requiring signatures and approvals.","Many of the things company is trying to improve are missing the point - either trying to solve different/wrong problem, or introducing a ""solution"" that doesn't help.

Technology stack is ""old"" - and even if you go past the fact that learning Perl5, or in-house templating in case of designers - is not going to give you plus points for your next job (because learning concepts, big scale and commercial thinking will help). True innovation is also suffering due to limitations of tech stack, and aversion to technologies that would be new to Booking - even when they are widely accepted outside and not just latest buzzword.

Many ideas and concepts get shot down because they seem technically impossible or would require too much effort. Or in cases where they are not shot down right away - get introduced with big trade-offs that limit the usefulness, or delayed by 1 to 2 years.

All mentioned combined with company compensation philosophy being ""We don't want salary to be the reason people work here"" means there's very little to motivate people to go an extra mile."

It's obvious that the business will change so much for the better over the next few years and for a relatively young workforce, it's an amazing place to spend your 'formative years'.

It has a lot to do with politics also.

The Hotel Ninja team was the best team of people I have ever worked with, they could of built any product with very high standards. But B.com instead of reusing the team they fired them, only to hire some of them back afterwards.

B.com sells itself as a startup spirit company, but in practice it is not. It is a massive company that is only driven by profits and bulling. 

From a technical point of view the technology is not appealing, the core of the system is written in Perl and MySQL for persistence. The code base is massive, and the only way they can keep it going is by hiring gurus from the Perl and MySQL communities.

Generic answers from TL when you question accuracy of their system. While we were able to promote our own surveys via emails it was easier to get across what this survey is about but that was not in their best interest as they want to keep rotating people and have new employees through manpower so they can cut off the cost of benefits, bonuses and salaries.

That trainer and I have both since left the company but I will always be grateful for her enthusiasm and true love for what she was doing. If I find another training and trainer like that, I consider myself very lucky. 

Outside of that, the other pros were health insurance options and coverage. The recruiting team is also a class act.","Horrible management, sycophant team leads and a favoritism system. Leadership drives out good people if they find them threatening. There are so many people in this center simply going through the motions. It's so obvious that no one here really cares anymore. The number of people leaving is extremely high. No one wants to stay because they are not motivated to stay. The spirit team does little to actually instill spirit and none of the ""motivating"" events are actually motivating. 

People are fake. Team leads kiss butt all day, every day. Most are never at their desk and if they are, they are ""too busy"" to help you.

Management is often young un-experienced people who have no experience in managing people, they often do it in a very non-modern, conventional way based on reward and punishment systems. They will give endless feedback on your personality if you have any traits they dislike. They will also go behind your back and share information with other managers that you shared with them in trust. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to work for this company. And if you still want to, be prepared for a very non-professional and mentally degrading environment where you should be prepared to basically sell your soul, your values, your ethics and your true identity to the devil to be able to succeed within the company."

And fruit. One banana each day. 

Everything else just sucks in there big time.","Useless managers. 
They performance manage people according to how much they like them. For the same values someone can get a bigger bonus from another just because he is manager's favourite. 

They always promise promotions but they do not help you unless again they like you. 

Wages and job is good if this is your first job and you are below 24.

Otherwise after 3 months you will want to kill yourself. 

Stay away. Do not believe the advertisments. 

Last but no least, shifts are horrible. They turn you to a jombie and there is no personal life when you work around the clock in different times daily.

They are obsessed with people being late if you are late even for 1 min to log into the system count as lateness after 3 times  you are out ( this count also for breaks and lunch) you can't have breaks when you want and  technically you can't go to the toilet the first and last hour of your shift  but they don't  tell you this straight they ""suggest you"" to not go.

They are busy the company is huge therefore they expect you to take av. of 60 calls per day. When you are on ready every day your phone keeps on ringing  and you  have to be fast they measure you performance per hour you can't be too slow.

4523,Booking.com,Good to see the horrible reviews still exist!,2015-12-14,1.0,Administrative Assistant,"Nothing. There is nothing ""pro"" about this company.","More than a year later and still my former position is still open. Justified that losers still don't have a clue on what a good employee is. A good employee isn't there to kiss butt and gossip. A good employee is there to do their job. Now with a better PAYING job with a healthier atmosphere, I'm not sure how I survived for more than a year working at an insane asylum with managers still coming out of diapers, office managers telling lies from another office in another city (jealous much) and mindless weekly calls about nothing but how to do a job, instead of taking that hour and doing the job.

Oh lest not forget how they set you up with these personality test so they can accuse you of things they claim you are due to a fake test. Anyone who really knows the laws of human resources should know that every person has a right to deny such testing without fear or reprisal. I'm not sure how this company is still surviving with such low ethics. I mean below six feet under. How sad is that?

Anyone who has been fortunate enough to get out of this place, now knows the true experience of a professional work environment with employers who know the laws of human resources. I feel sorry for anyone who accepts employment thinking they found a great job with super awesome people. It's definitely a cult environment with people trying to escape as soon as they get the chance. You are lucky if they do the escaping for you by letting you go. However, I will never forget the terrible and abusive experience I had there."
4524,Booking.com,They try really hard to camouflage the negatives of working here.,2015-12-14,3.0,Customer Service Executive,"They offer adequate compensation, and have very nice benefits including quarterly bonuses.  After one year of employment, there are a lot opportunities for advancement.","They promise you a schedule in the phone interview, and then give you something totally different once you're in training.   They are not flexible at all when it comes to the schedule.   

The training program is 5 weeks long, but it doesn't mean much as they change the system so often.  There was a major change in the system the day after we were trained on it, and all they said was, ""Get used to change.""  

There is nothing special about you at Booking.com.  No matter how hard you work, or how high your CSAT (customer satisfaction) is, you are completely replaceable.  The most you get for excelling in CSAT is a pat on the back, and a $25 gift card once in a great while.  

Your employment is solely dependent on your CSAT score.  This is determined by a survey sent to customers via email after contact with you.  More often than not, your dissatisfied surveys are due to the situation, and not your service, but there is no way to dispute this.  Even if the guest leaves a comment that praises the you highly, but clicks dissatisfied by mistake, it still counts as a negative score. 

They constantly promote team effort, and reiterate how important it is to work with your team, but there are no opportunities to do so.  Every score that affects you directly is individual, and the overall team score only affects your team leader's bonus. 

The senior line is the line that you call when you need help in a situation, or a customer requests to speak to the manager.  We are constantly told that we call them too much, and that we need to look at the procedure guidelines before calling, but I sat next to them, and I watch them goof off, and watch Youtube videos all day.

Finally, the team leads.  I'm sure not all of them are as bad as mine, but mine was ridiculous.  She tells us to call her when we need help, but she is never at her desk.  In the one on one feedback sessions, there was no feedback, just the same goal reiterated.   Before our quarterly review, she asked that we tell her what we think our strengths and weaknesses are.  On my review, she copied and pasted my email to her.  Literally made me review myself, and added nothing to it."

Don't expect anything. You're over worked, underpaid and under appreciated.  If you bring this up they will let you know they ""appreciate"" you with a balloon. - Like they did back in kindergarten. - If you use up your break time or personal time you do not get any other time for such things as restroom stops. - They don't offer sick days; you're required to take PTO - and if you don't have any available, you 'borrow' the PTO from the future -bringing you negative - meaning you have to make it up. - You can't be late or they'll use PTO time to make up for that time. - You get written up for everything all the time.

The insurance and 401k are ok as well. If you land a role in an upper management position then this could be a good company.","The pay HORRIBLY and they have very little focus or attention given to retaining talent. There are also very few career growth opportunities, except in the HQ in Amsterdam, but unfortunately Europeans are favored for those roles because they do not require relocation or visas. Americans are especially less likely to get hired for roles in Amsterdam because, even though they pay horribly here, they pay even less there and Americans require higher salaries than locals in Amsterdam. All employees are sent to Amsterdam for the all-company meeting in the winter and they tote this as a perk, but don't kid yourself - flying across the world for a 2 day event and having to fly directly back (and having to spend the majority of those two days in a conference center in windowless rooms (granted with a party at the end) is no perk at all!). Morale is also incredibly low, especially in the office that I work in, but this doesn't seem to be an issue for management, as nothing is done to improve the workplace, despite having received feedback from employees on what could be improved."

Overtime opportunities, 
Free Tazo teas, 
Ping pong table..
If you are stuck looking for a right job for you, this is a great position temporarily. At least you have a job until you find one.","Starting from what is behind Pros of this company: 
Free fruits but most of time they are being rotten (if you work on weekends, you don't get fruits at all sometimes), 
Bonuses but your personality have to be approved (?) by management to get qualified for bonuses after they evaluate it (I'm talking about your personality not your performance, so you'd better play it right when you get hired: Opinions can be perceived as ""negative attitude"". Oh, if you are introverts, the management may think you are being unfriendly with your coworkers, therefore you may not get bonuses you deserve), 
Fun events (potluck, games, etc.) but potlucks has to be brought out of your pocket (if you do not attend this, management may think you are not being friendly with your coworkers. If you bring pre-made stuff from a store, people don't eat them and you are pretty much wasting 10-20 bucks just for that event, also you still have to work as scheduled), 
Overtime opportunities but most of time it is limited, please don't count on this. 
Ping pong table but don't get fooled by fun-environment-looking-office. When a recruiter shows you around the office. If you want to know if CSEs are really liking and enjoying their work, then talk to them directly. 
Other cons:
Remember, this is ""Customer service job"" after all. Yes yes you will encounter very rude people on the phone every single day. I cried on my first day.
There are very limited number of promotion changes. Lots of people leave at the end, very high turnover rate. CSE positions are for people who don't have any other job opportunities, SERIOUSLY. Everyone at cafeteria talks about how they are looking for other jobs right now.
Management tells you not to use cellphone on the floor for security purpose (to protect customer's credit card details) but your team leaders are smirking texting god who knows who/what on their smartphones while you are trying to find a hotel for the guest who just lost their reservation because the hotel was overbooked and needs a room right now. Then your team leader will kindly tell you later that you were not being that productive. 
If one of your colleagues confront your team leader about their cell phones, do not expect that our opinion will matter or change the mindset of the management. Remember, you cannot change a thing when it comes to a management.
Do not have opinions, don't be honest with the management, just act as if you are super happy to be there just for your own sake. Play cards right. It doesn't matter how hard you are trying to get better at what you do, the management will still make you feel like you are not good enough for their team if your numbers are not great. 
Most importantly, please do not get sick. I know it's almost 2016, and we live in USA but please do not get sick and miss work if you don't want to get terminated once your penalty points are accumulated up to 3. Please note your doctors note does not matter."

- the company has very high expectations from its workers which is causing self-destruction, costumer service executives are expected to be fast and having high satisfaction score however this is impossible because when they expect you to be fast, you cannot give the care to customer you would like to as you need to meet the target each month. We are struggling it each month and lots of my colleague resigned from doing great job as they been pushed by team leaders and management to be faster so thee are but service is much worse. it is shame.
- the company is not able to value people with loyalty and people who have been working in company for while as they treat every one same way. I am not that long there but I have colleagues who have been there for while but they have no benefit from that in comparison with others. 
- as the company does not really have any loyalty plan, there is abnormally high fluctuation - lots of people leaving and lots of people coming. 
- in UK Cambridge office, the career for non-english speakers is more complicated. I suspect that UK office is the only one having so many UK people in management. Unfortunately from my experience, English character is very tough and the lack of understanding for multicultural environment is sometimes very perceptible. When you really need a help or you get into the trouble because of your healthy conditions, you cannot expect any extra mile neither help and this also depends on your team leader. Lot of them pretend they do care about you but it is much easier to say than do. 
- Yes, you are expected to behave in their standard so it means you cannot show your nature as they would feel highly uncomfortable. You have to often pretend that everything is so great and be smiling even it is not true.

 The Team Leads do not want to help, they want you to de-escalate a call so that they don't have to take it. Everything is constantly changing and not all of management can agree upon the correct procedure. No cell phones are allowed, but you see management on them all of the time. Do NOT be 1 minute late, literally, they will give you points. They care about how many calls you take and not the quality of handling the call.

If you apply to another position within the company, whether in the same department or the hotel department, you will get a rejected for some made up reasons and you will be denied further applications to the same position for another 6 months.
It's a number driven company obsessed with graphs and charts. Assessments are based on objective values which are then determined by your team leader based on what you've done (how do you assess how humble someone is?)
You will be assessed and your numbers compared with others in the company and if you are not doing as well then you'll be watched like a hawk.
But the turnover in the company is so high that people are always leaving and management does not hire anyone new to help with the workload, instead they expect those still working there to take on extra work.
There is no balance between work and personal life, you're always either at work or at home waiting to go to work because the work hours are so erratic and their planning department cannot plan peoples schedules merely putting the same people on the same rotation, so you could be working 2 weekends every month and someone else working none."

The guest was the priortity and internal advancement was open to all employees.,"Unfortunately, Booking.com Orlando has become that dreaded U.S. Call center. Regardless of how you treat the guest with the best service possible the metrics are all that matter. The CSAT (customer survey) is not applicable just to the CSE but the CSE is held accountable for the survey even if it has nothing to do with their proformance and if the survey is low then you are written up on a 90 day write up for a 30 day metrics report. Completely unfair to the CSE - upper management does not seem to care or take this into consideration. I have worked for Bookng.com for 2yrs. I was in love with my job it was a family but now I hate getting out of bed and going to work. Think about it when 80 employees are fired in one month for no good reason just because upper management feels they are not being productive although they are and have been the original staff that has helped with bring Booking.com to the U.S. status it currently is in. There is no consideration for the employee!  This is when you know that you need to leave and not refer anyone to work at Booking.com because you do not want for this unhappiness to happen to anyone else."

4584,Booking.com,"If Booking needs you, you don't need Booking",2015-10-14,2.0,Systems Administrator,"In honesty, the Booking IT department has a couple of things in its favor. The job is not demanding, most team leaders are reasonable (and you can put in for a transfer) and the relocation perks to Amsterdam are noteworthy. In other words: Booking.com is an excellent way to immigrate to Europe, and get a foothold in the job market here. For that, it gets the one star.","The lack of vision in general is easily attributable to the company being unchallenged on its existence for over a decade. In the absence of a vision, everybody is just maintaining the status quo, not coming up with new ideas and not doing anything to improve upon things. Because why would they?     


This applies to everything. Management is becoming less and less connected to what happens on the floor, and technical reasoning is virtually absent. While the people are generally reasonably skilled, the 80% expat staff composition means that nobody has a safety net to complain... and even if you do say no, some new guy will step up and (naively) say yes. Voilá, structurally ensured bad decision-making.     


The CIO is keen on repeating (and you can even see that dogmatism leak into the positive IT reviews here?) that Booking is ""not a technology company."" Considering that this is from the Chief Information Officer, it's not entirely unfair to conclude that it fails even at being even an Information Technology company -- it only has the offices, perks and explosive growth of one. Underneath the hood, it's looking a  bit like a stock market adventure, or a perl hacker's playground, depending on job title. Some people are really caught up in this, and can't discern factoid from fact anymore.

Tragicomically, the one thing Booking would benefit most from would be exactly that: being a technology company. Booking is troubled with problems on a daily basis that you wouldn't believe could exist in a space between 750 capable programmers, and still, it refuses to modernize what is, essentially, an engorged LAMP stack tracing back to its company beginnings.     

For anyone considering applying there, and for that matter for the cleverer heads who haven't jumped ship yet, I have to pose the question of whether you think that Booking is good for your career as an IT professional. Nobody else wants perl. Nobody else wants a shell cowboy. How long will the illusion last?"

The CSM level management were never responsible for the failures within the site and when asked to show their management scores and how the Team Leaders felt about their management skills, these were never shown. 
Failures due to their poor management and interpersonel skills resulted in a lot of bad decisions and minimal support to their staff. 
Many members of staff go off with stress and depression and are harassed to come back to work and made to feel like they have to justify why they are off. 
They are then not given support and guidance that they need, but branded and tainted as ones to watch. 
If you dare to disagree with decisions or procedures, you will not go far and you will be on the list of trouble makers. 
The comapny has got too big too quick and you are not a person anymore like when they started out. You are just another person in a seat and no discretion is given in any scenario.

Most tools you use are built internally, so even though every employee has to start from scratch when hired, from understanding the logic of their tooling, you understand the company better as a whole. This company runs on change and A/B testing, so for someone who likes procedure and strict structure, this might not be the organization for you. But for someone who likes to feel like they have a voice at their company, someone who appreciates executive transparency, and for someone who thrives as an independent worker then this company and role may be a great fit.

My favorite part of the role was that I was the CEO of my own market and designed my strategies of how to optimize the performance of my partners based on my knowledge and observation. I felt empowered by my management to take challenges head on and not be afraid to fail, which is refreshing for such a large corporation.

I meet and work with people from all over the world.  

I travel to the Central Coast of California often.

Office culture has been extremely welcoming, fun, and down to earth.

There is a lot of autonomy and responsibility; I feel I am growing professionally in a supportive atmosphere.

Some people get promoted only because they are in close relation with Team Leaders/Managers but not because they really deserve it or super talented.
Any reasonable complaint made about TL normally wasn't considered, however if you're an agent and make once something wrong even though you didn't mean to - you're on the street.
In one year things went from ""Very good"" to ""Very bad"", was hard to see it especially when you loved this place so much before.

Some managers just don't know how to get the potential of their people. They don't even give them a shot to try them. It's amazing how you are appraised; they just see you the way they like no matter how you try. The best part is the hiring process either in Accounting or FP&A; they hire people that share their thoughts and attitude rather than they seek diversity and creating a wide mix of minds to truly become global teams. To be fair not all of them are that bad but it's just unfortunate to see it happening and they are still there.

Managers often don't know achievements of their teams, quarterly, yearly reviews are done based on emotions not facts. There is no clear bonus structure.

4676,Booking.com,Don't Drink That Blue Kool-Aid,2015-07-13,1.0,,You will make some life-long friends. Yearly trip to Amsterdam. They used to have a strong internal training program but that has since been scraped.,"Management was so incredibly inept. The whole purpose and potential for a rewarding and stimulating career or any sort of personal development gets lost in office politics or mean girl behavior reminiscent of a really lame high school. The only people who can tolerate it are those who are skilled and shameless kiss-ups and those who are unable or unwilling to speak up. It is also an incredibly inefficient workplace. They absolutely refuse to consider using SalesForce but instead rely on a ridiculous internally developed CRM like tool (that doesn't work) and countless google docs...no joke. However, they want everything to be tracked. All the tools that were rolled out during my tenure lack the functionality to be of any use, and we were expected to develop our own work arounds. 
You will work hard and hustle for a salary that does not allow you to live comfortably. Your quarterly bonus, if you overachieve and totally kill it, will be less the 2k. But it is pretty unlikely that you will hit the impossibly high targets. 
Turnover is very high due to the extremely low morale and demoralizing office environment. Management had been making a concerted effort to push seasoned employees out despite strong performances and proven results. Those who hadn't found better opportunities were unceremoniously laid off with out notice. Since they had no grounds for termination, they were required to pay out severance to all. If you have integrity or self-respect, I would highly suggest looking elsewhere. It may seem like a cool place to work at at first...casual workplace, yearly trip to Amsterdam, etc. But don't be fooled. The smart and talented people leave. It is not worth the laughable salary, which is significantly below market standards. There are hundreds of other AM positions out there that allow for a positive work environment, development, self-respect, respect from your superiors and peers, etc. Plus they will pay you what you are worth and then you can treat yourself to a cool trip to Amsterdam, and not be subjected to all the Booking blue BS. 
Lastly, and almost possibly most disturbing, is the impenetrable glass ceiling that is in effect. Booking.com has a very significant female majority. Rarely is a female promoted into any leadership role. Although I cannot imagine any of the women currently in mid-management would be any better than those running the show."

4680,Booking.com,Reasons why NOT to work at Bcom,2015-07-11,1.0,Customer Service Executive,Amazing people who are working there. I'm very sorry that they all continue to work in this company.,"***Crazy shifts. (I was hired for a flex shift, which means, you work 8h in a period between 7 am and 11:30 pm. Regardless the fact that HRs tell you about preferences which you set in the system, you NEVER ever get the normal time. I worked there for 6 month, every month I had to work both 7 am and 3 pm shifts). Company demands a high productivity regardless you physical or health condition, regardless if you begin at 7 in the morning or finish at 11:30 at night. If you are sick, be sure, you will have to report to your sickness to your TL afterwards in details. TL usually press on you and if you have a trouble, or need at least 30 min per day off calls - forget. Nobody cares. You need a holiday? Forget. Of course, you can apply for holidays, but don't expect to get a day off within first 9-10 months of work. 
***Salary. Depending on your tax rate, the least you can earn netto is 990 EUR. There is a quarter bonus. You DON'T get it, if: you are ever late for more than 1 min (!)., you were sick for more than 7 hours. Enjoy. 
***Prospectives and opportunities. They promise you loads of opportunities within the company. Bad bad lie. Prepare yourself to work 1 year or more (only answering calls and sending templates, no other actions), and IF there will be a blessing from you TL and - attention - a LANGUAGE QUOTA in your office, only then perhaps they will allow you to apply for a better position. But it's of course not a guarantee that in the end you will get the new job.

Nice office, free coffee & fruits and that's about it!
The office and especially restrooms are crowded due to 450 employees has been working there.","Booking has insufficient employees Performance evaluation by Productivity and Guest Satisfaction. Expectations the following: Productivity - no less than 5.5 guests per hour and Satisfaction -at least - 95%.Looks easy but don't be happy. The company is overwhelmed with guests' complains due to the very strange way of them running their business. When guests enter their Credit Card on Booking website they believe they pay Booking so when they call Booking with questions about charges or room related questions Booking cannot answer it as Booking doesn't charge guests. Booking reps have to investigate and to seek the answer from hotels what takes some time.That way of doing their business creates a lot of frustrations with the guests and a lot of guests complains. How will you achieve your Productivity and Guest Satisfaction if you are on the phone with the same guest for 2 hours because hotel cannot find guest booking or cannot accommodate guest with the right room or has no any room available to accommodate the guest? You must find the solution like some alternate hotel (if you are able to) and then to advise guest to book it online quickly because you cannot book it for the guest!!! I have never seen such craziness in my life. I have been working in travel company and in Hotel reservation before and it was easy, simple and enjoyable - answer guests questions and proceed with booking. That is not the case in Booking.

Second huge con is super inexperienced young Management. Management knows the Booing operating system they know the company business policy but they have no idea how to manage all that diverse people. Due to the rapid company growth they promote to management positions within company to save the money on experience outsiders. Your manager can be 23-27 years person from oversees who has never been a manager and has no idea what is appropriate and what is not by US workplace culture standards. For example you can be ordered on your lunch time to go walking on the parking lot to manage your stress and frustrations from bad customers. But then when are you going to eat your lunch? And you have only 10 minutes a day for your personal needs ( like restrooms). And if you maximize it you better drink less water and go less otherwise you'll get negative points toward your attendance. If you get sick and even bring medical doctor paper they'll still count a missed day as a negative point on your attendance.  And if you are not in your 20-th like most of Booking employees and you are older and experienced and respect yourself you will not feel good about being under such management and under such army rules. The pay in Booking is very low that's why most of the employees young or immigrants for who it is OK to start with $13/h. Don't be fool with all those free coffees & fruits and free lunches. Find the company that will pay you enough to buy your lunches coffees and fruits."

- to have been a part of a growing and market leading company","-management, managers, managers..!!
There are no words that can describe the sadness of seeing a great company not investing and finding good managers. 
Promoting someone just because you are friends with the managers is not ok. A manager needs to have managements skills and willingness to be a manager for the team, not just apply for the job just for the title!! Someone wrote in a previous post that the company is like high school and unfortunately I find it's worse. than that
 It's like a kindergarden where kids are playing in a sandbox and choosing and deciding over their colleagues work career and life.
The company sends out a survey each year since they want to know how everything is going, (this is supposedly anonymous) and even though the managers I had and the office in general got a low score the company did NOTHING to change the situation. 
70% of the staff in the office where i worked quit their jobs during one year and went to other companies and still nothing happens from the higher management! 
Booking.com just hired new people  (younger and younger,  so they can be formed in to the Booking Blue format)  that gets off on the fact that there is a big party each year and freaky fridays. 
Before everyone was working together to achieve the targets set - a goal to make the company grow.
Now you are just a number, that was hired to sell, sell and sell. 
We needed to get a good relationship with the hotels, but the hotelier could not call or write us but we would call them 2-3 times a week and on top of that also go visit. imploring them to do deals and similar just to get our numbers.
Nothing of the commercial part was left in the end, only selling.

Im sure Booking.com will continue to loose good and serious employees due to this . My advice is to see that Booking.com is a good school, do a year there and then take your knowledge and go to another comapny that will treat and pay you better!"

Lunch is a part of your contract. Fresh fruits, coffee and tea available.
The international big team gives you an opportunity to meet people from different cultures and change experience.
Modern office in a city centre.","The weakest point is lack of transparency in any field.
It begins from poor quality of middle management (Team Leaders), but it is not surprising because the salary they get is a joke for this kind of position, so the company is not attractive for good quality and experience managment.
Than the bonus structure, which is part of your contract like to be amended anytime and is getting to the non-transparent direction, so at the end your Team Leader decides what kind of bonus you will get (not your described by numbers work). It is lot of favourism and if you have not good relations with your direct manager, you have a problem.
Than comes promotions to the higher positions (extremely limited, only in Amsterdam it is better). As per experience, it seems that there is no competition, but only the correct persons shown by the management. It is sometimes very sad to see who is promoted at this company if you know the previous quality of this person work...
If you were good enough for the management, and you were lucky to be promoted, you can be surprised, because after the promotion you can see your payment slip and you earn less than before, on the lower position... It is extremely not motivating.
Does not metter who you are, what is your experience and soft skills, they will hire you. Now they take people from the street. It is frustrating for experience employees and very fast put down the quality of the service.

4720,Booking.com,Poor management,2015-06-03,2.0,Account Manager,"*Travel
*Young, vibrant colleagues
*Free food, lunches, snacks, booze","*Management that has never managed before and should never manage.  If you accept a position here, be prepared to lose some self-worth as management expects colleagues to be fully skilled upon hiring.  One office just opened and has seen every employee turn over except for ONE manager (who might be part of the problem).
*Poor work-life balance.  My favorite quote from a colleague: ""I've always been an expert at time management until I got to Booking.""  You are told to change direction daily and to avoid your emails in order to complete other tasks.  At the end of the day, you have 70+ emails from hotels and no time to enjoy your own life.  
*One pillar is ""Keep the Customer at the Center of Everything You Do,"" but the offices do not walk the walk.  A hotel will email asking for assistance, but you can get to it because you're doing a hundred other things.  You are told not to answer the phone, but to continue calling and harassing hotels to meet your goals.  Others can wait until these goals are met.  The bottom line is the center of everything the hotels department does.
*No training- At some point the training department was cancelled all together, so new colleagues are trained in office and pretty much thrown to the wolves.  You will get in trouble for something you didn't even know was your job and that you had never even seen before.  I hear that there used to be full training before you even got to the local offices.  Now it's the blind leading the blind.
*While there, they cancelled a position.  I mean, told forty something people that their job would not exist in 3 months and  to figure out what they want to do next.  How does this make employees feel valued when their job is gone in a blink of an eye?  Worst part is, this was a management position and the folks in the jobs were some of the most admired and trusted associates.  All gone now.
*They keep the salaries low and tempt you with bonus' that end up being unobtainable.  They even decide to change the bonus with 10 days left to the quarter!"

4728,Booking.com,Working at Booking.com for Dummies,2015-05-22,5.0,,"I have been working for Booking.com for just under a year. I have seen a lot that goes on here, and I am going to tell you everything you need to know about it. 
 
Booking.com has been at this location for about 15 months now. They are growing at an incredible speed, and there is a lot of change going on. This can be good and bad. Growing fast means a lot of hiring for every position in the office. You hear other companies say that they “hire/promote from within” and then nothing ever happens.. That is the complete opposite about this company. I have seen people start as Customer Service Representatives and then become seniors, quality associates, recruiting assistants, trainers, team leads, and even Operations managers. True Story. If you are motivated, a team player, energetic, adaptable, and put a smile on your face while providing customer service the best you can.. You will be promoted, and that’s not just for the Seattle/Bellevue office. You can transfer to any location you can imagine… Again.. True story. And remember Booking.com is an international company, with offices all around the world.  
 
Booking.Change- Change can be hard for some people. Some people need those concrete instructions, and it’s hard for them to adapt when something fluctuates. This is a newer company in the Greater Seattle Area and they are still trying to work out a couple kinks. They are hiring a lot of new people who might be trying to figure out the best way to manage their employees.  The training has changed a lot since they opened. The interview process has changed a couple times. They have switched from one Customer Service program to another just a couple months ago. They are still trying to figure out the correct/fair way to distribute different shifts throughout the day. 
 
Having said all that. All this change is a good thing too. You can sincerely tell that this company cares about their employees. Booking provides these huge Starbucks machines that make you anything you want. Anything. Free fresh fruit delivered every morning. An Xbox one with comfy lounge chairs everywhere, can you say FIFA tournament? A ping pong table. Even a Shuffleboard table. This office is gorgeous. Bright, open, and also has one of the best views of Seattle I’ve seen.. From Bellevue. Tuition reimbursement, Travel reimbursement, ORCA Cards, Free Parking. New Monitors, headsets, Ergonomic Office desks, and Chairs. Company sporting events, company sport teams, hiking clubs, and board game clubs. What else can you ask for? I know what you are thinking.. “Great we are just sitting down all day and can’t get any exercise?” Would a onsite gym be what you are looking for? Because they have that too. But wait- What about benefits…? They give us great benefits, and 401K. Booking.com does this because they know people with a lot to offer want to work for companies that have empathy, enthusiasm, and have a progressive culture. 

I should probably also mention that employees are often hired in as a Contingent staff members. I know this can be hard for some people because you don’t know what can happen.. You might need to quit your other job to take this one.. What happens if you don’t get transitioned into a Booking.com employee? Is that possible? Of course it is.. But I know that Booking.com truly has full intentions to hire everyone that goes through training. It’s just up to you when you start. Be on time, willing to learn, stay positive, and provide that outstanding Customer Service, and you could transition from a Contingent staff member to a Booking.com employee in less than 3 months.  This means that in those first couple months, you are building up towards being a Booking.com employee and receiving the full benefits package. 

Scheduling. Dun. Dun. Dun!!! Scheduling can be difficult. But so can we. You might have a harder schedule for a couple months, but you will get an opportunity to bid to change it. The scheduling team seems to be very accommodating for bus schedules after training, and approve most vacations I have seen. The office is open from 6:00AM-11:30PM Monday-Sunday so you won’t ever work overnight.. But when it comes down to it; this is a job. A good job. If you want to get involved in a good company, and grow just as fast as the office does.. I think you can stick it out.  Typically, when a person first joins us, they are asked to work the 2nd shift and to work weekends at times.
 
Training is a blast. You are bombarded with culture. Around 25 new hires are in a classroom setting and you will be trained on most if not all of the questions and calls you will receive. The trainers are amazing. Very outgoing, very positive, and extremely helpful. This company invests in their employees, and it all starts with how you are trained. You will be nervous the first day, but who isn’t. By graduation, you will be hanging out outside of work with the same people you didn’t know 5 weeks earlier. 
 
Management is very supportive, devoted, and dependent on your success.. They all have different styles of management, but from my perspective they all work. All of the Team Leads are friendly, and actually care about their teams. The operation managers, HR, and higher ups are always thinking of new ways to show their appreciation to the office, and the success the office has had. They all walk the floors and you wouldn’t be able to tell who is who unless you asked. They even could just sit next to you for the day and work there… Pretty cool. 
 
Hope this answers any of the questions, or concerns you might have.","The pay is a little low. That can be hard. But what do you truly want out of your job, and your life? Extra money, or waking up happy knowing you are going to a place that respects and appreciates what you do."

-Unattainable targets set by far away Amsterdam that change at any given moment, sometimes in the middle of the quarter due to error in forecasting by local SAMs
-Sometimes even told to abandon our actual goals for bonus structure ENTIRELY to further the advancement of company's main initiatives
-Sometimes main initiatives require us to annoy and strongarm partners to the point of making employees feel desperate, upset and pretty much losing every ounce of passion when encountering our upset partners.  Leadership team cannot offer any helpful guidance because we try every which way and they know we're pretty much set up for failure but probably can't say it outloud.
-Mandated use and tracking of a terrible excuse for an internal, homegrown salesforce (Booking can totally fork over the cash for what a company like Salesforce does best than thinking we should spend our resources and time on a broken system to optimize opportunity and revenue)
-Upper hierarchy essentially mandating terribly executed micromanaging tactics that leave the entire local office from top to bottom to not trust anything and anyone 
-SAMs aren't able to work together, not sure why when they are wonderful individuals and aren't allowed to manage teams due to being overworked and micromanaged themselves
-50% travel alongside change to Friday meetings are set up poorly and burn employees out fast

-recruiting is backlogged and can't send the best candidates for such a reputable company or folks realize that they shouldn't even try

I waited 2 years to write this review thinking that after a while I would be less angry and write a more neutral review of the company that I spent about 2 years with.  However, the bad feelings are still so strong that I know I will be writing a very negative review of this company!  Mainly, because NOTHING has changed!  You guys really need to start reading these reviews and taking them seriously or the talented people that you keep tricking into working here won't be around to trick anymore!

If you think you can get promoted and advance in your career here, think again!  Unless, of course, you are best buds with upper management and get invited to family brunch on Sundays (that's right family).  Meaning if you are not related to and/or at least the same ethnicity of management you will not get promoted.  If you find yourself in the same boat I was in, e.g. not either of these things you better be prepared to brown nose.  

This company is ALL about quantity!  Get more hotels on the site!  That is their chant!  Never mind the fact that the market is saturated and all that are left to acquire are small B&Bs and uncommon accommodations (what are these? - basically anything with a bed!).  All about the almighty dollar, huh Booking?  Speaking of dollars, you will make enough money to barely pay rent and you will stress about your bills every month!  Thanks Booking! (NOT!)- Oh what's that another trip to Amsterdam where all the employees get deathly ill, sure that will make up for everything....

This company also loves to create new roles, which sounds great until they decide that they no longer need that position and just get rid of it!  Oh yeah, that happened!  Twice in about a 2 year span.  At least when your position no longer exists you get out, but let's say that you are foolish enough to try to stay at this company.  Of course, you can apply to a new position, but then you better not expect to make the same amount of money...oh yeah remember when I said that you barely make any money to begin with, well Booking would prefer to lessen your income by at least $10K!  

If this is not enough information to make you start considering other avenues to start a career, then take a look at the other 90 reviews on here that are all basically saying the same stuff."

You will not be supported what so ever if your management and their family members don't like you, they will bully you and treat you like you have a contagious disease.

They have no shame in gossiping and talking about you right in your face. Making the work environment extremely uncomfortable and impossible to get anything done

They throw you out to lions giving you this spiel about nourishing and maintaining partner relationships. Not true your partners will be lucky if they see or talk to their account manger a few times a year. With their lovely new DXI phone system, partners have no direct way of calling their market manager and there is no possibility of leaving a voice mail. Partners call and get some random person that answers the phone and in a few inexperienced words, that employee can ruin all the hard work and time their manager has put in to that account

To Booking.com it all about pleasing their stockholders. It's just a numbers game quantity vs quality. Factory work"

HR division was also completely incompetent, which resulted in errors in payroll almost every month..."
4824,Booking.com,Account Managers- eggs about to crack!,2014-12-31,2.0,Account Manager,"As an Account Manager, the job itself isn't exactly mind bending or overly complicated (technically speaking).  Working with some great hotel partners, networking and gaining real industry knowledge is great.

Friendly co-workers, sense of team work amongst those of same job title, fun office activities, catered lunch, good benefits (but pay is below industry standard), and annual trip to Amsterdam.","In the U.S. there is a new structure in place where Account Managers have to be out of the office every other week with every Friday as an in office day to have all day long meetings.  So, what does that mean? I'm already in this constant state of being stressed out from having to schedule 20 meetings with clients in a week (M-TH), have team meeting and office meetings on Friday, having to follow up from those client meetings, while then having to start all over and schedule meetings again for the next week out.  Then, throw in the added work of doing pricing all day long when you are in the office (and being told that you can't do anything else, even though you still have responsibility to partners to fix their escalated customer service issues, and respond to any other inquiries they may send you). All in the meanwhile, targets and focus seem to change from week to week, or even from day to day! Senior Account Managers offer little to no support and are being told from upper management to micro-manage the heck out of us.  EVERYTHING IS TRACKED now, and even though they keep saying ""oh, we are not tracking you"" THEY ARE and they just won't admit it. There are invisible quotas.   I still haven't figured out why.  I think upper management now has this general distrust of the AM team, when I know full well all of us (at least in my office) are sharp and very skilled at what we do and we all have good relationships with our partners.  

Back to the travel schedule - trying to prepare, schedule and meet 5 partner visits a day, 4 days a week is just draining.  By Wednesday I am so tired from talking to people, thinking about what I am going to say to them, showing them the reports, and then actioning and doing follow up that I just want to fall into a blackhole and disappear.  It's exhausting and I don't know how long I will last like this. I really really hate this.

Last, the bonus and how things are calculated - I think they must be consulting with the government's education department because it's like common core math for business.  Here's an idea: give us individual targets based in reality and then we won't be left to guess where we stand in reaching whatever % of our salary to be paid as bonus.  

In summary, the AM team is underpaid, overstressed, and demoralized to the fact that we are being micro-managed to the point of mistrust, when there is no reason to mistrust.  It is very sad, because when I first started a couple years ago it was not like this.  I like my office, my co-workers, the benefits and my hotel partners. 

This egg might crack soon."

- The company is growing and there is no end in sight. The CEO is very smart and is setting up some interesting things for the industry.","- The job you are hired for is not the job you will end up doing and the company fails to train you adequately for the transition. 
- Goals and Targets change radically from quarter to quarter so there is no way to adequately know if you will be getting your bonus that quarter.
- Upper management is super cliquey and people advance based on who they are friends with, not on the merits of their skills.
- Booking has frozen most of their hiring and is forcing their employees to move to their new offices across the country. They sell this as an opportunity and offer a ""generous"" relocation package but this has become the only way to advance in the company. Managers constantly imply that you are selfish if you want to stay within your own office and grow your career there. Additionally realize that people are willing to move if you provide good opportunities for them, not just the same job in some nowhere town.
- Pay is low for the stress of the job.
- Booking is moving to micromanaging your day by monitoring every phone call you make every day. I didn't get into this business to be measured on my sales volume. I got in it to serve the hotels and make sure they are making a good profit off of us (and us them).

The environment is extremely stressful, they try to squeeze every possible drop of life from you without providing the necessary tools. There is no investment on the customer care department, there is no training, they do not improve your knowledge in any way. 
There are a lot of actual and former employees with legal issues with the company, even when you finally earn (by law, after the 3rd renewal) a permanent contract, they do not hesitate to fire you or to put you in the condition to resign, which is of course illegal. Proof of it is the number of legal actions that Booking.com lost against former employees in the last years, and counting.
Furthermore, working here doesn't improve your CV, everybody in the Netherlands knows that this company does not add anything to your previous experience. 
There is no way to stimulate your creativity, actually whenever you try to come out with something new you are pushed away by the laziest management I have ever seen.

This company should just focus on at least meeting the market rate in terms of salary. Don't get a below market salary and then try to ""make up for it"" but giving us random junk.
- Brainwashing of the brand and culture, you're either in or not.
- I get that this is an online brand and things are always changing, but quit changing ""standard procedures"" every other month. How do you expect to ""keep a standard"" if you keep changing it. Literally, always get an e-mail saying ""we change how we do this, we do it like this now""
- This company prides itself in providing ""higher trainings"" but then they say their ""too busy"" ""peak period"" and then cancel all trainings.

If it weren't so uncomfortable it would be amusing.  It's all smoke and mirrors folks.  If you drink the Kool-aid you'll be okay for a while, until you realize that what you are being told could not be further from the truth.  You WON'T get promoted unless you are friends with the right people.  You will NEVER earn as much as you would at another OTA.  Keep your head down, your mouth shut and find another job ASAP.

It's nice to have free lunch once a month and bar hop on the company but what does that do for your quality of life?"
4866,Booking.com,Booking.com more like Booking.bombed!,2014-10-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Well if you consider clueless , lying deceitful gossiping management a pro. you will fit right in!","Firstly if you are a person that values your work, does a good job, is responsible, is goal and career oriented, don't count on being promoted or have room to grow.

At Booking.com promotions are only given to:
Family members, lots of nepotism and favoritism going on there
If you happen to belong to same ethnicity senior management
If you are the ultimate brown noser  who goes out for drinks after work and get plastered with your seniors 
If you are invited to Sunday family parties
If you enjoy gossiping like an immature teenager and  putting people down on a regular basis 

Then.... no matter how little experience you have, how absolutely incompetent you are and  how little you value your work, Congratulations!! You will be promoted 

The pay much lower then the industry standards. In your interview you will be informed about the possibility of earning a bonus . They don't tell you that the structure and outline for the bonus changes like upper management change their underwear!  Making it impossible to achieve and if are lucky enough to get a bonus the money you earn will barely be enough to cover a tank of gas!. Hard work is expected but not rewarded 

Forget about having any support from HR, they are located in an office far far way (seeing nothing that is going on in the local offices) HR will turn a blind eye toward any unfair mistreatment of employees. Equal Opportunity Employer, Booking .com?? that couldn't be further  from the truth. You will not be supported what so ever if your management and their family members don't like you, they will bully you and  treat you like you have a contagious disease. 

They have no shame in gossiping and talking about you right in your face. Making the work environment extremely uncomfortable and impossible to get anything done

They throw you out to lions giving you this spiel about nourishing and maintaining partner relationships. Not true your partners will be lucky if they see or talk to their account manger a few times a year. With their lovely new DXI phone system, partners have no direct way of calling their market  manager and there is no possibility of leaving a voice mail. Partners call and get some random person that answers the phone and in a few inexperienced words, that employee can ruin all the hard work and time their manager has put in to that account

To Booking.com it all about pleasing their stockholders. It's just a numbers game quantity vs quality. Factory work"

Things I like about working here:
- I've never worked on a project I didn't believe in. You're given the freedom and respect to work on the tasks you believe add value to the customers
- I've never had a deadline. It's about identifying problems and designing solutions that can be proven to work through data. Insight and quality have no timeline and the company understands and allows for that. 
- Great colleagues. There are a lot of incredibly smart people that are enthusiastic about their work. It's infectious and positive. 
- Career-growth opportunities. There are many ways to move up in the company such as becoming a product owner, team leader, or senior designer. Internal and external training opportunities and one-on-one meetings with your managers support that growth. 
- Work/life balance. The managers, team mates, and product owners at Booking.com care about you as a human and don't treat you a like a ""resource"" to the business. If you're sick or pushing yourself too hard they will encourage you to relax and take care of yourself. They truly want to have happy, healthy people. 
- It's a flat structure. Everyone's opinion matters and good ideas come from everyone, everywhere. Even though there are job titles that imply some kind of structure, I've never, ever seen anyone pull ""rank"" to put down a thought or another employee. It's an environment based on mutual respect and learning.","There are growing pains. 
- As with anything that grows quickly in a short amount of time, there is a lot of fluidity in the teams and office structure. You have to be as dynamic as the company to thrive here."

Well my friend, sign the dotted line and in six months you too can see how chaotic and unorganized things are. As you update your LinkedIn and come up with a clever excuse as to why you need a new job after only 6 months you can reflect as to how much that dress code and holiday party mean to you and your personal sanity. 

In a nutshell: it's like backwards innovation and tooling, mediocre leadership stretched too thin, and poor compensation that make it intolerable to stay here longer than a few years. Combine this with a call center approach to a corporate office and its Booking.com's recipe for an employee retention disaster. There is no one on one account management support any longer as promised to partners. The foundational elements and values are changing after ten years. Explain that to your several hundred thousands of partners. There is a new phone system that chooses the poor sucker who is in available status and mandates they answer calls related to another slackers market who is not available. Yet this person is available and sits at their desk and streams the latest sports event or Nicki Minaj music video. Completely serious. A corporate office of account management for the worlds largest travel site with no voice mail for their clients to reach out to. This results in mediocre service across the board, sticky notes on desks, and just general discontent among employees. 

Internal promotions are a joke when it comes to compensation. It's a 10% increase. If you want to strain yourself you might get 11% and a free migraine! Wahoo! Relocation- no problem best of luck if you can afford it after the one year supplemental package has wore off. 

In a nut shell. Apply to the competition if you want to work for a travel site. Work hard, get paid hard. Or you can come here and just work hard. Nothing else."

The vacation setups are horrible: you usually have to ask for vacation days at least 3 months in advance and you will probably never get more than two or three subsequent vacation days because the software they use to allocate vacations just wont let you. Theres a crazy amount of pressure on you to perform, even when you are well above the goal they have set for you. 

They do offer you a lot of great things: free lunch, freebies, fruit etc, but once youre working for them you know why: the pay is barely above minimum wage and you have to deal with the hierarchy, high expectations (to get bonuses) and plenty of overbookings and demanding customers on a daily basis."

Steady income.,"Where to begin with the cons. Have you ever seen the movie ""Mean girls,"" or the 80's movie ""Heathers""? These movies are about one small click ruling the entire school and no one is allowed in this click, or accepted if the click doesn't approve. This is exactly what this office is like, except the click isn't  your coworkers, they are upper management, or the "" leadership team"" as they like to call themselves. No one can move up within the office unless you bow down and become their puppet. They pretend to be your friend and give you the sense to trust, until they get all they need from you and hang you out to dry. They give you false hopes of moving up, ask you for advice on projects and insight to take the credit for themselves later. Starting from the area manager to the seniors. They all greet you with fake smiles, and set up agendas to get rid of you. If you want to be part of this office and move up, I have some advice. Join all their soul cycling classes, and sing along to all their songs while at the office, this is the only way they will take you seriously.  In the end it doesn't matter what you do, if they don't like you, you are out of there. It doesn't matter how much you have done, it doesn't matter how much you know about the job. They rather hire people from the outside for a position than promote from within, but part of the formula is no outsourcing.. Sounds a bit contradicting if you ask me. but hey, what do I know, I'm just a person who proved their worth for years and continuously was told No, only because I chose not to have stool breath from kissing theirs."

Still poor salary and no difference at the end if you are a great agent or just doing your job. The percentage in the bonus is so small that you have not really more in your pocket, even you had much better results as your colleagues. The way of company ""We want to satisfy everyone"" is wrong in my opinion. A lot of people who doing nothing or bad job because nothing there has any consequence.

Cambridge office is run very much like a dictatorship, rules that exist here do exist in other offices. 
The CSM's do not lead by example, they never work evenings, one of them never works at weekends (despite the fact we are ALL supposed to work a minimum of 2), they NEVER work bank holidays, everyone else is FORCED to do a minimum amount. 
It is clear that higher management have no idea how low the morale of staff is in Cambridge though, when a visit is expected suddenly the managers become 'Booking Blue' as soon as the higher managers leave the management revert back to their usual selves.

Once you have worked at Booking.com, you can work anywhere","Ouch where to start....
- Account managers: absolutely NO work life balance. 50% travels means that when you are in the office that's a minimum of 12+ hours/day, when you are out of the office, you are basically working until midnight EVERYDAY with barely a lunch break. Not even to mention working during weekends. Management encourages you to leave on time but work demanded does not fit in a day. Oh and when you actually manage to get everything done working crazy hours you are blamed not to take additional initiatives... Do NOT ever wish to get a major market as this means additional projects, pressure and stress. As a matter of fact when i left nobody volunteered to take over my nb 1 market for the office...
- Great company if you like to show off, tell the word how great you are and what an amazing job you do (you dont actually need to do a good job, just say you do). This is actually against the official company policy....what happened to 'work horses versus show ponies'??
- Promotions based on 'who you know' basis.
- Micro management, even if you work 12h a day +, but one day you dont make 10 acquisition calls and report the notes (because on the road you dont have internet everywhere), say bye bye to your bonus. You need to justify everything, every call, every action.
- The role of an account manager has become a call center; where all your calls and emails are tracked very closely. No consideration for the employees you are just a dot that they place wherever and whenever they need you. 

Funny enough I had recommended one of my friend, which i regretted 6 months later as she was (along with the rest of her team) maltreated by her manager. Every single manager at all levels was aware of the situation, including HR directly but you see nothing was ever done as this person was so good at saying how much of an amazing job she was doing...

First 2 years were great, intense but i am a hard worker so dealt with it. Last year was just a nightmare and apparently got much worst since I left only a few months ago....(which I had anticipated)"

Things change on a daily basis and most of the department is clueless. The select few people who know their job, and know it well, are considered threats to management and their growth in the company is halted.

Depending on which office you are in, you work with some great people!","Every post on here about poor management is 110% accurate! I saw the extremely negative posts prior to accepting the position and thought to myself, they were just young, mad, unmotivated employees that probably got fired. You see, I was not a ""fresh out of college"" type of employee. I had thought I would be able to work with them and do well. In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have got my hopes up, they are/were the worst managers I have every worked with/for. And to be fair, they were put in those positions unprepared and under supported. So I might go as far as saying they were good people, just horrible horrible horrible managers. And I didn't get fired. I left and returned to my old industry and am making double. 

The list of Cons go On and On.... I agree with most of the previous posts, so go back, and read. And please note that if there is a post that rates this company over 2 stars, you can disregard as it is probably middle management trying to better the ranking.

There are, gracefully, many fairly attractive people across the various offices, so at least networking has some point to it.  Most of us being drunk half the time is the only way this company doesn't implode","The main task for an employee is to navigate the endless corridors of the Byzantine bureaucracy in order to find out what it is you are here for. After 2 years in this position I'm still not exactly sure. Trying to figure out what my job is, is like seeing an oasis in the desert. 

When asked ""Why am I here for 40 hours when, as far as I can see, I could do this job in 20?"",, middle management refer to the catch-22 of ""development"".  They are not referring to, it turns out, sorting your life out in order to get a real job, strangely.

A word on development (this is the be-all and end-all of the company's culture)

Having no use for all the skills you have acquired up to this point in life, social, academic, professional or otherwise, you are meant to come up with a cunning plan (PDP ) on how you are going to develop yourself. You are allowed little help or advice in this area. This is mainly because the managers themselves have no idea what they are doing either, aren't involved in their teams (apart from chasing the El Dorado of obtaining a PDP) and, developing hoi polloi too fast might mean that their own role becomes obsolete.

The idea is that the goals placed in your plan should be both personal and related to your role, i.e. technical. It doesn't take long (for some) to realize in practice the goals sum up to spying on your colleagues, pushing yourself aggressively above others, being loud, being bitchy, admiration of admin for its own sake, keeping information secret even when the usefulness of the information has expired and first and foremost, schmoozing with your stiff, boring stooges you call your colleagues. I won't bother you with the corporate synonyms for these terms.

One example of the fraudulent action items we are forced to place in our PDPs would be ""communication skills"". I have improved mine immensely in the time I've been here. This was done by leaning how to ""influence"" my pairs. By influence read manipulate, upstage, machinate or simply control to gain advantage over them in the horizontal (read vertical) hierarchy.

The ""free"" food is usually fit only for sub-normals.

Everybody is pregnant (see pros) or talks endlessly about the imbeciles they have created to replace themselves."

Booking.com gave everyone an iPad for Christmas and threw a super amazing Christmas party at the Amsterdam headquarters, filled with booze, house music, and actual fun.

Most of the people I worked with are smart, talented, creative, and driven. I've developed lasting friendships with them.","Booking.com is the type of company that tries to trick you into loving your job. A handful of bumbling idiots fall for it and would practically give their lives for B.com.

I was a robot for 8 hours a day because I was assigned menial tasks that required zero thinking and attended pointless/endless meetings about equally worthless crap. I once attended a meeting about meetings. No lie.

If one of the Kool-Aid drinking managers doesn't like you or recognizes that you are not as brainwashed as they are, you will not advance. You will continue to do the same meaningless busy work day-in and day-out. If the managers do not personally like you and invite you to Sunday brunch or SoulCycle, you will not advance and you will most likely be driven out of the company by their cold-shoulder, high school pettiness.

4958,Booking.com,"If you're a smart/talented human being, you'd be dumb to work for Booking.com.",2014-01-22,1.0,Content Editor,"Every six months or so, they'll dangle a little trip in front of you. When you inevitably get upset you're making 20% less than they are at the competitor or you realize there is no room for advancement because they've decided to fill your role with a sociopath (because middle management is also made up exclusively of sociopaths), some useless training will come up somewhere exotic. You'll go to the training, meet some really nice, really friendly people. You'll bond with all of them because they're all as miserable and unhappy as you are. 

Booking.com is a colossal game of smoke and mirrors. For every perk handed out, two are quietly taken away. If you find yourself enjoying something, that's when it's time to get nervous. 

If I have to say something nice, it's that the job is usually pretty stress free. The managers don't really care much about you and they certainly never listen to what you have to say, so if you want it's pretty easy to fly under the radar. If you're a lazy, ""happy just to have a job in this economy"" type of person, you're going to do awesome at Booking.com. 

Oh, and free lunch once a month.","Booking.com has one heck of a scam going. They make more money than all their competitors combined, yet pay their employees 20-30% less than every other OTA.  I think they figure that they can just keep hiring eager young people, wine and dine them until they realize they're being duped and then just go find more young people. You are and will always be expendable to Booking.com, just know that.  The cycle can stop with you...seriously, do not take this job. 

A huge percentage of the managers are not only kind of crummy, but aggressively awful. The company grew so fast, that many of the managers earned their positions simply because they've worked with the company the longest; which in many cases is just three years. 

Booking.com always reminded me of an Oreo with a garbage filled center. On the one side, you have this brilliant visionary CEO. On the other side you have these bright entry level employees who are really earnest, nice people. Sandwiched in the middle is just this layer of really terrible people with atrocious management skills. If the Booking.com middle management had an Instagram account it would consist of mirror selfies, pictures of food and annoying hashtags. 

Managers are constantly making decisions that make you scratch your head. At first, you'll just shrug it off: ""I guess that's how they want to run their business."" Then you'll start to ask yourself, ""Is this how things work at other companies? It can't be."" Then you'll get upset, ""Not only is this a poor business decision, but it also defies human logic!"" Employees, at least in our office, walked around in a constant state of depression and outrage.

Eventually you feel so surrounded by immaturity and incompetence you resign to your desk and work really hard with your headphones in just so that time passes faster. Maybe they're onto something there.

Things are especially bad if you're a Content Editor. Did you go to school to write? Do you enjoy writing? I bet you like being creative too. Well, despite the job title, a Content Editor doesn't get to do any of those things. Isn't that fun? I have no idea why they keep hiring English majors for a job that no longer requires writing. The closest you get to ""writing"" will be checking thousands of robot generated texts for grammar. What great experience! As the job exists today, you'll spend most of your time calling or emailing hotels to have them send in photos. I hope you like sales, because that's what this gig basically is now. If you're an English major and you wanted to put your education to some use, run! Run as fast as you can from Booking.com.

All I can tell you is what I experienced and that is working at Booking.com was a living nightmare. If you still want to work there after all that, well..."

Management of Customer Care just wants to squeeze the most out of people until they become exhausted and leave the company. They want employees to do productivity numbers to show to the Managers of the Managers, but not actual work. Communication is poor, like a prison. No freedom to speak, move or talk with colleges during work time.

The only time provided by the company to interact with each other is the parties, they are well organized.

Still, because at work it is not allowed to chose make a break with anyone and every break is monitored by machines, the parties, which are good, feel like Pinocchio Land of Toys."

The rest of the time is split between meeting with each other, getting as many company paid lunches as possible,  and making everyone else's life hell. This includes making up policies depending on mood and outright lies about policies. They will also stand in the middle of the department bashing each other, thier teams, and the company. Bullying is common practice and HR is either too stupid or lazy to help. The zero tolerance policy on retaliation is just a bunch of words on paper.  The area managers refuse to help,  probably because it would mean working.  The newest regional manager has proven to be a liar in everything that was ever said.  Workload is overwhelming and don't you dare ask for help.  I doubt any of them even understand how to actually do the job.  If you want to move up, forget it.  They lie and claim that the focus is development,  but in actuality it's made to be your responsibility. Oh! You're also not allowed to try to develop yourself.  That will end with a write-up for asking questions of a member of management that is not your direct supervisor.  Changes and decisions are never shared.

Absolutely solid business model and great methodological approach to the business.,"The company extensive new hires program alone isnt enough if you dont have support and guidance from your direct manager.

I personally didnt have much guidance from the 2 different direct managers I had. 

Company culture seems to be that you ought to learn how to swim quickly and alone. 
This could be tricky if you come from another business environment and take on a position Senior position of responsability because Booking.com has a very unique way of doing business. 


As I got on board, for the first quarter I focused 100% on my team achieving my target (I was in a Senior commercial position) later on somebody confessed me that your performance is not just related to target achievement... you need to find your way to ADD something else in. 

I may agree, but one needs more than 1 or 2 quarters to do that if you dont have appropriate guidance and your manager is not supposed to be just there controlling and evaluating your job, 
should also give you the support you need.


It seemed to me that failure to engage into internal politics may be lethal.
Regrettably (and I say regrettably because I wouldnt expect from a company as Booking.com) if you are in the graces of your manager you can do your job normally and sleep tight, your reviews will likely be in your favour. 
Should this not be the situation, well then... you have no more then 1 or 2 quarters left.

Consideration of other people (and not only strickly about your job) seemed to be very important and HIGHLY VALUED when deciding an appraisal result.

Must DOs: go to parties, engage with people and win the graces of your colleagues in any department as they are going to decided over your future in the company."

Speaking of which, pay is beyond low. The company pays well below the average compared to other top competitors within a similar industry and the standards for earning the quarterly bonuses keep changing. Many employees have even half-jokingly accused the company of ""testing"" for ways to make it impossible to earn. Most managers lack knowledge, leadership skills or both. Opportunities are extremely rare at this point within any of the established offices in the US and most that do become available are often filled with candidates from the European offices.

This is not true, there is somebody who the ""team-senior-second team- leader"" likes more. They are not giving you a permanent contract and even have the guts to ask you why you're leaving the company?!!! They treat you like a dog, counting on the endless foreigners coming to Holland and ready to give everything in order to work."

* In some cases, very specialized work - meaning that you are in a small team dedicated to a specific job and do not have access to other related things very easily. This is understandable due to the size of the company and its rapid growth.
* This as result of the rapid growth, management change and lack of managers that work on developing people (in a lot of cases due to lack of time and some due to lack of experience).

Often one person will train you a certain way, but you can still be marked down by a quality agent for doing something wrong, when you were trained a specific way. It's not very consistent. I also find a 30 minute lunch break is just not enough when working a 10 hour shift. I've also seen the last few rounds of interviews for various positions such as supervisor. Often people with terrible quality and productivity are promoted, because they are extremely social with the upper management. Those of us who are very good at their job and beg our teamleads for advice on being promoted are often given a few words of advice, but no real follow through. Interviews also vary; my first interview was all behavior questions in which I was, to be honest, not prepared for. After countless hours of studying and mock interview preparation, they asked all time management questions, and denied me, stating my answers were great, I just needed to ""be more detailed."" Promotions feel like a joke, and you pretty much have to be a social butterfly who kisses up to management to be considered, and have to overstep your comfort zone by emailing other departments to see if they need help with anything just to get your name out there.

They spend ridiculous amount of money on lavish, fancy parties to keep their clients happy.  Most of the clients are angry because customer service provides them with such poor service. The workers around you are constantly chatting about their personal life and things you should not bring into work, which makes it very difficult for you to concentrate on your work. Brown nosing and kissing up here will get you much further than actually being good at your job. If this is your type of company, you would be a good fit.

Management will betray your trust in a heart beat
If you have an opinion or like to speak your mind then you will definitely get written up and try to muscle you out of the company


I can go on and on but my only advice to you if you are looking to work here is that you shouldnt. I have worked at previous corporations but let me tell you that this one in perticular has a very toxic environment. Management has no idea what they are doing and are constantly micro managing. This job is meant for very simple minded people who are not looking for growth. Do not trust management as they will betray you the second they get a chance. Obviously you can see this by all the other negative reviews written about the company. If you do end up working here then I would suggest you learn the indusrty as best you can and leave to another company that actually pays well and takes care of their employees just as I did. They continously promote the wrong people and it causes a ripple affect as none of these people have ever managed anyone."

Some people, who kiss asses, get away with everything and get special treatment, while they are really hard on others
Senior management and Senior developers do whatever they want
Very slow doing anything to benefit you, renewing contract
Performance review is mostly self-assessment
Clueless managers
Code is messy, unorganized, and not documented
People whisper about you behind your back, The company fails on communication
Lots of brainwashing, Company ""culture"" is a joke
Lot of churn in IT, but they say ""nobody ever leaves""
They hire anybody, even people who don't know any Perl"
5070,Booking.com,Not great,2012-06-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Some of the employees are very nice to work with (some are not).  They seem to put some effort into staff social event.,Poor management and a petty HR department make it very difficult to feel comfortable.  Very stressful and a lot of office politics.  Pay not worth it.
5071,Booking.com,"Sycophantic, inept, and unqualified management.",2012-05-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"It provides a regular paycheck.
The people in certain departments (i.e. IT and a few other Analysts) actually know what they're doing. 
The company is making money hand over fist. 
Relatively easy to build up your resume.","Many of the people who get promoted aren't the most qualified, but they've done the most sucking up. One is example is of a candidate with neither managerial nor analytic experience was 'placed'  in a position requiring both of those skill sets over another, fully qualified, candidate. And unfortunately this sort of thing isn't the exception, but the norm. This leads to abysmal moral and utter lack of loyalty towards the company."

International working environment,"Unrealistic targets, bad working conditions (lack of oxygen in the office, bad canteen food, for which you are obliged to pay for). Management absolute beginners club, posh look a-likes with a power trip. They will only say hello when they feel like and they will treat you without respect. Applying for another position within the company is not possible, HR does not respond to your applications and they turn you down with the same template emails. Very low salary, bonus incentive is based on surrealistic targets, holiday requests are almost always denied or never answered. The office equipment is badly set up (common technical errors). You hear your colleagues complaining the whole time. Expensive company parties with food and music you will be sick from. Whatever is the problem, the finger is always pointed at you. Negative and unhelpful management. This makes everything very stressful which adds to the stress you already have. You feel like just coming in and being present without your mind being there. You feel sick if you think of work on your days off."
5074,Booking.com,"Incompetant, amateur and scared managment!",2012-04-23,1.0,Account Manager,"Its a job, barely.
Standard health package (thank you Priceline)
People from a hospitality background are friendly?
Great product for now","Lack of career growth
Lack of pay increase, poor pay
Lack of incentive 
Product growth stalled and flat making ""team bonus"" goals impossible 

European business model clashes with American capitalist mentality thus the meek and mindless stay and the innovators and achievers leave.

Extremely amateur managment from the top down.  Hopefully new accredited CEO will clean up.  Very unimpressive and average joes running the show; who need to ask their employees in group meetings what they should do.  I was embarassed for them. Then quickly realized I WORKED FOR THEM! llol 

If you have passion, drive, intelligence, pride and confidence move on to something else.  Despite how bad the job market is its not hard to find better considering selling life insurance would be more satisfying and similarly both would hire almost anybody!  LOL!

The managment is so clueless and non confrontational that if you are lazy you can get away with doing nothing and believe me people do.

Preceeding reviews very accurate and obvious common trends between offices only signifies problem exists from top down.  

Truly a breath of fresh air to leave."

Company is great but the Chicago office is a bad apple.
Hopefully with the new CEO in charge, there will be some changes in management","Managers have no confidence in themselves.  They treat you like children, and you get to play a ""game"" if the internet is down.  They like to hold meetings to hear themselves talk.  They demean you in front of your colleagues.  Morale in this office is low.  It's sad when management stresses you out more than the actual work (which is simple and not very challenging unfortunately).  Management is hypocritical and routinely leaves the office to go run personal errands (you know, like shopping cleaning supplies for an hour).  I have never had to report a manager to HR before but I did here and was retaliated against.  They do not do things the right way here which means using common sense and getting the job done.  It's a joke.  If you respect yourself and have a heart, work elsewhere."

No internal communications about what's going on. Lack of direction from management. Content team leader was moody to the point of unprofessional outbursts in the office and showed blatant favouritism towards one team member. Management is not concerned with whether people enjoy their jobs and discourage giving any sort of feedback or input. The general impression given is that if you are not happy, they can easily find someone to replace you. There is also no 360 review or any way of giving input on your direct manager."
