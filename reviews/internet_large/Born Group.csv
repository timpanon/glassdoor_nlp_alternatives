That’s the only “Pros”!","Work culture : they don’t have a culture, they don’t exhibit culture. You are treated as you should not be. If you abide by their absurd restrictions, you will prosper. Some of the big names here are people who don’t hesitate a min to backstab anyone for growth. 
Stability: they may claim to have good clients but they don’t have a vision, they are not built to sustain, they work on short term gains. Explains why they are calling themselves a “startup” even after a decade.
HR: we should call them admins. They are powerless. And they are clueless. We can replace them with class 10 folks
And
Management: Four guys remain a constant at the top
So does the CEO. The crew of people reporting to them are slaves, the rest who dare to differ are “fired”. They don’t fire instantly. They will gradually insult, pull you dow , place you in a spot beyond which no self respecting person would want to stay."

There are many talented people but it takes time to find out who is just getting a paycheck and who is talented.,This was the worst company I’ve ever worked for. There is no onboarding at all and you are expected to be an expert at all the systems on day 2. When you ask for help you are belittled and made to feel like you are an idiot. Project audits and processes are for the sake of process and do not provide value to the clients. In one month I had 1 project audited 3 times and was written up because a previous project manager did not make sure documentation was complete and I was not provided access to the repository (I had asked multiple times). Management does not support employees and there is no resource manager so you’ll spend days trying to see if anyone has a resource when you need to replace someone. Just don’t apply if you’re looking for a place that has organization or any sense of a proper onboarding process or if you’re looking for any kind of support from your manager.
