Will always have the best widget.,"The ""Leaders"" within this division are a collection of ""boys"" that have long-rooted connections often dating back to college and/or early career paths. Their fraternal nature blinds them to the realities of the market and certainly the voice of the field and front-line reps and managers. The people often called out as the most important asset of the company, are not then treated as such. The actions simply don't align with the proposed narrative.
And their acquisition management has been the worst I've ever seen which has caused an exodus of people leaving for either the competition or something better. It's sad because under better leadership this division would be a market leader by a tremendous margin instead of bouncing up and down in that regard from year to year. The leadership needs a clean sweep."

227,Boston Scientific,Boston Scientific Review,2021-12-09,3.0,Medical Assembler,There can be great coworkers that you get along well with and for me as time went by the amount of coworkers hard to get along with become less and less. If you have a great attitude then the only thing you need to worry about to not be hard for others to get along with you is to have a high output. That's where the cons come in.,"1. Always need to hit goals. My department and shift in particular is short staffed so we need to constantly do overtime whether it's staying extra hours and/or working the weekend to hit our monthly goals. We are continually pushed to have higher outputs even though we are completely above our staffing goal. If it's any worse than this you can expect to work holidays as well. For high-output-experienced-workers this hits us hard because we have to constantly do everything. You'd be hard pressed to know that attendance is king when it comes to getting your raise and having experience and high output does you no good. It's even worse that it doesn't get you a promotion either. Makes you think why you're going so fast for besides the fact that you may not want to do overtime.

2. Management is bad. We are constantly told to do more than 1 job simultaneously and in a fast paced environment it becomes extremely tiring . It's 1 person doing a 2-3 person job getting paid 1 person. Great for the employer but horrible for the employee. Management also gets so stressed they lay the anger and frustration on you. I know because they tell us sometimes but that never justifies. It's almost everyday. They also know that you cannot do anything and no one will care if you did. There has been multiple reportings of people to Supervisors, Managers, and Human Resources but they do not do anything about the person being reported. Especially so when that person is a Supervisor or higher (including a Production Coordinator which is 1 step below a Supervisor).

3. Opportunities for advancement. They hire more people from the outside than they hire/promote people from inside the company. This makes it very hard for anyone as a Production Builder or similar to advance their career. You will not be given a chance to learn something new because they want someone who already knows a bit to do the job even if you are a passionate, hard worker and fast learner.

4. Salary. For Production Builders the salary is capped at $25/hr as a Production Builder III. Which requires at least 7 years of experience etc. Keep in mind that we do a 2-3 person job so getting $25/hr wouldn't cut it anyways. The base pay for a contractor is $17.50/hr, doing a 2 person job, would be $35/hr but you're getting nowhere near that. No great bonuses either, sometimes you may get anywhere between a $5-$50 gift card. It's definitely not occasional, just whenever management ""feels"" we're doing too much but they also have to approve of it with their superiors too which decreases the chances of getting it depending if your higher ups want to or not. It's nice to be rewarded, but you won't get much here."

Everyone we worked with from other sites was happy to work for BSC and from the top to the bottom all of us were treated with respect, transparency, and 2 way communication, placing value on all that we did and making for a very thorough transfer of knowledge and goal accomplishment. They have a great culture with a lot of bright minds and I would love to work here again.

Advancement within the group is well defined on paper, but in practice you'll see some promoted while others languish. If you're vocal about advancing, you'll be put on the path, and if you're happy to simply be left to be a technical writing soldier, you can do exactly that. I think I gained about 10k a year from year 1 to 3. Not great, but was probably about to be promoted around the time I departed which probably would've been another 10k.","This group has its own dedicated Project Managers.

For sure BSC is on top of the world on that aspect. Great facilities (global standard) with top level computers, softwares and equipment.
The hierarchy exists but at BSC you can easily work with people very experienced with a high level. That’s great to motivate and knowledge sharing. Networking is great there, which can result in job rotation abroad or a definitive job in another site (but it is not easy).","Low benefits. Profits sharing is only 12% of annual salary.
Boston scientific has a VIP program, where you can be globally recognized for cost reduction projects, but the reward is ridiculous. Only $200. If you deliver a project of $1M savings, you earn $200.
No retirement program/benefits.
Boston is not a tech company, but they should pay attention on what the new generation seeks. Flexibility, gyms, creative space, health programs (in practice, I’m not talking about apps and online videos, I mean people concerned about YOU during the routine), balance between career and life, job rotation to promote international experience.

Good place to get exposure to a lot of different things because it's such a skeleton crew, it's always all hands on deck!","""Piece of Candy"" Syndrome - they have a hard time finishing things because something new and exciting comes along and being innovators, their interest lies more so in taking on more cool things than seeing to completion what you said you'd do, especially when it's no longer fun and exciting. Managers drop balls to respond to the demand to do more, save more, optimize more. Managers spread way too thin, and often have a problem delegating to the workerbees. Lots of ""collaboration"" across the managers but they forget to bring in fresh eyes of the younger, well equipped non-managers.

Fear to speak out about the atmosphere we were immersed in, and fear of repercussions even after we have left.

• Decent Benefits.
• Experience working in a large site.

• Some really smart colleagues working here. 
• Galway site going through a significant growth cycle.","• Majority of staff are on contracts from resourcing companies without benefits & with differing rates of pay and limited opportunity to convert to permanency.
• A lot of old legacy code that will never be updated due to risk and FDA regulation.
• Manufacturing mentality means a Software Engineer is a resource and there will rarely ever be more than one Software resource assigned to a project. 
• Software Development processes and architecture are not treated with any importance and are non-existent.
• As mentioned above the manufacturing mindset also means there is rarely any downtime.
• Personal boundaries are not respected in my experience. Employees are very likely to be contacted on their personal phones outside hours or while they are on annual leave. 
• Working weekends\long hours is a norm in this organisation and as such it is taken for granted.
• It's an old boys club.  An example of this is that out of about 8 to 10 directors only HR has a female director. 
• Significant amount of staff turnover."

Particularly in the area of HR, they have seemingly tolerated very weak and inappropriate leadership; they have dismantled one of the best global talent management functions in the country and abandoned their approach to engagement, internal development, best in class capabilities, and work/life balance.     Employees, and especially high potentials, are extremely frustrated with the lack of leadership, sponsorship,  and career development and are ready to leave the organization.   Most are finding their roles more tactical than strategic and are seeing such an increase in demands that they cannot maintain a reasonable balance of work/life.

Above-average work/life balance, except for stingy vacation days given to new employees. From a tech standpoint, company is so big that there is no shortage of interesting work.","Every company I've worked for views IT spending as a necessary evil, but BSC C-level management takes it to another level. About half of the 1000 IT employees are Indian employees of Tata Consulting Services, with the ones in the US on the problematic H1B visa program. Amidst an otherwise banner year for BSC financials, an IT layoff of US-based employees happened and we were told outright it was because not enough (expensive) US employees left through retirement or otherwise. That was disgusting, but it happened amidst the obvious failure of Indian outsourcing in BSC and against strong industry trends away from it (google it). Non-IT employees rightly associate IT with incompetent and unhelpful Indian employees and heavy users regularly go around the help desk to competent US employees. Ironically, the most ""successful"" recent initiatives were adding IT bars (like Apple's Genius bars) at major US sites so employees could get competent help, and stop giving such gawd-awful satisfaction rankings to IT's Indian help desk. A not-so-advertised related ""success"" was the introduction of a special US-based help desk for sales staff, so this vocal, high-profile group didn't have to ever deal with Indians. Gobs of non-technical US interns that seem to get hired at high rates to fill quotas while US/EU technical staff trudge along under constant hiring freezes, until absolutely needed, then told to hire non-US only."

Lots of wonderful people in upper management-- great role models with wonderful leadership skills.,"Very frustrating to know that working my butt off results in making someone else rich--
TMs with this company make triple what CSs make with very little difference between the job descriptions. TMs order the CSs around but are not technically considered their managers. Very strange relationship between the two positions. The only way to make more money as a CS is to sell.... Again strange considering that the TM is the one that most benefits from the CS selling.  ... One must be crazy to want to work this hard just to watch their ""teammate"" reap the rewards.

If you are interested in this position:
Know ahead of time that you will be working extremely hard and make very little money. Even when you have a free moment from cases & sales calls to try and catch up on admin work, you will get pulled to neighboring territories to cover their cases (again, not making you a $). Don't be surprised if you end up working 12-16 hour days. You will be on-call every single weekend and you will be required to answer your phone to patients and accounts even if you are on vacation. As the CS member of the team, you will be the team member required to cover the holiday cases. You WILL be overworked & underpaid and the work-life balance is horrific."

During that time, the company has undergone significant changes - becoming leaner and more focused on it's core product offerings. As a result, the company's stock has appreciated significantly as new products have been launched successfully. This has greatly benefited the employees who participate in the stock purchase plan - where stock can be purchased at a discount twice each year. In addition, the company has funded an attractive yearly bonus, based on profitability. 

I have found the company to be very employee-friendly and a fun place to work. There are many perks that are offered during the year to build morale and loyalty.

Leadership was often changing in the beginning of my employment, but now we have talented, capable leaders who are stable in their positions. 

I feel that Boston Scientific has found it's footing and is moving forward with direction and purpose, providing excellent products for patients with serious health conditions and a promising future for its creative and dedicated employees.","There have been regular reductions in the workforce over the time I've been employed, but now those seem to have abated.

And on the other side were forced to use our holidays when the company has down days due to business needs.i myself had to take holidays for a week because I was sick.

In 2 years, I gained more experience than most people get in their entire career. I received numerous training and project management opportunities. I also had constant exposure to senior IT leadership via rotation program events.","Although the experience and opportunities are great, work-life balance is terrible. There is an unspoken game of ""who can stay at the office latest."" Morale is low and employees are constantly being asked to take on more responsibilities as employees leave or are laid off."
2432,Boston Scientific,Very good company to work for.,2013-12-28,4.0,R&D Technician,Great environment. Gym and flexible hours,The same as other big companies. Layoffs to satisfy the shareholders.

In fact one of the highest matching for 401-k and a chance to earn decent bonus.  Upward mobility is there for many positions. If you work in some of the business function areas, attitude is probably better.","Like many other corporate peers, BosSci is not immune to demand more and more of their employee pool. The problem is that even though individual contributors and managers are asked to give it all, the reward is often not there during the annual review.  You will get promoted but that will be the justification to work more and longer. Even you WYAO, you might get put into Improvement Needed category.  People who has the passion of balancing their lives are often labeled as non-leadership material as they don't share the passion. The IT functions has a distinct feeling of being run like Accenture - devoid of any loyalty and compassion.   Most projects are often run to meet some dates which in turn result into poor solutions and myriad of problems for others to handle, after they go live. More and more interns, college grads are being asked to contribute, which in turn leading to a high turn over at a very early age group in the corporate culture. Just look at any given moment, how many positions, this company is trying to hire.  Directors and up will keep on passing the buck and are not accountable for a miserable landscape and completely detached from the reality. Bottom line, if you don't mind, giving it all for few years, then probably this is the place.  But don't expect a family to wait around to share the outcome."

Best-in-class products across the board.  Some great talent and capabilities in the new product development arena.  Great facilities and campuses.  Recent acquisitions are very promising.  Good 401k match (6%) and tuition reimbursement ($8k/annual).  Work/life balance is above average for the industry.,"Cronyism runs rampant throughout this company from the days of Schneider and Scimed.  Few new people and fewer new ideas.  Top heavy organization and middle to upper management is stagnant.  Working-leveling employees are not trusted or empowered to make decisions.  Projects are generally are poorly managed, micro-managed, and timelines are unrealistic.  Business model is shifting to acquisition based growth instead of organic development which is a waste of the talent the company does have.  Significant benefit erosion and unwillingness/lack of effort to retain top talent.  2012 annual merit increase for average employee was 0%, second time since 2007.  Top talent has been leaving in droves and layoffs seem to be an annual occurrence since 2007.  Far too risk averse in the process of deciding and funding new product development puts the company in a constant catch-up mode with the competition.  Sales force and marketing strategy are poor at best.  Company does not execute on its proclaimed values."

Currently offers 5 fewer vacation days to start then Medtronic (10 days versus 15).  My biggest ding on benefits are if you max out your 401K before the end of the year, the company starts matching.  Say you sell a little extra in November and make more commissions.  No 401K match on your last check.  Say you need to adjust down your 401K contribution.  It takes multiple pay cycles to process and can miss part of your match.  There have been slow benefit erosions too.  I don't see that changing for a while until the economy creates employee retention programs again.

Typical corporate atmosphere where their best solution to the political and economic climate is to layoff and/or outsource while senior leadership makes millions in compensation (CEO compensation is a matter of public record.  Look it up).  There was a major discrepancy in workload for my department, and noticeable favoritism.  People who continued to slack off experienced no apparent repercussions while those who worked efficiently were rewarded with more work.  Those who carry the workload do so to the point of exhaustion and frustration, with no end in site.  The culture is reactive versus proactive.  Due to the size of the company, any changes made have to go through so much bureaucratic red tape that by the time the changes comes, nobody can remember the point.  Collectively, this all has resulted in a loss of top talent to other companies."
2588,Boston Scientific,"Low morale, poor management, out of date systems",2012-01-20,1.0,,"In my department employee are treated like incompetent criminals. The level of micromanagement is unbelievable! Part of this problem probably stems that supervisors have little to no management experience or training. Drama, office politics and spite are the name of the game.  Morale is very low and attitudes are correspondingly bad. Systems are clunky and out-of-date and employee suggestions are ignored.  I’ve seen colleges work 12-hour days for months on end and get reprimanded for not doing enough work. If you are a hard worker you are awarded with more work and no recognition or praise. Overall, my department contains a good deal of talented, highly educated professionals but it feels like junior high. Very high turn-over.  Maybe other departments are better!","Employees treated with little respect, office politics, miserable people, no growth, managers with no training, no work-life balance, micromanagement, out-of-date job tools"

They have been a leader in the areas of stent production and heart rhythm devices (defibrillators and pacemakers).  This means that the work you do as a member of the company directly improves the lives of individuals.  The annual Quality Day event showcases specific patients and their families in a way that brought tears to my eyes every time I saw how the technologies I worked on helped people in very tangible ways.,"Boston Scientific has become increasingly focused on cost reduction through outsourcing key functions (IT, R&D, manufacturing).  This has resulted in a series of layoffs over the past 4 years.  The result has been devastating to both the people laid off and the people remaining behind as the survivors have seen workloads increase and financial resources shrink."
