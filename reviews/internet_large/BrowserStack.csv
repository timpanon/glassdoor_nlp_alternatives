As a salesperson, you are not just encouraged to learn and do stuff on your own. The clearly curated and streamlined sales enablement session enables you to get familiar with the process, operation, product, industry, tools, etc. They enable you to be a successful salesperson even before you get fully onboarded into your team.

Documentation:
You can find every single answer to your question by referring to the documentation. The wiki is constantly updated and help you big time.

Technology stack:
You might imagine a company could have gone for a suite, one-stop for all their needs but they have made sure to handpick the products which fit their needs. You will have access to all the best tools the industry has to offer. 

People & Culture:
The general culture at BrowserStack is interesting, something which is rather different from the ones you see out there in the market. It is definitely not a family and they don't try to be or act like one instead it is a community. A community that cares about you, your growth and is willing to invest in you. The upper-level managers would wanna hear from you and wanna know how to experiment with things making you feel important and more importantly they listen to you. Listening to you is of absolutely no use if action is not taken, which is why BrowserStack is different. They work on addressing those concerns and suggestions you have to offer.","For someone who is looking to slack or just go about with their day-to-day activities, this may not be their ideal org. Be ready to learn and grow at a rapid pace, if not you will definitely find it harder to sustain. If you are not a person who is open about receiving constructive feedback or criticism this may not be the place for you."

They can bully, make you feel worthless and get you sacked and on the contrary, if they love you they can get you all that you wish. highly toxic place for mid and senior roles. no autonomy. only founders dictate and it needs to be followed. they have kept yes men around them and the leadership people are just there to fill their pocket and do as they are told. there is no point raising your concerns because no one is interested in what bothers you. they are just there to look for themselves. HR is a useless team and doesn't care about concerns raised. you tell them something and they will show lot of concern but these conversations are eye wash and no solution is provided. they are hiring in bulk and you might feel that there is lot of growth but it is an illusion. things internally are broken - no one is looking at the REAL PROBLEMS. there is just hiring and no efforts to fix the exit issues. every week people join and exit. their only solution to every problem is money and nothing else. why? because the leaders and founders have no intent to build a company. its just about filling their pockets and throwing some at the problem at hand so that they can live peacefully. the product has great potential and the company could have done great by now but the founders are so full of themselves that they dont care if they play with someone career. ethics is zero and there is no fairness in the system. there are these fancy linkedin posts about talks and photos shared about expensive gifts but nobody talks about the exits, unhappiness and frustration which exists in the org. again...throwing money at the problem to divert it. the recruiters just keep spamming people with inmails and they dont even see if the profile is relevant. there are arrogant people in some teams and some just dont care. even if they dont meet their targets they are not told anything because they have that comfort with the founders. work life balance... well there is no balance. it is just work and nothing else. no learning...no fun...just work... life doesnt exist if you are working here so better join at an entry level. make money and leave. the longer you stay the more difficult it would get for you to love your work. there is no vision, no goals or plans. whatever they plan fails and undergoes iteration after a lot of push back. targets are set irrationally irrespective of which territory you work or the external factors like covid. if you are planing to join sales team, better to get clarity on what will be the potential earning because everyone is at 30-40% achievement here"

We operated in a very ad-hoc fashion, creating little to no impact. This is what happens when you ask product managers to handle marketing teams. Not once, but twice!

Everything is over-scrutinized and micro-managed to the extent that things never ship. And because things never ship, you're over-scrutinized. It's a vicious cycle.

Don't even get me started on the performance reviews. It's unfair and does no justice to the work you've put in.

167,BrowserStack,The most unethical and greedy co-founders ever,2021-01-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The product-market fit is good. Company is profitable. Backed by Accel.,"1. A ""yes-sir"" culture. The co-founders want to surround themselves with people who just do what *they* want. You'll find people with relatively less experience at the Director level handling multiple teams because of the boot-licking they've been doing. The co-founders are only interested in hiring people who'll do what they want and are not interested in new ideas. Just take a look at how quickly so many senior level people like VP of Engg/VP-HR/Directors etc. have left.

2. Continuing from above, the partiality and groupism culture. Everyone wants to be close to the co-founders and the co-founders encourage such behaviour. If you're not in that closed circle, you'll never get promoted no matter how good you've performed.

3. Greediness of the co-founders - even though the company has made lot of profits, it's not willing to share it with the employees. For no reason, it gave ""muted"" (word used by HR in the org wide email) appraisals during Covid-19 citing slowed down business. Everyone over at BrowserStack knows that there was no slowdown in business. Don't believe me still? Just inquire about the ESOPs program from the current/past employees.

4. Bullying by the older employees - the older employees who got promoted inspite of less experience/talent bully everyone. They like to bully and block ideas by more experienced senior people who get hired. Life becomes miserable and then they resign. And then they wonder, what went wrong?

5. Flawed rating system - this is the biggest sham of all. BrowserStack tries to claim that it's a meritocracy but it's not (see above points). The rating comprises of a calibration where the EMs get together and ""review"" ratings that were given to the team members. They get together and pull down ratings of people they don't like and then tell the employee that this is the result of ""re-calibration"". Hope you guys understand what's happening here! Classical groupism at work here.

6. Nothing technically innovative there anymore. All the initial stage employees who did great work were systematically edged out by the co-founders so that they don't have a say later on and replaced them with boot-lickers. Just go through LinkedIn and check out people who are EMs and Directors and have a long tenure. You'll know who are the trouble makers.

7. Almost impossible to work at VP level there if you have new ideas. Just tow the line."

There is a bit of an open culture where anyone can comment or question anything (but even if it's not their concern or they don't have full context) though this doesn't necessarily mean action will be taken after people here you.,"- most tech is hanging by a thread, if not already on fire. Quite a bit of chaos.
- Some teams just spend their time chasing support tickets and fixing minor bugs, and don't get breathing space to really fix the tech from ground up.
- really no strong developer platform or toolset. No common testing setup (and no testing at all in many teams), no application frameworks, no common deployment systems or logging frameworks, no single authentication for all systems. For most of it, it is really is just the initial hacky startupy code written ages ago, mostly by folks who haven't built strong systems elsewhere which they're desperately trying to maintain. It takes ages to do simple things, and you can cause a few fires in the process too.
One big issue is that the only senior management who stock around for long are the ones who have been there since early days. In the tech side, these guys haven't built anything of scale elsewhere, and anyone who challenges status quo never get a chance to do so. 
Both the founders don't really trust anyone else apart from themselves. They don't give full autonomy, and are involved in everything, which is why the tech also doesn't improve. 
It is a great wonder that the product has become so successful, it's certainly not going to scale going forward in the same way. 

The same applies elsewhere in the business too. Whether it comes to peopleops or sales, everything needs to be done in the way the founders want. 

I noticed lot of people blaming managers, the reality is the managers are helpless."

They have had a lot of good initiatives and the culture was great as well. You get the usual SAAS benefits plus more in some cases. The new office was definitely amazing and really was inviting.,The issues are primarily with middle management. Many department heads aren't really that great and lack managerial skills. This creates too much of friction between Manager and reportees. Company did keep trainings for Managers for this but many did not take it seriously since they don't find anything wrong with their way of handling things. I know this is a very common issue across organisations but I think BrowserStack can be amazing by fixing just one thing. Also there was no work from home policy.

226,BrowserStack,No company like this one,2019-06-25,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been working with Browserstack for close to two years now. So I have seen company's growth right from when we were close to less than 100 and now closing 225+, So I think I know what is cooking.
I was surprised to see Browserstack being rated as 3.3 overall, because I have worked with more than 3 companies before, big and small and I know what a 3.3 feels like.
I think many of the bad reviews were either old (Yes, there was a time when some ways company used to operate was not great, and founders admitted it too, and I always wondered because luckily since I am here, I never faced any of those issues at all. In fact this is the most lenient (policy wise, perk wise) company I have ever worked for so far.

Things that I like about BST are - 
* Few of the best minds working here, even freshers. Hiring is on point, partly because of a recruiting team that is good at what they do, partly because they pay really well, thus attract good talent. You will always learn and will be motivated to outdo yourself given everyone around you is doing the same.
* Package offered, HR policies, leave policies, everything works in your favor. First such company I witnessed in my 7+ years career.
* Fast paced - it will push you to be better version of yourself, certainly worked for me
* People are very approachable, including founders.
* Founders are very very invested in the company, so you know they mean business.
* Your suggestions will be accepted, recognized and implemented, if you can logically prove it. There is no meritocracy, be a fresher, but prove your point, and you are in.
* As a company they are really trying to fix a lot of things, even issues that I would call vanity or brooding on some people, if it was my own start-up. Good to see they are ready to do anything to make it a better place to work.
* BEST PART : It is an Engineering driven company, and engineers are respected most, more than business people, their hardship is always recognized unlike other places. That matters the most to me, a reason why I would stick to this company even if a lot of things change.
* Office hours start at 11, oh yeahh!
* Catered lunches, loaded pantry.","* Company has recently moved out of start-up-ish culture to more organised way, so you will feel some documentation, some processes here and there missing, but that's part of growth journey, Uber was much worse.
* Things are still being settled on planning front, but they are improving. Nevertheless, business is booming, so enough time to make mistakes, correct the course.
* Work-life balance, damn sometimes it's just not there, sometimes it is.
* Work sometimes gets challenging, bad thing if that happens few days in a row and you are worn out."

230,BrowserStack,An unbiased reality check!,2019-04-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Hello All,

Before you read this, I must tell you that I am under no influence or bias to write this. So I will try to be honest in my review as far as possible.

Just to give you a brief background about me, I have worked for bigger companies like Amazon as well some awesome start ups in the past and am an ISB alumni as well. The reason I am sharing this info is because I feel I have a lot to live upto and the names associated with my profile don’t allow me to compromise on my integrity while writing this review. Here at Browserstack, I work at a position where I have to interact with a lot of people. Unlike other folks who have claimed that they have been asked to write positive reviews, I have not come across any such requests.

I have been working here for 7 months now and when I read some of the reviews below, I was disturbed at how some people who could not be successful in a fast paced and challenging environment have been venting out their half baked thoughts here with the hope that it will de-motivate other folks from contributing to the growth of this Company.

To be honest, when I was offered a position, I too was skeptical too and did check glassdoor reviews which were not so encouraging and was not too motivated on joining but somehow I had other ISB alums who were already working here to whom I spoke and took a leap of faith and joined. 

What I found over a period of time was that both the founders are really invested in making this a great place to work for people. Some key challenges they face are below:
1. Maintaining the happiness of existing employees and taking it to the next higher level
2. Building for scale for the company where both speed matters both from employee growth as well as Customer Obsession stand point
3. They want people to grow in house at a much faster pace than people themself can imagine to. Have seen them investing to nurture and add skills to existing employees.

Couple of things everyone should consider
1. The points 1 & 2 are equally important and coming from a company like Amazon, I can understand its very difficult to manage both but what matters is the leadership is constantly on their toes to transform this into reality and we should be empathetic to them since they are still a young company in the making. It is this time that only positive people are needed to contribute and be aligned to the DNA of the company. Folks who think they are a better fit elsewhere should respectfully move on to other places while people who are really motivated and see value should add value here.
2. For a small company that is some 200 plus strong and growing rapidly, certain heart burns cannot be avoided but that does not necessarily mean we should try to bad mouth a company in a public forum. One should understand that such traits will not help you in any company you work.
3. What I have also observed is that the leadership is very approachable and they try their best to listen, understand and resolve people’s issues, retain a valuable talent and upgrade existing pool as well.  What you will observe is all the high performers in this company have some common traits like they focus on solving real problems and not give excuses, are highly driven by the company’s core principles, are consistent in terms of personal & team deliverables, etc….traits which would make such folks successful in any company they work for. For people who need a easy going life this Company is certainly not a good fit. 
4. This does not mean the employees dont have a work life balance, they do and much better than other companies. 
5. I also strongly feel, that before people go through other reviews and take their word for it, you should come and visit the company and spend a week atleast to see how the environment is here and you will really feel motivated to join. Or you should talk to people who work here and understand whats reality.","I dont see any cons as I had already mentioned I can relate to the challenges a company faces while scaling and growing. Plus, their success so far also speaks tons about where and how fast they wish to grow. So, either you be a part of something that might grow into something huge in the near future or regret later."

All depends on your manager. A lot of internal politics in the Sales department especially.You should say 'yes' for whatever manager says, else you will be in trouble. Leadership team can be twisted on managers fingures and management is carrying an authoritative attitude only. Worst work culture and high unethical behaviour. They are happy to screw the employee career, even it's their fault. Expect to work during weekend / from home without any extra benefit. 

Why you hire the folks and then fire with the immediate effects without prior notice If you don't have the potential to take the interview properly. Girls are being treated badly and managers don't have the sense to talk with theirs DRs at all.

- Some senior folks are sensible and reason for whatever level at which company is at today but they are also not valued and its only a matter of time before they are also fired
- If you are a 'yes-man', this is great place","The only and the biggest - Co-Founders

They are insecure to the core. CEO has all the time to do only politics and scrutiny of people's activities, timings, how much snacks people eat and how much of 'their' money they spend. They are a fault finding machine (with no suggestion on what is right or correct) and it seems they think that is the job of a CEO and co-founder. They have put up so called ""Values"" for people to follow but they themselves do not follow ANY values.

They are some of the biggest hypocrite people you would come across. Does not respect anyone at all - including senior folks. Keeps watch on them and does things behind their back. Tries to be good in public and then privately works to drive their agenda through key people. Senseless frequent changes in the team (with no prior discussions or indication) and firing at will once they are done with a person's use. Recent example - CFO who has been doing good job of putting sense into HR and has been able to build some credibility and win employee trust over last 1 year gave a presentation on the Policies and Process overhaul one day (where co-founders actively participate) and in less than 24 hours, he is removed from HR. CEO has time for managing office administration but not on how to grow the company. 

For last one year, there were signs of improvement and the Co-founders were 'looking like' genuinely interested in improving and listening to people but as they say - you cannot hid your true self for long. They are back to their 'normal' ways. People are now openly told that they (Co-founders) are now 'evolved' and does not need anyone's advise."
255,BrowserStack,A job is what you make of it,2017-09-13,4.0,Software Engineer,"This review is highly opinionated and does not aim to represent the general consensus among the people working in the company or the people who worked here earlier. And is focused entirely on the engineering team and some limited interactions with other teams.

* Learned a lot. It does not matter whether it will help me in the future or not.
* Everyone is accessible and helpful.
* People take responsibility of the things they deploy, I know I this sounds what an HR might say, but it is true.
* Team is tightly knit and we all are good friends.
* Nakul (the co-founder) still codes and helps in debugging production issues (This might be a need of the hour because of less number of senior people in engineering, but I still appreciate this).
* Team outings and other fancy things in general.
* Open office, in which you can roam around. You can sit on the chair, on the sofa, or on the ground.
* Office time is fun time. There is a cheerful atmosphere in general.
* You get a laptop, a monitor, and a stacked cafeteria.


I will address some key issues which keep coming up in other reviews here.
Work from home -> It was not present earlier, but it is now. You can work from home.
Code quality -> Improving. It is up to you. If you see bad code you can cry about it or fix it.
Upper management -> Luckily I do not have the privilege to interact directly with these people. But most of what other reviews have said is actually true, it’s not good. Will expand more later.","There is no visibility regarding where the company is heading. You are just doing tasks assigned to you and fixing bugs. The upper management/HR knows about this and try to portray that they care, but the reality is people down below (at our level) still have very very limited visibility around things. It feels like the engineering team is just present to make sure that the product is up and running 24x7. We'll I guess that's the whole point of the engineering team, but I feel we should contribute to the company in ways other than producing code.

It feels very weird when you see the management take decisions without even being familiar with their own product or for that matter the competitors'. I clearly remember incidents where managers have said something that makes no sense at all.  Senior people are way too cool to go through ""onboarding"". I am not generalising, there are only a few people like this.

No contribution back to the community. Open source contribution is not encouraged. Company feels like everything is their intellectual property. Discussing anything internal about the company to the outside world is discouraged, even if it is common knowledge in the tech industry. It feels very saddening because most of the product is based on open source projects.

“It’s your job” attitude. You solved a difficult problem ? Well, that’s your job. You were able to fix something at 4 in the morning ? Well, that’s your job. It does not really matter. Because of this people now are slowly loosing the dedication and the responsibility they once had for their product. I am not talking about “appreciation”. I am talking about “acknowledgement”. The task of acknowledging something might seem trivial and unnecessary, but it helps a lot.

And then the company worries about high attrition rate. I am not sure do they even worry about it or have come to terms with it. Every employee is now considered to be replaceable. You think you are important to the company ? You solved 100 different problems ? You stayed in office, came on weekends, fixed issues, shrug off a 10th of a second so that you can get a big deal for the company ? Well bye bye I guess, they will just let you go, you are nothing but a code munching machine. And honestly if someone reaches this state, they should leave.

The deadlines are tight. Producing low quality code on time is encouraged. If it is on time, then it is good enough.

The company is not yet big in the terms of employees but they want to act like one. “values”, “targets”, “culture” all seem too superficial to me. Or the way these things are implemented/imbibed, seem too unconvincing and unnecessary, rather a lot artificial and text-book like. It should be something that comes out naturally and every employee can empathise with it. It should not be force fed.

This has become more of an open letter to the company, so I should stop.

I like working here and will recommend it, it’s not bad, but not great either. I think I have grown into it. If you care about what you are actually doing and not expect anything back from it, you’ll be happy. If you think what you do for the company, the company will do back for you, then you are in for a disappointment."
256,BrowserStack,I learned a lot here,2017-08-09,4.0,Lead Engineer,"I learned a lot of deep technical things here. The problems they work on can involve really deep tech work and can teach you a lot. I worked on cutting edge web technologies, at the same time there were things which were very deep into tcp stack. I learnt a lot about building and scaling engineering & hiring teams here. Compensation is really good here. Although wish they could have given everyone some bonuses and ESOPs. Founders are very product focused and are very very hands-on. The best thing about Browserstack was the extremely talented team that it has, along with Ritesh & Nakul. 

It is not a fluke that they are probably the only bootstrapped Indian startup which is heavily profitable in a US/west centric product. The amount of effort they put into constantly improving the product and data centric approach teaches you a lot.","I believe that founders are a little too hands-on. They should let go some parts like day to day running of teams/office/food/sales/hiring and focus more on product and more value-add things.

It is my very first company and I hate this company. This company is filled with yes men. Any one having any other idea is shot down. Product leadership is very weak and not knowing anything. Sales leadership is very good (for a change). Founders are unethical. They treated old employees  badly and all of them left. Old employees told me founders kept all money with them and did not share anything with them. Every year they got only Rs 1000 ($14) voucher.  Even 3 years with company and they got only $14 every year as bonus. Founders took million of $ from company but screwed over poor old employees who only got $14 every year. Now I am also leaving this pathetic company. I want to grow and don't want Browserstack to spoil my career.  Everyone leaves this company quickly because of bad management and bad founders. All employees here are new only. 

If you want to be happy in Browserstack become a simple yes-man and then suck up to the management. This is the culture of the company. I would suggest go join old Indian companies like Reliance. Reliance is the worst company in India and people abuse each other there but I will still suggest Reliance over Browserstack. I hate this company"

262,BrowserStack,Poster child of how not to make a Company,2017-01-30,1.0,Software Developer,- Some of the perks are very effective. Having all meals available in the office is very convenient for employees and saves a lot of time.,"- Terrible Attrition - 2 directors leaving in the span of one month. 5+ employees leaving in just the first quarter of the current year. If that does not scream incompetence I don't know what does. 


- The company has a bad leader. Accountability is heavily discounted as you move up the ladder. While one mistake on your part results in you being reprimanded and looked with suspicion forever, the directors can make blatant mistakes that change the course of the entire company to a windfall and there is not so much as an apology let alone repercussions.


-  Supremely terrible people managers. Infact I don't think there is any people manager at all. Browserstack the business takes far more precedence over Browserstack the organization (if it takes any precedence at all). 


- Atrocious work environment. Imagine writing code while you are sitting in a fish market. Browserstack is worse. Cramming 8 people in a table that would more suit 4 is their idea of an ""open culture"" or a place where people are  ""accessible"". 


- The working hours do not at all take into consideration having any sort of life beyond BS. Stay late, work when you reach home, work on the weekends. If there is work to be done, you better be doing it every living second of your life because that is all that is rewarded.


- Bootlickers go far. Time after time people have been promoted and put into positions they don't deserve over better and much deserving employees because the one trait that holds a massive priority is flattery. To judge someones competence based on how closely he/she works with the Directors is the best way to show a finger to your most hardworking employees. And guess what happens when those employees realise it? (Hint- Attrition rate is very high) The amount of talent and skill that is wasted every single day because of vanity and pride is mind boggling.


- Massive emotional drain. Every single employee who has spent a considerable time here is emotionally and mentally exhausted. And no one cares! If you cannot continue function at your peak all day every day you will be shown the door in a split second. It won't matter how much you have given to this company. It won't matter that you are going through a rough patch in your personal life. It won't matter that their unreasonable expectations from you cannot be humanly met. 


- You don't matter. The bottomline of every decision ever taken. The employee comes last. The employee holds no value. They are just a means to an end. And if they have to wear down and run over a few of them, they will. You will be put into a function you are not familiar with and not interested in and expected to work at your best because your master is telling you to."
263,BrowserStack,"Good product, terrible company. Don't even think about it.",2016-11-19,1.0,,"- Good pay, though recently even that has reduced.","Where do I even begin:

- Your interview is a joke. Your real work is 100% bug fixing.

- Your appraisals are random and based on whether top management likes you or not. It has nothing to do with your work and performance.

- How you move up the ladder is determined by the order - white skin, white accent, girl/woman, IIT/IIMs, others. Any permutation and combination of the 1st 3 will ensure that you get ESOPs and a big fat salary. If you fall into ‘Others' though, you might as well quit, instead of suffering, getting frustrated and then leaving with nothing to show for it.

- There are NO experienced employees to learn from. You will have to teach yourself, or learn from other inexperienced employees.

- The ENTIRE founding team has left the company in less than a year. Good, hard working people who spent years building the product got nothing in return and were either terminated or left out of frustration.

- 4 years ago, we were told the company would grow from less than 10 to 100 in 3 months. After 4 years, the company has struggled to reach even 80 employees.

- It doesn’t matter what you’ve contributed to the company or how long you’ve been there. You must remember that you don't matter. You are only there to make the founders richer. And if the founders favour you, you can claim to be a founding member too, even if you’ve only been there for a year or 2.

- When asked for product feedback, if your feedback is not liked, you will receive emails saying 'Idiot, don't give stupid suggestions and use your brain'. This is how the founders address employees.

- There is a no-lunch policy. You can't go out for lunch or take your team out for lunch, even if you've made a major release and want to celebrate. It's not allowed. You will be taken aside and reprimanded. Even while eating in the pantry, if the founders feel there is important work, you are expected to leave your lunch and do the work till it's fixed.

- I have often heard the founders say 'If I am paying them money, they should work'. This means nights, weekends, weekdays, holidays or any other time the founders deem ""necessary”. At one point, the founders even considered calling employees on weekends to take typing lessons to type and code faster, to ship faster.

- No work/life balance AT ALL. How will 2 guys who have no social lives or social dynamic ever understand work/life balance? Having fun at work is frowned upon. There is not even a library for employees to read and learn from. Nothing. No skill development. Just sit and fix bugs all day. 

- You are expected to work at least 9 hours a day, but this could go up to 12-14 hours. And after this, if you show up late to work, your salary will be reduced. 

- You will work on ridiculous tasks that have no research, validation or thought. They are merely dreamed up by the founders, and you are expected to build it. And once you work on and build this ridiculous feature, it will either not go live, or you will have to rework it entirely because the founders suddenly feel like ‘it doesn'ts works’.

- The company has no vision or plan for the future. The big goal is 'Make money'. That is the central driving force at BrowserStack. The goal is to make the founders and partners richer, while you, the slave, get tired, disrespected, frustrated and eventually burned out.

- No matter what you build, even 50% will not go live, because the overall skill level of PMs is very very low. Inexperienced PMs who have NEVER coded or designed will instruct you on how to code and design.

- Do not trust HR at all. They will lie to your face with sweet talk. None of your concerns really matter. Remember, you are only there to make the ""founding partners"" rich."

It is motivating to see teams aligning and I think that's a great thing. The important point to be noted here is not that the teams look great now, but that they have recognized their problem and worked towards solving it. I see the same attitude in my team. This brings into light their willingness to make something better.",None to me as of today. I will be updating if any. I will relay the cons internally as well.

1. Founders view employees as slaves. You get treated like slaves and you are micromanaged. Slavery is timed very closely by the HR. No daily wage for coming even 1 minute late or clocking out early.
2. HR is uneducated, uncouth and extremely political and influential. Steer totally clear of this one. 
3. Careers come to die in this company. Do not expect any form of career growth. Management is not interested to see you grow. Its because slaves are meant to be slaves
4. All the old people who built this great product are gone. They put in the blood sweat and tears and got NOTHING for it. No shares, no commendation, nothing.
5. Forget about any equity or shares. If the old people did not get even 1 share, why will you. Unless you are an employee in their US office. Double standards are common here

- No professional growth
- No decision-making power
- Substandard HR department - worse than the worst HR of any other company
- No grade system for salaries, so they widely differ from department to department. Very quick way to learn your worth within the company"

274,BrowserStack,Fun and challenging atmosphere,2016-03-21,5.0,Software Developer,"Challenging work means you will never get bored here. There are always difficult and interesting problems to solve.  
The compensation is one of the best in the industry.  
Office is comfortable, with well stocked pantry and good amenities.  
Unless you work in support or sales, or have some urgent work to do, Saturdays are off.","Challenging, fast paced environment sometimes means there is no downtime allowed, and your productivity expected is the absolute maximum every time.  
The timings are a little flexible, which is nice, but it means everyone comes in late, and leaves late."
275,BrowserStack,"""Superb Place to Work...If Work with Fun can happen anywhere, its here""",2016-03-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work is challenging being a startup, product is awesome and purely technical with good tech team.
Always surrounded by passionate people having hunger to learn and explore.
Good environment for learning.
Fast paced culture and ideal place for a technical person to work.
Office pantry is awesome, always well stocked with many options.
For me, it is the best company to work with who not only motivates junior and middle staff but also helps in every manner in all aspects of growth.",Fun work yet the cons overshadow the positive. Though I believe that there is always room for improvement in anything. But thinking of things to improve here it becomes so difficult because all you see around is Positive and goody.
276,BrowserStack,Great technical exposure,2015-11-16,4.0,Software Engineer,"The breadth of technical challenges you face at BrowserStack is hard to find in most of the companies, especially based out of India. Its an ideal place for a person who has interests in hacking on new problems across a wide range of technologies. At BrowserStack, your technical know-how increases tremendously as you're working on a purely technical product with a good tech team. And of course, since BrowserStack is very popular among the web development community, you have a great audience to build stuff for.","BrowserStack is part of a big community of web developers, QA engineers, automation engineers, etc. A lot can be gained by sharing the tech knowledge with the community via blog posts or open source contributions. This is currently difficult to achieve as the complete focus is on developing a cutting edge product."
277,BrowserStack,Great Place To Work !!,2015-11-05,5.0,,"Great place to work. Associates across all teams are extremely helpful and supportive. Many things to learn from the peers and seniors. Open channels of communications and easy accessibility of the management. Great benefits too. All 3 meals are on the house. Friday evening Snacks are ordered from cool restaurants and the evening is turned into a fun gathering for all. A cafeteria full of snacks, munchies, soft drinks , juices (these are just some of the things). Constant innovation in all areas of the organisation. Focus is always on solving problems with the simplest of solutions. Haven't encountered any kind of politics and the working culture is very inclusive and transparent. Best of the tools are provided and constant up-gradations are carried out.  A fine example of what a workplace should be.",Work Life balance can be improved further.
278,BrowserStack,Software Developer,2015-09-23,2.0,Software Engineer,Technically work is good. But quality of work has been steadily decreasing since all major problems have been solved. Will give you good environment for learning.,Work environment is really bad. Work life balance is screwed and you wont enjoy even a little there. There wont be any outside life and you will be stuck with work throughout the day.
279,BrowserStack,Awesome place to work.,2015-09-13,5.0,Software Developer,"Product based company
Awesome people with awesome knowledge
Nice working culture
No politics
Exponential learning curve
Unlimited Snacks
Founders are really cool and hear the opinion of everyone.",Not exactly a con but office timing doesn't suit me.It's a 11-8 job and I prefer 9-6(or 5) kinda job.
