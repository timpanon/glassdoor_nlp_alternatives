- Great benefits (amazing pantry, free lunch everyday, lots of company swag all year round, etc.)

However, do note that this is largely helped by the fact that we're based in Singapore and thus exist in the same timezone as Beijing, so international meetings don't happen at odd hours for us compared to offices in London and Bay Area, for instance.","- Less annual leaves than my previous company (but with the ability to carry forward unlimited leaves), 
- Slower career growth for non-China based employees (according to my co-workers)

685,ByteDance,two much additional work,2021-02-24,4.0,Android Developer,pleasant work environment; good salary,Working overtime is quite common in this company
686,ByteDance,Career altering mistake,2021-02-24,1.0,Sales Director,"The company has a leading B2C solution across the globe (TikTok), and heavy hiring plans that come from the cash rich advertising revenues and other 'data' agreements. The company is incredibly large, so scope for horizontal movement could potentially be very good if you are looking to come in and reskill over the course of a couple of years.","You will quickly realise, as per other reviews - this company has no concern for the wellbeing of its employees or the morality/ethical practice of business. They simply want route to cash as quick as humanly possible - and it shows. At a macro level you may hear of 'copycat' softwares coming out of this region, and this company is in the epicentre of it. Competitor analysis took a new meaning here, as to define every single move and practice the company made.

The company is heavily skewed towards Chinese employees, for which they have exported to every corner of the globe to attempt to maintain a stranglehold control on the management layer of the business. I would estimate that 90% of the management at the company is Chinese and to your eyes, seem vastly underqualified for their roles otherwise. Make no mistake, if you do not speak Mandarin at this company - your views will not be trusted or taken into consideration. You will be an 'outsider'. Note that even the American TikTok CEO lasted only a month before resigning. 

Despite being a senior hiring manager, I did not get the final say on who I would employ, what their duties were to be, or be seen to achieve if I set up my employees to be successful. I would be seen as 'in competition' with the people I hired the entire time.

Aside from the issues above, there are wider problems. The company suffers from a deep lack of transparency. We would often find out about major company changes or moves from popular news platforms before we would get any kind of internal notification (if acknowledged at all) and there is a general secretive nature about the business which unsettles both employees and prospective customers.

If you are not Chinese, and are expecting to make this company successful outside of the Chinese regions for a product which is not core (TikTok advertising) I would strongly suggest you considering other employment opportunities. You will have limited scope for success, growth and otherwise gain experience which is not relevant to other companies at this business."

By this I mean both management and cooperations with other colleagues. The bi-month goals changed constantly and therefore created lots of chaos. Colleagues will drop random questions or tasks to you (one time, I was asked to be the interviewer of another team's candidates. Of course I rejected politely). Due to the fact that most leaders are very young (inexperienced), the management is therefore very chaotic. I was astonished how some leaders don't even understand the basics of business data ( like how to analyze funnel data) . In one word, if your tolerance for mess is low, do not come here. 

- Not a product-driven company. The company values tech over product/design. Most techs might throw technical tasks/questions to PMs. Seems to me that the product teams have no product architect members. 

- Overly reliance on documents/meetings. You will spend up to 30% of your time attending meetings. Long hours spent on document writing as well. 

- Working hour. If you look for work/life balance, do not come, because ByteDance offers none. 

- Lack of focus. You will have many tasks on-going at the same time, causing you and the team have no sense/possibility to focus on the most important objective. You will have little time thinking/discussing your work focus. Most are coming down from upper-level OKRs. This is not a company respecting independent judgement."

- Centrally located.
- Free coffee, but no milk during weekends or holidays.","- Watching thousands of videos a night with horrible songs slowly but surely melts the brain. 

- Intense pressure to have a next to perfect accuracy. With badly translated guidelines and constantly changing rules, this is impossible.

- Stretching the limits of the law beyond imaginable. In the first week, I had to sign an appendix to the contract allowing ‘rotational’ shifts to be put in place, night work, work on holidays, work on weekends. It was either sign or resign. After a few months, these shifts have become standard. Only one person is “granted” to do the early shift for one week, maximum. Everyone else works in the night shift and on weekends plus holidays. Extra pay is the lawful minimum.

- Days off are completely random, could be a Monday and a Thursday this week. A Sunday and a Tuesday next week. 6/7 day in a row work weeks are commonplace.

- 6 month probation period, during which 70% of the team has been fired by the supervisor while they were sick or on holidays. The HR guy didn’t even bother to inform them.  

- During the job interview, the senior recruiter lies about “possibilities” in the company. But you have to wait out the 6 month probation period. After this, you’re told there are none. End of the line here.

-  Supervisor is incompetent beyond belief. Supervisors work hours are roughly from 11 to 18:00 hours. 99% of the team arrives at 16:00 and stays till 01:00. Who exactly are you supervising then? Doesn’t take the effort to get to know anyone, only communicates with favorites. Doesn’t know the very basics of the work we do after being on the job 6 months.

- Supervisor intimidates and lashes out at anyone who dares to be critical. Does not have any sense of self-criticism. Blames the whole world. Needs to be told by lower-ranking team members how to do job.

- Constant lies about reasons for radical changes or why there isn’t any new staff hired to take the pressure off the workload. Blame is always put on “China”, where in fact only the local supervisor decides these things.

- As the office in which its located doesn’t have staff operating after 17:00 the air-condition is either off and leaves it smelling like a dump or on freezer mode and leaves everyone sick. Windows can’t be opened. Dishes aren’t done during the weekends, toilets smell like a sewer.

- Pay is terrible, especially considering the toll it takes on personal health and family life."

4. Dont care about worker's lives and health. Everything for free was just to make people for long hours. Dont really care about career development."
1043,ByteDance,Terrible ethics and culture.,2019-04-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are good benefits and a handful of great teams with stellar individuals based out of Los Angeles.,"Working here was the worst.

The culture is so toxic, as there's hardly any trust between anyone and the combative nature of most teams often mean not coming to productive agreements on important projects. In most departments the leadership is lackluster and in need of major improvement, with some team leads being extremely inexperienced, uncommunicative and antagonistic even to their own team. In some cases, it's common for individuals to take on initiatives overnight without consulting the team, leading to conflicts that often see other members pinned as lazy and unmotivated.

The daily expectation is to work long hours, usually with short notice regardless of holidays or time off, and to be always available with hundreds of requests to answer in the dead of night. Communication is extremely lacking between countries despite trying to mediate time zone differences, and grievances are hardly handled with any resolution.

Role expectations are cloudy at best. Any individual can reach out to you with tasks that don't fit your job description but you're expected to do it anyway, and do it fast without any questions or guidance under the guise of urgency. Reaching out for any clarification often results in no real answers, and whenever issues occur it gets blamed as your attitude and work ethic being poor. 

Growth doesn't seem possible as you're expected to never question your role or team structure, unless you ""prove"" yourself to be deserving of promotion against impossible standards. Expressing a desire to grow in your role or team gets shut down and you don't have a say if you're moved from projects, teams or departments without notice. When people leave they are easily replaced without proper consultation from team members. 

Do not work here, the shininess of being in a new and big tech company gets overshadowed quickly by the sheer amount of disrespect, poor treatment and general toxicity that occurs every day. The company must improve and make major changes immediately or else more qualified and talented employees will continue to leave."

There is no basic rotation principle. Business needs have first priority, not the health of employees.

1106,ByteDance,Worst company I've ever worked for. Avoid if you can.,2018-03-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Free food
-Nice office
-Friendly US coworkers","-The most unorganized, unprofessional company I've even been associated with.
-No room for growth unless you're Chinese/based in China.  All decision makers/bosses are based in Beijing and due to the time difference most decisions are made overnight while you're unable to offer your input. 
-Most corporate communication is in Chinese so oftentimes you feel left out of important companywide information.
-The company has no strategy behind any of their decisions or at least it's kept secret and not communicated outside of upper management
-Young and inexperienced managers who have no idea what it's like to manage anyone and offer very little direction while setting unrealistic goals and setting employees up for failure (hitting 60% of your OKRs is essentially passing)
-Very rare to get a promotion and oftentimes you're just shuffled around within the company moving from product to product and don't have any say in the products you work on
-Upper management refuses to listen to any feedback or criticism. Anyone I know who has tried has been let go from the company.
-Chinese work culture is terrible working 12+ hours/day and 6 days/week, so US employees feel pressure to be ""always on"" and responsive at all hours of the day often responding to messages in the middle of the night
-The company relies too heavily on their AI and algorithms that never seem to work
-Non-existant HR to report complaints to"
