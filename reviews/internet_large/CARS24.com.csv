There are enough reviews here that are pointing out this work-life imbalance, I don't know what HR People are doing about it. Company just can't ignore such criticism by stating that they are scaling up etc. Why can't you people understand that when people are happy their productivity increases and when they aren't no matter how many hours they work productivity will remain same or in worst cases it may also decrease. Why would any organisation want that? This aspect needs serious intervention from the senior management.

Apart from listening to issues of Retail Team to support and find them solution. They are providing PIP's and pressurising to exit. 
They don't want to find any solutions to problems,moreover they only needs numbers without supporting them in any manner.

 If anyone get a better price from market or competition than you can also sell your car to them.

They don't know A B C D about vehicles and those morons are leading the team as a Sr. General Manager and as a ZM.
3) No job securities, you will get terminated any time with any intimation.
4) HR departments are useless, they don't have any authorities to take any kind of action , they are the poppets of IITs & IIMs.
5) They will commit you for the good incentives but they will never pay, they will deduct your incentives by giving meaningless reasons.

Newer employees are gruelled like anything (it is a pro as they get to learn so much)","Work From Home - Yes, but please drop a mail to manager, L2 manager, CTO and Head of HR to get it approved. Simple.

Flexible timings - Yes, until one random day (once a month or two) your manager will come with a sheet of all your  punches for the month. And if you have not averaged more than 9 hours, you will be punished for it, may be even fired (firing is pretty common and they take it with pride that as startup they think they are supposed to hire and fire).

Salary Deduction - Pray this doesn't happen. If it does, then no one can revert it. Reasons are for arguments sake only. To err is human.

Long hours - Deliver or not, it doesn't matter. As the top management (read CTO), believes if you are not in the office after 7, you are doing putting effort, yes SEVEN in the evening.

I have spent good 3.5 years at Cars24 so believe I can give a great review on in-depth company workings. Few Pros:

Opportunities: This is a fast pace company with high growth aspirations. There are projects across verticals where you can try each and every skill that you might have. And best part, people love you when you participate and  try to help solve some of their current issues.

Work culture and values: From the very early stage, Cars24 is driven with its core 7 values. Every decision (hiring, training, spends, individual growth, HR policies, key business decision etc) is driven by these core values. All the CXOs and top leadership live by these values. And again the best part, these values are super employee friendly.

Open and honest:  The amount of transparency the CXOs have with the company as well as the amount of trust that is immediately offered (irrespective of the rank) is very rare to see in high growth companies. It makes employees super invested into the company because they can see their impact each day.

Great focus on learning and development: Irrespective of the department one is part of, company puts a lot of effort and resources to ensure everyone is getting required training and upskilling. They have a dedicated learning and development team for core business functions and internal/external knowledge sharing for support functions.","Information availability: Though the entire leadership tries to ensure all key facts are shared earliest, there are time when delay in inter - team discussions cause teams to pick un-optimized routes. Given the growth focus, there is a possibility that multiple teams are working on same/similar project and you miss out on the current status.

Although steps have been taken to reduce it, there is still a feeling of the company being more reactive than proactive with things sometimes being left to the last minute.

One critical thing is that the company can be quite fast paced, and I sometimes feel that I cant keep up and miss out on a lot of pieces happening around, but that says more about me than the company!!"

2) Highly incompetent middle management, so you will always feel smarter 

That's all guys!","Lets categorise cons into ""Hiring and Firing"", ""HR policies"", ""Work life balance"" ""Managers"" and ""good fits""

""Hiring and Firing""

1) The company is amazingly dynamic in a truest sense. They hired 2k employees in 5months and then fired 1.2k employees in 2 weeks. 
2) They Fired 40 developers from Bangalore office without giving them even a month's severance 
3) I know an employee who got hired after a week of joining. I was stunned. Then it happened to me :p

""HR Policies""

1) HR here is expert in exploiting the employees by intimidating them 
2) They won't reverse salary, in case of miss punch 
3) They won't entertain Work From Home 
4) You can be called over weekends, just like slaves 
5) Every now and then they change the policies to exploit more people 

""Work Life Balance""

1) Lets not talk about this, as once the CEO him admitted, don't expect to have personal lives if you work in CARS24

""Managers""

1) Good politicians specially in Product and Tech 
2) CTO here is amazingly political, should join BJP 

""Good Fits"" 
1) No offence but people how are from service industries like TCS, Infosys can join here 
2) People who are unemployed for at-least 2 years can consider joining here 

PS: Just see the reply of the HR on this review and then see it on rest of the reviews. They just copy and paste"

609,CARS24.com,Worst Place to Work At,2019-05-23,1.0,Retail Manager,Concept and Technology is good,Company is not at all employee friendly and is too rigid. long working hours and no weekly off. you have to work for 10 hours 6 days a week. Sat Sun is working. Working hours is 9am to 7pm. They have zero tolerance on late coming. even if you're late by 2-3mins you will be given a warning from HR. Two warnings and you're out from the company. No off on holidays. Pathetic working condition. Their branches are out of water and electricity supply as they don't pay electricity bill and rent and maintenance.
610,CARS24.com,software engineer,2019-05-17,1.0,Software Engineer,Very challenging job. May be u will fired next day or same day of joining.,"CTO is pyscho. He thinks that he know every technology but actually he is big 0.  Vikram hired him because his previous record is excellent in shutting down company tech teams . CTO hires people than start firing. May be he enjoy it.
Which CTO puts feet on table in meeting. He don't have any manners.

 Really the company was good under previous  CTO  but new CTO has ruined the company's reputation.


Psycho will create psychological emergency, will make your life hell. Will ask you to complete 2 months work in 15 days. Once you deliver 2 months work in 15 days. He will start crying for code quality but actually he dont know how to code. He just listen about some technology from someone and believes that he is now master in that technology . If you get any bug in system it's your bad luck. No one can save you. Psycho never talk to you, he will come to you, will kick your mind, and leave. Most repeated statements by psycho in past 1 month. ""I don't know how you will do it, but I need that on time (time decided by psycho)."" If you are in office till 12 AM, you should be in office by 10.30 AM. If you are late than that time max 11.00 AM you should be in office. He has hired all engineering managers like a cow. They never opposes whatever is being thrown by psycho. 
Psycho think people should work for him whole night. if he will call you at 1:00 am you should reply and do work.

If you still planning to join cars24, best of luck!!!"

In the beginning, the company was an excellent place to work, but over time, it started to become a typical biased work culture where you just need to be quiet and listen to your boss, if you complain, your promotion will be delayed because your boss has issues with you. I worked for this company for 3 years since the start itself, and can strongly say that this company really need to work on their employees welfare instead of just running behind the growth and stop fooling employees in the name of incentives.

Business and roles largely are well structured so everyone knows what exactly is to be delivered,"The top management has nepotism written all over it as one of the business leaders (low educational pedigree and low general understanding of business or strategy) seems to be hired only due to her personal family relationship with the COO of the firm. Decisions of hiring and firing are taken too quickly and aren't well thought out. Perceptions are formed too soon. If they perceive you to be wrong then regardless of anything you wouldn't be able to change their mind.
Decent to join till about junior level executive or junior level management like store associates and store managers. But if you are anything above it; let's say you belong to a top tier engineering school or top tier B school, are joining at sales head, sales tm,  retail head, retail tm, city manager, etc or above and are serious about your career in the long term then this company is best to be avoided. You would be a hero one day or for many days, but 1 mistake and you would be fired without the slightest sense of respect or human regard. They don't believe in making you have a career which any top tier educational pedigree guy/gal would expect but they would conveniently hire you asap and then in case anything goes wrong you would be fired extremely conveniently too without any formal written warning.
If people reading this think that I am just a disgruntled ex employee and that my review is just an aberration to the otherwise awesome glassdoor rating (>4) of the firm then lemme tell you that all HO employees have been personally forced by the senior management to write raving reviews about the firm (around 4-5 months back) which one cannot refuse because they found out through some research that having a bad glassdoor rating was hampering their ability to hire top talent and decided to make all people write 4 or 5 star inorganic reviews."

661,CARS24.com,Company has its pros and cons,2019-02-06,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The challenge! If you are a motorhead, you will love this company! The learning curve and understanding of the industry cars24 gives you is unmatched across India.

Management is helpful and will not put too much pressure on you to achieve targets(which is a con in itself will explain below). 
Growth I have no idea about, but these guys are expanding and hiring aggressively so lets see.

All in all a good place to work, but can be better due the cons below.","First con: Unrealistic targets. I understand Cars24 is a startup and is in fact growing so targets to be high and blah blah but come on, stores that have never achieved the target you give will not achieve it in the future too when you keep increasing them, especially when you open 5 more stores in the same city.  At least put some achievable target which can be done on a month on month basis, maybe missing a bad month here and there.
Second Con: Motivation to achieve targets are incentives. What motivation will be there if you cut incentives for every silly reason that comes up? 2x 3x incentives does not work. Just stop cutting incentives.
Third Con, a six day working week! Expect to put in atleast 60 hour work weeks with incentives being cut for coming even 1 minute late, but no overtime pay when you cross that 9 hour login time. Ever thought that employees are becoming complacent because they are burned out?? When the world is on 40 Hour weeks, 60 hours weeks are stupid. 
Fourth Con: NO EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT activities! None. Management thinks the time this engagement thingy will happen, is the time they can utilise to buy one more car or one more dealer to be onboarded."

2.  Good company for top B school people.","Company has several issues. 
1. Anyday could be your last working day if you are not favourite of your TM. ( Mid management is highly biased)
2. Work Life balance is very bad.
9:30 punch time but no fix time to punch out. 
One day you will leave little early next day you will start hearing comments. 
3. Few managers use derogatory comments in front of team members. 
4. Vision of company is bad because company dont respect employees and their dealer network too. 
5. You could be asked anytime to share whatsapp location just to prove that you have reached for meeting. 
6. HR team is good but they are bounded by senior management to obey their instructions. 
7. High Hire and Fire percentage.

I wont say company is not good. But the work ethics and favourism at mid management leads to your exit from company. And when You fight for your right you are told today is your last working day. 


So keep calm and take your salary till the time company dont fire you."
