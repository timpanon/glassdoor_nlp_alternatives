Knowing the process of how they verify news for the website, I'm never concerned that it's inaccurate. Highly respected among longtime viewers who have migrated online. The hours are a bit long (expect to work some 60-hour weeks if you want to move up the ranks) but pretty reasonable (rarely night or weekend shifts needed, barring breaking news). They are actually investing in the newsroom, which not many organizations can say. They are really working on being as cross-platform as possible.","In Digital, there is a lot of emphasis on speed, and a lot of emphasis on Twitter, which is not really where traffic or readership comes from.
A lot has been invested in new ""lifestyle content"" that may erode some of the news credibility, especially online."

It used to have a lot of great things going for it until new management came in.,Managers don't care and target people who complain and get away with it. They also use pressure tactics to get people to quit or spread rumors about employees with coworkers. I've seen so many people leave and Go to Yahoo Finance because of this behavior.

Working hours are incredibly long and expectations on small teams are unrealistically high making getting out and securing a new role extremely tough. Junior staff are expected to run the place as poor performance, favouritism, mis-managment and incompetence at director and VP level is left totally unchecked. Bullying and whisper campaigns from management are common and make it a very tricky place to enjoy attending daily and believe you can succeed."
88,CNBC,Digital Video,2018-11-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great and extremely young people on the team, free gym","This isn't a place for people that like actual journalism. Headline journalism is too much of a thing on this team and then some producers rely on younger people to find the research to support the higher ups' thesis that doesn't make sense a lot of the time. Not a lot of initiative from older people on the team to diversify their skill set. Most of the younger people can shoot, edit and research very well. If they don't, they are eager to learn. Some of the seniors can't do anything of these things properly. I'll give them this though, they're really good at acting busy all day long."

Mine was extremely inept and a bully with zero mgmt skills, but was kept at a very high ranking position anyway, pulling the wool over everyone's eyes. If you love the rush of working in the home of media which is NYC, look elsewhere. It was depressing to look outside a window and see a NJ car park (if you had a window, most cubicles didn't) People were very stuck up and clique-ey."

Not working on the weekends (in TV this is very rare).,Not much upward mobility due to employees not leaving the company...a good sign in some regards.  Difficult for managers to accept that employees have interests outside of work and occasionally need to use their personal days...it's like pulling teeth to get personal days approved (and we're entitled to 5 days/year).  CNBC is considered the leader in business news but rarely do they want to try new ideas for programming...they're coasting and I think the viewers pick up on that.
