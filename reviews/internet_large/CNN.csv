20,CNN,Great Company,2022-02-06,5.0,Writer,"CNN is a great company. I basically grew up working here as I started soon after graduating from college. The company invest in its employees, presumably so they can retain them. There were tons of perks: a gym in the building, health programs (they paid for you to train for and do a triathlon), company 5ks, free FitBits, free tickets to sports events, discounted tickets to various Atlanta spots like Botanical Gardens or High Museum of Art, tons of PTO.","Lack of diversity in upper management. CNN is relatively diverse among the rank and file but not so much in the upper or even mid-management. The compensation is also not that great if you start their young, as I did, and stay in the same role in the same department. Your best raises will come if you switch departments or roles (ex: writer for Domestic becomes a writer for International; writer for Domestic becomes a producer for Domestic.). If you rely on just the yearly merit-based raises, i.e, you remain a writer at Domestic for years, your raises will be paltry. They’re less than 5 percent; I believe they’re on average 2.5-3 percent. That’s barely anything and discourages loyalty to a particular role or department."

Best part is working with global leaders and experts like Wolf Blitzer, Christiane Amanpour, all CNN International and incredible shows like Parts Unknown, Anderson Cooper 360 and financial programs with Richard Quest. The programming for CNNI, TBS and special projects is award winning for a reason!","Far too much instability - very difficult to tell if we were being dismissed or laid off from day to day. Every day felt like a mystery regarding our employment status. 

My director was the only reason I was terribly uncomfortable and kept looking for another department to go to. She didn’t have the same senior skills needed to be successful and a leader in our division. She was difficult with which to work due to her anger management issues and many people agreed. It took them years to get the courage to speak to  her about it and finally let her go. She would leave early every day to get hair cuts or work from home yet she was very inaccessible during afternoon working hours and would get angry if you called her to ask about things pertaining to work. Work from home was not an option for me during my ten years so I stayed on site upwards of 10+ hours a day as our group had a lot of work and there were only a few of us to manage it...and that took a serious toll on my weight and health.

I came in at 26,000 USD so it cost me more to work there than I was getting in return. It was a labor of love for 10 years because I wasn’t paid enough to purchase  a home or pay off my student loans. I still have the same student debt that I entered the company with in early 2004. It’s not a place to make a living if you’re just out of college, it’s an extension of your studies and so you really can’t stay and make an industry impact or survive on such low wages even if you double major in relevant fields and previous experience.

Working through hunger, sleeping overnight during storms and blizzards was challenging. Lots of egos to overlook. It was so bad to the point some senior management that I supported would pretend not to see me if I waved at them in the hall/courtesy hellos but would email me privately to say thanks for the hard work, etc. that same day. I don’t know what that was about. I dressed up everyday so, not sure why they seemed ashamed of the association. 

It can feel like a very disrespectful environment at times but I loved my work so I stayed until drastic change took place that made it impossible to remain. I should have left sooner but I had a lot of hope. I ran out of hope and I was tired of going hungry and lack of job stability so I didn’t stay."

There are some AMAZING colleagues, and some managers I wouldn't hire to be an intern. 

Managers are OFTEN promoted from very limited career experiences (sometimes solely at CNN), and it shows. These managers who've never worked at another news organization, are often petty, weak leaders, sometimes even after being sent to Poynter's Leadership Academy or other leadership training.

Rather than look at each employee's strengths and weaknesses, management behavior largely depends on current mood, and whether the direct report is in a particular clique. I've seen MANY quality people pushed out because of a personality conflict between themselves and a direct report, when a good manager would work to resolve the issue and regain the quality work from that employee.

I saw colleagues who were treated horribly for the most ridiculous reasons, often outside their control. I also saw managers give direction to all direct reports, then give opposing direction to someone whose life they simply want to make more difficult, or even to push a particular person to resign.

I walked out that door with a promise...to NEVER subject myself to such an unhealthy environment again. You may end up with a good manager, but they are few in that newsroom.

Don't make the mistake of thinking you can leave stressors at the door of the CNN newsroom . Work life at CNN will ABSOLUTELY bleed over into your personal life. That's an unfortunate promise I'm now qualified to make."

You're paid for being present, not your expertise or skill.

3. Great healthcare plan
3. 100% 401k match
4. Various discounts with car companies, phone companies, etc
5. The diner is being renovated and will be amazing
6. Your friends will think its cool you work at CNN, but trust me, its not...","1.  Pay - you'd make more money waiting tables. No seriously...
2. Schedule - you work almost every holiday (I'm talking Christmas, Thanksgiving, and this isn't because you're low on the totem pole, its like this for everyone on the production side), you WILL work overnights, you WILL work weekends, you WILL work 5am shifts, you WILL lose any semblance of social life you had.
3. Management - pretty much nonexistent. Don't ever plan on getting valuable feedback on your progress or having someone go to bat for you. I've had some terrible managers before but the incompetence of mgmt for this dept is beyond belief.
4. No promotion track - mgmt is terrible so like I said, you're on your own. They'll promise you a 6 month/year promotion track but in reality you're looking at 2-4+ years before sniffing a promotion. Doesn't matter if you work your tail off.
5. No training - the job is super easy and you're not doing anything sexy at all, so your delusions of grandeur will be rocked when you realize you're never going to learn anything unless you go out of your way to teach yourself.
6. Culture - everyone is pretty much miserable from top to bottom. Its a common joke that you will have no social life and no money. In fact people wear it like a badge of honor, but personally I prefer happiness over sulking day in and day out with my coworkers.
7. Respect - yes, you're bottom of the barrel, but you'd have a hard time finding an intro level job somewhere else that treats you this badly. Be prepared to have producers yelling ""PROMPTER!!!"" at you even when you've worked on their show for 2 years.

CONCLUSION - you will advance 100x faster and learn 100x more at a local station where you are valued as a person and not another number. There are incredible people and incredible jobs at CNN/Turner, but the News Assistant job will set you back years in career development and financial stability. 

This job is a glorified internship that's full time and doesn't just last a summer, it lasts as long as you wait until realizing you should leave.

324,CNN,CNN Digital - Product,2018-05-02,3.0,Various Roles In Product,"1) The people, with few exceptions, are great.  People within the product org are friendly, collegial, and have a good sense of humor.  They're the main reason that I stayed for as long as I did.
2) The CNN brand is recognizable throughout the world, and carries weight on a resume (more so for journalists, but still).  And you can accuse CNN of bias, but you have to admit that the company is a big voice in the media space and plays an important role on the national stage.
3) Once you've made it into Turner, there are lots of opportunities to move around to other brands if you wish (though it's  very dependent on your ability to network).
4) Product moved into renovated offices at the end of 2017, and the updated space is nice and modern (more like a modern Silicon Valley office, though not as extravagant).
5) The downtown (CNN Center) location is very convenient to reach by car (free parking), bike, or MARTA.  It's also a short walk to lots of good food destinations.
6) Turner takes community service seriously, and allows you to take off up to 40 hours annually for volunteer activities (as long as it doesn't impact your work).  There's also a semi-annual Turner Volunteer Day, which provides staff with the option to serve the community via activities that are organized by Turner staff (they do a great job).","1) One of the most consistent, sustained complaints among Product Managers and Directors is that they feel like order takers and project managers, and that they aren't involved in defining the strategy of their products.  This is due to a lack of resources (e.g. Product Managers have to act as PMs, the Product Strategy team was dissolved years ago), expertise (e.g. CNN/Turner doesn't offer any form of strategy training), and expectations from the senior mgt team (who do not emphasize strategic thinking).
2) Senior management (VPs & above) are just ok, at best.  Actual leadership skills are lacking or missing entirely, and there hasn't been a real vision for the Product org in years.  As a result, defined organizational goals have also been weak or entirely missing.  Missing vision and goals makes coordination throughout the ranks difficult, and creates a lot of confusion.
3) Big, wide-ranging decisions are often made based on gut feelings, rather than relying on data and careful reasoning.  Senior leadership is replete with ego and bias, and they respond very poorly to being challenged and constructive criticism (despite preaching otherwise).
4) CNN is not particularly innovative or proactive about its products.  Annual product roadmaps are largely defined by whatever the org didn't roll out in the previous year, copying competitors moves, reacting to Apple/Google/Facebook, or by the whims of senior management (who mostly rely on industry buzz to inform their decisions).
5) Product has restructured every year for the past 5 years, which involved staff cuts.  The restructures occurred without much warning, and the reasons given (if they were given at all) tended to be vague and superficial (""It's a fast moving industry, so this is totally normal."")  The most recent restructuring was in February/March 2018.
6) Mobility i very restricted and salary increases are pitiful.  Most people have been in the same roles for years, and CNN tends to hire from without rather than promote from within."

If you're hungry for opportunities and offer yourself up to various teams, there's a lot of opportunity for growth. The company rewards people who want to learn vs. those who are comfortable coasting. Of course, every team and role is different. The benefits can't be beat - healthcare coverage, gym memberships, etc. Although that might change depending on how the merger with AT&T goes.","As with any job/industry, you do have to put in your time when you're starting out, either as a freelancer or a News Associate. You'll work long, sometimes unconventional hours for little pay. That said, you'll move up quickly within your first year or two and if you hustle, doors will open."

349,CNN,"CNN: exciting  & dynamic work enviroment, but less job security-",2017-11-14,4.0,Senior Futures Editor,"1. CNN has a dynamic, frenetic pace, with the core activity being chasing breaking news, which is fascinating  if you like fast-paced work that forces you to learn about something new with each  unique news story.  It is a requirement that you enjoy thinking outside the box, because every news story has its own nuances and themes, which require that  you improvise a new set of tools to get accurate information from sources. There is no repetitive daily grind in this line of work. 
2.  Great people to work with:  very smart and talented people, who love the frenetic pace of news gathering as much as you should.  No dull people looking for a quiet day need apply, and very few survive there for long.
3. Great benefits and usually good salaries. 
4. A great place to build a career in journalism; CNN ( still!) has great brand recognition and so it is a good springboard to other media companies.","CNN, like almost all news media organizations, is  in a long-term struggle for survival to keep subscribers and advertisers as the Internet pulls more and more eyes away from traditional news outlets. This translates into radical changes as management tries new ways to increase viewership, resulting in periodic seismic shifts in  staffing... so stay for the exciting work, but make sure you keep your resume polished and have a back-door exit plan. It used to be the case that talented employees could count on their job being permanent (barring acts of misconduct);  but that is no longer the case.  Expect periodic downsizings and elimination of special departments (i.e. CNN's science and technology unit).
As one of my former managers helpfully suggested as my unit was being reformed and I was left without a job, ""embrace change""."

2. The benefits are good, especially the 401(k) match.

3. Lots of paid time off.

4. Great way to meet people all over the world.

5. Being a part of history unfolding.","1. It's amazing how out of touch management is with the journalists. The gap is very wide. Hard to tell whether they don't know or don't care. Probably half of each.

2. Threat of a layoff or reorg always hanging over your head -- though that really makes CNN like most big companies these days. Not sure that would be better anywhere else, especially anything that tries to make money off free information.

3. Wildly varying workloads. Some people phone it in or don't do a lot while people with more to do than they can handle are then given even duties. I had colleagues whose eyes would literally pop and their jaws literally drop when I showed them how much work I'd do in shift.

4. Related to No. 3 -- quality of your work has very little to do with how you fare at CNN. You can do top-notch journalism and be poorly thought of. You can do pretty lousy journalism and be deemed a superstar. We all know in corporate American how much office politics and being a player plays a role, but it's a crying shame how important it is there.
 
5. Lousy hours. That's part of the news business that can't be changed. But given that it is, management could do more for the people who don't work 9-5, Monday-Friday. If you're not seen in meetings, it's like you aren't there and didn't do anything. I was surprised how neglected the evening and overnight workers were given that it's a 24/7/365 place."

The manager can take your name off the rota and effectively leave you fired - but because you are on zero hours contract there is nothing you can do about it. 

When you start as a production assistant (standard entry level job after completing an internship) they throw you into the job without any training , and if you are still making mistakes afrer a few days then they take you off pay and ask you to shadow another production assistant unpaid before giving it another go. 

Oh - and despite the fact production assistants compete with each other for a limited number of shifts per week, the manager insists that new production assistants are trained by existing ones, in effect asking them to train their competition. Absolute genius!

I still remember when the managing director of CNN flew in on a private jet from New York (approx $20,000) to announce redundancies - in a year when CNN netted $600 million in profit! 

The place is run on greed and is a disgrace.

I entered a previous review titled, ""Fantastic and Lousy,"" and I'm afraid I must starkly revise it based on what has been happening to former colleagues and the network's alarming metamorphosis oozing from my computer and television.  Those pros in the previous review have nearly entirely faded, and the new CNN is tumbledown. Soon the name will no longer be an asset on a CV but instead a sticky smudge you will have to explain away to future employers as they kerchief it from their fingers. Alas, the grande dame has become a madame. Think of how you would appear in the glaring daylight someday as you skulk out of her door?","The parent company, TimeWarner, is swinging the wrecking ball at the fourth estate while it cherry-picks profits out of the rubble of responsibility and moral conscience. CNN's newsrooms have fun house floors, especially if you're in the U.S. Sure, the benefits and vacation will be great, but then a trap door will open, you'll whisk down a chute, and they'll be snapped from your grasp as you sail to the pavement.
Yes, yes, the corporate world, but really the way to run a news institution? When profits are high? When you have the power and finances to turn it into a beacon of journalistic hope for your nation, and others? Go to CNN, and your colleagues there will be unforgetable and the vast majority lovely. But management will promote their own, less deserving friends ahead of them and dismiss good, hard working people. The inanimate gaze of the chopping block in the room will taint your days with angst. And then there's Trump. The American monster CNN midwifed. Much of the U.S. media have prostituted themselves to King Bigot for clicks and ratings, but CNN has held court the most, and helped him gel a fascist movement in the United States that will delight the world for years to come.

They often give lip service to those who are looking to move up or make changes in the organization and consistently do nothing to improve the newsroom 

HR (like at most companies) exists to protect the company and management and when an employee brings up harassment, or points out an abusive manager, that employee is usually the one who is punished rather than the manager.

Biggest mistake of my life!  (No exaggeration.)  When Time-Warner slashed the budget in 2014, many of the senior managers were axed and replaced with newbies, who didn't have a clue about the day-to-day operations of the departments.  The result has, in many cases, been a shamefully disorganized approach to hiring new people.  After I started the job, I was forced into a role that had little to do with editing, and LESS to do with producing.  My discussions with management about this were a complete waste of time, as they were totally inflexible.  As a result, the talents for which I believed I was being hired went completely un-utilized and I was miserable.  I left after a 8 months and never looked back.

And holding a meeting or networking at the Starbucks in the food court is the norm.","Well, take everything I said above with a grain of salt, because that's under the old management. There always were layoffs when I was there, and reorganizations, and one day your best buddy was there and then he was out. When I was let go, and someone in another dept. heard about it they took me to lunch, that's how nice folks are there. But it happens without warning, and to a lot of folks at once, and sometimes it makes no sense. The other drawbacks - its a 24/7 news operation, so who knows when you'll be working.

Turner is a southern company, built on the good ol boy system and promotes their friends. If you hang out with leadership on your team, you will be promoted. If you do not, you will not. Work performance does not factor into your promotion. Friendship weighs heavier and clouds judgement of managers. They like to have their ego stroked and butts kissed. Working hard at your desk will get you no where. You have to be super energetic and enthusiastic about your work and broadcast that. This is seen as passionate. Even if you are not that type of personality you must become it to thrive here. Bad ideas will be considered if there is ""passion"" around them over great ideas.

Also, everything is very ""siloed"" so each group has no idea what the other group is working on. Shows compete against each other for guests or pieces.

I came in near the beginning of the network, and rose thru the ranks .  I was proud of CNN and Turner Broadcasting's rise to to peak of the industry.  Great employees, generally  good to very good immediate supervisors and managers that have risen thru the ranks and are managing areas in which they once worked as staffers.   The benefits package are among the best in the business.  My CNN 401k match made me VERY  well situated for retirement early in life.  the company match is phenomenal.","CNN is struggling to re-invent itself, again.   The current president has boldly stated ""CNN Needs less news, and more shows.""  for those of us who still believe Ted Turner had it right from the start with ""News is the star"" are appalled  at some of the steps CNN is taking to try to regain Ratings Success over Journalistic Integrity.   The lip service  given to ""Life/Work Balance"" became a joke.  The company talks a good game, but the reality is something else.   That said, most CNNers have a passion for the work and relish the thrill of live news and the long hours in the short term, when needed.  That hard work and long hours is often left unappreciated by senior leadership.  Over the past couple years CNN has done a series of ""re-orgs"" of Depts.   This too often seemed to see the most senior, experienced, and well-compensated staff...pushed out.  We call it the 20, 50, 100 club.  (20 yrs, over 50, making more than 100k).  Morale is low now,  staff anxiety high, due to many factors including layoffs, and disappointing ratings."

Was immediately prevented from implementing anything but the most basic entity possible, felt like trying to code an app from about 6-8 years ago. Was nearly last in line for making any architectural decisions and was actually laughed at for ideas which would have worked very cleanly with little maintenance.

I cannot emphasize this strongly enough - if you choose work for CNN as a developer, DO NOT SPEAK UP. Do not try to do things in a more modern way or try to train people. You will be branded a troublemaker regardless of whether you are right or not. Regardless of whether you are trying to make a thing work well or not. It does not matter to them. Even if the product group you work with is fundamentally unhappy with what is being produced, it is still frowned upon for you to speak up. You will be blacklisted.

All that matters in the end is checking off the right checkboxes at the right times so the project looks good on paper. Health of the app itself is not a concern. The director I was working under is now actively blocking me from other employment at Turner or CNN. Need I say more?"

When I was hired at CNN it took 2 weeks to get an email address and 2.5 months before I got my first paycheck. HR and payroll didn't seem to be phased by it and didn't care that I couldn't pay my rent.  The company truly does not care about an employees life outside of work."

There are also a few programs for discounts on travel, products, services.","I think working here is like any other corporate environment... sure, there are opportunities to advance, and putting in hard work along with a little self promotion will help move you along. However, there are some folks in management, mid-management who seem to value the big talkers over people who can actually do great work. It doesn't happen all the time, but I've seen enough talented people get pushed aside because they are either not a part of the ""in"" crowd, or simply grow frustrated of the fraternity of ""oh, I know you from"" and ""you worked at one of the big three nets, you must be smart"" type folks. It can be discouraging... but at the same time, managers seem to be cycled in and out every 3/4 years, so if you stick around long enough, maybe you'll get lucky and move ahead."

They work closely with HR (another nightmare) so you're basically stuck with no advocate if your boss behaves badly."

Just be aware of that going in to Turner. Make sure you never mention anyone's incompetencies or errors because you become the trouble maker. The in-crowd can make huge errors.... errors that wind up in trade media and ridiculed on line. A less popular person, but more capable person can make a minor mistake, like misspelling a name, and get written up.

No internal address of elephant in room of future of journalism.  Undervalued conception of research as disposable process in news environment. Strange/strained/antagonistic relations between dependent departments and units. Virtually no career development (window dressing of yes, but no actual movement occurs), no mentoring, no reflection on professional standards (for this role) outside the CNN bubble. Frequent turnover, some are able to re-fit, but how and why is completely unspoken. Opaque HR processes. General hypocrisy of ""we're there for you, you have these great benefits, come out to a softball game"" but you're basically just a number. When making waves to get things done, unless you have big guns behind you, the process of change is more stressful and in this way is tacitly discouraged. Departments not interested in cultivating quality, but getting something done as quickly as possible, mistakes and all. Granted, it's a news environment, but still....Bad ratings, disgruntled employees, and general confusion about future of journalism, and ""TV Everywhere"" lead to scattered, rather than inspiring and constructive internal culture."
