35,Cabify,Used to be fantastic. Going downhill since mid '18,2019-04-16,2.0,Operations Associate,"- Fast-paced environment;
- Ownership and freedom;
- The original value proposition of the service could actually put the company on the forefront of MaaS apps.","- The company is disinvesting in key areas, including HR;
- Several markets are going down in terms of results for lack of strategy and amateur leadership;
- Many people are leaving due to chaotic workloads, outdated processes, slow pace in change-making;
- Major strategic mistakes and lack of leadership;
- There isn't a long-term strategy to compete in a crowded market and thus the brand is decaying;

No carreer growth unless you are personal friend from top management. Head and top management positions filled in by useless people because of that. Feels like you are in high school due to this political war. They reestructured and everything they have gained is that employees have lost their exitement and willingness to work there.

39,Cabify,The job that gave me patience,2019-02-07,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"It teaches you how to be patient. It teaches you how to deal with incompetent people. Your work impacts the real world, the company is big and you can learn a lot. There are very interesting people, especially in Product.","The company has grown very fast and it has caused many gaps that have been filled with hurry and without attention; every internal process is outdated, which is very surprising and frustrating, since you're there to work in a startup environment; and there is a lot of bureaucracy that results in even more frustration for the employees. 

There are many management positions occupied by 'friends of' who are obviously incompetent but the system they have created makes it impossible to point them out. They are all friends with each other and defend each other when necessary. They have created a pyramid of people who do not know how to do their job but who can't be fired, it looks like a big joke. It reminds me of 'House of Cards'."
