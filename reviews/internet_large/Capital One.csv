1,Capital One,"People are good, performance culture and work are poor",2022-04-09,2.0,Design Strategist and Researcher,The people at Capital One are great.,"The perforamce stucture relies heavily on manager favourtism and popularity. This can be hard for people who are favoured and those who are not. A lot of emphasis is put on presenting work publically to be 'seen' and feels like a zero sum game, you have to compete with the people you work with to 'own' the work.

The work is also limited in scope. The only product is credit cards, and after a couple of years this can get very tiresome."

Making changes feels like moving mountains and while we profess to have many moving independent parts, we quickly find that one wheel cannot turn without the explicit written consent of other wheels which feel affected by the turning of the other wheel.

52,Capital One,Head in Sand,2022-04-02,3.0,Attorney,The overall culture is positive,"There are too many roadblocks to advancement and little transparency. If you are good at your job and keep your business happy, you could probably stay there forever but never advance beyond Director. At some point they just made it next to impossible (unless you are one of the anointed) to progress beyond that level.

62,Capital One,Exodus of tech talent doesn't faze management,2022-03-31,3.0,Software Engineer,"- company can still get things done when upper management deems it necessary and throws people together to make it happen. When the pandemic started, there were lots of such initiatives to make it easier for customers and employees.
- good work/life balance
- great 401k match and benefits
- great place to learn about AWS tech
- company really values customer feedback and tries to do right by them","- RSUs are only for master software engineers and above. CEO likes to include C1 in the ranks of netflix, amazon and other companies that have crossed the digital canyon. But compensation structure is nowhere near them.

- extremely tough to get promoted unless you are willing to spend 50% of your time in networking with other teams and know all the right people. The bar for promotion keeps raising every cycle even though the managers promise that you are next in line.

- recruiters constantly try to down-level qualified candidates and convince them that they should be promoted within six months, which sadly never happens. 

- the CTO launched the TDP program to get new college grads into C1 and give them the best training among employee groups. TDPs get the plum assignments and get promoted faster than people who came through regular channels. But TDPs use the time to brush up on leetCode skills and move on to bigger tech companies. As a way to stop such churn, CTO seems to have asked managers to promote them even faster :eyeroll:

- new people managers leave within 6-10 months since they get sick of the games that they have to play to get their employees promoted. Old-timers can play the cross-calibration games that are used to stack-rank employees better than newbies.

- even though lots of companies have abandoned stack-ranking, C1 seems intent on making it work. Out of 74 possible candidates for a job category in the last cycle, only 4 got promoted, supposedly due to stack ranking. This leads to a lot of good engineers leaving for better pay. If you are interviewing for a position, ask the recruiter for the list of people promoted in the last cycle. The shortness of the list should help you decide if you want to play the game. 

- every team has 30-40% contractors and their talent level has dropped considerably during the pandemic. Full-time engineers spend a lot of time coaching these contractors in addition to their regular work. Managers seem to be not willing to remediate the situation, since its tough to get any contractors in the first place."

You aren't in danger going to at work location by someone else, who has low awareness to social distance. Diversity and inclusion are important. They preach this but words alone aren't enough. They have given great effort, but words are cheap. To really be inclusive, it must be visual. I have not seen higher ranking employees diversify.",COAF sold me on the ability to migrate into any industry CO is in. I found it quite difficult to break into roles I was eyeing for years. Promoting up on a pace that you see for your own career I view as a con. As well as diversity as a con. This company isn't as diverse as it claims. That hasn't changed much over my tenure either.

Good WLB.,"It is a bank - meaning that c1 does NOT have a good tech culture that they are bragging about.  If you decide to join, you might want to be mindful of selecting a good group. Talk to your future coworkers before you join. It will help. 

For me, it had been the worst experience in my career so far. I happened to experience organizational changes few months later after I joined. I can write a book to rant about my experience with C1 but I would like my review to be served as an informational guide for people who are considering to accept an offer:

1)  The work is easy. The majority of the time I spent here is at meetings listening other people to argue about some nonsense and work that the manager tries to put the team through in order to make us look busy. 

2) There are some chance that you can fall under a horrible manager.  It depends on how “lucky” you are because reorg happens often. Btw, the definition of an “incompetent leader” to me: full of ego, hollow in knowledge, insecure, micromanaging, bossy, couldn’t care less about emoloyee’s wellbeing. It was my first time encountering toxic people in my life, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. 

3) Stack ranking at a bank? As many of the other reviews have mentioned, your performance is evaluated against people at the same level as you. If you get a manager who is willing to advocate for you, then you are the lucky one. Although it is not guaranteed that you will get a “above strong” rating, your life will still be easier.  If you happen to get a bad manager who only cares about the time you put into nonsense work because they don’t know much about tech, you will be as miserable as me :). Choose wisely."

At the lower levels, People managers can be dismissive of BIPOC issues and while they will listen to you complain about being bullied, they will also use corporate speak to say it’s your own fault. This happened to me twice, with one of the times making it into my performance review as something I should improve. I was so mad about this, but luckily changing teams is not too hard to do! The flexibility in changing teams and moving to a nicer team are why I stayed. I will say also that it’s almost impossible to give reviews about your own people manager anonymously so my old people manager is sadly still there."

Families are the norm and are very well supported with decent leave policies and flexible work arrangements. They are in no rush to return to the office, and leaders as well as associates extol the benefits of working from home. Compensation is quite high for certain job families (ie. software engineering), but uneven for other groups.","Meeting culture can be paralyzing due to personnel bloat at the bank. Leadership and steering meetings often involve 30+ people, which makes it difficult to generate decision or have meaningful conversation. 

Performance culture forcing PIP quotas breeds a climate where bootlickers are rewarded and independent thinkers are punished. In the end, calibration boils down to a popularity contest where people who are well liked by leadership get promoted and those who challenge leadership are voted into weak performance and managed out.

You will find that there are two classes of employees at Capital One, lifelong veterans who have been with the bank for 20 or more years, have never worked anywhere else and are -deeply- invested in the way things are, and folks who've been around for 2 or 3 years deciding if it's worthwhile to stick it out. The former class are entrenched and know how to use the performance management system to reward each other and cement power. The second class are prey and fodder for the veterans."

Now a Hybrid organisation but wanting to mandate 3 days in the office to get the culture back to 'how it was' pre-pandemic."

-Good on-site amenities before COVID

People are dismissed after lunch on Fridays heading into 3-day weekends","-Every employee is stack-ranked, with ~5-10% of people getting punished with half bonuses, half raises, and being put on a PIP (fast track to being let go) each year. HR glides over all this when you join, but the fear of this by itself changes a lot of behaviors and internal politics. For example, everyone is obsessed with working on projects that look good when reported to higher-ups, sometimes at the cost of doing what they think really should be done. Perception is everything at Capital One, even if it is not the only place like this in the job market
-Only two weeks’ vacation when you join (and it gets prorated)
-No stock grants in most cases unless you’re a director+, very unusual for a self-proclaimed tech company
-The salaries look high at each title, but there’s down-leveling and title deflation, so set your expectations conservatively. At an IC level, you are told you could get promoted at any time to encourage you to work harder for free (they will not remind you there’s a cap on promotions each cycle until you don’t get the promotion)
-No more Excel, everyone uses Google Sheets now
-Personal email is blocked on work computers, and you’ll be doing two-factor authentication at least half a dozen times a day
-Contractors and fresh college grads constantly joining and leaving teams, requiring a lot of training, explaining, and finding replacements. These less efficient newbies are often paid close to what much more experienced/FT hires make
-A culture of forced optimism (even printed on shirts and mugs) where instead of saying there’s a problem or a weakness, everyone says you have an “opportunity” 😀
-Pay is not competitive in NY or SF
-Constant mandatory training courses (the acronym is CBT, and the joke writes itself if you look it up) and reminders from your VP that your department looks bad if anyone is late completing the courses
-Extremely hierarchical culture — be prepared to be discouraged from initiating a 1:1 meeting with anyone more than a bit higher than you in title/scope 
-You cannot work remotely from anywhere outside the US even during COVID (most places will only ban a few countries) 
-Before COVID working from home was heavily discouraged though office crowding was an issue"

The company does well and if you do your work right, there is job security
You can have a good work/life balance if you navigate and find the right team
Pleasant people at the associate and manager level
If you are in one of the hubs like Clarendon/Richmond there are a lot of onsite perks. Lots of meals and food.","Being a minority here will be a challenging experience. The company has a performance management system that really favors how friendly you are with your manager. Usually this benefits buddy-buddy relationships. I've seen managers and higher-ups favor their online gaming friends, intentionally punish/target a team with a minoritized racial identity. You can read the comments in other posts, there are a lot of jabs at non-white members within the company, people complaining about the company focusing on hiring or promoting women. The senior leadership is pretty racially and gender homogenous and if trickle down was ever a real, its how this company works.

As a PM, your experience will be a lot of meetings and managing up. Which may not be unique to the role at any place. In my experience, I found that due to the need to impress people with decks or ""influence"" over working product or code, people invite everyone senior to meetings to voice their opinion. It's a very hierarchical company, so before any decision gets made you will be talking to every co product owner and their boss and bosses boss and boss on boss to make any type of decision. This all means you likely won't get much done.

There's a lot of politics at Capital One. A Lot. So be prepared to undertake in all these games. It's a bit toxic really and probably the worst part of the job.

I don't think you will gain much technical product experience. Capital One is a very product risk averse company. There really isn't a culture of testing and learning you may get at other software companies. You will hopefully get a very specific idea/product the company wants to build. Pray that the company fully invests in it, and if you are lucky within two or three years it may come to life. Within that time you will likely get reorg-ed and your project may go dead. You won't easily get access to the data of products or even company market research/strategy.

Another tension at Capital One is balancing your personal sanity with the desire to perform the Capital One Way. To maintain sanity, you will want to avoid as many meetings, interactions with senior leadership that don't go anywhere, and find a core team that you are highly efficient with. Unfortunately, the stacked ranking system benefits you interacting with lots of managers, showboating that you are influential across multiple organizations or teams, and networking. This will likely stretch you thin and just be present to too many ineffective meetings and obnoxious politics or power dynamics within the company. You will start to think about these relationships and dynamics all the time. Your life will blend into Capital One. At some point, you will probably need a therapist to remind you that all these stressors are only at the office. However, you will fill a strong need/desire to be in with the ""in-crowds"" at Capital One. 

My advice is if you take a junior/principal role here, find a product in later life cycle/in market one that's critical to the company, learn the basics of managing a product in market, working with an engineering team and design group then peace out. There's not much here for building/launching/improving. It's NOT a technology company despite whatever HR /company site tells you."

572,Capital One,Experienced Hires Beware,2022-01-17,2.0,Business Director,"- Large corporate option in the DC area with strong brand 
- Typically good work-life balance relative to pay
- Great benefits package for healthcare, parental benefits, etc. 
- Attractive Tysons campus, especially with new additions of Wegmans, Capital One Hall, etc.
- Generally nice and hardworking colleagues","- For the Business Analysis job family, it's extremely difficult for experienced hires at any level to be successful and especially to get promoted. That's based on hundreds of associate observations in talent conversations across multiple years and lines of business. Powerful transferrable skills and extremely hardwork are no substitute for leaders actually seeing an individual do the work since they were 22 years old. (Analyst Development Program is the preferred entry point.) 
- Re-organizations multiple times per year, which can be demoralizing and frustrating for everyone involved. 
- Organizational politics especially at the Director plus levels. I spent a significant amount of time trying to understand what leaders wanted and working to influence them (and still wasn't successful)."

- Managers promoted to their own level of *incompetence*
- Everyone out for themselves
- Managers take credit for what their team delivers
- You only get a good review if someone else gets a bad one (bell curve)
- Managers are limited to how many top performance or promotions they can put forward; so, others get left behind (even if they're doing a good job)
- Incompetent managers are never fired -- only their victims that work for them
- Improper conduct (harassment) by management only results in a slap on the wrist

However, growing in the company can take years and if you are not networking that can be a problem as well. I feel as if you have to know the right people in order to grow since the company is so large.

Culture of people that I was surrounded by was always positive and uplifting
C1 takes the time to empower you to make decisions and present ideas","Yearly reviews, based on performance, is lacking. It really leaves a lot to be desired. 

As someone who was rated Strong/Very Strong, year over year, it became frustrating that I was not seeing promotions. Especially after I learned that the only reason I was being held back, was because HR didn't see the value in the team and it would raise too many questions if there were to be a promotion. This was after being told that I had been ready for the next step/promotion for a long time. There's too much to write to truly explain to this story, but that is main idea behind it all. It's unfortunate, but sometimes, we recognize bad decisions and move forward with life.

Oh, and last thing, I wish that you had more of a voice when presenting these issues, but the reality is- the company is so large that it is hard to get your voice heard on an issue like this particular one. It's unfortunate, really, but overall a fantastic place to work. 

Chances are, most people will not experience this same type of event. This was strictly within the organization that I worked within, and they are not actively hiring Visual Artists any longer."

685,Capital One,Great Place to Work,2022-01-02,4.0,Business Manager,"1. Awesome culture:
Peoples are genuinely very smart, friendly, and outgoing. Management respects work-life balance and is very respectful of employee's personal lives. Although some people chose to work past five, there is definitely no pressure to do so (unless there is a pressing deadline).

2. Investment in people:
I've also found that managers at Capital One are incentivized to highlight the achievements of their team members instead of promoting themselves. Even at the most junior levels, analysts will almost always present their own work unless it is to someone at or close to the C-Suite level. Managers also invest a fair amount in developing their employees, and it is typical to have regular 'development meetings' with your manager and your manager's manager to ensure that you are learning and that you are staffed on projects that are meeting your goals.

3. Internal Mobility (Vertically and Horizontally):
At the lower levels (Analyst - Sr. Manager), people can typically expect to get promoted every 1-2 years (in larger parts of the business). There is also a culture of people switching teams, and it is not uncommon for people to take new roles in completely new parts of the company with very little friction.

4. Great Internal Resources (see cons as well)
Capital One has a great set of internal tools and resources to help people manage the day to day functions of their jobs (managing data, doing analysis etc). This is especially in the larger parts of the company. As a result, people here spend very little time doing 'grunt work' and are instead dedicated to very substantive projects. As a new employee, I was quickly able to build a robust profile of work, and genuinely feel that I have developed a strong cross-functional skillset (data analysis, presenting, project management etc).","1. Lack of input in the rotation process (for campus hires)
Many business analysts joining out of college will be put in C1s rotational program (the ADP program), where you are assigned one role for your first year and then join a new team for your second role. The first rotation essentially random, while analysts get a larger degree of input into their second role (although the final decision is made by the program). Many people like this because it lets them work in diverse parts of the company, but inevitably a number of people will be placed into roles they are very unhappy with.

2. Frequent Organizational Shifts
As Sr. Executives come and go, they will restructure their subordinate teams. As a result, entire teams, and also individual analysts, are often move into new chains of command and may have to pick up an entirely new body of work. This happens quite often and with very little notice (maybe once per year).

3. Differing experiences across lines of business
In my experience, the largest parts of the company (Mainstreet and Upmarket) tend to have higher levels of technical support and better promotion rates than other parts of the company. The higher level of technical support often means that these LOBs have staff dedicated to making your job easier by automating repetitive tasks, ensuring data is easily available, and by building tools to simplify your work. In smaller LOBs, analysts will often have to do this work on their own, limiting the amount of time you can spend on important projects."
686,Capital One,This use to be a great company. Everyone is leaving,2022-01-02,2.0,Senior Credit Specialist,Great vacation time & Benefits,"No work home life balance, no real procedure & guidance . They hire executive level people who change the whole structure and lay off huge departments, to send those jobs offshore. Then in 2 years they leave and the next bad idea comes along and leaves those that remain doing the work of 3 or 4 job roles with no bump in pay. Almost no diversity the higher up you go."

Flexible team schedule 
Descent perks","Rampant favouritism 
As someone who has personally played a part in the company’s leadership team I was blown away with the rampant favouritism and clan mentality that is deep rooted within this company. There are literally 6/7 families that control the leadership (cause both husband and wife are in leadership positions). And it all starts at the top and then trickles down into every level. First you have to be white, then in their in group, then be their favourite and then if you can present yourself well and if all the stars align there is scope for you to move up in this company. If you are person of minority or a hard worker you are doomed.

Re-orgs and promotions are rigged
Every re-Org in this company is a chance for people at the top to give positions of power to their faithful. Also you can literally predict who will get promoted by looking at the org structure. It has got nothing to do with skill or work it’s all based on groupism. 30-35 year old people (husband and wife) are Directors and Senior directors and run this company like a Sorority. The sad part it everyone knows and plays a part in this toxic world. You can work hard and move mountains and your promo will be delayed caused you sneezed in a meeting and did not say excuse me while people who did nothing continue to move up and will eventually become your boss.

US vs Canada madness
The company is a sister concern of their US parent and everything they do comes from the US. The last this this company did which was of any use was building a guranteed product for sub-prime customers and now they milk it for decades. All the folks at the top do is the same 5-6 campaigns and high five each other. The US parent however is actually very very good but Canada leadership has massively lost its way. The only time I felt motivated was listening to Rich Fairbanks and then a month later I realized how different the ground reality in Canada is to his vision.

No tech innovation 
While the US parent has done a ton of innovation in product and tech in Canada it is a mockery of Tech innovation. The company claims to operate like a nimble tech company which happens to be a bank but they are exactly the opposite. Nothing is done in name of innovation and lip service keeps you in the job.
Nothing you do here adds to the resume other than the company name.

Leadership is self obsessed
This is the weirdest thing I have seen in a company and I have been in a lot of them in my career. People who are frankly kids love to talk about themselves that try to be comically vulnerable and personal with employees and because it is far from genuine people literally laugh at them in the background. They try to copy the US leadership which backs emotions by work but in Canada all you have to do is talk. Pretty funny actually to watch!"

- absolutely NO GROWTH when i worked here. You are a branch ambassador. Thats it. Theres branch ambassador and then theres market manager. I was there over 2 years and heard of one true promotion - everything else were lateral changes (sorry, branch ambassador to call center is not a promotion)
- the work they had us do during development (for reviews and such) were childish.
- you are not seen as capable adults. You will be micromanaged
- branches closing left and right, adds to angry customers and will leave you not feeling secure about your job
- they are cheap and slow with giving security guards, even when the entire branch feels its needed. They are cheap.

779,Capital One,"Incremental change, not all good",2021-12-10,3.0,Senior Risk Coordinator,"Working for Capital One was something I aspired to, and it took several years to finally get hired. This was not an unusual story, especially because it is one of the largest and most well-known employers in the area. I worked at a now-defunct call center outside of Richmond, and there was a clear ""have and have-nots"" delineation between those who worked at West Creek and those who worked at my location. The site was often looked down on, or completely unknown, to the people at West Creek making five times our salary, but we were collecting the money that allowed them to have fancy perks like bicycles to ride between buildings and a butterfly garden. I can't speak to the experience at the Glen Allen locations, but it seemed that folks could much more easily move from working there to West Creek than from our site. I don't know if the site going permanently remote has impacted the career opportunities for those employees, but when I worked there you still had to be within a 100 mile radius of the site you worked from, meaning you couldn't apply for remote roles in other states. 

The people I worked with were amazing and getting to know them was the best part of my job. Management supported career growth for their team members, and we were given lots of opportunities for professional development (pre-pandemic.) Having access to support groups for many different types of identities was a unifying experience that made the widely dispersed company feel a bit more familiar. I was able to gain experience in many different areas that boosted my personal and professional growth. However, I do believe that privilege plays a big part in that, as many of the other folks I worked with were passed up for opportunities time and time again. 

Benefits were good, with affordable healthcare options, 401k (regardless of if you contribute), parental leave, short- and long-term disability, EAP, tuition reimbursement, and occasional perks like gift cards and swag. The managers of the front line workers really care about their employees and do the best they can with the resources they have. We often had potlucks, parties, and events on site, which made work very fun and enjoyable. I didn't know everyone I worked with, but they all felt like friends. Unfortunately, this experience didn't translate to work from home, although many other sites had been remote long before and therefore had the infrastructure in place to support employees in that way virtually. 

Finally, learning about credit and financial well-being was one of the most valuable things I gained from my experience. I have been able to help my family and friends build their credit and feel more secure in their finances from what I learned during my time at the company. There are lots of resources available to learn and even help your community. Volunteer time is allotted each quarter, and the company matches your volunteered hours with donations. Most of the employees truly care about others, which makes for a very welcoming, friendly environment.","Once the pandemic hit, my role began to shift drastically. We went from an ""empathy-based"" approach to ""results-based."" It completely ruined morale, and that was before the layoffs and department closures began. People were desperately trying to leave the department and company due to the massive shift in business objectives. It became very difficult to get promoted, which was one of the biggest perks before 2020. The future went from looking bright to very, very bleak. At times, half of my department was on leave for mental health (which is understandable during a pandemic), but this trend began well before then. With everyone struggling to make it through the day and burning PTO to take care of themselves, more and more pressure was put on those who were still working. Metrics became stricter, performance reviews were graded more harshly, and everyone at the bottom of the food chain felt the pressure bearing down from the top. Needless to say, it became a pressure cooker, and most folks couldn't take it. 

Unfortunately, a lot of my coworkers (including myself) were going through very tough times during the pandemic, and our jobs involved talking to customers who were going through the same things. It was like living in a never-ending hellscape of sad stories. There was no relief, and we were often told to just ""focus on the positive."" Pretty hard to do when you are literally cold-calling people who are in the hospital with covid, fighting for their life, and telling them they need to make their minimum payment on their credit card or they will be charged more fees. We had some hardship programs to offer customers at first, but there was a cap, which enraged many people who would then take it out on the phone agents. I don't know what the department is like now, but I hope things have changed for the better. 

Culturally, the company has lots of grand ideals about how it is changing banking for good. However, during the pandemic, I saw a complete loss of humanity in this regard. The biggest indicator of this was the cafe employees who were pretty much hung out to dry. Pay equity is something that is not discussed on any level, and when some employees tried to ask for an objective review of their team's pay and raises, the company essentially told them they should be grateful for what they are making. Complete lack of transparency from upper management and age-old tactics to keep workers submissive and hopeless bred massive distrust and disdain for a company that workers previously evangelized. 

Many employees were often put into stretch roles or internships, which builds great experience, but is essentially the company saving money on labor by having someone do the role without receiving the pay. There should be a bonus or differential for employees that temporarily are working more senior roles. Getting one of these internships or stretch roles was often the only way to move up, and you usually had to be hand-selected rather than apply. If you weren't a golden child or friends with management, good luck trying to get a new role. I was considered both at one time and still couldn't get hired in any other department once the hiring freeze was lifted. 

This can be a great starter job or a long-lasting career. It is all circumstantial, and each department and line of business is very different. Do your research, ask lots of questions during the interview process, and make sure that you are confident of what the expectations are for your role and if it will change over time. Take advantage of all the resources the company has to offer and learn as much as you can. 

My experiences are all subjective, and many of my former coworkers are still very happy and love their job. I would take any review you read on this site with several grains of salt because there is no guarantee that your experience would be any better or worse. If you are considering applying here, I highly recommend finding someone who can give you the inside scoop, and hopefully a referral."

They are not close enough to the ground truth to focus on solving the real problems. For a company that wants to be ""all in"" on AWS, the cloud controls are ridiculously opaque and Kafka-esque.

Decent pay
Work-life balance overall for the company is very good compared to other companies (notice how I said for the company, not for this particular position in terms of the everyday workload. The one positive is there is no on-call for this position, and once you complete your 8 hours you can forget about work for the rest of the day)","Since the pandemic stated in 2020, call queues have been a complete disaster. Most days it takes hours for users to get a hold of an IT Service Desk agent. I'm talking 100-200+ calls in the queue, with no end in sight for the agents who handle this for 8 hours every day. Between each call, there are only 45 seconds before another call comes in, which quickly leads to mental exhaustion after talking for 8 hours straight. This has been an issue for pretty much 2 years now!....2 years! To have it happen for a couple of months, fine, but any longer than that and you really can see where this item is on upper managements priority list/recognition of the dire reality of the situation. I understand it's a tough issue that's multi-facted, but 2 years is completely unacceptable in terms of the mental effects it has had on current employees.

Pay increases every 6 month period are usually a miniscule 1.5-3%, which as everyone knows, does not keep up with inflation (especially the 6% inflation in 2021). You can most likely get paid more by working for a fully-remote friendly company based in another high COL state, especially for a role such as this one that should already be fully-remote since it's completely over the phone. 

Morale is at an all-time low with most team members I speak with, people are just burned out and dread going to work in the morning, which is quite sad. Life is too short to be feeling this way, and to see it at a company like Capital One is very disappointing.

My biggest gripe is by far the lack of growth opportunities here in this particular position. Now, I want to preface this by saying yes some users have moved out of this position into other departments. For the overwhelming majority of agents however, this has not been the case. The users who did move into other positions usually had a lucky break with knowing the right person at the right time, or having experience that was gained outside of Capital One and thus could make them a stronger candidate. For those whos first IT experience was here however, even with earning certifications, it's very hard to move out of this department into other IT positions within the company. Part of the reason for this is that Capital One has a job hierarchy that restricts users from applying for other job positions unless you are currently at a certain job level. For instance, if you are Sr. Coordinator (which is what this role starts at), you cannot be considered for a role that's 2 levels above your current level due to HR policy. The company recently made it so you could apply for 1 job level above your current level, which is an improvement in terms of upward mobility for people. However, the kicker is most tech roles within the company start at Senior Associate or above, which compared to the Sr. Coordinator level, is 3 levels above that. The levels break down like this:

Sr. Coodinator
Prin. Coordinator
Associate
Senior Associate

So with this hierarchical system in place, you are destined to be in the IT Service Desk position for a long time, which I believe is by design to keep people in the position. Promotions can take anywhere from 1-3 years, and there's no guarantee when it's going to happen for you as it takes longer with each promotion. Upon getting a promotion, you do not learn any additional skills that you didn't already know at your previous level for the most part. The job responsibilities stay the same, and thus so do your skills and employability for other positions within and outside the company. 

Generally, industry-wide it's often recommended to stay in Helpdesk/Service Desk no longer than a year or two so you can specialize in other areas (unless you really enjoy it). The other areas are things like System Administration, Cloud/Networking, Security, Data, etc. The problem is, you do not gain the necessary skills within this position to move into those particular areas within the company, and are left to get certifications or outside education to fill this gap. This isn't an issue unique to Capital One, but the problem is a lot of internal company positions will want at least a year or two of experience with the technologies themselves in an actual job position. Not having this experience, but having certifications and outside education will look good, and may even provide an opportunity for a lucky break as I mentioned some people above had, but overall when applying for other positions you will get denied for not having the direct job experience a lot of times. Outside the company, your predicament is just as bad as even if you do have certs/education, the position itself does not give you access to skills that can get you more than another help-desk job unless you get lucky with a company willing to view your certs/homelab as experience. You don't get your hands on managing users/groups in Active Directory, group policy configuration, Windows Server, automation/scripting, AWS/Azure, or SQL. When you look outside the company, you'll see and realize how a lot of even other Help Desk positions within large companies require these skills."

-Pressure to meet goals can be extremely overwhelming
-Meeting-heavy
-Processes are continually changing and you are expected to work with your head on a swivel
-Work/life balance is heavily flawed 

You are expected to be in a minimum of 5 stores/day. without exception. Territory makeup is smaller, so that's great for those needed a change from heavy travel jobs, but this really makes no difference since you'll be in the field 5 days a week, 8 hours a day. Do not take this role if you are afraid of a rapid pace work environment. Also, dealers in the F/I world are a whole different beast."

2. Anyone and everyone will tell “it’s so hard to get promoted.” It’s VERY political and if you are promoted your increase is 2-3% merit.

They emphasize addressing unconscious bias in decision making and open leader / subordinate relationships in a culture of advancement. They target paying higher than the regional median for tech talent, and are aware of the current tight labor market and have made appropriate adjustments for that. 401k matching is competitive. They're health insurance plan is self-funded, which works well for the associates because they have a pretty large risk pool that skews healthier and younger, which keeps premiums pretty low for very competitive coverage.","Large tech stack with a fair amount of duplication means it takes too long to build and deliver new systems. Internal documentation is often difficult to find, and is sometimes out of date.

- The campus in Northern Virginia is shaping up to be an incredible one after all the construction, but traffic is going to be a massive headache

- Most of the perks you could possibly want, including paid leave for both parents (much less for fathers than for mothers), 401K match, and wellness reimbursements","- Work delivery is slow, with some projects taking a year or dragging on for months before getting killed, so your rating / promotion can get political, with how you're perceived being more important than what you actually deliver

- Company has a mission of doing right by its customers that it preaches regularly, but it's hard to see how Capital One has differentiated itself from major competitors in that regard

- You're largely on your own in terms of development and career progression and your mileage varies significantly by your direct manager. There are a lot of great people leaders at Capital One, but there's a constant shuffle, and you need to manage this process proactively

Everyone is collaborating with the customers' best interests at heart. As a product manager I got to partner with designers, business analysts, data engineers, and of course my tech teams of 4-7 software engineers. 
Auto loans is organized into ""experiences,"" each focused on a different phase of the customer's journey, and product managers get a high level of autonomy to develop new features and improve processes. 
My projects were engaging. People across job families were engaged in their work, smart, collaborative, and really nice.
Also we're a good mix of a tech company and a bank: product and technology are at the focus of the company, but you still get banking holidays and log out at 5pm every day.
I was in auto loans in the Plano campus.","There is a high level of change: I had 5 managers in the last 12 months. That's higher than average, but everyone seems to change managers at least once a year if not twice; either because the manager gets moved to a different team or because you do. 
My projects tended to get changed frequently as well: partway through a project, leadership would change the objective and ask us to focus on a different goal, abruptly stopping a 6- or 12-month project halfway through without us delivering anything. That happened enough to my projects and other product managers' to become a pattern. 
This all combines to a frustrating level of change when you have really interesting projects and would love to get them out to customers. My advice would be to start coding an MVP as quickly as possible so you can at least deliver something before priorities shift."

The salary also needs to be commensurate with the operational workload required. I left in early 2017 so hopefully that aspect has improved.

Campus was nice with plenty of amenities, such as a discounted pharmacy and excellent, discounted dining areas. You can definitely find some nice people here just like any job. Hell, you might even enjoy your job if you're lucky.","If you're not lucky, you'll be working on something boring or in a tech stack that's a pain to work with. Even worse, you might get stuck with team members who make you question your own sanity. It's such a huge company that nearly the entire spectrum of experiences is possible here.

Internal politics are a big thing here. Advancement is not a question of what you do; it's who you know. You could be the hardest working developer on the team, but if you haven't been doing side of desk work or giving demos or presentations (those are *huge*), you're out of luck.

Finally, being that it's a Big Financial Company, there's a lot of regulation and bureaucracy and overhead. The amount of hoops you need to jump through just to get a static webpage available internally is mind boggling. If you're someone who sees impediments like that as a nuisance rather than a challenge, you're likely to get annoyed.

Ultimately, the pay and WLB have been great, but I've not done anything genuinely fulfilling here. On top of that, I've had to deal with some real jerks (ones who are classist and lack any self awareness, at that). The only reason I haven't quit yet is that there are hardly any other tech jobs in Richmond, let alone ones that pay as well."

Focus time is needed i.e. it take 15 mintues to prep for a meeting, 15 minutes to refocus on task afterward. A 30 minute meeting turns into an hour and having these scattered throughout the day really does hinder efficiency. During my first few weeks I caught glimpse of someones google calendar and saw it bursting with multi-coloured meeting events (sometimes overlapping 3-fold) to the extent it resembled a picasso painting."

Minimal raises if you department isn’t meeting shareholders expectations. Too much pressure on employees to problem solve for upper management. Managers try and take credit for their employees suggestions. Managers out of touch with employee work, not a lot of in department promotion, and creates a toxic environment. You can get trapped into your role with a poor end of year review. Feels like an abusive relationship, since you’re judged on attitude, and not supposed to vent about your struggles, and they expect you to always have a positive attitude. Would not suggest my department to my worst enemy."

Senior Leadership leverages ""yes"" people to carry out agendas that reward self-promotion over doing what is right for the company or the associates on the front lines. Associates who identify actual risk to the organization are routinely penalized if doing so runs contrary to senior leadership's overarching agenda. The leader of the AML organization often boasted about having ""never filed a single SAR (suspicious activity report), the fundamental work of the front line associate within his organization. Leadership fears competency and rewards compliance. Stay away from this company if you are highly-confident and comfortable challenging the status quo. One of their mantra's is ""disrupt"" - but when you actually do so, you are summarily demoted and removed."

Private healthcare scheme","VALUES - Their values of ""Excellence"" &""Do the Right Thing"" do not apply to their employees. Capital One used to be a Great Place to Work - voted the Best Place to Work several years running - this is definitely no longer the case. 

MANAGEMENT - The management overload their employees with ridiculous amount of work and deadlines, yet they seem to leave on time every night without a care. Managers are often inexperienced and of short tenure and consequently give employees unrealistic time-frames as they have little understanding of the tasks they are asking employees to do. Incompetent managers never seem to be brought to task, they just blame their team. Questionable morals  also appear to go unchallenged 


BONUS - Employees used to receive a good annual bonus which was a great incentive to work really hard to the best of your ability as you were rewarded for your efforts. Management made the decision to take this away from the lower grades yet kept an annual bonus for their own grades. This was counter productive as why should you consistently go the extra mile for very little reward. It also doesn't make employees feel valued as it made a split between management and lower levels which didn't seem to be there as much before.

CULTURE - The culture is political and toxic, its very much if your manager likes you then you will do well but if they don't you will have limited chance of progression. 

PERFORMANCE REVIEW STRUCTURE - This is brutal. Your pay rise is based on you being ranked against your peers even if you do a totally different role. This encourages a toxic and political environment which encourages the wrong behaviours and a blame culture as people climb over each other to improve their rating . It does not encourage collaboration. Good old fashioned hard work and being good at the job you are employed to do is not rewarded, your performance rating is based on the things that you do over and above your core role. If you are not given the opportunities by your manager to get involved in other things in the first place, you will never do well on the performance curve. Employees who do well are the outspoken type who make themselves heard, it's irrelevant if what they are saying makes no sense at all. The more introverted types with standards might not fair so well here"

• Even when work gets done, it's usually very basic. No boundaries are pushed and generally it's difficult to be proud of anything you build
• The processes, despite costing a lot in terms of time, are simply ineffective. The tools used to support these processes are often buggy and completely block work for days and even weeks sometimes
• Mobile engineers rarely work on mobile - their time is spent between service work in Java, infrastructure work on AWS, AMI refreshes, debugging buggy pipelines and services, creating change requests, attending community of practice meetings and team/tribe ceremonies
• Lastly, managers' responsibilities are stretched, meaning they can't enact much change. Senior managers seem to be under-stressed and generally are a hinderance rather than helping with anything
• The only people who understand mobile are the mobile engineers - most other people, from QEs and product to managers and above have no experience with mobile. This leads to lots of confusion, unnecessary questions and generally lack of clear direction"

We used to joke people stay longer just because of that even though the work might not be great. Great campuses and amenities, you have all the resources and equipment at your disposal. 

The recruiting process was by far one of the best and seamless processes I've ever been through, I was thoroughly impressed. 

Surrounded by a lot of very intelligent people with high IQ (but maybe not so much EQ). Incredibly competitive environment because everyone is super smart.","Their marketing department is not like traditional marketing - it's more Operations and Performance. If you are coming from the outside and are considering a Marketing role within Capital One, I HIGHLY recommend you search for former Capital One Marketing employees and get their perspectives, whether positive or negative. Word of mouth feedback from former employees is usually the most valuable. I'm sure you've heard reputational things already about Capital One (not saying good or bad), but the way Capital One operates/markets and their way of work is VERY unique and specific to them, and not typical of other marketing environments so make sure you talk to former employees before making a decision. 

 Not everyone fits into their culture; if you don't fit in it's identified pretty quickly (both from cultural and work standpoint). Like I said, they have a unique way of doing work that is specific to them and you're expected to do it. I was disappointed with the fact that they hire a lot of outside talent but I felt they didn't take advantage of the value they're bringing (I'm not saying this about myself, more my general observations which are unique to me). 

You're either in or you're out. Once you're out, you're really out. I had a benefits issue after leaving and have literally been ignored and ghosted entirely by their HR department despite multiple follow-up attempts and reaching out to other contacts in the org, which is unprofessional.

1440,Capital One,Tech pivot stumbles; your experience really depends on which Division you are in,2021-08-13,3.0,Software Engineering Manager,"- Salary and benefits are great (for engineers). Full-time Engineers were given a huge pay bump this year to compete with other large tech companies (time will tell if this was only due to inflation). 401k match is the best I have seen anywhere (up to 6%). Health plan is just OK.
- Company appears to be doing pretty well. However, there is a dark side to this that I will get to.
- Lots of free and easily accessible learning resources. They will pay for all sorts of things, from certification exams to degree programs. There are also tons of opportunities to present about various topics to large swaths of the organization.
- Internal mobility is highly encouraged. Employees routinely jump from team to team and division to division. Internal job board allows you to easily find and apply for roles around the company.
- Engineers are given a lot of say within the company. As much as I will complain about the tech org later, CapOne does seem to be genuinely trying to encourage a strong engineering culture and giving them the power they need to succeed.
- Heavy focus on their TDP program, which aims to attract graduates straight out of college and give them lots of training inside of the company. Sounds like the TDP experience can vary widely depending on what kind of teams you get placed on.","- CapOne wants be a tech company soooo bad, but it doesn't seem to understand what that means or how to do that. They hired a bazillion software engineers, designers, project, and product people, but have no idea what to do with them. Lots of engineers spend all day just updating libraries and re-hydrating VM images. Internal product teams get more love and resources than the public-facing products that actually make the company money. But hey, this message seems to be making investors excited.
- Some divisions have strong products, talent, and culture (*cough* Card). Some divisions are really floundering from both a talent and business perspective. This creates a self-reinforcing loop where good people constantly flee to the already-capable teams and everyone else gets left with the lesser performers. Credit cards are still hands-down their cash cow, so everything else plays second fiddle.
- Lots of power jockeying between teams and senior leaders. Typically this comes in the form of creating processes that make a team a gate-keeper for the rest of the company, such as requiring everyone to get their approval for something as simple as adding a column to a database. More and more decision-making authority is being given to HQ teams like Cyber and Change Management, while the engineering teams on the front lines building the actual products have little to no say in how they are allowed to develop things. Little trust is extended to engineers throughout the company; instead, HQ teams try to micro-manage product teams and force them into supposed best practices despite not knowing anything about their products or code bases. This is made all the worse by people with little to no engineering background repeatedly being put in senior engineering leadership roles. These internal tools and processes that lock everything down are more often than not half-baked and have all sorts of functional issues. There is a lot of bureaucracy even compared to other financial services companies that I have worked at.
- Their well-known cyber security incident in 2019 was CapOne's 9/11 moment. At first there was a real drive to fix systemic issues that led to the incident, but as time goes on this initiative has driven the tech organization to the brink of madness and self-destruction. Crazy amounts of engineers are being used to do lots of BS work in the name of ""cyber security"" and ""compliance"" at the expense of improving their products, but very little of it actually helps their security posture. This is driving away tons of talented tech folks who don't want to spend their entire days working on nonsense like filling out paperwork rather than building products.
- Their Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging program is borderline toxic. Race and gender is brought up constantly and seems to be the only thing that matters to most people. If you fall into one of the in-vogue demographics (and don't work at a branch), you will be given several speaking and leadership opportunities. If you aren't, prepare to be berated either implicitly or explicitly on a daily basis. Some company policies and mandatory trainings are created and run exclusively by the EmpowHER and Black Leadership Council groups. Whenever I wanted to hire someone of certain ethnicities on my team, HR always demanded a written explanation due to ""diversity concerns"", but never did the same for other ethnicities. The sad part is Asians (east and central) get crapped on the most despite making up half of the company's software engineers; lots of H1Bs that are bullied into long hours and low pay increases under threat of losing their visas. The company should do its best to respect people regardless of things they can't control like sex, but this DIB program isn't the way to deal with that topic.

Some things I saw related to their DIB efforts: a woman muting all of the men at the start of a conference call because they ""already got to speak enough,"" to lots of cheering. A Division President highlighting the ""white"" data point on an employee demographics chart during an all-hands meeting and saying ""This is the problem right here with our diversity efforts..."" despite the numbers showing that Caucasians were under-represented relative to national demographics. A recruiter got drunk at a company event and spilled that a lot of them dig through candidates' public profiles to see if they might be Republican supporters and reject anyone that they suspect of this. A very active member of the DIB program on my team repeatedly complaining in private about ""all of the Indians"" that worked at CapOne."

Bottom line, she never got back. Even after I emailed her asking for help a second time. Essentially my disabilities made me unqualified in their eyes even though I went through living hell to get that degree.

I've been through 5 branch closures and when I started working for Capital One 10 years ago they had 9 Full service Capital One Branches within 10 miles radius. Now, since 2019, one full service and one Select service, now its 2021 one full service within 40 miles radius. Capital one is all about making money for Capital One they force customers to bank digital and enforce employees to bribe and make customers to bank how capital one wants them to bank. Its not all about that special connection with the customer any longer. Capital One wants banking made easier for Cap One. So they will have less ovee head and use the excuse we don't have customers coming in because they are digital this is BS! So they use the excuse to let higher paid dedicated 10-55 year employees go and then hire new hires starting them out at $15 hr. You are promised tomorrow at capital one and you are constantly being watched,threatened to be fired,written up for any and everything because of new policy/ procedure guidelines changing back and forth. Even they can't keep up with the policy changing because it literally changes daily. Good luck if you consider working here. Please take my advise! Beware of what you are getting yourself into. They have excellent benefits, but it will not last forever! Very stressful job!"

From compensation to benefits to people management to transparency to empowerment to opportunities to competent workmates to flexibility to great work environment, Capital One works hard to get it right for their employees.","Most employees in most years, even if you are a hard worker used to being the cream of the crop, are going to get the middle rating of ""Strong"" in their competitive performance management rating system. If that will hurt your feelings Cap One might not be the place for you. Getting a higher rating with the additional monies that come with that requires a combination of hard work, right project at the right time, a little bit of politics, and a little bit of luck. That said, the compensation and bonuses with ""Strong"" or significant and if you can handle getting that, even some years when you felt you deserved more, then you will probably be the one to stay and enjoy the significant pros of working here."

Teams are given great flexibility in how they work (as long as it is scrum with 2 week sprints).

The company generally tries to do software ""the right way"". Well tested code is only par for the course. There is heavy emphasis on standardisation to help with delivery as well as removing blockers and tedious change requests going forward.

There are good communities there and you are encouraged to make a difference and make changes. Success is celebrated well.

The graduate and young careers paths are very good and provide a genuine spring board into mid level and senior positions.

Work life balance and employee well being is outstanding.

COVID specific: They sent staff home before the government ordered lock down and ensured there was next to no disruption to work. Bravo!","Far too little ""real"" technical or actual coding work. Lots of goal setting and retros with very little substance behind either.

Some managers generally don't seem that interested in developing their staff and would prefer to resolve conflicts of interest with hand waving.

Unsure of who the tribe structure suits. Finance presumably. You will spend a long time working with teams in totally separate departments rather than collaborating with your tribe which was the intention.

The performance review system seems outdated and is loathed by everyone. Far too much emphasis on what the specifics of what you have achieved rather than how you are actually doing day to day.

Don't expect pay rises to keep pace with the industry. Promotion is the only way to ensure you stay fairly compensated.

The requests from the US are usually planned badly and are often unwelcome.

The company preach about technology and the transformation it can bring however recently there has been more than a lot of lip service paid to tech debt/platform investment rather than actually finding time for this work."

Capital One has a high focus on customer satisfaction and most employees are also customers.,The culture can be foreign for an outsider to navigate at first. Capital One adjusts quickly to outside (and internal) factors and reorgs can be common.
1521,Capital One,Great people but bad work politics.,2021-07-31,3.0,Associate Software Engineer,"Pay is pretty good for new grads. Salary has steadily increased as the demand for SWEs increases. Two base salary increases across the board in the last 1.5 years, but not everyone gets it (more on that in cons).
Work-life balance is great, but this can vary by what team you're on and management.","Stack rankings. Even if you're a hard worker, if you have stellar coworkers/teammates, good luck. You'll get rated poorly and get blindsided because you weren't given any feedback throughout the year, hence no real opportunities to improve. If you're rated below strong, aka ""performing as expected,"" you will not get a salary bump, even if the people who've been at the company for 3 months get the bump by default because they're ""too new to rate."" 
Work politics are clearly at play when it comes to performance reviews at mid-year and year-end. If you're placed on a team with a manager whose expectations are too high, good luck."

It is like a cross between the TV show Survivor and Real Housewives. The amount of passive aggressive behind your back activities is stunning. Someone is going to end up in the bad review bucket so people do what they have to in order to stay safe.

And they are very big into diversity and inclusion, it is woven into everything as if race and gender identity are the only things that matter. If you fall into one of the correct victim groups you are safe, if not then keep your head down because as I said someone has to be labeled as underperforming."

1665,Capital One,"Pretty on the surface, still just another call center underneath",2021-07-12,2.0,Net Promoter,"You have a lot of say in choosing your shift / hours. Making changes after you start is difficult to impossible, but if you go into it with a preferred shift in mind(mornings / nights, 10 hour days 4 days a week, 7 hour days to avoid a mandatory lunch, etc) there's a good chance they'll be willing to work with you.
The benefits package is great, but it kind of has to be to makeup for being a call center.
Very inclusive team. Everybody is treated as an equal within the department regardless of race, sexual orientation, or other background characteristics. If you're a social person, you'll probably make a lot of friends working here. 
The pay may seem competitive for the area, and in some ways it is, but for the work/effort required there's many places you could be working for significantly more money.","Underneath the pretty paint and great benefits package, Capital One is much like any other call center. 
There's very little room for advancement. Most moves within the company would be lateral, requiring 9 months of investment and zero pay increase. The one promotion up from entry level is to the escalations line. What a customer would call a ""manager"" but really you're just doing the same job you were already doing, and now also taking escalated calls. This comes with a nice pay raise, but the work becomes more toxic and you'll need a very thick skin to get by. 
Beyond the first promotion to level Two, level Three has a very low turnover rate and you may be waiting YEARS taking escalations calls before you're even considered for the next level. If you want to reach a position in the company that will afford you a comfortable living, expect to put in upwards of a decade of your life waiting for it. 
Missing work / calling in sick is a big deal, one that WILL get you fired if you do it enough. 
Every month you will have a certain number of calls pulled by several different people, some you've met, many you never have and never will. These people will critique your calls and give you a score that may or may not depend on their mood at the time.
You will also be held to very strict, often impossible to meet KPI 'goals'. These goals will be purposefully set at unrealistic levels so that when you inevitably fail to meet them, they can use it as a reason to withhold bonuses, offer a less attractive raise, or put you on the chopping block depending on your personal relationship with your manager.
Every month you WILL be told that you're spending too much time talking to your customers, and you will be asked to reduce your AHT (Average handle time) or you risk termination, even though AHT is largely out of your control. You may get lucky and all of your calls are simple 2 minute balance transfers, or you may get unlucky and have a complicated array of technical issues you're chasing on end. 
Either way, LUCK is more important here than talent or effort."

They are trying hard to move forward and be a top contender in the FinTech industry. It’s a slow process, but compared to other banks they are pretty innovative and have made big steps since I’ve been there.","They sell that it’s like a start-up environment - it is not. It is a bank, audited by the OFFCP, with a lot of red tape surrounding anything we do. They have to be 1000% risk averse, so it feels like you have to go through 10 pipelines of approval to get anything done. 

The performance management system is horrible. Metrics for hiring numbers or anything actually related to your job description are not considered when giving out promotions. Instead, it is a popularity contest or about who received the attractive projects that gets recognized from leadership. At times, this is unfair as not all recruiters get shoulder tapped for projects. 

Some direct managers (not all) are very disconnected from the perspective of “in the weeds” recruiting, as many managers are not promoted from within but hired externally. This is frustrating for lower level associates having to teach managers how to do their jobs."

THAT'S IT which makes the competition hard to move into management bc people won't want to leave management if that is a goal of yours. If you are not interested in management then you are stuck in your sales role so you can't move around and learn other interesting skills or job functions. It's a dead-end job sadly and Cap One Auto has made no improvements in trying to create new jobs other than just sales or management. So BE WARNED, if you are lucky to be chosen as a Relationship Manager or Area Sales Manager get comfortable. It definitely can cause burnout doing the same thing day in and day out with no prospects of learning new skills for new roles within the auto division. Do not be deceived, Relationship Manager is a call center role-if you are not a call center type this job isn't for you,if you plan to come in and move around don't come into Capital One Auto Finance--find another way into Capital One. I cannot stress enough that this is a DEAD END JOB and in NO way a Career."

Also, expect your leadership to change a LOT. I've had 7 direct managers in 10 years and about a dozen dotted line managers. Priorities shift a few times per year. Because of the frequent changing, any goals that your group has set will likely be irrelevant within a few months.

- Good benefits (relatively)
- If you luck into one of the ~5 good managers at the company, you'll have a good time until you rotate
- Good tech to learn and gain experience on","I think the worst part about this company is how disingenuous it is. They are really good at paying lip service to important issues such as Diversity, Empathy, Transparency, Work/Life balance, but then try to find any evidence of progress within any of these areas (if you're truly data-driven, then this is a no-brainer), and you won't find any.

Diversity: They recruit from the same 4 schools in Canada, from the same 3 programs, which have the same type of students and people from similar backgrounds (McGill, Queens, UofT, Waterloo..). Where is your diversity? When asked about why we don't recruit from other schools, you'll get some bs answer that boils down to ""we are biased and we like our bias so we won't change"".

Empathy: The amount of associates who have left purely because of their manager's emotional incompetence is absurd. The managers here are promoted not for their ability to manage people, but for their ability to deliver ""results"", which means that if your whole team is burnt out and depressed, but your manager appears to have reached some goal (emphasis on APPEAR), then they will get promoted and you'll be left with nothing but emotional trauma. 

What do they do about this? An optional 2 hour empathy training.

Transparency: If you directly ask senior leadership anything that isn't a set up for an ego stroke then you will get a vague, standard PR answer that is of no substance. ""What are you doing about the absurdly high attrition?"" ""Why won't you pay us more?"" ""What is this business trying to do exactly? Other an exploit poor people"". 
Answer? ""Great question! We are excited about the future of Capital One Canada! What you're asking is important to us, and we will continue to work hard on providing those answers :)""

WLB: Mixed bag, you may luck into a team that isn't doing anything, so you're free to spend the day on Reddit or applying to other jobs, or you may be absurdly busy. In any case, you will have way more meetings than you care for.

Other notable issues:
- They cannot retain top talent they have nothing to offer to anyone with skill and ambition. The pay isn't good, the work gets boring, the company is stagnant, the managers are bad
- Senior leadership loves to talk about themselves and what hobbies they have, etc. at every meeting.... Who told them this was a good idea?
- Leadership is extremely biased, but will constantly tell you how unbiased they try to be. Yet, if you don't think like them, you will not get far.
- Titles are inflated. When you eventually leave, if you go to a REAL tech company, your title will decrease, but you'll be paid minimum 30%-50% more. Capital One is obsessed with titles and hierarchy, so don't get too attached to that ""senior"" next to your role.
- Once you hit senior, you are not paid well if you are in a technical/analytical role.
- If you're an external hire coming into a senior role, you will not get promoted unless you completely conform to their way of doing things. Again, absurdly biased
- So many people who have never worked elsewhere saying how great it is comparatively....
- Our business model is literally charge poor people for being poor"

The appearance of results is more important than actual results, so a lot of people move up through the ranks simply knowing how to sound like they know what they are doing regardless of actual ability. Many managers and team leads are poor at mentoring or coaching their hires, giving them unrealistic tasks with no guidance and expecting other teams to provide support and problem solving.

The work life balance is non existent to say the least. I was promised I would be a software engineer and get to do what I love, but instead I'm just a janitor to work through these terrible internal processes and tools that are poorly defined and don't work 90% of the time.

Performance management is set up to drive fear not collaboration. The worst part is, it is masked in lip service to mitigating bias, and promoting collaboration.

It really is about how a manager sees you and how much you suck up to them. I am finding my role to be more about pleasing my manager and completely ignoring my own development. I also find that I am bot allowed to challenge management on any ideas as they see this as a challenge to their intelligence/ hierarchy. Work overall is also very boring.

2340,Capital One,Okay Company with terrible performance management,2021-04-03,2.0,Master Software Engineer,"1) Gives back to the community through volunteer/ coders program
2) Compensation is above average, and raises are fair. My salary more than doubled after working here 6 years.
3) Work life balance is pretty good, aside from late night releases
4) Has better values than most other banks. Yeah C1 gets fined from time to time for violating regulations, but it's no Wells Fargo
5) Much farther ahead technology wise than similar financial companies
6) Strong push for diversity
7) Pretty good benefits
8) Invest in yourself days","1) Uses stacked ranking for performance management. 

 How will you be evaluated as a developer you ask? This will determine not only your bonus, but also when you will likely be promoted next and salary increases, so it's pretty important. 

At Capital One, this is process is known as calibration sessions. All the managers under a senior director get in a room and they are given a certain percentage of who can be rated as exceptional, very strong, strong, and needs improvement. . 

There is little regard for the reality of how the employees are actually performing objectively. Astonishingly, the managers work backwards from the same distribution no matter where you are in the company (no I'm not joking) and try to fit all the employees into that, leading to some cases of exceptional employees being under rated, or struggling employees being rated as strong. 

 Your rating will be determined by other managers who you have little opportunity to interact with on a daily basis, and will heavily depend on how much political clout your manager has. Astoundingly, there is little to no consideration put on the opinion of your teammates who would know the most about your contributions.

What this results in is a sort of hunger games culture where you can only do better by having those who work closely with you to do poorly. As you can imagine pitting teams and employees against each other in this manner is a huge drain on productivity.

2) Work is not interesting and doesn't build your developer skill set

The data breach has created a very shortsighted culture. There is a cyber initiative that in theory would be important work to safeguard customer data, but as an initiative it's not very well managed. Don't get me wrong, securing platforms and customer data is and always should be the number one priority. But the kinds of things they have developers doing aren't making the platforms any more secure, and are largely dictated by non-technical types. There's teams of developers (a significant portion of devs) that are spending months doing nothing but continually upgrading versions of libraries of internal systems and filling out endless google sheets. 

This work is the height of tedium and you can expect your developer skills to slowly degrade if you find yourselves in one of these nightmare positions. 

3) Lots of late night releases

More so than other places that I've worked, you likely expect to be up on late night releases 2 to 3 nights per week. This is a drain on your work life balance and one of parts of the job that are actually not conducive to work life balance, otherwise the work load is pretty fair.

4) High turnover (and loads of technical debt)

This may vary with team, but almost every platform I've encountered is understaffed and filled with technical debt. It's a vicious cycle where developers are leaving because the platforms are unmaintainable, which leads to new developers going through the same burnout and leaving. You can't under-staff a platform and continually put off refactoring and listening to developers without paying a price.

5) The hiring process leaves a lot to be desired. 

Applicants for software developer positions are given questions out of a pool that interviewers are mandated to pick form and are frankly... awful. They're solving a small coding challenge that has no resemblance to the kind of work that we do on a day to day basis. It's no surprise that with this hiring process we get a fair amount of developers that can't contribute to the team in any meaningful way and are rarely fired, but merely moved from team to team forever.

6) Company politics are rampant

I've personally seen managers straight up lie to another to get ahead. On one occasion one manager said he would give a developer to the other if they could transition a platform, and then went back on his word and pretended he never said this. I was shocked. Some of these managers directors are so without moral compass and scheming they make Machiavelli's characters look like Fred Rogers."

- Title inflation, recent grad one year out of school can be promoted to ""Senior"" Software Engineer. This is an insult to actual senior engineers.
- Terrible performance management process
- Promotion process is muddy and the goal post shifts every year
- Canada business has been on a downhill trend for years (lost two partnerships, lack of competitive branded products, can't retain customers that graduate from the secured cards)

Beyond Principal Associate, not a single thing they sell you in the interview is true about growth or support, there is no upward momentum - immediately a glass ceiling unless you are a home grown HR rotational not a professional recruiter with actual ideas.

This is likely the single most political company of truly unqualified managers I have ever worked for. I have been here just over 3 years and have had 7 different bosses because of inconsistent reorgs - you are a placeholder they toss around and throw reqs at.

Avoid this company for corporate recrutiment. You are expendable, you will feel put down and alone in your career here, management won't support you unless you fit the mold of popularity they see fit, and promotion (unless out of tech recruiting) is a pipe dream.

Also so much fake positiviti (like the grouping) it's awful."

2451,Capital One,Thick skin required,2021-03-22,1.0,Collections Specialist,Better benefits than almost any other call center,New employees are constantly being training because most of them get fired shortly after starting. You need to fully understand which policies can get you fired and make sure you follow them. If you ask a manager about policy there is a good chance they won't know it either and if you follow what they say and its wrong you will be fired. Since managers are free to lie about what they say (since its not recorded) you should figure out a way to record it (hard to do on Zoom calls). The worst mistake you can make is to take as gospel what a manager tells you. In early 2020 they fired every temp in the last 3 groups of new hires because they made too many mistakes. So rather than find out what they needed and properly train them they just fired that many people at once rather than hold the trainer accountable.

- Extensive paid parental leave option.
- Myriad additional benefits depending on your situation.
- If you're looking for a place to 'park' fora few years, this isn't a terrible option. Depending on your role and department, work/life balance is recognized and this can very much be a strictly 9-5 position for those seeking that.","- I'll preface by saying - given Capital One's size as an organization - employee experience will inevitably be both team and manager-specific.
- If you're based outside of Virginia (McLean, Richmond) or Texas (Plano), you'll end up feeling like an outsider. This may be changing due to the increasingly virtual nature of employment, but pre-pandemic this was certainly the case.
- The performance review cycle - while not uncommon among enterprise organizations of Capital One's size - rewards those who know and schmooze the right people and have a well-positioned manager. The unfortunate reality is that individual performance metrics are not weighed heavily; it's more or less a popularity contest.
- While internal mobility is encouraged and stands as a reality, the organization leads with selling that option to prospective employees. This begs the question: why are employees constantly shuffling throughout the organization and what are they running from?
- Largely a culture of blame. With an organization this size, it's easy to pass off errors to someone else, hide your tracks and refuse to accept responsibility.
- If you don't start working at Capital One straight out of college in one of their rotation programs, you'll never truly be treated as a superstar employee; it's very much a 'home-grown' environment for leadership.
- Along the same lines as the above point, much of the leadership within the organization has spent the majority (if not the entirety) of their career at Capital One. This lends to blindspots, a lack of diversity in experience and a refusal to adapt to outside points of view.
- Generally speaking, Capital One (purposely) does not pay as competitively as organizations in the same space. If you're going to sell your soul to a bank, you may as well get paid for it."

The rest of your time is spent doing teller transactions, or if a customer has a legitimate request or issue that requires some actual knowledge and assistance, then you don't get to help them yourself, you just call someone from another department and put them on the phone with your customer.

If you are one of the lucky few who get into a great team where they actually do development work, great! But there is a higher chance that you will get placed into a team that does ""development"" work and by that I mean do nothing that is remotely close to development. There is a reason why a lot of TDPs don't make it through their 2 years in the program. Management won't listen if you complain. They might make you rotate off the team early but no guarantee so you can waste your first year doing no development work. 

Also, like mentioned above, people love to coast at this place. Something that should take couple days can take anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks. There is no sense of urgency when it comes to completing stories. Or if the devs are working hard, they are impeded by the many hoops they have to get through to get their story completed."

Meaning, if you're a business analyst you inherently get to a higher level and pay grade than some other jobs. Really was demoralizing when I discovered that, as it felt like it put a pallor of being undervalued on the role I was hired into.

- Very smart people
- Good home/work balance
- Good amenities: pharmacy, gym, cafeterias, doctors, etc.","- Big company politics
- Development plans for employees are optional and most managers don't have the time to use them yourself. You need to keep track of your own development. Managers will usually help achieve your goals if you tell them what you want.
- Rating is on a curve and how you will be rated is determined at the end of the year, so you can manipulate the system. The trick is to talk first when they ask for an ""exceptional"" employee. Once you are established, you usually aren't questioned again. You can also get people a higher rating than they deserve by talking about your average/strong employee when they ask for exceptional. Just be the first person or two to talk and even if they bump you down a notch to meet the bell curve, you're still ahead. Likewise, if you don't talk about someone, they will likely be rated in the lower tiers, so try to talk first. You rarely need to talk about middle-of-the-road employees."

- Decent requisition system for office supplies (can easily get monitors, chairs, etc.)
- Decent pay for entry-level/mid-tier jobs.
- A lot of training if you're straight out of college with a bunch of peers
- Tuition reimbursement for college courses up to 5250 a year, along with access to coursera and pluralsight.","- Be prepared to have to suck up to your manager. The way the evaluations work, you are compared against all your peers, and the only person speaking on your behalf is your direct manager. So if they have a bad opinion of you, you will languish.

- Get ready for vague job responsibilities and milestones. I was specifically told that senior business analysts are required to do what is necessary to finish a project, and that you will be subjectively judged based on how well you did whatever was necessary. This ties in with the previous point, in that you never really know how well you are doing until year end.

- Prepare for a lot of ""80/20"" corner cutting. Timelines are very aggressive (one could say unrealistic), and management does not like delays. Therefore, shoddy analysis has to be done, and covered up with pretty Powerpoints. Discrepancies are not looked into closely unless they don't ""fit the story"". 

- Expect people to be selfish. Because this is a ""results focused"" company, anything that does not contribute directly to your results will be ignored. That means that there is no incentive for others to help you unless it benefits them or they have a kind heart (and thankfully, there were a lot of kind hearted people). Collaboration is rare unless it is mandated from above.

- There is no training if you are not straight out of college. ""Professional"" hires are given a 3 day orientation, then thrown right in. You will definitely notice this, as you realize that hires straight out of college seem to know how to talk the talk, and have better connections.

- You don't get to choose the team you are hired to, you are assigned randomly to teams that need people."

Team leaders have budgets every quarter for things they can spend on us. They have big events and invite all the employees and have dj’s and great food etc. they know how to make you feel appreciated,The job itself is MENTALLY EXHAUSTING. Having to try to collect money from people struggling especially during a pandemic is heartbreaking. I get tired of telling people that we can’t do much for them. Capital one made very minimal effort to assist in this pandemic even though I’m sure they benefitted from corporate bailouts. The only help they provided was not charging late fees IF a person calls every month to tell them they’ve been affected by COVID. If they don’t mention COVID they get no help. And if they forget to call one month we’ll charge them late fees and can’t waive them. Also we keep charging interest every month so someone who owes 300 dollars ends up deferring because of the pandemic and losing their jobs and by the time they get a new job they owe 500 dollars. And I’ve seen it on large scales too where people go THOUSANDS of dollars over their credit limit from interest alone. And they will NOT give any offers to lower ANYONES interest rate. No matter what. So it’s very hard to work for a company that treats its employees great and their customers terribly. If you have a conscience you wouldn’t be able to take this job for long

Culture tries to be employee-centered and practice good ethics. Compensation is good but not great.","San Francisco location is really noisy: high ceilings and wide open spaces make it an echo chamber. There are small rooms along the edge where employees may sequester themselves, but  those rooms are always full. Decentralized management and week Scrum Masters means results in lots of bullying in the scrum. The company decided all software developers are engineers, so QA engineers are expected to become full-stack developers. But there is no plan or support that allows the transition, other then spending 20 hours/week outside of work to attend community college or take courses through Lynda.com . Traditional developers are balking at doing real QA, so quality suffers. Women are encouraged to participate in numerous conferences and conventions for women in tech, while the men stay at the office an work. As a result, the guys gain more experience and deliver more output in the same period. In the bigger picture, more new hires that are men are moving on to higher paying jobs. the company emphasis on diversity is at the expense of productivity. High achievers are not rewarded in the first few years out of college. ""Diverse"" groups with little background in software development recieve a small amount of training and made into Scrum Masters, and many look like deer in the headlights."

My favorite way to explain this is when I tried to find someone to invite to a work function when my partner couldn't make it with me. As I was listing people off in my head, every single one of them was a co-worker that would already be there. I did end up bringing a co-worker that might otherwise not have come, but still...it was another co-worker. 

After over 10 years, 3 departments, and countless positions, I'm still friends with many of my former co-workers. I enjoyed going to work to see my friends and work with them.

I had one boss that fought tooth and nail to get me a worthy raise due to my hard work and the fact that I was grossly underpaid for what I did and my ""title"" within the company (and I really don't care about titles).

Depending on your location - great snacks and paid or subsidized gym membership. They really do care about employee health.","Stack-ranking for promotions and raises. The higher everyone is ranked, the worse off everyone is because ""Very Strong"" becomes the new norm and lowers everyone to ""Strong."" 
Gaining licenses and certs rarely counts for anything other than prestige and additional responsibility and opportunity, but definitely not guaranteed promotions or raises.
Long-term employment means no salary adjustment. The only way to get paid what you are worth is to leave and come back (and yes, I know people who did this and made a lot more money, mainly on the tech side of things)."

3335,Capital One,Game of thrones: Cap1 edition,2020-12-01,1.0,Senior Business Analyst,Great Benefits and surrounded by smart people,"Cap1 culture revolves around hiring young people and having a high attrition rate. They push 10-15% of associates out every year. Doesn't matter if they have great performance, someone has to go. So if you are a team of 8 BAs in one department, at least one of you is leaving at the end of the year. That creates a very toxic environment where people are competing rather than collaborating. This is not an agile environment this is an 1980 policy of ranking people that no one uses anymore. There is a reason a lot of people come in and leave at the 2 year mark, and cap1 is ok with that, they actually designed it like that. Same for senior level same for management level.
It is very common for people to steal your ideas/work/projects to get the recognition. The louder you are the better off you are during the ""calibration"" hunger games eliminations process. 
Moving on to middle management, you have a bunch of 28-29 year old ""managers'' running the show. People with as little as 3 years work experience are managing people's career. Your manager is your god. They simply control everything, your career, your projects, your bonus, your calibration, your performance. If your boss doesn't agree with you or you both aren't compatible, well guess what will happen to your calibration, yup bottom of the curve. 
The work can be exciting but recently they announced the partnerships exit, I wouldn't be surprised if they start laying off analysts or shall I say be more aggressive in their ""elimination"" game. 

For current and future employees, Know that their performance rating is nothing but a politics game between managers. You are just pawns they are manipulating. If you feel stuck and you aren't on top of the curve, leave! The way they push employees to quit rather then firing them is brutal to your self esteem and mental health. Why won't they fire you? well they will at the end if you just won't quit, but mainly cause they want to maintain a good team morale. 
Oh and that is the HR policy, no one will admit it, but it is: Fast in fast out. Hire a lot and push out 10-15% at each cycle out.

Extra tips to win the game of thrones:
- If you work extra hours, you will skew the curve. Now you guarantee you are ahead of the curve. Other associates either have to match your work or they are out. See how the toxic culture starts developing?
- Agree with everything your boss says. DON'T trust your boss. Never be honest with them . They will use whatever you say against you. 
- Don't help other associates in the same family group if you aren't getting anything out of it. Wasting a couple of hours here and there will push you down the curve. If you help, make sure everybody knows! Even better tell your boss you did half the work why not. 
- Leave. Because everything I mentioned above will make you a bad toxic person. Constantly apply for other jobs."

Essentially all engineering teams are run by a Product Owner. The product owners sit in meetings and groom backlogs; they're not capable of contributing to meaningfully to technical discussions. Some have a technical background, but within a few months they're completely out of date on any given stack, and are functionally unable to manage an engineering team. At that point there's a real problem- software decision-making is entirely driven by a non-technical staff. This of course is a perverse incentive- instead of an engineer driving technical decisions, designing software and innovating, the engineers have to effectively beg product owners for tasking, (""please let me solve this issue the right way""). Any incentive an engineer had to excel in their trade will quickly be exhausted by this poor organizational structure."

My position is a M-F position and all major holidays off and there are time where overtime is available.","The wrong people in the right position! Capital One or at least the site that i'm in has a trend of hiring people in management that have no previous experience in fraud or does not have the aptitude for fraud. This is an issue if you yourself have fraud experience or are a seasoned veteran, management does not like to be corrected or challenged, if they say 2+2=8 and you don't go with that then you're going to have a hard time. It's all about PERCEPTION with these people, once you go against the grain they will retaliate against you no matter how good of a performer you are and the HR or associate relations route will not help you and they will side with management automatically. My current manager is a complete ding bat and does not like to be corrected and has no experience nor the aptitude for the work, trying to have a conversation or explain things to a person like this is like trying to ice skate uphill on a sunny day.

Your opinion is valued and it is not intimidating to share your opinion with a VP+ executive. They are constantly requesting feedback on job satisfaction. The work itself is challenging and very rewarding.,The only reason I am even looking around for new jobs is that as of this moment the company is still expecting all employees to return to the office once it is safe to do so and I find that the benefits of working from home are too great to be able to return to the office.

There is a lot of talk about development opportunities but that is only true for friends of directors. The company doesn't value experience, it values new grads and new people so turnover is high and you end up with people with a couple of years into their working lives at the same level as very experienced people.  Its hard to know who works there from one day to the next. Each part of the business is run by somebody on the leadership team, they believe their business area is their own fiefdom and every area has a very different culture, so  the experience as an employee is wildly different depending on where you work. The middle ""director"" level fear making decisions, don't appear to trust the people in their teams, and every decision gets escalated right to the top, so if you're far down the pecking order it is very hard to get any work done. There is little psycholgical safety because senior people recruit their friends. The performance management system is used as a stick."

I went to the gym every day, took advantage of personal training and free career coaching, would often frequent the #freefood slack channel rooms to score free lunches, etc. It was a great experience aside from the standard petty office politics.","The culture has gone down the drain post-COVID, especially with regards to work life balance, based on what my partner (still at Capital One) says. I asked my partner to take one day off of work to come with me to close on a house and he refused because taking a non-Friday off would be a red flag in his group. I then asked if he could take the Friday off to help move and he said that might also be a red flag. He also made it clear that based on the way his team functions, he's not planning to take more than 1 week of paternity leave next year because he doesn't want his team to use that against him in perf.

-a lot of the strategy roles; are effectively BI roles with a small business dimension, it is not really suitable for experienced hires, especially if 60-80% of the work will be SQL coding
- people with 4-6 consulting experience (coming evening from a manager level role) end up being on the same level as a grad after 1 year internal experience - it creates a very odd dynamic and tells one that the value proposition is not understood if you can be manager/ senior manager / director in other comparable organisations with that experience 
- most experienced people with strong profiles have realised that/ do realise it after a few weeks in 
- due to COVID we are trapped now, but fear not once the opportunity is given people will move on to the right options
- although good progression was promised and obvisouly oversold at recruiting stage will need to be validated, currently not particularly convinced by it
- overall it is not a disaster but looking at the other options I had back then as a strong hire I am regretting it a bit, will most likely jump asap once COVID impact fades away"

Leadership loves giving examples of when we forgive loans (usually under extreme circumstances) - however, hard to forget the other hundreds of thousands of heads we are pushing underwater.
- Nothing you do matters. For all the analysis you do, if the conclusions of your work don’t match up with what managers were going to do anyways, you’re sent back to rework the analysis to support the original hypothesis.

- Some teams can be great at times and you may learn a few things if you are lucky. A lot of your colleagues are not extremely qualified so there's plenty of opportunity to mentor too.
- As far as modern tech open-space sweatshops go they have nice sit-stand desks and nice aesthetics. Some catered lunches, the ones the business side pays for can be really good but engineering is mostly fed pizza.
- A lot of distractions, you can be busy for months without doing any actual work. Don't worry, as long as you make your senior manager look good you will still get promoted!","The senior management team is great at manipulation and self-promotion; skills that allow them to recruit some good talent which, sometimes, accidentally, can form good teams. Don't expect those teams to last, you will soon find out that all work of substance is done by the US team. 
Canada is playing catch up, you will find yourself begging US teams to push a button for you, write tons of configuration and maybe a line of code or two. 
If a promotion comes don't expect money. Pay is under market but they pretend it's not.
Be careful who you trust! It's all cliques, in-groups and the agile coaches are there to report your thoughts to managers."

- Work in the Canada office isn't very exciting as most decisions come out of the states. It also takes a ton of people and departments to make even the most basic decision. 
- Like another reviewer said, ""Analysis Paralysis"". Too much emphasis on the same few analytical/data-driven views that any other opinions are rejected. 
- Promotion-motivated. From the day you start, you are fixated on your next promotion and if you don't get it within the 18-24 month window you will probably leave.

3884,Capital One,Changing banking for good?,2020-06-30,1.0,Associate,They have really good benefits,"I chose Capital One as the HR reps who visited my school touted it as a really healthy, progressive environment that differentiated itself from the old school finance way. I was a part of the rotational program so I got to experience several parts of the bank. 

The most major issue I experienced was sexual harassment. My first week on one of my rotations, there was a work happy hour and a senior male commented that I “was going to be his second wife.” Then, in the office, another senior male made a sexually charged comment. I told my manager about it and a sexual harassment case was filed but there was no real resolution other than he had to stay away from me. For the rest of the rotation, he bad mouthed me (even to the interns that were there for the summer). I heard quite a few racist and sexist remarks that he either announced publicly or someone else would tell me how uncomfortable they were by something he said to them as well. Yet, nothing was done. After I left, I received a request to pay back some of my compensation for leaving early. I called HR to see if we could come to some sort of agreement as I had left early to get out of a toxic work environment but they “had no record of the sexual harassment case.” Ultimately I ended up just paying it in full so I could move on and not have to worry about fighting with Capital One anymore. Overall, I was disappointed by how they handled this incident.

Also, they market Capital One as a place motivated people come to build something great. Most of the people I encountered were people who came from big banks who were now ready to take it easy in a less intense environment. It didn’t really feel like a place to start your career and learn from the best. 

Last thing, performance reviews are very subjective and not transparent. If you don’t have a manager who has your back, you’ll struggle to feel fully valued. I tried to communicate with my manager early on and was constantly told that my work product was timely and of great quality and that I would likely receive the highest ranking, though it wasn’t set in stone. At the end of the rotation, I suddenly got a lower ranking because “I asked too many questions when I should be trying to problem solve on my own” when my male counterpart (who several times turned in projects late and spent most of his time on linkedin looking for other jobs or facebook) got a higher ranking than me. All the other feedback was the same as throughout the rotation but I was downgraded for that reason (even though it was never communicated to me when I asked). Looking back, it just seems like a weird process to me as I ask more questions than ever in my new job (and my manager has commented on it) yet I still get the highest rating because of my timely, solid work product. 

I now work at one of those “old school” financial institutions and it’s a much more meritocratic and supportive environment than either of my teams at Capital One (plus to be blunt, the pay is better). Looking back, I learned a good lesson and found my way but I think I could have saved myself a lot of trouble if I just started off in a big bank."

If your like most IT folks, like to be heads down developing, solving problems, then CapOne will not be a good long term place for you. You have to put on a show and kiss the right but or your not going to make it, no matter how great your development skills are. I've worked at several companies as a contractor/employee and CapOne is the most Game of Thrones place I've ever worked, its crazy. If your an older more experienced IT professional, I would not join CapOne.

Both the Richmond and McLean (the new one, M2) are amazing places to work with countless amenities, think kombucha on tap, medical centers, gym, collegiate-like campus with bikes to ride from bldg to bldg for your meetings. Shuttle buses are available between the campuses so when you do need to get to Richmond for a meeting, just hop on the shuttle in the morning and catch it in the afternoon to get back. Compensation and benefits are exceptional. Even in comparison to large tech firms (Apple, Google, etc.) Capital One offers similar or in most scenarios, more benefits. Work life balance is pretty great depending on your team, general start time is 9am and employees are encouraged to take the time they need to tend to family business. Hours and wfh can be flexible, but again depends on the team. Adoption assistance is up to $35k and they offer fertility benefits with up to 3 IVF rounds with meds included (no PGT testing unless you meet specific conditions, you need to utilize all embryos before doing a second IVF round, and all FETs are covered until the last round of IVF in which case they will only cover 1 more FET).","Not necessarily a con, but need to be aware of the environment - it is a very matrixed organization. So most teams don't have full ownership over what they are building and will need to collaborate very heavily with multiple other teams because another product owner will have accountability over the vertical while you own the horizontal. This causes projects to take much longer than they might otherwise. This also means that if your Sr. Dir. isn't very strong, you likely won't be able to your projects to move forward if discussions have to move up the chain. The YE rating system is cut-throat. You need to prep and stay prepped all year. Make sure you are socializing your work to every single person you can. It will come down to stack ranking with a required 5-15% needing to be rated lower than 'meets expectations'. If you keep upping your game every year, you'll be fine but that may mean taking on external public speaking engagements, leading projects that will have massive business impact that can be 100% accounted to you alone (you'll get docked if someone else can share credit, which is in a matrix is hard to not share credit). I've seen people with $100MM in project value get average ratings so know that you aren't coming here to go with the flow....if you do, you won't last more than a year."

ALOT of AWS experience gained","-Having a noisy open workspace, working less hours and having stickers on laptops doesn't make you a tech company. The job was advertised as a software engineer but ended up doing boring DevOps work, and when I needed to code I had to deal with undocumented spaghetti code(I was surprised to see this quality of code in a company like CapOne). There is no enforcement from tech leads to write clean code or provide documentation. I was surprised because the coding challenge in the interview process was written very professionally and included end to end testing.

-You'll need to go through many procedures in order to make any change in production code.

-You'll spend most of your time on endless time meetings.

-The tasks you need to work on are not clear and you will waste your life looking for answers on what needs to be done.

-Co-workers are not helpful and lazy - will take time to respond to you so you stop asking questions and won't respond at all after 3:30pm (because this is when some people stop working here).

-Tech lead is incompetent and careless. If asked, wouldn't even know how to run the app which is the core functionality that the team manages.

The internal coding courses offered were an incredible way to get relevant, foundational technical skills that you could practice day-to-day. The role I was in was fairly challenging although the cyclical nature of the work meant that things would get repetitive past the 1-year mark. Fortunately the rotation program allows almost anyone to switch teams and experience a new role within the company.","Capital One's only real con to me was its unsavory business model. While the mission was to ""Change Banking for Good"", looking at the financials usually painted the picture of profiting off poor people and new immigrants off of interest and high fees.

You will be taught very generally about banking and what fraud is but not that you will be responsible for all regulations for banks including non-fraud related calls. Your Capital One expects you to use their knowledge base to do everything whether it is in your scope or not. You will receive write ups for not knowing something. The Knowledge Base is pretty grim. It is in no way something you can use while speaking to a customer. It is a link within a link with in a link that opens so many windows you forgot what you were there for in the first place. Management is aware but hold you to every word on your QA's. Management does not take calls, they have no idea what you are facing on the front line nor do they care. If you question anything you get pointed to ask someone else. You are not looked at for your individual contribution to the team unless you suck up to the manager and they like you, then you will be put in for every recognition there is and mentioned in every meeting. They rank you with everyone on the floor which is very unfair especially when in the same pool as tenured employees. This means you won't get a raise, won't get a transfer, and choose your shift you want to work forever when you get your offer because you will never get it changed, ever.

Inconsistencies with policies about remote work and whether vacation time is actively tracked or not (varies manager to manager).

The way to get promoted or be put on a path to ""stretch"" for promotion is by kissing up to higher ups to get out on projects that appear to be game changers. The true talented associates are ignored.

- Heavy emphasis on analytics and SQL, skills that are very valuable and highly transferable
- In general you'll work with good people at the individual contributor level who're well intentioned
- Competitive pay for the amount of work you do
- Good RRSP program and pretty standard stock plan
-  A  strengthening ""tech"" brand due to the strong exit placements of alumni","- You'll be working in the credit card industry, which isn't for everyone,. Capital One also isn't very forthcoming about this during recruiting. 
- Analysis paralysis, the flip side of the heavy emphasis on analytics is that there is a general sense of false precision, and you'll be asked to do the same analysis a hundred different ways  for very little incremental insight.
- Because the work is concentrated on a single industry, the learning curve will be steep at first, and you'll quickly become knowledgable in credit cards, but it'll flatten out thereafter unless you want to build extremely niche knowledge in  one particular aspect of credit card (e.g. over-limit fees).
-  Management is a mixed bag, while there are a few truly inspirational leaders, there are also managers who are very ""cliquey"" and will only promote associates who're close to them, there are also a lot of first-time managers who were promoted to people management position based on their individual contribution and they're not well equipped to lead teams."
4081,Capital One,"Great starter job, if you're willing to risk your mental health",2020-03-19,2.0,General Emplyee,"- Good starting salary
- Strong in analytics
- Nice junior coworkers, who share the pain","- Management: A culture of consistently promoting self-serving, political climbing managers who are generally willing to trade-off their associates well-being for business results and a personal promotion.

- Associates: A culture of being afraid to leave despite being depressed, because of tight-knit friendship circles at work, above-industry pay, and the impression that they are working with ""the smartest people in Toronto""

- Symptoms of depression I've seen in myself and many others:
Emotional numbness, insomnia, hopelessness, overwhelming dread, zero self-worth, and a total inability to believe that things can be better. All of which feel normal in the moment, and insane in hindsight.

Also being afraid to express these feelings, partially because I've experienced and seen other managers tell their associates off for “being negative”. This is despite all the mental health training for managers. 

There are also some truly great managers, but they are the minority and won't get promoted as quickly compared to the ones who optimize for self-gain."

They hire outside the company instead of promoting within.  Once you are in a schedule you can not get off of it.  The new hires get a better schedule than the tenured employees.  If you want to go part time, they tell you no, but they hire new employees part time.  Sure you can post for a new job, but you have to apply like you are a new employee with resume and interview.  They will not look at prior work history.  When they do post a new opening, it is only because they have to and you are just wasting your time, they already know who they want for the opening.

Lots of nepotism and favouritism exhibited by senior leaders.
- HR has no idea how to proactively ensure fairness; certain groups are given random competitive salary increases while others are left behind. Significant salary gaps between job families.
- Nothing exciting happening in Canada, very difficult to get things done if you do have good ideas. Leadership tries to get you excited about the future by rolling out a brand strategy that is unrealistic and won't change anything, or by saying they have aspirations to grow but with no specifics on how.

Managers on down to Customer Service all seem to have a calm coolness - the banking world can be so smug and it was refreshing to come to work each day. The work/life balance is one of my favorite parts - they believe a happy, healthy (mentally, physically & financially) are recipes for success & a sustainable business model.","It was sometimes tough to get ahead in some departments - the beauty of Capital One is the ability for most associates to migrate inter-department & pickup valuable skills along the way, so there were always opportunities."

This does wonderful things for team cohesion and makes people optimize for very strange things. 

If you are a software developer, expect to get stuck in an on-call rotation at least once a month and doing a LOT of devops work even if you weren't hired as a devops engineer. Toward the end of my time there, 90% of the work my team did was related to scrambling to comply with some new enterprise-wide mandate (fix X, switch to using Y, etc.). In the end we had almost no time left to build our product. The product owners and tech leads are really out of touch; a lot of them have no technical background.

Also, the decision to abolish assigned seating and move to ""everyone scramble for a seat every day"" (excuse me... ""Flex Seating""! Yay!) is a horrible decision. It makes the day so stressful to never have any idea whether you will be able to find a decent seat or not, and yet despite the overcrowding many teams do not allow for regular remote work."

Innovative and industry-leading work in some areas (but not outside of the core front line businesses),"I have never seen a company offer so much promise based on its reputation, and then succeed in beating the potential and enthusiasm out of highly capable people. I have worked at several companies during my career and see the specific problems at Capital One as:
1) ""Tell me what I want to hear"" - the senior-most leaders are so sure that ""what got them here will get them there"" that they only want to listen to people who use the exact same kind of language, communication style, and ideas. 

2) The emperor has no clothes - This follows from #1 above. Leaders don't want to  listen to ideas from people who have gained expertise in other banks. They are rewarded for being generalists and lack depth of expertise - yet they do not want to leverage the people who do have that expertise, for fear they'll be overshadowed.

3) Lack of maturity in people leadership  -  Little weight is placed on the maturity of  people leadership skills and talent development, even at the executive levels. This leads to short-sighted org decisions, lack of investment in talent hired from the outside, and external hires at all levels feeling like they're not fully utilized or challenged.

4) Performance management - claims to be objective and transparent but is very susceptible to favoritism and disproportionately rewards loyalty above other factors. Old timers at the company heavily favor other old timers.

5) Cultural hubris - Only Capital One experience counts. Only Capital One has a ""high bar for talent"". Skills built at other institutions aren't recognized and made use of."

4141,Capital One,"A neutered, toothless house pet posing as a predator",2020-02-20,3.0,Senior Technology Manager,Great benefits. Most locations have a beautiful campus. Fantastic subsidized cafeterias with amazing food. Some very talented people (who will leave).,"Your experience will vary greatly based upon for what part of the company you work, and then even more so by your leadership team.

The company repeats ad nauseam that it is ""a tech company that just happens to operate in the financial services space"" -- saying it does not make it so. I've worked for many companies in my career; this is more like a Soviet-era, government-owned manufacturing company than anything else.

Organizationally, it is highly fragmented and lacks both vision and leadership. The various LOBs are so very siloed, and driven by their own goals and politics that serve the sole purpose of getting leaders fat bonused, that is nearly impossible to get anything meaningful done. Unless it is a Cyber remediation activity, then all of a sudden everyone is aligned -- and that's what a takes to get alignment.

The vetting/hiring process for Directors and above is a) do you have a friend here? and b) do you have a pulse? This means that the excruciatingly painful and laborious hoops of tests and interviews through which Senior Managers and below must go through are not equally applied; as such, you will undoubtedly encounter some absolutely terrible people in senior leadership roles that have no business being in such positions of authority.

Despite what the Capital One PR machine claims, it is ridiculously far from being an Agile organization. Small, sporadic pockets of something slightly resembling Agile exist within the company. I was very disappointed by encountering people (in leadership roles) who have only been with Capital insisting ""we're doing Agile"" [flag!] and who, when you thoughtfully challenge that inaccuracy, you're persona non grata for telling the Emporer that s/he has no clothes."

Benefits are excellent.
Campuses are nice and well maintained.","'Up-or-out' performance management process equates relative ranking to absolute ratings, e.g. if you are at the bottom of the curve relative to your peers, you go on a performance plan, even if you are doing on okay job.  And the 'bottom' is forced - the company demands a certain % be rated below-expectations.  Once on a plan, it is nearly impossible to get off, since you must 'climb over' someone(s) ahead of you on the curve.  Moreover, as a manager it's difficult to put someone on a plan who hasn't been there already, since they weren't properly warned of the possibility, making climbing out of a low rating even more difficult.   So people scramble to switch jobs before the performance period.   So many things can wrong with this approach, it leads to alot of wasted talent and hurts morale.  Most companies have recognized this issue and allowed managers more flexibility in how they rate their people; relative ranking (forced ranking) will always be there, but it need not automatically lead to forced meets/does not meet ratings."

They do not pay you more or incentivize your growing skillset, which is why they cannot retain top talent. Based on the current performance management rating system, the likelihood of you being promoted is 15%. Most are only promoted then they throw temper tantrums and threaten to leave... who wants to work like that? Also, the wage gap is real. That's why it is ""frowned upon"" to discuss what you make. If you're a female, it's pretty much guaranteed that your less qualified and lower performing male colleagues make 15-25% more than you do. As your skillset grows, leave Capital One. They do rarely offer compensation when moving across LOB's or departments. You lose money by ""growing within"" Capital One internally.

-basketballs courts

-bikes everywhere to get around campus
-a fedex office where you can get next day AM delivery on personal packages for about $6","Unfortunately, all of the above is meaningless because Capital One's performance management system is an unmitigated disaster. I could write a book about how horrible it is, but I'll try and condense everything below. (I WISH I KNEW THIS BEFORE I CAME TO CAP ONE. PLEASE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY)

1) At capital one there's an assumption that the level you came in at is the absolute highest that you could have, and once you start, nothing you did before capital one matters.

2) You will stay at your current level unless you kiss up to your manager because vertical movement at Cap One is seriously messed up. The ONLY WAY to get a role at a higher level is to get promoted by your current manager, which is very hard, or to find a role at the next level and humbly ask the posting manager if he/she would consider you for the role even if it's above your level. The posting manger will then snoop around and go to your current manager. If your manager doesn't tell this manager that you were on the promotion track you won't get the higher role. Period, end of story. You will not move up unless your current manager loves you. The assumption is that all movement is horizontal. Promotion is the only way up. (To get around this a lot of people leave the company and come back at higher levels. DO NOT come here lower than you think you're worth. It's not worth your time. Hold out for the higher role)

3) Your colleagues who've been with the company longer than you understand the culture and you will suffer because of it. They know that you're the sucker for trying to get stuff done while they spend all day brown nosing with your manager and accomplishing nothing. They will get promoted and rewarded at year end and you will get the ""inconsistent rating."" If you don't ""shape up"" and drink the kool-aid you will be pushed out. If your ""poor behavior"" continues you will be shown the door.

4) You get pushed out by being given this ""inconsistent"" rating that has no grounding in reality. When this happens you can't apply to any other roles until you've sufficiently kissed up to your manager who then raises your rating. Don't like brown nosing? Too bad, it's your only way out. Please direct yourself back to point #3. Really don't like brown nosing? Too too bad, direct yourself back to point #3 twice and then find the door. Try and fight your managers rating? Too bad, you're going to lose and then your manager is really really going to hate you. You're never getting out of inconsistent and we're beyond point #3 at this point. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

5) Influence not achievements, just remember that. ""Influence"" at cap one is simply ""justification for accomplishing nothing while still feeling good about oneself."" You can't make this stuff up. Try running  a department where every decision requires unanimous agreement from all stakeholders. Want to see how this works (or doesn't)? Work for Cap One.  Do you dare have an opinion? Please direct yourself back to point #3

6) Cap One is filled with managers who've been with the company since the earth cooled. They will force-feed you the kool-aid. Direct yourself back to point#3 if you have a conscience or morals.

7) Calibration... Oh I havent even gotten here yet and I'm already 7 points down. At end of year you're ranked amongst your peers and given a year end rating. Did you drink the kool-aid and were you buddy buddy with your manager? Congrats, you'll be fine. You're a high-strong to exceptional. Did you challenge the status quo and question unethical decisions made by peers and managers? Direct yourself to back to point #3 please. No, really, back to point #3. Cap One doesn't actually care about ""doing the right thing"" or ""acting ethically."" 

8) Ok i'm actually just getting started but I'll stop here. When in doubt, go back to point #3"

4193,Capital One,All that glitters... is not necessarily gold,2020-01-29,4.0,Software Engineer,"1. A very lax culture with a startup feel for being such a large company. Hours vary per team/manager, but it's usually around 9:30-4:30-- you never get the stink eye for coming late/leaving early.
2. Working remotely is heavily encouraged in situations that warrant it, such as being sick/house work/doctor's appointment/etc.
3. (Sort of a pro, sort of a con) Some managers are amazing-- and some are very lack luster. Thankfully, Capital One encourages movement around the company, so you don't have to be stuck in a position that you hate.","1. Capital One is growing far too fast for comfort. The parking situation is absolutely horrendous. If you're not in the office by 9:15, you're kind of screwed. It's sort of like a college campus-- lots of growth and 0 parking. The thing is, colleges have subsidies for/free public transit; Capital One has no such thing. The employees have been making a buzz about this issue for years with no response from the company.
2. Employees (specifically those brought in through the college grad program) are hired in flocks. This is okay on the surface, but the overcrowding situation is at a tipping point (some people don't even have desks!!) and it's looking more and more like Capital One hires these college grads as cheap labor. In general, the vetting process isn't the best-- it does a pretty good job most of the time, but every now and then you meet a person and think, ""who in the world interviewed you?""
3. As you've probably guessed, politics are major here. Playing the right cards, not necessarily doing great work, gets you promoted. Your manager alone is the one who pitches your competencies during review season. You can have 10 great things on your brag sheet, but if your manager has a vendetta against you/a favoritism for another employee, you're going to be torn down."

- Some really smart people","- Management doesn't understand basic Product techniques 

- Performance Management is forced distribution and is based on your manager's opinion (not your work or success or anything else you have done) of you. Your goals and performance are not usually even mentioned in calibrations. Your reviews are political and only people who play politics really well get promoted.

- Product at Capital One CC basically consists of people who are trained as Business Analysts being Product Managers without any training in most cases. In some cases, the people who ""train"" the analysts on Product are themselves former Business Analysts who also don't fully understand product. 

- Tech teams are evaluated on points completed

- While agile, design thinking, etc are talked about, those techniques are not followed. Agile is only used for tech teams (not the full process)."

- Regular fully-expensed trips to Nottingham.","Upon joining you quickly become mired in endless planning and scrum ceremonies, bookended by talks on numerous corporate initiatives.

Unworkable requirements are simply passed to teams from stakeholders in Nottingham who have remarkably little understanding of the teams in London. Inexperienced managers must then wrestle with these to try and eke out deliverables for stakeholders wedded to unrealistic deadlines.

The graduate scheme is large and there are a limited number of developers able to support them in their development, adding additional pressure on teams.

If you’re looking to grow as a developer I would simply avoid working here. Although Capital One does have good initiatives for learning and development, these can’t make up for the total lack of time spent actually building software."

Salary is OK and there is a lot of flexible working ability.","To me it feels that it is not a technology company. It is a credit card company using technology in their specific way to achieve their goals. There is nothing wrong with that statement. The question is whether you want to work in a highly bureaucratic technology team full of controls and checks where the main priority feels to be defensive which results to very slow cycles of work. The fact they use AWS is a great thing. The fact that there are processes requiring people to make requests and wait for days to be approved by various teams in various timezones is not great and makes people feel demoralised and frustrated. Privileges are locked down to the minimum which again makes work slow. All these may come down to regulations and rules of the industry.

Induction for new joiners is poor. A set of computer based training taking the first couple of days of the new joiner which feels so impersonal and dull for a fresh starter. Literally the first and only thing you do for days is to complete these trainings and create tens of requests for setting up access for your account. There are also 3 old-school induction days that take place in Nottingham where the offices have a restaurant, gym and it is next to the main train station."

Perhaps CEO's vision is great. Benefits are great.,"I experienced the worst ever leadership and management here in Canada Tech. The culture in capital one US is far better.  Leadership here has no clue how to handle situations. They keep passing on problems. Worst decision making ever.  They run a generic job description for recruitment and place people in any position that is open irrespective of matching skills. People are continuously leaving. Recruitment standards are pretty low. Make sure you discuss the role, responsibilities and your matching technology skill set before joining. They lure you with higher salary than market. Even if you have joined recently, fail fast, leave and find something better. Do not ruin your career here, not worth it. If you keep dragging on it would be too late. There are far better things to do elsewhere than working at Capital One Canada Tech.  Capital one Canada is just a bunch of people relying on what US gives them to work on. No place for innovation. They are harping on one single innovation that happened from Canada for very long time . Too many org changes too often leaving you gasping and play catch up game. They claim to be an Agile house but they are nowhere near. The circumstances will make you unlearn a lot, ruining your  hard earned knowledge and practical experience. There is no scope to apply agile practices. Serious Warning: Managers, Developers if you want to learn and grow and make a career, join a real tech company with good business model. If you join Capital One Canada, one day you will repent and say, if only I had taken right decision not to join this place."

It's a good place for fresh college grads but everyone else not the place to be.,"Frequent reorgs and top level management changes all through the year. I have had 4 reorgs in less than 3 years of being there. Whenever someone at the top leaves, management takes it as an opportunity to reorg the deck across the division. One of the most regressive performance management process I have seen which they take great pride in, it's done 4 times a year with no time for associates to focus on learning and development - it's deliver or out all the time but when you couple that with the frequent reorgs it's hard to settle in a role and deliver. Very short term focused managers. Managers are not interested in your development, they just need results to go after their promotion. They run quarterly survey on employees but managers are busy trying to figure out who gave bad ratings than focusing on how to improve morale. There is a lot of corporate marketing speak which is says and means two different things. Be prepared to just preparing atleast 100 slides a week, that's all there is to their work."

Leadership is terrible. They don't listen to their people. Performance management is super backwards. Nothing ever gets done. When something does get done, it's extremely slowly, and it's almost always a zero risk, tiny reward initiative. Risk tolerance is 0. All about making each other feel good and giving participation trophies - coaching is non existent as a result. You only find out what you can do better at twice a year. Good ideas are turned down because they're ""too hard"" or ""too much effort.""

Was hired for one role and, shortly after one month of my arrival, the role morphed into something that I was way overqualified for.  Instead of the ""team"" attitude, because people are forced ranked against each other, it was less ""I'll help you do this"" and more ""that's so and so's job."" That attitude leads to a lot of backstabbing and politics across the culture.  Told to just ""keep my head down"" and not ""rock the boat.""  At this point in my career (I've been working for 10 years in corporate America), I don't have time to just skate by and hope that I don't ruffle any feathers by sharing an unpopular opinion or offering a new way of doing things."

Great place to work since you have a lot of support, a good location for local food to grab for lunch, and awesome benefits. Managers will always work with you and help you improve your skills. Has a grill/cafeteria/deli which was always a cheap and healthy option for breakfast or lunch. Also, there is always room for advancement. Oh, and there was an onsite gym with a locker room and such so you can workout during break/lunch/before or after shift.",Parking could be a bit hard to get close to the building if you are in the later shifts (especially closing).

I had amazing managers that supported me and my career in my first couple years (but also had horrible, toxic managers that had no clue how to manage people later on.)","So much turnover and change in the 4 years I worked there.  My earlier years there were amazing but things went down the tubes in the last couple years with constant org changes and leadership changes.  Current leadership lacks vision and bullies people. Several issues with gender and racial bias happening from the top.  Promotions are based on favoritism. Lack of clear career growth and support. Underpays compared to bay area standards. Design is going through some real issues right now, It's really sad because the people and the work were so good, but the current  environment is unbearable."

They may have been decent at their jobs at the time that they were an associate, but that doesn't mean they're capable of connecting & leading a team of 20 agents. What you got was immaturity, politics, power-hungry type-A's.....and it created the most toxic atmosphere.  My last manager was a work-horse with the personality of a T800...he fostered unethical behavior to ramp up stats...was called out for it, but since the stats made him look good they promoted him to a PA overseeing an entire department. Execs came down once or twice a year and were given the red-carpet treatment by management who spent a  considerable amount of time covering up the truth and having them ONLY speak with agents who were glorified cheerleaders."

A very diverse company with lots of people from different backgrounds and many of women in senior positions.  A very positive company with incredibly passionate employees.,"I start at Capital One about 6 months before the big change last year. The move to the Branch Ambassador role has eliminated all traditional branch roles.  This makes progression opportunities difficult, as there is no clear route to take.  Formerly there were different levels of Banker, lead tellers/assistant managers etc., now we work in a sort of socialism where everyone is equal and no progression in bank .  Company is pushing towards a digitalized future with associates presently encouraging customers to DIY bank by using online apps and using ATMs over tellers etc.  This make the employee wonder where this leaves them after this transition complete.  Capital One claims to be a bank modelling itself as a tech company, but it is has many technology problems and too many software program to perform simple jobs.  Company focuses on feelings and emotions (values) more than address what customer wants."

the constant re-org of the technology org is comical; There's not a lot of tech talent at CapOne, they don't value it. They skew to hiring young employees who will work for less. They try to be entirely too 'hip' for a bank. Also, they have an identity crisis: they don't know if they're a technology or financial services company. They are trying to be both and not doing either particularly well."

From my experience, they have way too many software engineers, way too many cogs in a giant machine, and everything is too decentralized. Amazed that anything actually works, quite frankly. There was no vision, just myopic two week sprints, that were incredibly fast-paced. Hated the open layout concept. There are also too many H1B people working there, and they sometimes tended to group together and speak their own language. There was no strong sense of camaraderie among the team.

A false sense of values and culture that are promoted but not considered in-house, even with employee violating ethical and company moral along with multiple complaints to HR. Bonuses removed. No equal pay. Gender-biased. Tech outdated and do not implement innovated ideas or talent for solutions. Great place if you absolutely need somewhere to work but promotions revolve around company necessity, favoritism and not your performance, even if you are a high performer, and work above and beyond what is requested.

4710,Capital One,Ab initio Developer,2019-06-16,5.0,AB Initio Developer,"Satisfaction: The study showed that satisfaction is one of the most immediate benefits of an employee who fits well culturally at a company. If an employee finds their environment to be satisfactory, they are going to be happier working in that environment.
Increased Performance: That happiness is likely to lead to several motivators for the employee. Because they fit well, they’re likely to be more confident in their work and strive to work harder and achieve more. Because of a good fit, the employee will have an increase in his or her work performance, benefiting the company and the employee.
Reduced Stress: A big problem with a poor cultural fit at work is stress, affecting a number of areas in the employees life – from work performance to socializing with other employees. A good cultural fit means the employee will be less stressed at work, likely to reduce poor performance and turnover.
Reduced Attrition: If an employee is happy and fits where he or she is, they’re going to be less likely to want to change that. Finding candidates who will fit the culture of the workforce isn’t just ensuring that the candidate will just work hard – it likely means they’ll continue working hard and remaining committed to the company, with less motivation to leave.
Commitment to Company: Above all else, if an employee fits culturally to the company, he or she will identify that as part of their company experience. Therefore, they are more likely to remain committed to a company because they fit so well.","1. Injuries

- Smart and talented coworkers
- Free snacks and coffee
- Opportunity to work on some really cool AWS cloud projects.
- Lots of holidays and PTO","Capital One is very hierarchical and is a culture of management and meetings. As a developer, I've had 4 managers in my two years here. I've had quite a few engineering jobs, and this was by far the worst managed tech culture I've ever seen. Lots of managers who can't deal with challenge and would rather remove the people with big ideas and replace them with sycophants. 

This opportunity is best for managers and junior developers because they give juniors tasks that are way above their experience level, much to the frustration of senior engineers. They are having problems keeping senior developers around because promotions are very hard to come by and the opinions of senior talent is not respected. Chest puffing is more valued than actual work.

Ultimately, you have to enjoy working in a corporate environment. By that I mean, you have to know when to open and close your mouth and know what words to say. If you are competent and can play the political game, you will do very well here. If you are here to actually care about your work, then I would look elsewhere."

4814,Capital One,"Overall, a fantastic company, though not without some of the pitfalls that are typical of a F500",2019-04-30,4.0,Senior Business Analyst,"Disclaimer: My feedback is specific to the analyst development rotational program and general corporate strategy functions - cannot comment on the experiences of cross-functional staff (HR, IT, etc) and field employees (branch, call center, etc).

It's a truly impressive company that built itself out of nothing in the early 90's and is now a top-10 bank and respected brand in the corporate world. That stems from the leadership of the founder, Rich Fairbank, an ex-consultant who,  nearly 30 years later, remains closely involved in the company's direction.

I think there are three principles that characterize the company's core values, and each one accounts for both pros (outlined below) and cons (next section):

The first is its Information-based strategy - Capital One takes a fiercely-empirical approach to decision-making. This focus on data and powerful analytics is what enabled them to disrupt the credit card industry (a business where decisions are nearly all quantifiable) in the 90's and it is deeply ingrained in the culture. The company places a premium on analytical ability and conducts its interviews much like a consulting interview (cases, looks for quant skills on resumes, etc). As a result, the analyst ranks are filled with exceptionally intelligent graduates from the finest schools in the nation, and they typically go on to do impressive things in business. I think nearly every person in my analyst class who went on to business school ended up at a top-7 MBA program.

The second is the attitude towards people management, which is effectively to hire the best people you can and truly value them - provide them with all of the tools they need to be successful. Capital One really treats its employees well - respect for work-life balance, provides them with all the latest gadgets on the company dime, offers robust perks like an amazing gym/free personal training, on-site doctor care, subsidized meals cooked by professional chefs, etc. Capital One's corporate culture has way more in common with Google than it does with a Wells Fargo or B of A, its peers in the banking world.


They typically match MBB comp packages for the business analyst program, and you'll work wayyyy less than someone who takes a job with an MBB. 


The third is its sense of corporate responsibility and customer focus. Capital One used to have an unwarranted reputation as a predatory lender that made money off of lower-income customers' interest fees, but in retrospect I truly believe that a sense of accountability and loyalty to the customer permeates the majority of decision-making.","As with any large corporation, there is a heavy dose of politics. There are often people at the senior management level (think SVP and up) who seemed to have schmoozed their way up the ladder and wound up in over their head. However, most of the executives are indeed quite smart and worthy of their titles, so not a huge knock.

The analyst program pitches itself as primarily strategy-focused - essentially in-house consulting - but depending on where you are assigned to work in the company/who you are working for, the job responsibilities can be far less sexy (lots of coding).

The raw analytical horsepower that exists throughout the analyst job family (including management levels) does present a double-edged sword in that decisions can tend to be OVER-analyzed. Big data analysis lends itself well to the credit side of the house, but the banking business is way more brand- and relationship-driven, and applying heavy analytics to decisions on the banking side can occasionally feel like you are killing a mouse with an elephant gun.

The social events are pretty lame (probably due to both the nerdy culture as well as the crimped budgets of a huge corporation with public shareholders).  I remember one year, instead of a holiday party where most companies rent out a cool venue and everyone gets drunk, we had a holiday luncheon, in our office, with no booze, and just lame White Elephant gifts.

There's a ton of middle-management which means it's hard to make a big impact until you have climbed the corporate ladder significantly, which is why I left for a smaller consulting firm."

4825,Capital One,"Growth story is dead, layoffs common, do not work here if you have other options",2019-04-27,1.0,Business Analyst,The work-life balance can be good and PTO is generally easy to get. Salary is comfortable for the area I was in. The offices are new and nice. People are generally friendly.,"The biggest problem I have with Capital One as an employer is their pipe-dream vision of a digital transformation that often leads to massive employee layoffs. The most important fact you need to know is that the company's growth story is mostly dead; if you expect to catch a rising tide that will lift your career, I would look elsewhere. Historically speaking, Capital One is successful in only two areas of consumer finance - credit cards and auto lending, but there are very few growth opportunities remaining in these areas. The upmarket card business is overheated and is in an unsustainable rewards arms race that will likely blow up in the next recession (potentially forcing thousands of layoffs or possibly bankrupting the company).  Card Partnerships is a break-even venture at best that has seen massive layoffs over the past few years. While Capital One is successful in auto lending, there are virtually no growth opportunities available except perhaps in refinance, but that will likely start a price war with companies with cheaper costs of funds if it continues to expand, which could kill the auto finance business in short order. Capital One completely failed (to the tune of thousands of layoffs) in the mortgage and home equity businesses as well as in the brokerage business. The commercial business is marginally successful at best, and there are no realistic plans to expand internationally beyond their minuscule footprint in the U.K. It seems like the main strategy of upper management is to hope that their ""digital"" transformation will miraculously change these hard realities, and it's simply not true.

I don't mean to be bitter, and there was a time when I believed the half-baked ideas of upper management that they could benefit their customers while still maintaining a sustainable business that didn't consistently hurt employees that made that success possible. I changed my opinion when I saw thousands of people lose their jobs over and over again because of the culture of irresponsible and reckless expansions, which is symptomatic of a toxic corporate culture fueled by an arrogant and dangerous hope that Capital One's ""best"" people or digital innovation will exempt them from the harsh realities of running a profitable business. Moreover, virtually all of the executive hires (VP+) are ex-management consultants who often pitched these dangerous ideas at their old firms and paid no personal cost for the often disastrous results. Note that a lot of the people who hold high positions with just a bachelor's degree joined when the company was significantly smaller; almost everyone who does that now and doesn't relentlessly play politics (instead of focus on their skills and contributions to the company) gets stuck. I observed that almost all of the promotions happened in the handful of growth areas that still remain at the company, which are becoming smaller and smaller by the day."

4828,Capital One,False Advertising,2019-04-25,1.0,Data Scientist,Flexible work hours and convenient downtown location.,"3 out of the 60 DS actually do work that resembles industry standard DS work. These are the folks that are sent to public and recruiting events to make it sound like we all do real DS work. Don't be fooled! 

Most of the business leaders do not know what DS resources are or how to use them. They think Data Scientists' core job is to write SQL scripts for business analysts and process managers for ""controls"". Instead of investing in proper tech resources and fixing processes, leaders choose to use Data Science resources to write SQL script based ""controls"" designed by business stake holders who know nothing about data or SQL. You don't think you will be writing SQL scripts for data pulling when you sign up for a job description that throws out AI Machine Learning and PhD requirements. It's outright outrageous false advertisement. 

There are frequent breakdowns in processes that impact our customers. The in-house euphemism for this is a ""risk event"". Data Science resources are used regularly to fix these risk events by adhoc query writing to pull data for process manager who were not able run their processes properly. 

No wonder more than a dozen data scientists have left the company in the last few months. Turn over is insanely high. The gave every DS a big fat raise recently hoping to stop the bleeding. Did not help... 

The kind of problems the business is trying to solve do not require data science, machine learning or even basic statistics. Just some reliable data and SQL developers / Data Analysts would be more than sufficient."

Good work/life balance","-It is NOT a tech company. It is a BANK. The culture of a bank. The office politics of a bank. The boring routine work of a bank. The tech branding is misleading. Most of the technology stack is old with a shy use of modern technologies. Toronto studio relies heavily on the US studio to deliver any new feature or product. As a developer,  you inherit mostly everything built by the US teams and you adapt it to fit the Canadian market. Your work becomes mostly maintenance  and bug fixing.
-Some Product managers/owners can be mean and bullies. They can be very conservative and lack any vision and creativity. They are not interested in enhancing or modernizing their products. Unfortunately, they drive technology and as a result, developers do not get the chance to work on exciting new and modern technologies.
-The worst culture ever.  Some developers are toxic; having the culture of hiding information from you so you don't perform better. Managers are bullies and passive aggressive. You have to suck up to them, but if you try to challenge the status quo,  you could end up without a manager and without a team! Scrum masters do not even attend the meetings they set up for their teams, and most of the time they are useless. They are always overwritten by the managers and as a result, lots of clash and unsettling situations.
- Performance management and review process is utterly impersonal, de-motivating and ineffective. It doesn't measure your performance or your creativity. It just forces you to be submissive if you want to get a good review from your manager. It is a tool to control you and not to enable you! It measures how much you delivered even if there was nothing to deliver!"

All other employees are then compared to the ones who received Meets Expectations to determine if they get a better or worse rating. The downside to this is if you have a manager who does not argue your case well, then you may not get as high of a rating as another person who has a manager that can make a good case. And as stated above, this rating will determine your raise and bonus, if applicable."

4890,Capital One,Avoid working at this company,2019-03-27,1.0,Principal Analyst,"Pretty decent pay and benefits, 401k match and ASP
Very nice office, Starbucks in the lobby","It's been over a year since I left Capital One to work for myself and it is the best career move I have made.

Looking at some of these recent reviews, I'm not at all surprised.  They are all true with the exception of the allegations of racism.   I have never personally witnessed overt racism and/or biased hiring and promotions based on race.  It's a pretty diverse crowd that works there, although I cannot say with absolute certainty that racism never happened.  I have heard employees say that people who take time off for maternity leave don't get promoted though.

What I can say is that the cross cal essentially guarantees people to lie, cheat, and back-stab.  It is a very toxic environment.  There is little incentive to cooperate on projects bc everyone is trying to avoid the category 4 (incomplete) rating at the end of the year.  I have literally had people not answer my questions and say ""I know how to solve this but I'm not going to tell you bc we are competing against each other.""

The work that I did was presented to top management but they did not acknowledge my contributions.  My boss instead took credit for my work and I was given a bad review at the end of the year bc other associates ""performed better"".  So visibility matters more than the actual work that was done.  

This also results in a structure where there a small group of yes-men (and women) at the top with huge egos go on power trips and a very high turnover rate amongst the vast majority of their subordinates.  Bc the interview process is quite intense, talented analysts generally leave after a year or 2 for better jobs.

Similar to some of the other comments here, when I confronted my boss he said there were ""leadership and communication"" issues.  Those 2 things are very vague and can obviously be applied to anyone in any situation.

Our team had the lowest employee satisfaction survey results literally in the entire company.  My boss threatened me if I did not give them good results he would fire me.  But instead of giving in to his threats, I simply quit my job.  I notified HR of this issue and about 3 months after I had already quit they wrote me an email that simply said they had ""addressed"" the issue with no further comment."

However, once you get used to wearing jeans, using a MacBook Pro, and standing at your desk, you’ll start to realize the disastrous decision you made to join this place.","Capital One Canada is a toxic workplace filled with passive-aggressive, hypocritical, egotistical, and pathological liars.


In general, it’s filled with a few types of people- 
1- People that want to wear jeans to work and say they work in an “agile” open-office environment, but aren’t capable or smart enough to work at a real technology company.
2- Entitled and spoiled fresh university grads that are paid well above market rate to sell their souls to a successful American company with a dying Canadian division. (These people are half your age with a quarter of the experience, but they passed an antiquated business case interview, therefore they’ll be your manager).
3- People that have been there for years, and can’t work anywhere else because they’re now incapable of delivering real value to an actual company that cares about growing in Canada.
4- American or British “expats” on lucrative packages to come in, run the Canadian division into the ground, and crush the spirits of every Canadian working there."

Many talented, smart colleagues - you work with motivated individuals who are trying to do more with their careers can just cash a check. 

Committed to employee satisfaction - employee satisfaction surveys are taken very seriously and management is expected to have action plans to address areas of opportunity. The company invests in facilities, benefits and other perks to make associates experience as enjoyable as possible. 

Tremendous quality internal training - particularly useful for exempt level employees. If you take advantage, you can learn things you will use your entire career. 

Endless opportunities - many associates can make career changes within the company and/or generally find jobs in whatever geographic area they want to live.","Performance management - associates in the same job level are ranked against each other by management. The perception is politics can have a significant influence on your rating. It can be particularly difficult for higher performing associates, who are not skilled at corporate politics, to receive higher ratings.

- If you're in an org with a decent budget, you can be relatively flagrant with your corporate card use.","- The SF office feels like a ghost town. Less than half of the staff we had a couple years ago is still there.
- Top-down decisions from upper management often don't take into consideration how their actions will affect the teams.
- It is highly likely that you will work on something for months and months and it will never ship.
- Pay is low, relative to the area.
- Stack ranking. Performance review with forced distributions makes it impossible for everyone to be fairly assessed. Teams with sometimes orthogonal skillsets are calibrated against each other, and managers are forced to fight each other for who gets a promotion.
- Constant churn. Reorgs are neverending. Building a team and getting into a rhythm are nearly impossible when everyone is constantly shifted around.
- The SF office is consistently told they are essential to the company's strategy, but very few actions have backed this up. All the power is entirely on the east coast.
- It's very much the norm for people to be referred to as ""resources"". This mentality is apparent in how big decisions are made and communicated."

The company only cares about you if you are located in certain areas of the country, those locations with the greatest perks shows you who they care about and want to be.
Upper management tends to think down on the rank and file employee and seems to only say things to quite the masses but not deliver on those promises."

Some scheduling flexibility but this could be better improved.  People brag and overrate the schedule flexibility when in actuality it is super rigid.","The management team and dated Performance management process tries their best to find faults.  Good performance is rarely celebrated.  For example, you can have 30 good  calls and you have 5 customers who compliment you through a survey and give you a 5 star rating but then if out of the 30, one customer may have a so so rating and give you a 2 out of 5 star and not recommend Capital One, the one bad rating will negatively impact your overall score in a huge way. The worst part is that the detractor may not even be your fault and  they may give a  bad rating primarily because the company does not meet the customer's needs e.g. lower interest rate or bonus rewards for long time customers.    
Management also tries their best to find fault with your calls as much as they can.  Every time I see customer surveys I get 5 star rating, and even got Celebrations from Promoters and yet one or two calls that didn't go so well you get bad errors that count against you getting any future promotions, raises or even job transfer to a different dept.

- Decent benefits","First of all, I'm not sure how Capital One has so many positive reviews on Glassdoor. There has to be many fake reviews here. In my six years working there I didn't know anyone (at least in Retail Bank IT) who was really happy about working there. Most were absolutely miserable. On one hand, Capital One gave me a lot of experience and exposure to things I wouldn't have encountered otherwise. On the other hand, Capital One caused incredible stress to my life because of their morally bankrupt performance management, politics, dishonest and cowardly management, and constant turnover.

If you are considering working there, understand one thing....you are a number on paper. That is it. If management feels that you are not helping their agenda (if anyone even knows what it is), they will push you out by ignoring you and your work, lying about your performance, and finally firing you (they call this ""redeployment"" to make it sound less serious).  In my last year there, I worked extremely hard to go above and beyond every objective assigned to me, only to have my current manager do a pathetic job at presenting me to the performance management calibrations, which by the way, are based on the opinions of other managers who don't necessarily know anything about what you are working on. It was then I knew it was time for me to go. The whole system is not just ridiculous and absurd, it's immoral.  It is a system designed for upper management to empower ""yes men"" managers to control hiring/firing.

Capital One is extremely political. I even had a co-worker tell me that to be successful there I should focus more on being visible than my actual work. Believe it or not he was right. Thankfully I found a much smaller company where I don't have to put up with all the nonsense and be rewarded for my actual work. It's absolutely wonderful. If that's what you are looking for, stay far away from Capital One. However, if you are an outgoing person with above average job skills who is good at politics, you'll probably excel.

Make no mistake, Capital One is one of the best companies I've ever seen at marketing a spotless image to the outside public, but on the inside, it is toxic, although it will take new hires a while to pick up on this."

You can talk like, I can create a diamond from the air, and talk it loud and talk the same, though that is not possible in real and you will be recognized.  Ineffective game-players can get a better rating than people who work hard and dedicated.  And they might put you in coaching plan, if you are in the lower bucket, learn how to make a diamond from the air. And if your manager doesn't like you, because you don't go every day and say good morning, then you are in bad luck. People may smile at you all the time, but they will not hesitate to give bad feedback for the mistake you have not done which might be interpreted as you did it. One of my friend told one day... ""here snakes are everywhere"", which makes perfect sense. If you want to work in a friendly environment, where people treat each other in (not fake)compassion, this is not the place.

Work from home",Not the company it used to be.  Senior Management in certain departments needs to be overhauled. Some departments let you work from home while others frown upon it.  You can be told that you can work from home due to lack of space but when you do you are then reprimanded for not being seen (basically out of sight out of mind). They are famous for getting rid of folks 45 and over so word of advice to those in that age group is to start looking for another job before they decide to let you go.  Forced distribution in performance management is a joke. If your manager doesn't like you or fight for you then you will be the one at the bottom. Lots of fake people so be careful who you befriend and who you think you can trust.

Lots of in-house learning and collaboration opportunities. Mostly very nice people to work with, and a pretty diverse workforce.","It can be hard to take advantage of some learning opportunities or participate in innovations because so many projects are under high-pressure deadlines set be senior management. The company uses Agile methods but does not really buy into the real Agile approach of giving teams a prioritized backlog and letting them define release scope and dates. Instead, whole systems have to be built, migrated, etc., by hard deadlines and the teams have to figure it out. Teams or trains can't easily grow and get people up to speed, so instead directors crack the whip, requiring lots of extra hours and weekend work. Teams are rewarded, but they can't really complain; many teams are mostly contractors and have no feedback power.  Directors say they are empowering their people, but then won't negotiate scope or deadlines. 
The forced distribution performance management process is still in place and creates a negative atmosphere among peers who are in a team environment but are also in an un-acknowledged competition for their jobs against each other. Who will come out on the bottom each year is a matter of constant concern, and relief when it's not you. 
The CEO is a wonderful person who sets inspiring visions, but I am told he is a big proponent of forced distribution. Also, when he sets an audacious goal, this is what sends the rest of senior management into overdrive on crazy deadlines."

No point working an office job here - you can make $25/hour answering phones at the call centre, and at least you wouldn't have to deal with the corporate bullies and fake personalities.","-Worst people and worst management I have ever worked with. Manager+ level employees who don't know the core, basic job responsibilities for their function. How can you justify paying these people 6 figures to do absolutely nothing but delegate and go for ""coffee and chats""? How ironic is it that a financial company can't even manage their own department budgets effectively.
-Discriminatory hiring practices. This entire company caters to hiring young, new graduates and will turn a blind eye to your application if you're over 40. And trust me, if you're not white, you will not grow here. Shred your resume/delete your application now before going through their useless 4-5 round interviews.
-Promises one kind of an experience to customers but delivers the opposite. Similarly, they promise one type of employee experience and deliver the opposite. They preach about being on all sorts of ""great places to work"" lists but have the most inappropriate, unethical culture you'll ever encounter. Bad behaviour becomes justified for survival, and it even gets rewarded. This is how their leadership team is filled with incompetent ""lifers"". All of this causes their staff to be stressed, lazy and uncommitted - simply staying for their overpriced pay check, or even better, going on disability leave.
-If you're not with the ""it crowd"" or a threat to your boss, they WILL find a reason to dismiss you, whether it's justified or not. HR IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. Keep your problems to yourself, and whatever you do, don't share them with employee relations."

Lots of food and snacks

Working with very smart colleagues encourage you to challenge yourself and think outside the box

Benefits (time off, paternity/maternity leave, sick time, wfh) are pretty good, except for medical - copayments are too high or you pay too much per month to avoid those astronomical copayments.","1. Never trust what your manager says at face value. Always send meeting notes after each meeting as they insist on having conference calls vs written documentation to play the 'he said, she said' game. 
When there is a clear lie, they claim to have a 'miscommunication' and the employee might have 'misunderstood what his/her supervisor said'

2.  Performance management - rating your employees against each other is creating a civil war to survive. 

3. Personality, gender, race and position matters - if you are an introvert, female, not white and a position and/or team that are deemed as ""non-essential"", you will be first in the list to be discarded when there is a re-org.

4. It is basically a big high school run by ""popular"" people, Capital One is *huge* on politics. If you do not play that game, you are toast.

5. Your future and advancement in this company depends on your supervisor. If you are not his/her favorite, watch out.

6. More on performance review - there are no clear standards on what is expected of you in your role. It depends on which LOB you are in,  the team you are part of and unknown expectations of the current VP of your department. 

7. Perceptions are everything, actual results mean nothing. Your performance is measured based on reviews by your team members and colleagues. If somebody does not like you because they just don't or because you are doing your job and they do not like being called out, it is a red X in your credibility. Recovering from that is pretty much impossible.

8. Directors are too involved in the individual team dynamics. They use their authority to override roles, responsibilities and impose their wishes. You do what they ask for blindly or you will be in trouble, despite forcing you to go against the responsibilities of your role.

9. Lack of accountability in management for their decisions. If something goes wrong, they will blame someone else for the lack of results in order to avoid the blame and consequences.

10. Recognition for a job well done depends on what kind of project you are allocated to. 
If it is a ""we need to work on it to survive in the industry"", forget about it. You will be taken for granted.
If it is ""we are working on it to differentiate ourselves and break new grounds in the industry"", you will be the star, no matter how well or bad the project is moving along.

11. 2-4 reorgs a year are clearly not needed as they create chaos. It takes months to recover from a reorg and then a new reorg is announced.

12. Employees can be treated like thieves when they are let go. There is no need to have a security guard shadow a good standing respectful employee when he/she is let go - while the employee cleans his/her desk, returns the laptop and badge and is walked out the door- No, it did not happen to me, I know what you are thinking ;) 
Treat people with respect."

Senior management is always feeling a need to ""make their mark"" on the org, and as such demand regular sweeping changes to the way things are done.  God forbid someone does a great job but doesn't consistently innovate - that's a recipe for dismissal.

Additionally, hiring practices have become a circus.

Not stressful, deadlines are flexible.

Pay is good if not particularly high.

C1 in SF is a great place to park yourself and make a steady income without having to really care about what you're doing.  In fact caring is a detriment, just do what you're told and you'll be fine.","It's not a tech company, it's a bank.  Computers and network are locked down, it's difficult to be productive.  I waste more time fighting IT than I waste in meetings!  I've worked at other big enterprises in the past, C1 is by far the worst.

Boring busywork.  Why are we doing any of this again? My team built something that literally made the website significantly slower in order to enable features that no one used. I tried to discuss this but it was made clear to me that was outside of my role and I should just focus on the tasks I was assigned.

You definitely feel the fact that this is a satellite office (I'm in San Francisco).  We are many layers removed from actual decision makers, and hear anything important via rampant rumors before anyone in management tells us what's going on. On that note, plenty of reorgs, shuffling priorities, and elimination of budget. Even with a strong performance review I got pushed from a team I liked to a team I hate because the budget for the team was slashed by 70%.

The stack-ranking system seems to be universally hated by managers and ICs and even the directors I've talked with.  It's pretty brutal."

5278,Capital One,HR will run this company into the ground,2018-10-22,2.0,Consulting,"- CapitalOne US is great, Canada - not really!
- $$$. Clueless Hiring Managers + Recruiters end up offering most salaries (as long as we're in line with the higher US salaries!) at around 80 p - that is 30% above market. If you get an offer as an experienced hire, go high and they will likely give it to you because they dont know what theyre doing. Youll need it too, because unless youre willing to join the long human centipede of people s**king each other off, you wont really get promoted and will quickly fall behind 
- Young workforce: can be a fun environment, One word of warning: everyone is sleeping with everyone else at this place.
- Great place to get your feet wet for a year and a half and bounce, because unless you're part of the special club, you are unlikely to advance at the company.","- Shady HR practices: this HR department is incomparable. I have always had great disdain for HR people - but the group here takes the cake. Recruitment is the worst, but then it continues on through to Leadership, who are typically doing nothing more than spewing sound bites from articles they read on Linkedin about the latest ""trend"" - all without any actual knowledge behind any of what they're saying
- Lord of the Flies culture: someone doesnt like you or perceives you as a threat? Get ready to be manipulated and lied about behind your back so that the backstabber can get ahead
- Delegate delegate delegate. The minions sitting at the top keep distributing work down to the ones underneath, and they all work mindlessly towards arbitrary goals that go nowhere - because there is really no accountability save for when people are souping up their performance assessments for promotion calibration - the best blow(out) gets the biggest promotion!
- In a nutshell - pretty toxic a workplace. Do yourself a favor and go to a real tech firm"

Managers work at multiple branches now and will have you travel to the branches they manage to help out staffing without paying you for travel or as a multi-branch ambassador despite you working outside your home branch. Systems are down every other day.

Learn new technologies to put in your resume and use this place as your stepping stone.,"1. Work pressure. No work life balance. Managers tell you that you should not work after 5 PM. But on the other hand, you have unrealistic deadlines. Agile is out of picture. Work is taken in chunks and divided into sprints. PO says “we have to deliver this in this many sprints”. In office hours, we have tons of meetings and no room for actual work. This leaves no choice and you end up working from home after office hours.
2. Office politics - corruption, bias, favoritism at its peak.
3. Incompetent managers and peers who are waiting for you to finish your work and then steal it and showcase as their own piece of art. After work is done, manager will say you didn’t do anything great. You are hired to do this. Everyone else is doing the same. What are you doing extra??
4. No freedom to be yourself - just pretend you like Capital one in front of your manager. 
5. Team work vs individual performance management - all year, mobbing is enforced and people who want to take up something on their own are blamed in the retrospectives. At the end of year, no one knows who did the actual work. Only manager’s favorite guy gets the promotion. The least favorite might even end up losing their job.

Working really hard isnt enough, you have to be constantly talking your successes up to the right people which can get tiring and uncomfortable. Despite an amazing location, the London Office has very little energy, it feels like we are a satellite office for Nottingham, where all the decisions are made and majority of leadership are based.

5413,Capital One,Trying to be a tech company,2018-09-02,3.0,Lead Software Engineer,"Capital One is a great place to work with if you are an Individual Contributor under the Manager level. The teams are very agile, and independent

Great place to be if you are young","Directors and Sr Directors have a lot of power and freedom, and more or less define the culture for their areas. The worst thing to do at Capital One is butt heads with a Director. VPs/SVPs usually do not prescribe how Directors and Sr Directors should run the organization. So, if you have a problem with a Director, going skip level usually doesn't help.

Re-orgs happen all the time at the management level. This is good in the sense that managers at Capital One do not have a ""king of the hill"" mentality. However, the flip side is that this has lead to a cliques in the management layer. When a re-org happens, managers jockey to get themselves into better positions, and the way managers do this is by aligning themselves with people of influence. So, the end result is that there are these cliques built up around people with influence. Your growth in the company depends on your ability to stay in a clique and your clique being succesful

The company says that it's a tech company, but product has a lot more influence than tech. Engineers are more or less expected to do what POs tell them. 

Ageism is rampant. Capital One uses stack ranking to rank employees. This means that they have to flag 12% of employees as ""underperforming"", no matter what their actual performance is. Underperforming employees are put on a Performance improvement plan. Somehow, underperforming employees tend to be older than the average. ANd once they leave after being frustrated, the position gets filled by a TDP. TDPs are Capital One's term for fresh hires from college

Theoretically, there is a path for Individual Contributors to grow to VP level without going into people management. However, I have never seen any IC who has grown beyond Director. The only Director-IC that I have seen spent 20 years in the company to get to Director. Sure, there are ICs at VP level at Capital One, but they are all hired from outside. Practically, once an IC gets to Sr Manager level, the only way they can grow is by playing the same political game that everyone else plays"

5422,Capital One,Beware when Interviewing with Capital One,2018-08-29,2.0,Software Engineer,"The company benefits are competitive. The tech culture needs a lot of work: even though Rich Fairbank spends a great deal of effort in pitching his grand vision, the actual execution falls short in the hands of middle managers, who are way too consumed with their promotions and personal agendas. So while the grand vision CapOne tries to sell is enticing, be VERY CAREFUL with the group that you're joining--because what is a Pro at a high level may just be a mirage.","All the cons mentioned before this post are true: the year-end review process is painfully frustrating, the middle managers exercise a subtle (some times blatant) form of favoritism, the geographical/office politics amongst Virginia offices against non-Virginia offices is petty to a fault, and Human Resource department pretty much sides with management all the time (in many ways, reminds me of Uber's public relations debacle).

Please be very skeptical when interviewing with Capital One and make sure to ask yourself if you're willing to play advanced office politics. Things are particularly bad in Commercial, which is far from Consumer Retail (the poster child of CapOne recruiting)."

-Office facilities are good. Some buildings have height adjustable desks
-Celebrations and parties time to time
-Technically Innovative 
-Training
- Good benefits
-Recognition awards if your SM is playing politics well","-Hyper political environment, favoritism is rampant. 
-Telugu vs others politics. Chances to succeed in the company depends on which group you land into. If you don't speak their regional language, doesn't matter how good you perform or deliver, your contribution won't be acknowledged, someone else will take credit of your work and you will be given a bad rating.
Because of this, you can see some very talented people leaving or made to leave but also some zero talent, no in-demand skills people holding their position for years.
- All big talks but very low on action HR, whic is mostly absent, unless it is recruitment or firing. One of the SM's openly in a forum said: "" I don't care about diversity"". A number of times he displayed racist behavior and used to yell, humiliate team members in front of others but have been in the company for decades. It is not just one case, there are others like him.
- Senior Managers have too much power and there is no way to provide feedback about them to HR or anyone else. So, if you end up with a bad or a biased SM especially if he has the backing of the director, they can make your life hell.
- Performance evaluation system is the worst in the industry. It is not based on what you delivered, or as value to the company. It encourages animosity between teams and associates. If a particular group has any kind of feelings or grudge towards you based on some politics or bias, you are a toast. It's a shouting game or better an open fist fight where all the SM's in a room have to fight amongst each other to get a rating for their resources and declare the other team resources as bad and incompetent. Obviously, the loudest voice with blessings from a powerful director wins here. Imagine the case where your SM doesn't have a director? you will be beaten up from all the directions because there is not one above the chain to cover you up. It has happened to me.
- Technically confused. CapOne is going through a phase where it is confused if it is a bank or a technology company, it is thinking of itself as an IT service company, trying a number of things with no clear vision. 
- The company in the past couple of years have adopted the strategy to get rid of experienced resources and have been recruiting cheaper out of the college interns. It also stopped offering any kind of immigration visa sponsorship 2 years back."

5445,Capital One,The changes,2018-08-22,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Capital One makes sure that you embrace the company culture by making sure that everyone completes the required training, so you are ready to present options to the consumer.

Work/life balance exists but it depends on  which department you work in.

Benefits are great if you are a FT employee, but non existent if you are a PT.","To get promoted, you must be the best brown noser around ESPECIALLY if you work at the branch level. As the company is changing the structure as far as positions at the branch level i.e. branch ambassador & market manager or cafe coach - you will be required to multitask. The training that a banker will get in a period of 3 months, is given to a teller in a span of 3 weeks and they are expected to learn this quick.

Since at the branch level employees are forced to present the most up to date product i.e. the infamous 360 accounts customers are left frustrated because the company is losing its personal touch. 

Company moved away from mortgage lending, but today (due to the complains) they have come up with a bandaid to tackle that issue called lend one 

There were a few massive layoffs that affected hundreds of people and they did it over the span of a weekend .. and these employees were let go regardless of tenure or performance there was the case where an employee was months away from retirement and they let her go. Another that was promised that she wont be affected by the changes and she was part of the group of managers impacted.

So your job isnt secured at capital one even if you were a stellar employee.

They also said to impacted employees to apply within the company, but the managers of the department needing people dont call at all and you just simply get an email saying ""it was nice learning about you ..."" and they never reached out to the person 🤔🤔"

• Decent 401k match, health/dental/vision
• Lots of empowerment when it comes to leading the work
• Impactful work – everyone genuinely come in quite motivated

If you land yourself with a good team, you can find Capital One to be quite amazing.","After making it onto the list of top companies to work for, we saw our budget, snacks, and office perks pretty much cut overnight. 

NY office saw one snack each day disappear and never restocked again. We went from fully stocked draws to pretty much nothing but Reeses cups. Some of the Virginia offices saw snacks completely disappear. 

What kind of company advertise themselves as a 'tech company' without free food?

Meeting rooms have become non existent as senior leadership began making their own personal offices. 

Management have become less and less visible, and the new hires have become more and more like those of traditional / irrelevant companies. The once young and fresh vibe is disappearing, and the company is now filled with people who came from failed startups and places like Barnes and Nobles. 

Capital One just can't compete with new tech talent, and they simply cannot offer high enough compensation. 

Educational benefits are lost, and promotions feels incredibly biased. 

Individual contributor work is not recognized. There is lots of talk about doing things but nothing ever gets done. Bureaucracy is endless and only getting worst as we bring in the more older and traditional way of management. 

Work culture can be a hit or miss. You can work late or you can have nothing to do at all. Two years ago, Capital One had an amazing work life balance. Today, not so much. Vacations are tracked like hawks and you cannot take a vacation without somebody calling your personal phone. 

The moral is extremely low. People are dropping like flies, and there haven't been a single day without another 'Goodbye' email."

Performance management seems to be based more on who knows you versus what you have done.  It can be difficult to get things done because there are so many processes, reviews, approvals, and rules that you have to jump through in order to do actual work.  Some of the automation seems to cause more headaches than it has helped to make the job easier.  Things change constantly and it can be difficult to keep track of the latest method to do something is.  Attending conventions can be difficult or impossible due to limited numbers of individuals being approved to attend.   Mandatory CBTs are required on a quarterly basis for compliance reasons, but CBTs are not always appropriately targeted based on job roles, so you will most likely have to complete one or more CBTs that have nothing to do with your job.

You can work here for 30+ years, it makes no difference they will throw you out the door without any empathy. I was just fired because 'my position was eliminated' and am sick to my stomach.

- Not much micromanagement being a large company","- Competition at the manager and above level can be brutal, which leads to a trickle-down effect. Culture can change on a dime within towers and teams, managers turnover every few months. 
- Performance management system - they are committed to the bell curve model. it makes for a really unhappy and tense environment around performance management and review cycles.
- Luck of the draw - your fortunes depend largely on what team or manager you are aligned to. The promotions go to those on the eye-catching teams with projects that are aligned upper management's current hot issues.
-  Politics - Internal politics are always something to watch out for, but even national politics come into play - the company's messaging aligns to democrat/left wing agendas. Diversity in hiring is talked about in literally every single meeting. There are constant diversity seminars and videos and media which you are encouraged (read: required) to watch and agree with for fear of incurring Big Brother's wrath.

5746,Capital One,Potential to be great if they can get past the many little fiefdoms,2018-05-16,3.0,Vice President Treasury Management,"Very innovative.  For most of my 9 years with Cap One, it felt more like being part of a large tech company than a bank.  I enjoyed having the flexibility to switch roles on my terms.  The IT teams work almost exclusively in agile pods, so new projects are always right around the corner.  And they are starting to see the benefit of bringing big data and AI into finance.  
The benefits and salary are on par with other industry players.
Severance package was well done and helped my family during my transition to a direct competitor.","Commercial Banking is a mess.  Mike Slocum is a strong and supportive leader, but his upper and middle management team are sharks.  Moving  to the Treasury product team from the commercial IT dept felt like going from a great big supportive family to a Colosseum full of gladiators.  Within a year, the newly hired head of Product fired almost the entire department (many with over 25 yrs of experience)  before leaving himself.
Reviews and ratings are a cruel joke.  You can pour yourself out working 18 hour days to keep systems up and running, to minimize client impact, to develop new processes--but in the end you'll still end up with a 'meets expectations' rating unless you are working on one of the super shiny new pet projects of the day.  The whole cross-calibration process is ridiculously subjective and supports those managers who can ""make the most noise"".
Also, the reorgs are comical.  I had 4 different managers in 2 years.  None of them managed me long enough to advocate effectively for me in my cross-cals.  And that has a dramatic impact on your bonus."

Top sellers: Great Benefits, Awesome Vision, and a  Really Open Forward Thinking Company. It's always featured as a Best Place to Work. I'm confident Capital One will win out and become the best in the Finance industry... barring some outsider tech disruption or economic downturn.","I am not personally challenged by the work. Though the company's pay, benefits, and general atmosphere are great in the short term I am not as fulfilled working here.

Given that the company's current vision is geared toward capitalizing on advances in tech to be the future of the company, I don't believe they will have much use for many front-line associates in 5-7 years. I'd define front line associates as the many lower paid positions within the company who handle tasks like talking to customers and handling account info.  

The one thing that causes discomfort is when you realize how much resources this company can use to keep you entertained and happy with extra peripheral stuff. This definitely isn't bad perse, but many of us associates don't like the feeling of being bought when the sentiment sinks in.

Overall though this company is doing 1000% better than others, so in comparison to any other employee who is working a somewhat unfulfilling job, Capital One will have you beat 99/100."

1.

2. The people - tied closely to the culture, this a big team who really rallies together for the sake of our customers; I've learned so much from my peers, team, managers, and leaders over the years: everything from tactical skills, to being an effective leader

3. The resiliency: the company has been growing a lot and with that comes a lot of change; the leadership team is not afraid to make bold transformations to meet the needs of the market and keep up with the industry; it's been a great experience being part of such big changes and watching them unfold over the years.","Of course, no place is perfect. 

At the end of the day, this is a big organization and with that comes  a little bit of difficulty in getting things done. It's definitely not as bad as other big organizations - specially in the financial industry - and it's something we are working to resolve. It does get better the more we try!"

-Decent corporate culture","-Tuition reimbursement plan is pretty poor--seriously, Taco Bell pays up front and more per calendar year. Taco Bell.
-Management plays musical chairs every year leaving employees without a lot of direction until new management establishes goals and plans.
-Very evident that they take much advantage of the H1B Visa program to hire/underpay many foreign workers.
-Performance review process is poor, making managers fight for why their employee is better, and when added with musical management, I've had years where I've been reviewed by a manager I had for only two months of the previous year. Or have been reviewed by a manager who is no longer my manager--why would he fight for me?
-Benefits aren't anything special. 
-Raises are tiny when you are anywhere near the salary cap for your position. Salary cap isn't floated with cost of living.
-Social events (eg employee appreciate parties) are pretty poor. Related perks (eg they sponsor lots of stadiums) are pretty non-existent.
-Not lots of opportunities for promotion within."

Yikes - stay away!  This was such a shock - this was my second job and my previous company had been wonderfully supportive of women, so this was just so weird to me.   I was specifically told to hang back, not speak in meetings, not take initiative, etc.   When I had the experience, creativity, and intelligence to really make a difference.

Cliques are they way of the land and if you're not in one, you will become the scapegoat and management will rate you at the bottom.

Forced ranking is horrible.  They want to encourage ""thinking outside of the box"" but not to the point of out shinning the favorite.  Projects that can help you rank higher are not awarded fairly, as usually the management's favorite or close friends usually end up with the projects.  There is no opportunity for process improvement and implementing new ideas in the work environment.  New and innovative thinking is not encouraged.

2)  you are expected to choose a side. If you don't you will be bullied by all sides and their minions
3) objective criteria for performance measurement are a smokescreen. It all comes down to your loyalty to one or the other manager
4) a call center like environment ( capital one is new to the business card space). You will be able to tell based on the type of metrics used to judge performance. Primarily scorecard based risk assesment as opposed to a more sophisticated approach that considers client financials and industry
5) Antiquated technology, which is surprising for a company that prides itself on being ahead in tech
6) the type of work can easily be automated, so I don't see long term job security
7) You will be offered a job saying that there will be a test. What you may not be told is that the test will be at the end of a three month training period and will not be relevant to anything you will be doing in your job and will be entirely subjective. The only point will be to determine which senior managers you are allied to. The trainer will try to recruit you during training to one side. ""Mentors"" will come during the training session and try to recruit you to another side. The recruitment can begin even during the interview process. Some interviewers may actively discourage you from accepting a position using phrases like "" you have such a great resume, I don't think you will like it here"". Or ""don't worry about this interview, it's the next one you should worry about""
8) asking modestly thought provoking questions will be deemed as acting pompous
9) expect politically incorrect/ borderline racist remarks or attitudes during training and beyond
10) if after "" training"" and after a very subjective ""review board"" and after being demoted from the position you were originally hired at, you find yourself sitting at a tiny desk facing the wall, start looking for other work because you haven't allied yourself with anyone that matters. You will find yourself being a pariah and no one will talk to you lest your toxic professionalism  and integrity rubs off on them
11) if at any time you think you want to go above and beyond your responsibilities. Please don't. No good deed goes unpunished. You will be either thought of as pompous or as a threat."

Great first company for anyone coming out of college. 

The people have great attitude and are kind.  The culture shock will be very positive after arrival. 

Workspaces are innovative and well designed.  Whiteboards galore depending on what building your at.","Managers are honest to the fault of being petty and the performance management system will weed out super performers and those with diversity (yes, me).  The funny thing is for the poor performance management system and poor bonuses (you most likely will not get what they tell you), it suffocates talent and we leave daily to better opportunities.  Yes, people grow, but for a company I love and would rather stay with, the bell-curved talent distribution doesn’t work.  Pay could also be about 20-30% higher for mid-career folks.  

Leadership is split between directors and above who play politics and make decisions slowly to senior managers and below who feel like they are on a ship without a captain.  

Promotions tend to go to like-minded people as disruption or a different way of working is frowned upon.

5888,Capital One,"Smart people, competitive pay, good upward mobility",2018-03-25,4.0,Manager,"- Consistently worked with smart and capable people.  
- There's a pretty good amount of openness and transparency in general and leadership tends to include their teams in decisions.  -
 - Offer competitive pay, great benefits (cheap, high quality healthcare, 7.5% 401k match when you put in 6%, 15% discount on stock purchase up to 15% of your salary).  
- It's great to have a gym ($15/month) and primary care facility (for free) right at the headquarters.  
- They do a pretty good job promoting from within, especially at the junior and mid-senior levels (good upward mobility)
- Really nice facilities in general (bright, open, colorful, fun, good food)
- Focus on doing the right thing for customers instead of squeezing every dollar of profit out of the company
- Founder-led approach results in a focus on long term investment vs. just trying to hit investor goals","- Can be political (both corporate politics and insertion of national politics into the workplace).  From a corporate politics perspective, advancement can be highly dependent on who you work for and what projects you end up working on.  From a national politics perspective, with the HQ being just outside of DC, employees tend to lean pretty far to the left and are not shy about it.  Politics are discussed often and it's not uncommon to be asked questions like ""who did you vote for?""  I've seen this result in favoritism based on whether or not you have the same beliefs.  Big no-no.
- Promotion of good do-ers into management positions.  There are way too many cases of people in management positions because they were good producers.  A good analyst rarely translates into a good manager.  
- Death by meeting - seriously - I would guess that at least 50% of meetings I was invited to were either completely unnecessary or very minimally applicable to me.
- Pains from rapid growth still exist.  Tons of separate systems.  External example: just look at the consumer product logins on the website.  It's been 5 years since the ING acquisition was completed and customers with a traditional Capital One checking or savings account still aren't integrated with the Capital One 360 products/services (formerly ING Direct)
- Major locations are generally in the suburbs so there aren't a lot of options if you want to walk to grab food, do a happy hour, etc.  Most things involve driving.  This is mitigated by them providing just about everything you need on campus but it sometimes you just want a change of scenery.
- Not many options for work locations unless you want to be in either Richmond, VA or McLean, VA.  Richmond is small and isolated and McLean has an insanely high cost of living and terrible traffic.
- Hard push for diversity recruitment sometimes results in great candidates being passed up to meet a quota 
- Performance management system is based much more on time at a certain level than actual performance.  For example, you pretty much have to move a mountain to get anything higher than a ""strong"" rating in the cycle following a promotion.  They do performance management on a bell curve, which means that for every person with a high rating there has to be a person with a low rating.  Isn't the goal to have every employee perform as highly as possible?"

Generally there is good work life balance, if you like to coast and work 35-40 hours a week you'll be able to find a team to accommodate.","Management makes it really hard to get things done as a software engineer. There are seemingly endless hoops to jump through to meet compliance standards. Often times, the compliance standards aren't well thought out and are not flexible enough to meet the needs of the diverse set of applications being developed at the company. Every tech project essentially becomes waterfall as a result due to an insistence on project timelines, complicated compliance processes that become blockers and endless business justification for even small decisions.

Reorgs are frequent and political battles between senior management lead to major consequences for associates. Because of this, it can be hard to develop relationships with direct reports and managers.

My only other gripe is that performance management isn't an intelligent process. Essentially every team under a director is forced to rate their employees on a bell curve, the top x% get promotions and the bottom y% get bad reviews. This system incentives team members on good/productive teams to transfer to unproductive/poor teams if they want to get a promotion. You could have a team of rockstar engineers delivering awesome applications and only one will get a single promotion while another team that can't put a simple data pipeline together will get the same amount."

While the pay is pretty good - there are a lot of companies that actually pay better.","I have been here for 14 years and used to love it here but the culture has drastically changed in the last two years making it almost impossible to get anything accomplished because of out of control politics, egos and back stabbing.
1.  Although they talk about diversity, it is all lip service -  has rally become a ""Boys Club"" and biased against women, in particular on the tech side of the house.
2.  Performance management system is horrible and degrading.  The model is politically based and only rewards those working on the latest ""shiny object"" - fostering back stabbing and diminishing team work.
3.  Constant reorgs and restructuring is exhausting and disorienting, making it really difficult to really accomplish anything - I have averaged 3 reorgs a year since I have been here.
4.  Constant layoffs
5.  Unrealistic expectations with a ""warm body"" plug and play mentality - I am a Operations PM but due to re-org have been thrown onto a tech team and am now expected to instantly perform as a System / Data Analyst on a Software Engineering team with a system I have never worked with before - Although I am open to learning new skills, there is no training provided or even a direction for path forward from my almost non-existent manager - just a sink or swim kind of thing which just sets one up for failure.
5.  Although they talk about how collaborative they are - again it is all lip service.  Basically if you challenge or try to bring in a new perspective you are shut down - basically just do what you are told and act like you are thrilled about it.
6.  Also they like to say they offer ""work life balance"" and flexibility to work from home - honestly, although nobody would ever admit it, it is looked down upon - if you do you are punished for it in subtle ways - such as being first on the RIF list or come performance time - even if you do get all your work done and do a great job.
7.  People really are not all that nice or friendly - it is a survival of the fittest atmosphere, and with all the constant re-orgs and restructures it is hard to build lasting relationships."

They were yelled at on a daily basis, told not to work from home or take sick days, forced to work ridiculous hours at a table about 2 feet from the director (so he could see that they were there).

Because of the way the performance review process was structured, everyone was always running around trying to boss everyone else around.

If people had questions about the way you approached things, instead of talking to you, they just escalated to your management.  Likewise, you were criticized for the smallest things during performance reviews.

They have recently implemented a system where a pretty high percentage of technology staff have to be ranked in the bottom,  which is a death knell for anyone that lands in it.  They have also just raised their attrition targets significantly and are requiring their Managers to aggressively work people out to meet it.  The current tech employee morale is low and one of fear because of this and ongoing layoffs over the last few years in various parts of the business.

This company HIRES and FIRES (which they call redeployment for laying off numerous roles in bunches).
It is a part of Rich Fairbank's strategy: New and different business initiatives and practices each year.  When roles no longer fit in those new initiatives, they place you on 'redeployment'.  The company does not have a viable solution (Career Development Center) for retaining talent that may face redeployment.
Companies and roles change most certainly, but this is cut-throat.  In my 8 years at Capital One I have seen countless individuals placed on redeployment.  Great people, individuals with outstanding backgrounds, performances and skillsets.

The company does not make an initiative to retain this talent other than to say you are free to look for other roles within the company."

Senior Management, most of the time is not aware of what happens within the teams
Not always full credit is given to the work done by an associate - beware if you aren’t careful the other team mates could take credit of your work and the Team leads aren’t that keen to correct that 
Not that immigrant friendly environment - they do care about associates who would need sponsorship but beware you could be given a performance improvement plan and be fired from the organization without a valid reason even if your contributions to the team and the organization are tangible 
They care less about what the implications would be if they suddenly layoff a candidate on an immigrant visa, they don’t really understand the stress one has to go through in such a situation.

If you work in a team where you have a few TDP candidates(Technology Development Program, as they call in Capital One) beware that their feedback would count for or against you which would become the sole deciding factor to your performance analysis even if your contributions are great, their feedback would either boost or degrade your credibility all together in team(may be not maintaining an exceptional relationship with them - meaning never questioning the way they get their things done.)

They say that they are most flexible when coming to supporting their associates to work remotely if needed as per the situation they are facing - but that never truly happens - taking about 4 or less work from home days a month might cause you your job. Once in a while unexpected sick day to fall in the same bucket. These might turn out to be some lame reasons to get rid of you whenever they feel like it. Was accused of overusing the benefit for just the minimal use of it 


The senior management always mentions in their strategy sessions that they are in a mode to increase technology work force. But in reality they are forcing out the tech resources out in large numbers every two years and rehiring at the same pace which is totally making no sense whatsoever. I never understand why would they want to blame associates who contribute well enough to the team and organization, get rid of them and rehire a fresh batch of tech guys who basically would face a similar situation 2-3 years from now. I completely feel that not the best way for one to conduct his business


Very slow green card process
Senior management is never that employee friendly

They say they embrace open source a lot but what it takes to implement an open source solution is very time consuming tedious and approvals take very long and in return the blame comes on to the associates for not being able to accomplish something which is out of reach, the actual reason being lack of proper support model for the all the kind of applications which are being built in the organization.

The performance reviews and plans they dish out to the associates might not exactly pinpoint what they would need to do to improve as they usually would contain things that one might already be doing right except for a few time where he might have done a mistake

TDP associates dominate all the others

If you work in Mclean on your laptop it’s great, but when you are in the branch you have no idea. System outages like crazy. No career path for promotion. Teller can get promoted to uba. Uba to Bankers. And bankers will be bankers  for life. You go to a build your brand class and they say you are the cream of the crop. You apply for the next role and they say you don’t have enough experience. I am a banker for 5 years. I did mortgages until you took them away. I was successful in loans but now I have to call a 1800 for them to do my job. I am an expert in checking, Savings, and credit card....so is the capital one 360 website. 
Managers are all about coaching but cannot sell for the life of them. How can you coach me when you don’t do anything? Get managers who don’t sit in their office. Get a manager who is the best at selling and I will learn from them. I hate it when they just don’t tell me what to do like they know everything and don’t have any sales experience themselves. Pull a teller drawer once and a while. Digital solutions are so far behind but they claim to be Apple of Banking. Back office support needs to approve everything. We are not bankers...our role is to handoff our customer to another partner who drops the ball and the customer comes back to belittle us. Let bankers do Banker activities."

There is no understanding of how to grow and develop Product Management talent. You're expected to make it up as you go, sounds great with lots of room to grow, until management decides what you've done isn't what they wanted and you'll find yourself seeking other opportunities. Depending who your manager and leadership chain are will determine if you were given any constructive feedback or an opportunity to take a different approach/adjust.

- there are lots of great people at this company however your experience will vary greatly depending on your direct manager and leadership chain
- constant reorgs are exhausting and disorienting

They hire 10 to 15 new employees in each area monthly and then turn around at the end of year and eliminate 10 to 15% of their workforce in each department based on a performance based measurement system that puts everyone on a bell curve.

Great place to give back to the community through outreach programs.

You can retire here","Visuals and Politics dictate your career here. 

Many “engineers” plagiarize others’ work, but because the chain of command has no way to judge people or their accomplishments, these people are quickly promoted and then leave before they’re discovered. A lot of headlining projects are just a front used to grab promotions and leave. Due to this problem, many projects are believed to have failed from lack of maintenance, when in reality there was nothing there in the first place.

A culture of “niceness” discourages honesty and leads to honest talented people being alienated. Many have recently left, yet HR and leadership are unaware of this brain drain because they use inflated internal evaluations to analyze retention. This culture and its intolerance to criticism also leads to simple projects taking 3 years to reach production rather than 2 months because people who actually know what they’re doing either don’t speak up or are simply ignored as just serial complainers."

The campus in Plano is great, and I liked getting plugged into a network of talented people from around the country. I was given a lot of authority and autonomy to shape content strategy for my line of business, and it helped me experiment and grow into new areas of that role.","There's a weird culture thing between full-time employees (FTEs) and contractors. Many people start as contractors and get moved to FTE after a while. While I was a contractor, though, I had many meetings where someone would say ""this next part only applies to FTEs"", and then we'd sit around as people talked around us.

For the most part, it isn't a big deal, but after a long time I started to feel like a second-class citizen. There's a two-year limit on contractors - if you don't get moved to FTE after two years, you have to leave for 90 days and re-apply for your job. After I'd been in my position for 18 months, I had to start job searching because no one would commit to bringing me on permanently.

I got laid off in November, and it was really a bummer. Eliminating 950 jobs and cutting an entire line of business after only two years in operation doesn't say good things about the company's long-term strategy and planning.

Also: applying directly to an FTE job or moving from one part of the company to another to become an FTE sometimes involves a weird, unnecessary standardized test full of personality, logic, and advanced math questions. I'm a writer, and I flunked the math portion pretty hard and got turned down by two FTE positions exactly similar to the job I'd already been doing for 18 months. Three months later, those positions are still listed as unfilled online. This unfortunate testing policy kept that role vacant and turned away a qualified applicant, and I heard the same thing from many of my co-workers."

If you are smart, can problem solve and deliver results you can be successful across multiple job families.  They are not afraid to give you big opportunities and projects just be prepared that you need to then step up and deliver.  While not a ton of formal training you will be exposed to a variety of tools and techniques in everyday work that will be beneficial to you both at Capital One and at any company you work for in the future.",Org changes and leadership changes are frequent and while lower levels are insulated from the changes the higher you are the more disruptive the changes.  The company is full of talented individuals who inherently think they have a better way which leads to big changes from leader to leader most of the time.  Perception of promotions is that they are slow unless you are on the big project with the highly influential leader and then things tend to move much quicker.  I do think the company does a good job of identifying top talent for promotions but that leaves those not in the top 5-10% frustrated with the process.  Leverage your top talents and find a senior advocate and you will do great.

We are provided with all the top end resources and technology for IT & software development.","The number 1 complaint across the board by all employees is the year end employee review process. Most companies, you are graded based on your individual performance alone. Here, you are placed into a pool of people of your employee level (Associate, Senior Associate, Manager, etc.), and then senior management has meetings ranking all the people in the pool. People who do good work, sometimes end up low in a ranking which seems unfair and is why so many people complain. The higher your rank, the higher your bonus."

And mine is scheduled to close this year.  This after they have gotten rid of the entire home lending department so we no longer do Home lending. Never heard of a bank that only does accounts and credit cards. 

In my opinion they are getting ready to sell of the retail banking side and focus on just online banking. Sad because a lot of very good people are losing their jobs. All to save money for the bottom line (when ceo is paid in stock options this is what you get)"

Performance management is entirely contingent on your direct manager so if they are inexperienced or lack leadership skills, consider yourself screwed. Based on the rating system, associates are self interested and will withhold information from teammates in order to make themselves look good. The company claims they are diverse but they spend an insane amount of money sending leadership to classes and when they come back nothing has changed. Difficult to move departments because there are so many layoffs. No incentive to go above and beyond because there is no recognition unless you beg for it. Misogynistic attitude from the top down. The higher level associate, the greater chance of them acting like you don’t exist. If you are a head-down, get things done kind of a person, this is not the place for you."

In some areas it is still target driven, which is positive in terms of focus, but the mindset in some areas is not necessarily about doing right just getting an outcome and can be highly competitive. This does lead in some cases to games at associate level to try the teflon approach to divert blame which can be counter productive to good teamwork.  
The tactical approach is very evident and as a result can create additional unnecessary work.

In the last few months, entire divisions of the company have been laid off. My office is going to be shut down tomorrow, and this was all planned while our VPs kept telling us with a straight face that they were committed to tech and our location.

These are some of the most two-faced people I have ever met and it's completely clear to me that Capital One doesn't really consider itself as a tech company. 

A very large majority of the programmers in this company are very bad. Job titles like ""senior software engineer"" and ""master software engineer"" are given to people who can't code, communicate, or collaborate in any way at all.

At the same time, I get push back from my leadership team saying that promotions need to be based on merit and accomplishments. I point directly to engineers both within my LOB and across the company who have been promoted and ask what I'm lacking that they have. I never receive an answer.

This company's stupid desire to have ""product owners"" who oversee one single feature in a project is baffling. My product owners are all on the east coast and we only interact with them on Slack and over the phone.

It really feels like a company that hired too many B-players years ago who continued to hire the bottom of the barrel with C- and D-level employees and have no desire to actually do any real, good work.

Don't come to Capital One if you're looking to learn or grow. If you want to circlejerk all day to acting corporate, you'll feel right at home."

Great PTO ( 5 weeks after 5 years non-exempt/ 4 weeks exempt)  Salary is good if you negotiate correctly coming in.,"The whole strategy with Mortgage Banking has been a complete failure due to not hiring the best and most experienced talent. Also not listening to experienced professionals and overspending from the reincarnation in 2009 caused this as well.  Capital One's claim is they are a digital company but this does not translate to many lines of business i.e.,  mortgage banking and even Small Business for that matter. Many processes are still very paper driven and disorganized even after spending millions of dollars on systems that didn't work. Unfortunately,  President of Financial Services Sanjiv Yajnik has a lot of blame for this mortgage division collapse. Leadership changes and remapping of strategic goals should have occurred years before.  A one fits all approach doesn't work in every business.  I do hope with a possible liquidation and  selloff of certain lines of business to a forward thinking company will help Capital One refocus on the markets it strives in."

Local managers treat program like a boiler room.  Name recognition is not a plus.  Prospects and bank customers accustomed to Capital One as a credit card company.  Very difficult to get clients to take you seriously enough to get all their assets.  Heavy favoritism on the part of local management whose cronies/favorites are inexperienced advisors.  Favorites who are grandfathered into company get and keep all clients except those with little to no opportunity (i.e. don’t live in area).  Constant churning and wrong recommendations from less-experienced advisors who only focus on assets they see at the bank (as opposed to considering/profiling for outside assets and full financial planning) and happen to be the favorites so they can pad their numbers.  Clients mysteriously move from your book to theirs.  Exact opposite of what National Investment program is saying/trying to do in a fiduciary capacity.

The Pros of working for this company include decent pay, good benefits and, recently, exposure to current technologies.  The best benefit of working at Capital One is the fairly generous vacation package; I receive 4 weeks of vacation with the option to buy an additional week for a small price.","My recent experiences (last 3 years) in Capital One IT have been very unpleasant.  Firstly, the culture at Capital One is competitive, nervous and fearful.  The primary reason for the horrible atmosphere is the Forced Distribution performance management practice.  Capita One shoe horns associates into performance ratings with 15-20% receiving bad rating.  As you might imagine in a corporate setting as this the decisions on who receives what rating is highly political.  While I have never received a bad rating in 15 years I rarely am acknowledged for the excellent work I produce and have only received above average ratings in years where I expressed displeasure in previous ratings.

So courtesy of the horrible performance management practices, what you end up with is a group of nervous, scared associates who are afraid of receiving bad ratings or perhaps even losing their jobs.  The response to that by many associates is to work over 60 hour work weeks and rarely take vacation out of fear.  Most associates fall into this category.  I'm always saddened to see fellow associates needlessly work long hours and send emails around midnight out of fear.  It's really sad and super commonplace.
 
The culture is horrible.  Plus, the fear of layoffs is never far away.

Management at Capital One is horrendous.  The typical Capital One middle manager is compromised, scared and a sellout.  These poor folks sit together in conference rooms two times a year ""cross calibrating"" their associates in an effort to determine who gets screwed with a bad rating.  It is awful.  Capital One has a ton of strong associates; only about 5% in IT are truly bad so these managers try to convince each other and their associates (keeping in mind the 15-20% bad rating forced distribution) that somehow Associate A who is a great worker and nice person should be told they suck for the year.

There is NO work life balance in Capital One IT.  It is not because there is so much work; it is because there is so much fear.  A truly horrendous place to work."

You're not going to attract talent if you under pay your new hires. People are leaving / talking about leaving. Value your design and engineering talent. They're the ones who will bring Capital One to become the tech company it so desires to be. 

Work culture is very dependent on your team / manager. The NYC 114 culture is dead. Long hours plague many teams. It feels like a marketing agency.

If I come back into the office at 8pm because I forgot my keys, and there is an entire team of designers/engineers still in the office on a Friday night, there is a problem. 

If someone is in the office on a holiday, and I'm there to notice that person, there is a problem. 

Too much legacy code. Too many old guys trying to hold onto their jobs. 

It's a dead end for those just starting their careers."

It's one of those things that you don't have any influence over unless you're the one hiring, and actually contributes the most to how you feel about your work.

The culture, particularly in the Design team, is really nice; everyone is incredibly supportive of one another, and my colleagues are all experienced and enthusiastic about producing brilliant work every day. This makes me want to come to work more than anything else.

There is a lot of support from Senior Leadership in getting us the right training and learning opportunities. I feel like they invest in their team, and work to grow us to our maximum potential.

I also really love the culture, the flexibility with where and how I work. When I choose to come to the office, the spaces I can work in are varied depending on the type of work I'm doing. The expectation is that you're trusted to get the job done, so whether that's achieved in one of the cosier corners of the office or sitting/standing at your desk, it's fine.

The benefits are really nice; the pension is the best I've ever had, and health/dental care are all options you can take. I really appreciate the Mission Days and team days they organise for us, too.","Some benefits are not equally distributed across locations, so the staff in the headquarters get very subsidised meals & an onsite gym, in London we have free cereal and fruit for breakfast and free fizzy drinks fridges, and a running track on the roof with a very small discount for gyms.

- Challenging work. The credit card business area is infinitely complex with macro- and micro-economic factors, human behavior, and risk that all needs to be under consideration in decision-making
- Flexibility. Although with colocation and agile becoming an ever-present trend in how the teams work, there is flexibility in work hours and remote work depending on the role and team. Leadership is also very supportive of personal growth (within reason) so moving to new functions or business lines is commonplace and promoted.
- Parental leave. Capital One recently extended it's PTO for both maternity and paternity leave and is an industry leader in the US private company space
- Extra benefits. Team fun events, occasional dinner/lunches at the office, and onsite gyms with optional PT sessions in Richmond, Plano, and Mclean were nice extras to have.","- Office locations. While some more tech/digital roles are moving to city center locations (e.g. Clarendon - closer to DC, San Francisco, and New York), it is a long commute if you work in McLean HQ and want to live in DC proper.
- Varying hours, without varying pay. Teams, work style, and hours differ depending on where you sit in the business and how time critical or significant work is. However, there isn't pay differentiation between a senior analyst in one role working 40 hours per week or one working 60 hours per week. Performance/bonus/promotions are more dependent on competencies and results."

Excellent work-life balance and a CEO that is a founder and has a ton of passion for the business.","Employment is treated like a 24/7 competition. You're competing with every coworker every day to earn the right to keep your job, and maybe get promoted. Performance management takes up considerable time and causes considerable anxiety. You're considered an athlete competing to stay on the team. This idea is taken to extremes, causing a highly passive-aggressive environment. If you're ""in"", you're set. If you're not, it's an uphill battle to ever get the chance to break in. Too much time wasted on doing things ""beyond your job"", selling the idea that ""being great at your job isn't enough"". Nobody is in charge and everybody has a say. This is great in theory, but when it's time to make a decision, nobody is clearly empowered to make the call so compromise is key. As a result, moving forward means watering down projects to make lots of people feel ok about agreeing to move forward. Decision by committee takes the bite out of innovative efforts."

6636,Capital One,Risk Coordinator,2017-09-13,3.0,Risk Coordinator,"Let me begin by stating that Capital One is in fact one of the best companies to work for in this area. The emphasis on moral is great, and I'll always remember the good times they allowed us to have through employee appreciation events. The atmosphere allowed me to go into work everyday with a positive attitude, and I never dreaded going in unless I had my own personal issues. The job itself is not one you would necessarily dream of but it was not as bad as other collection jobs, according to coworkers. The customers generally understood we had a job to do, and there were only a handful of those who were difficult.  The incentives are good, but as I was leaving the management was making it a little more difficult to achieve eligibility.

Mobility within the company is also great. Although I wasn't given the opportunity to leave the department, many of my peers did (depending on the manager). The whole company was good at working internally. Great, great company in itself to work for.","Management... If you are looking into joining Capital One collections in Plano, TX...BEWARE. The department managers' methods are extremely questionable and possibly unethical. As far as they're concerned, you will be another pawn on the chessboard. If for whatever reason they found you unfavorable, it seemed to me as any formal policy went out the window and became arbitrary to them, and used to only their advantage to get what they wanted. The pressure became extremely unbearable, even for top performers. A specific example would be that one of the top performers of the past 6 months was unable to leave the department after a year due to the department managers preventing it for their benefit. This agent was able to leave the department after HR intervention.

Now, to say all of management was like this would be unfair, but definitely enough to make me leave voluntarily and go through the effort of writing this warning to you. You may assume that it was entirely my fault and perspective that I see things this way, however unfortunately I am one of many who also left due to the new management. I hope that one day the senior level is able to identify this issue and resolve it for future retention purposes. 

My best advice to those looking into joining the department would be to do as your told, and try your best to succeed while for lack of a better expression, kiss their a**. 

Other than that, the pay could be more competitive especially with the new pressures."

People who are flight risks get promoted first, and then the rest of the allotted promotions are dolled out to the managers who are loudest (I wish I were joking).

This includes everything from internal approvals, documentation being wrong, a tool/API you're trying to use to not having an owner anymore, to your team all losing access to github randomly (again not joking).
- Organizations are very territorial. If someone thinks you're not the right person to talk to about something, they'll ignore you. They won't go out of their way to stop you, but they will certainly not be helpful.

- Hyper aggressive work environment and bullying by these managers that is never heard of anywhere in the IT or the banking industry.
- Brutal review process where managers have to fight each other and the one who beats up others in this fight gets a good review about their employee.

 The employees are under paid and the promotions are highly strategic in regards to giving promotions to those who have already had salary increase within that year so they end up not qualifying for the 10-12 percent promotion increase. 
Even if you have all the knowledge and qualifications for a promotion the jobs can easily be given to someone who has no knowledge or any idea of what to do as a result of favoritism. Beware on the position you take because unless you follow ""office politics guidelines"" you could be stuck in that position and overworked for years. 

Finally, I am not the only Capital One employee that has had one of the worse and most stressful experiences.

The company is made up intelligent, driven associates who are supported by a management team that is committed to engaging them as humans, not just employees. The focus on growth is tangible, and it makes all the difference.

Another point that stands out is the willingness to take risks and learn from failure. The party line is that, if you never fail, you aren't trying hard enough, and this is taken into account when evaluating performance. 

All in all, when most people imagine what it's like to work at a bank, they imagine a scene out of ""Office Space"" or the beginning part of ""Fight Club"" before things get weird.

- Some people managers are very inexperienced (fresh grad, worked at Capital One for 3 years, promoted to people manager)
- Management judge people by superficial impressions a lot more. Everybody that succeed at Capital One has the same personality traits and there is very little room for an introverted analyst to bloom who just wants to do work (as opposed to show off work).

6865,Capital One,"A great company with heart, but definitely room for improvement",2017-06-27,4.0,Director,"Founder-led and market-back strategies: Fairbank still is at the helm and sets truly market-based strategic priorities 
Data-centric decision making: Analytics run this company.  Data trumps tenure.  
Amazing opportunities to grow and learn:  The organization generally values a breadth of experience and frequent rotation/movement is supported and encouraged.  Development programs available for high performing associates that come with HUGE benefits such as special training curriculums and full MBA sponsorship 
Fair compensation:  always better for newer associates, but, keeping an eye on the labor market is something Capital One takes seriously.
Benefits: To say the benefits are generous would be a incredible understatement.  Great standard benefits packages (e.g. retirement, health insurance, disability, tuition reimbursement) with ton of thoughtful extras (e.g. $35k in adoption or surrogacy assistance per child) plus some location-specific perks (e.g. fitness and health centers, walgreens locations, snacks, Tesla charging)","- Getting a raise and promotion: I think we most leaders do their best to administer the performance management process in a fair way, however, because people are involved, there are many imperfections.  There continues to be a relatively homogeneous group of associates (namely white business analysts who started as college hires) that are recognized and promoted more quickly than others.  
- Poor strategic execution: While the company excels at setting a high-level strategy, the one-level-down decisions are often poor.  The direct reports to the CEO seem willing to invest enormous sums of money, but $$ needs to be managed/directed much more closely. 
 Examples like the Capital One Labs, technology transformation, and obsession with ""Design"" and ""Product"" illustrate the idea that you can't just ""buy it"" --- you need to ""grow it"" to make a healthy organization.
- Org issues : The siloed accountable executive model doesn't deliver results as it is supposed to... still very much a matrixed organization (e.g. enterprise, technology) . The result is that the ability to navigate politics and effectively influence others is the only way to be truly effective

For a bank you would think they would be organized but NOT AT ALL! Nobody knows anything, very little training and they expect you to know everything once you get on the phone. 
Higher managements pretend to be friendly to your face but talks bad about everyone.
Team managers are disorganized, not tech savvy at all some of them are still writing things down instead of organizing themselves digitally. 
Some managers will talk bad about people on their own team and they think we don't hear them. They even gossip about each other and put each other down in front of people.
Bilingualism doesn't exist over there, people that are supposed to be bilingual are not, one of them was promoted to management and is doing a horrible job and is the one that gossip the most.
There is no HR on site, when they come they have the biggest attitude.

If you work in Richmond, the West Creek facilities are fantastic.

In the area I worked, pretty much anyone over the age of 40 was toast if they weren't a Senior Director or above.  The Senior Manager and Director levels ( for those age 40+) were constantly targeted in re-orgs and downsizings.  And it's not like you get great experience in Capital One Finance.  What you learn there is very internally focused and not valued outside of the company.  The people I saw getting caught up in re-orgs were not finding comparable jobs in other organizations.

If not, see you on the job market in 3 yrs or less.","There's an inherent culture of intently studying org charts, dropping names and vying for visibility and customer feedback at every turn to build your case for a promotion. Kissing up your business customer will take you a long way, as will attending happy hours and parties, incessantly promoting your work and being popular in your department. 

Diversity is a joke. For the most part, data scientists are asians, tech are indians and BAs are white.. and stick to their own groups (friend circles, lunches, .. you get the idea) You'll invariably see asian employees talking to their bosses in mandarin or their local language and feel left out if you don't speak the language and belong to the same team.

The company is toxic ; people either stick to their principles (& stay where they are for years), adapt or resign. The ones who adapt become aggressive Type A personalities who stop being team players, feed others' bad information and do everything in their power to use every minute in their own self-benefit. If you want to get ahead in this company, diss others' work, never admit when you're wrong, be supremely confident and take credit for others' work when needed. It can be attributed to miscommunication if identified later. If you're looking for a collaborative team environment and have chosen Capital One, it's hilarious :) Team work is eventually non existent so you'd much rather be put in a team with newbies who don't know any better. Don't believe for one minute that politics doesn't exist or 'Capital One has much less politics than other companies'. BS.

6988,Capital One,bad,2017-05-05,1.0,,not any. it's so bad.,"The issue with this business, is that associates are either managing too much, managing something they are not good at, or processes and setup at the business make it really hard to deliver results fast. AT THE SAME TIME, managers do not acknowledge this fact, continue to place harsh, unrealistic, and sometimes unsensible expectations on associates, and blame the associates for not working hard enough. These insufficiencies are well obvious in the day-to-day operation of the business. How can leaders blatantly neglect these fundamental challenges the business is going through? This is what pissed us off and why morale is low. What's so difficult about dividing the work a little more fairly? What's so difficult about putting the right person at the right role? What's so difficult about letting go some of your unreasonable expectations? And what's so difficult about reshuffling certain personnel (especially certain leaders) off their current role?

Leaders who are trying to make a change, I really hope you take a look at this. No one dares to say this cuz if they did, chances are they will get the blame for being not good enough and risk getting fired. We don't even trust the anonymous surveys to be anonymous."

7044,Capital One,Full of type B leadership that can't handle any type A's around,2017-04-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pay and benefits are good, but not great. And not worth it when you consider the work environment.","Chesapeake, VA office: Constant stress and threat of termination. Absolutely no security. Don't be a different personality. Upper leadership talk all the time about ensuring diversity and that this doesn't mean just race. Yet if you are not the same personality as them and handle everything exactly as they do, you are in trouble and considered a troublemaker, even if your way of handling causes less trouble. As far as diversity with race? The Chesapeake site is about 95% African American while the local demographics show about 2/3 white to 1/3 black. Not diverse. Racist against whites. 

Hard work doesn't count. It's how many leadership individuals you can party with that counts. If you're not their party pal, you can plan on being terminated at some point. If you're type A personality and actually work hard and try to get the job done, you'll be termed even sooner as they get upset at ""making them look bad"" for not doing their jobs. Upper leadership actually lectures constantly on the fact that being friends with  everyone is more important than how hard or well you work. I actually had an upper leader tell me that I didn't get a promotion I applied for, even though they knew I could and would do the job better, because the hiring panel were friends with another applicant. A person who didn't know how to do the job and actually had to keep running to me to ask me how to do things after she got the job."

-Some product managers know what they are doing and are a joy to work with, others just want you to tell them what they want to hear
-I met and worked with super nice people
-401k had great options and was a good match
-Got bank holidays off","-Absent management who, when present, ignored major personnel issues. this resulted in my team loosing several individuals who just didn't want to be harassed any longer
-Narcissistic people were able to secure management positions, causing teams to suffer
-Product and Design do not understand what Agile is nor are they interested in following the practices, although they say they do
-Advancement is nonexistent unless someone leaves. You have to be a Sr. Manager (people manager) before they will train you for management. That's right, you have to be in the position before you can be trained for it. This leads to a lot of people who have no business leading anyone or anything in the positions of power and those who have the potential unable to use it officially (many many people do the job of their manager, because that manager can't do their own job, without recognition)
-Too many thought leaders who don't do anything
-If ideas don't come from sr. leadership, they rarely get implemented. If they do, they are quickly co-opted by sr. leadership so they can take the credit
-Yearly reviews are a joke. Your manager has to fight for your raise, bonus and promotion (if applicable) in a fight-club like situation where all managers present the merits of their employees and then they force rank everyone. So someone is always at the bottom. If you have a manager who is not good at this game, you have a very small chance of advancement.
-Beware of those who want to advance. They will step on you to take the credit for what you have done. In order to get promoted you have to promote yourself relentlessly, even if that means your co-workers have to do your job for you because you are too busy going to meetings where you are in front of sr. leadership. 
-Health insurance was expensive (more so than other companies I have worked for) but offered good options for coverage
-Only 15 days of vacation - non negotiable."

Sure it struggles with bureaucracy, but they actively work to fight that and instead be a mission driven business. On top of that they take excellent care of their employees. The benefits are great and even in outplacement they bend over backwards to make sure associates are set up for future success. I think that how a company treats it's employees says loads about the company.","Your experience may vary dramatically depending on which portion of the business you work for. While the overarching corporate leadership and mission may be strong, if you are in a more fringe part of the company (such as investing) you may find your direct Leadership very challenging to work for and that there is an atmosphere of cronyism or tribalism. The single biggest con for Capital One though is that they still use a traditional stack ranking form of performance management that kills collaboration and innovation in favor of being popular or associated with high profile projects."

A lot of overworking and underpaying. Be prepared to wear a lot of hats which can be beneficial however delegating work because you have too much work due to a chaotic business model is crazy! They are almost militant. They try blinding you with a culture like you matter when they truly have the same goal of any firm, to maximize profit. They will lead you on to believe you are doing great work but then pass you over for someone less qualified because they may be easy to manipulate.

We were told that all new hires must work evenings and one weekend day per week. After working there for a while you will find out that new hires get whatever shifts are open at the time. For example, many are hired 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM Monday - Friday, or 4 ten hour shifts, weekdays only. If you start on evenings, it is very hard to ever get a day shift, and even after 4 years, cannot get an early morning shift, or a weekend off.

The benefits are impressive - company matching 401K contribution percentage, enables you to buy a week's worth of vacation time, most departments encourage team outings and volunteer events.  

Most people are of good intention and have good attitudes on a daily basis, making it a friendly environment.","Their performance management process is severely flawed.  Much of management abhors the twice-a-year process, admitting it is extremely stressful and upsetting.  Forced performance rating distribution mandates that your department has 'poor performers'.  Meaning, even if everyone is doing a great job, exactly what they are asked to do and they do it almost flawlessly, they still need to decide who isn't performing as good as the rest, so they can be in the lower performance bucket.  Managers either get in arguments in which one person ultimately loses because a manager isn't as an effective communicator or advocate as the others, or because a manager steamrolls the discussion and is so stubborn the opposing manager just gives up out of frustration, hence making their associate become the poor performer.  Associates rated as poor performers often have an extremely difficult time invalidating this label and perception, and are often used as the automatic scapegoat for future calibrations' low performers.  Additionally, once given this low performance rating, you are unable to move to a different role, even in cases where the manager agrees there is a job fit issue and the associate finds a more suitable role to go to.  Based on this, associates who stay in this category for too long inevitably are pushed out of the department and by default, the company (aka are fired).  This is frustrating, disappointing, stressful, usually unnecessary, and in many cases heartbreakingly unfair to the ""poor performer"" who is only labeled as such because someone has to be.

And there isn’t only one or two of them, it is a gang of them like that. 

people are leaving or fired…
the company does a good job at hiring good people but then don’t equip them to be successful. new people get discouraged quite quickly because a lot of people go out of their way to make them life miserable. feb is bonus payout time and is when a chunk of the company leaves. when managers don’t like their direct reports they would have HR investigate them and get them fired. it is hard not to be underperforming when the odds is against you so people get fired all the time. another way is reorg-ing them out. 

weak leadership
the slt continues to try to build morale but usually ends up a bunch of people quiet in a room. you can fool the newbies but can fool everyone. turning a blind eye on the bullying issues cause of pressure to drive results. unsustainable approach."

7423,Capital One,LOVE WHAT THE COMPANY OFFERS BUT HATE THE LIFERS!,2016-12-01,1.0,Senior Data Analyst,"Capital One Canada is an interesting company; being a foreign branch of a top american bank, it has access to great associate development programs and training resources. They also compensate their associates above well industry standard to compete for talent in the financial services space and technology space. This company is a great stepping stone for new graduates.","There are quite a bit of lifers in middle management at Capital One Canada. These lifers are pretty much stuck and content or even happy. They get paid at less 100k base salary for delivering the quality of work of a junior consultant. Sweet Deal, Right? The chance of transitioning to a big 5 bank probably means a pay cut or running the risk of being the underperformer of a big bank. As these are lifers could only perform in a junior consultant level, the top tech firms like apple, google, amazon, etc, probably won't take them and tech startups mean getting a pay cut and doing REAL work, so NO… Staying put is probably in their best interest. They make it incredibly difficult for new hires to settle in. The turnover is pretty high, on average associates stay for least than 2 years.

P.S. A lot of the 4-5 stars are fake posts from HR. If you filter the rating from highest to lowest, you would notice that there are not a lot people find the posts ""helpful"" but you filter the rating from lowest to highest, you would notice a lot more people find the post ""helpful""."

I could go on and on about how wonderful it was working for this company.","In my case, the biggest con would be the Year End Appraisal process. Depending on the business group you work in, you are stack ranked based on your job level with people with different job functions that may not have anything to do with what you do, For example people manager vs process manager vs operations analyst. There is a rigorous calibration process across different sites/locations to determine what your Year End Appraisal will be.

7437,Capital One,Best People + Most Fun Place to Work,2016-11-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I joined Capital One out of university, and I haven't second guessed that decision since. It's been such an awesome place to start off my career, and when I look at my friends who graduated around the same time, most have since left their first employer or aren't nearly as satisfied with them as I am with Capital One.

A few things contribute to this satisfaction:
1) High performing culture. They hire incredibly talented and hard working people, and they foster a collaborative environment where people are incented to coach and develop others. I've always been fortunate enough to have managers who are passionate about people leadership, which is really exciting as someone new out of school.
2) Job variety. Whether you're interested in building quantitative models, designing marketing strategies, working on the Mobile App or new tech products, etc., there's an area of the business that's at the forefront of the field. I've had the opportunity to move around a handful of times, each time learning a new space and working with new people.
3) Fun. Nothing beats loving coming to work every day. The people I'm surrounded with make me laugh multiple times per day, and the formal committees within the company do an awesome job planning activities like Blue Jays games, Paint Nights, Holiday Parties, etc. Because the culture is close knit, there's also a lot of informal fun, like after work drinks, etc.

All in all, this place is pretty awesome.","My biggest dissatisfier about working at Capital One is the North York office location. While it's on the subway and super convenient to get to on a daily basis, it's not as exciting as being downtown. Luckily, the office is moving downtown in 2018... and I can't wait!"

If you like the culture it's great (though it can be a little cliquey with the folks who've been around since the '90's being a tight knit group who seem to take care of each other). Very high quality work facilities, great benefits, competitive compensation packages. Emphasis on strong people management can be a good thing - the Card division is especially good at people management, they grow good people leaders there from the bottom up. Not so good at growing people managers/leaders in the functions like HR, finance, legal, etc (not sure about the Bank division).","Relentless focus on performance management and constant assessment of everyone at all times, and never ending giving of feedback can have a dark side (though it can definitely help everyone grow too). Specifically it can and does sometimes lead to a culture of nastiness, judgement, and a rigid heirarchy (because semi-annual performance appraisals are heavily influenced by committee discussions where every people manager at the next level up has the opportunity to give input both positive and negative - so there's a lot of striving to impress and never offend/disappoint anyone a step up in heirarchy). Also, people can spend their time indulging in judging others as an intellectual pastime (past the point of usefulness), rather than actually doing something meaningful - it can be an excuse for people who don't know how to get results in their own work (or who want to avoid confronting their own issues).

In fairness around the time I left that the company was starting to discuss finding ways to overcome some of these problems, and may have succeeded in the meantime. However, if you are gentle soul, who has any trouble at all taking criticism, or doesn't like being in a pretty fiercely internally competitive (although the competitiion is below the surface) environment then you may want to think carefully before moving here.

One other negative - historically Capital One has been very unplanned in having massive hiring sprees in good times, with insufficient internal controls. Then at some point they realize they've added too much overhead (either if there's an external shock in the market, or they just wake up and smell the coffee one day) and then go through heavy rounds of layoffs. As a result, especially in Richmond, Capital One has a reputation for these major reductions in force - and unfortunately this reputation has been earned. So this isn't as secure a place to work as some others."

Capital One's management has no plan. They hire engineers, give them no products or requirements and assume they will innovate like a startup.

There were 5 people at the company that had been there longer than a year. Everyone was new and had little to no idea how things worked.

Work culture is very good.","Performance review is a joke. The managers behave like gods. If you have an issue with the manager, then talking with internal HR or Associate relationship is waste of time.

In some departments, like commercial IT, the IT senior leadership is not really capable of interpreting the technology clearly. There is a lot of show off, precedence but really lacks computer science part. Those people who makeup things and bluff the achievements can progress much faster. However, the production and infrastructure teams will end up owning the poor implementations and suffer a lot to maintain it."

Many new managers do not have mortgage or auto financing work experience or understanding and are hired just to increase productivity.  As we all know, each account may have conditions or issues that may take longer to resolve than others and sometimes each person will always have different numbers for the day.  If Quantity is the priority, Quality is diminished and maintaining a balance of each will always be difficult."

I am biased, not because of Tampa location closing, but more because of how they went about it.
My cons of working at Capital One, while I was there was there was no communication between management and employee. We also had mandatory overtime every week (still not sure if that was legal). I don't mind working overtime and usually did even before it was mandatory, but many people pushed back against it. People fell in line when jobs were threatened and a few were let go (officially for other things, not for refusing to work overtime). We never had time to breath between phone calls, usually 300 or more calls in queue. We were ""encouraged"" to work through our breaks and lunches. The last 12 to 14 months before the location closed became very oppressive."

There are genuinely some smart and talented individuals that work there.","Unfortunately Capital One has a high turnover rate for a reason -- some departments are strict in micromanaging their employees on an absurd level. You're given PTO and flex time and some managers are more lenient than others. There's definitely a lack of communication between different departments and even managers in the same department. There's too many higher ups to have one focused idea and some hardly know what to relay to their employees because it's all ""he said, she said"" in the office. You have to be careful who you speak about because the company is tightly knit and word travels fast. One particular manager in the High Value Servicing department only cares about herself and not her employees and unfortunately you'll find other managers like that in different departments. This manager, though, wants you to believe she cares about you but when you have a real and pressing issue, her so-called empathy disappears. Particularly, the High Value department hires upper management typically from other departments. These individuals have had little to no idea what happens in High Value and will base most decisions by the book when the department boasts transparency and reaching ""outside the box."" I think Capital One needs to look at how they structure their management teams and find ones that truly care about their employees. It's such a high turnover rate in that department because employees are being fed misleading information about policy and procedure regarding their work ethic and a customer's account."

- Flexible work from home options and depending on the team, good work life balance.
- Office space is brightly lit and lot's of natural lighting. Plenty of meeting rooms and collaboration spaces. Now there are standing desks and Macbooks available.
- A selection of foosball tables, ping pong table and TVs for watching games with coworkers.
- Free goodies (e.g. Tea, coffee, occasionally food).
- Plenty of committees to join (e.g. Fun Committee, Philanthropy Committee, Asian Committee).
- Casual dress code.
- Various Fun Days or company social events throughout the year.
- Coworkers are generally intelligent and hardworking. Have met some really nice people and even made some friends. People are usually open to helping and connecting with you.
- Senior leaders are friendly and relatively approachable (e.g all hands, office hours, walking around the office).","- Lot's of bullying in the office by middle management that are not addressed through HR policy or by senior management (e.g. coercion, pranks, humiliation, tolerance of inappropriate behaviour). 
- Rampant favoritism that is counter to its claims of meritocracy. Very obvious in-group and out-group dynamic. 
- 360 degree reviews are now gone so performance review is more of ""he said she said"" and whether you are on the good side of certain key players. 
- Managers don't know how to coach or develop. Just provides passive aggressive ""advice"" to keep you in check of your ""development plan"". 
- Everyone seems nice but will go behind your back to complain to your manager/others. No one really cares about your development like the company claims unless it helps he/she get promoted. 
- Overemphasis on the charming and extroverted personality as a factor to success. 
- Lack of focus and forward momentum in the strategic direction of the company. 
- Things are poorly documented and very poor training in general so good luck with your own onboarding!
- Pressure to spend a lot of time, whether you like it or not, to ""socialize"" with your peers above and beyond what is reasonable for a professional relationship. 
- Better to keep your mouth shut about issues in the workplace because it will probably get back to you and you will be the one who gets penalized (this includes the many many ""employee"" surveys that you are asked to fill out)."

Typical people problems, though."
7689,Capital One,Software Engineer - Good opportunities to learn technology,2016-09-09,4.0,Software Engineer,"Technology
- Opportunities to work with new technologies, there's definitely a heavy emphasis on using  open source tools, openly encouraged to build with new instead of old. In terms of my personal experience, this includes backend, frontend, and DevOps. 
- No issues  obtaining tools you need to do your job (software, hardware). This may be team dependent. 
- People are willing to share their knowledge within the company. There are many ways to do this and it is encouraged. 

Environment
- Lots of smart people in the company with varying levels of experience. You can learn a lot from them. 
- For the most part, pretty relaxed environment. People can dress fairly casually. 
- The building itself is pretty nice, and a new one is being built as well. 
- Snacks! This might also be team dependent. 

Benefits
- Excellent 401k matching. 
- Other benefits are industry standard for the most part, but are solid.","Performance Management
- You are expected to essentially compete against other people of your level. Even if you perform pretty well for your project and your team approves of your work, it may not be enough. 

Technology
- Since there has been such a shift to use new technologies, there is a lot of change within the technology stack. If you use an application which integrates with other new applications/systems, there is definitely some growing pains and a learning curve. 
- Still in the process of updating legacy software and integrating with legacy systems. Still need some time to fully go modern in terms of the stack. 
- Agile is pushed but there still needs to be refinement in terms of how it's implemented. Not sure how different organizations handle this, but there needs to be a FULL buy in from all parties (business and tech) otherwise it leads to many inefficiencies and Agile in name.  

Environment
- Probably a case of preference, but it's mostly an open floor plan. Some people can be loud across the room and you can hear them. 
- I wish work from home was more acceptable on a regular basis. It is definitely possible to do this occasionally but it is not encouraged. This is also probably team dependent."

So if a customer wanted a big withdrawal we would have to wait a while until the slow lead teller decided she wanted to get you more money. The cash advance machine was ALWAYS broken,As well as the ATM machine that was on the outside of the building. But some how getting a new coffee machine was not a problem.

They have lost numerous people (who are great employees) simply due to policy and weak management not willing to stand up to precedence for team members. 

Capital One presents itself as a technology savvy bank. However I can only attribute this presentation to the marketing department because within the technology departments I worked in the people in charge had no understanding of their products or the technology necessary to produce quality.

Capital one does at least try to make the cubical experience engaging. They have games and contest consistently going on. Capital One advertises itself as :A work place that is extemely focused on its employees work/life 
balance
 Tis  is NOT true.To explain this I will have to share my personal experience here. When I was hired but Capital One I was told that schedule changes are common and that I would likely have the opportunity to change my schedule within the next 3-6months.
I was not worried about the schedule at the time, but it was comforting to know I worked somewhere so flexable. 
soon after I was hired my husband recieved an offer to move to a better position at his job- but it would put him in a conflicting schedule. 
We were not hesitant for him to switch at the time: because I would soon be have the oportunity to switch my schedule right?- WRONG. I have been employed for a year now. 
I request a schedule change nearly
 everyday from my coach. I have been doing so for over 6 months now.
I see my husband maybe 6hrs during the week. During our weekends my
husband and myself have committed ourselfs to serving in the Military. I have communicated that this is very difficult, as I cant even seem to find time to squeeze in conversation about bills, or building a family.
Every time I mention a schedule change I feel it falls on deaf ears. I have seen others schedules change, and everyone that was in my hiring class has had the ability to change thier schedule long ago. There is no system for schedule changes- it doesnt matter if you preform, or are a more senior employee. I have seen non preforming, and  recently hired employees be offered options to change thier schedules. I know that there is no system in place, because I have asked: so that I myself could meet those requirements. I had a coach suggest I fake a school schedule that would allow them to change my work schedule. 
It seem ridiculous that the schedule is ""not avalible"" but if Im willing to lie about it then it is. 
The other issue, is moving up.
In the call center in order to move positions you have to hit specific sales percentage for a certain amount of time. It makes it very easy to move up: if you apply yourself to sales. However, it also means the guy that sits next to you and comes in late half the time may get promoted before you: if he sells more. So its not based off of the employees preformance as a whole, but rather who is better in sales. It is a sales position, not a customer service position. If you understand that then you will be fine. 
Capital One over all has good benifits and the overall culture is pretty upbeat. Howerver I find that the position and the company was misrepresented to me during the hiring process. I suggest doing careful research of whatever position you are consisdering with CapitalOne. I would not recommend a friend to work in this position.Basic Call center issues make this position difficult: like only being allotted a certain amount of time to use the restroom.

Performance appraisal process creates bitterness and unhealthy competition between peers.  The company stresses the value of 'team' but the performance process is directly opposed to it.

If you make it to the next level, you are placed into a stretch role, which means you aren't promoted technically for a year. There are 3 levels for every one compared with most companies in the industry, so these are baby steps. You must have a very high energy level and communicate a certain way to be successful. Lots of buzz words.  Highly competitive. Lots of hype, not as much is actually accomplished compared with the intensity. There is an overly zealous focus on several different forms of documentation. Several groups work on the same solutions at once and may the first to deliver a mediocre presentation win. Culture caters to 20 somethings, and not many are older than 40.

7899,Capital One,Capital One - A great place to work (generally),2016-06-21,4.0,,"Overall Capital One is a great place to work.  At least in the Richmond tri-cities area, they are near the top of the list in compensation and benefits (including a very generous bonus each year based on performance, training/certifications, and health options - free health consultants and discounted gym memberships).  Furthermore, because there is constant change  (which I've also listed as a con), if you don't like what you're doing, you don't have to worry about doing it very long!  Finally, Capital One allows, and even encourages, lateral movement across the organization.  Many people move from technology roles to business/operations roles and vice versa in order to gain a holistic view of the company and to find their niche.","Like many fast paced companies, there are constant reorgs at Capital One,  and you should expect to be shifted around a couple of times a year.  While this allows for growth to those who embrace it, it can be a bit unsettling at times and keeps many on edge around the security of their job.   If you can accept that change is inevitable and that job security is a myth in the 21st century, then you will be fine.

Because of the competitive salary and benefits, Capital One has a stringent and somewhat difficult performance management process that consumes about a month of the year each year (at least for people managers).  This involves calibrating associates (often in different role types) - often an apples and oranges comparison that can seem somewhat unfair.  As such, there is little room for ""individual performers"" who do not display strong leadership qualities.   Again, once you understand and accept the process, this is not an issue."

Last year, COF laid off a lot of people but I don't believe a single H1B employee was affected at least not in Plano. Loan Servicing technology middle management is made up of ex-WIPRO employees with no prior experience to working for a US based company resulting in Managers who don't know the ABC's of management. I have seen Managers talk down to people,shout at people in meetings (especially at contractors who cannot fight back), be condescending and just downright rude. Lot of politics. You need to suck up if you have to get ahead or even get a good rating. Employees are constantly compared to their peers which hampers team spirit. There are other divisions in the company where things are much better than what it is in Loan Servicing IT. There were multiple management changes and each VP brings with him/her an idea of  what technology we need to use. This results in Engineers having to become jack of all trades and master of none. If someone cannot keep up with learning new tech every 6 months, then your mgr will get the chance to give you a negative rating, either forcing you to quit the company or fire you so they can hire a H1B."

The company has no idea what NPS really is when bigger companies such as Apple doesn't use that to coach agents they use CSAT (customer satisfaction).  The customers will give agents 100 across the board but not promote company because they outsource jobs or change made to rewards program but yet it's the agents job to fix them. A joke! Your family does not matter in order to get your schedule changed they give a set of criteria then change it during selection process to meet the needs of the favorites. No morale boosters oh and don't live two hours away if your internet goes down you are expected to come on site to work and won't be reimbursed for travel. The things you learn in training won't be used when you start production. Hours are not great for parents especially with small kids.

The food and coffee is amazing.  The company is highly collaborative.","So here's what happens.  You get unhealthy and you fight the docs, you will also end up fighting the companies' internal HR policies.  Good luck if you have disabilities documented or not.  IT WILL BE AN UPHILL BATTLE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SOMETHING STRAIGHTFORWARD.  I'm a disabled veteran and I'm still having difficulties and my disability is completely documented with the VA.  

FYI they will give you options if you cannot get the correct documentation.  The HR processes can be arduous.

1.     Return to work   *****MOST LIKELY could result in failure***
2.     Resign from Capital One (you will be eligible for rehire based on voluntary resignation term reason)  **You're without a job**
3.     Be terminated from Capital One based on attendance policy  **You're without a job**

The point i'm making here is that you are up a creek without a paddle and despite all of your efforts, they are running a business and would like to happily run it without you.  Beware.  

Overall, I'm a very positive person, but the reward system and the disability management is very poor in this company.  We're not asking for a free ride or anything, we just need a SAFE place to operate, that's all.   The funny thing is the company has disability recruiters who are full aware of options, but somehow I made it through without the proper support which I'm fully aware of now.  

Managers are technical managers and will not be invested in you until you are at a higher level.  

There is a reorganization going on - take it for what its worth.

They are not always as willing to learn new tech.  Or use web-based technologies to make their lives better."

I also very much appreciate their hiring process, which focuses as much on your character and chemistry with your potential teammates as your technical chops. I enjoy the people I work with now even more than close friends whose companies I've worked for in the past.","Capital One's non-tech departments have a little ideological catching up to do. Not a lot, but some.

There's definitely a gap in understanding between the agile/lean methodology of the tech department and the more numerical timeline-/goal-oriented mentality of the company at large.

Luckily, it's not a conflict or a war—just difference in backgrounds. One that I believe can (and will) be overcome with more communication between the two."

I have met some very intelligent and talented people here.","Capital One has a 'follow-the-leader' mentality. They are now convinced that they are an app company, since that is in vogue. They were a bank during the recession and banks were receiving bailouts.  Once the tech bubble bursts, they will follow the newest sexiest trend, who know idea or commitment to what that really entails. 

A very unstable, hostile work environment. The review process forces you to hold back when supporting your peers and always make sure that you have something over them. Not only do you have to be a politician, you better make sure that your direct supervisor is a politician too.  

I have seen many great workers ruined because the higher ups didn't like their supervisor.  If you fall into an unpopular team by chance, you are screwed. 

Incompetent middle managers are there due to nepotism and/or favoritism. They will move form ruining one team after another every year or two. They will be gone just before the complete garbage of their contribution is fully realized to the tone-deaf upper management.  If you're lucky, a competent manager will take over and start to turn the team around. But even in this case, they too will be gone before too long. 

More layoffs are coming later this year, while the CEO will continue to be in the top most overpaid CEOS in America list (according to Forbes).

8241,Capital One,Great people/team members; not so much management,2016-03-04,2.0,Marketing,"People are some of the brightest, smartest and most motivated and creative that you'll ever encounter. True team and partnership mentality. Associates encouraged to build skills, knowledge (if they're associates) if they can find the time (and that's always the issue). Teams across company are dedicated and hard working. Teams trying hard to really find best ways to be more digital. Customer service and the customer are truly at heart across the organization - not just lip service; associates and leaders really mean it. Great benefits, buildings/facilities are awesome.  Some flexibility in work schedule - most people work from home on Fridays or school holidays, etc.","So many layoffs and reorgs in US Card that leaders down through associates are leaving rapidly. They're sick of all the changes. With the mass migration, all associates are overworked. Although US Card is focused on being more of a digital leader, they don't get it and aren't hiring or training people to get the right skills. I learned more in 1 year way from COF in a digital role than I learned in 4 years there. They're still too slow to change.  

Mid level management (Sr Mgr - Sr Director) is overworked; need more training and time to be effective mentors and managers. Pressure is so high that leaders are micromanaging and expecting perfection when associates are working 50 hrs a week. The whole work-life balance that COF touted for years is a joke. It doesn't exist anymore. 

Work and roles are too siloed and sub categorized. Too many people doing just one role when they could combine (for example, brand, corporate communications, PR - you don't need one role who just publishes articles intranet or creates templates, presentations, sends emails. Combine that into each PR/Brand/Comms role and give person opportunity to  more than just be an email/article publishing jockey). 

Too  many clunky and limiting processes, although that's slowly improving with Agile and process management methodologies being implemented across the company. 

Hard to get promoted unless you're a superstar because of the performance management program. If you accept a job there, expect to be in it at least 4-5 years. You can always move to another team in a lateral move. If you're a contractor, expect that you won't be treated that well. You'll need to just do whatever junk work is left over at the end of the day that the lowest level associates don't want to do."

8253,Capital One,Abandon hope all ye who enter here,2016-03-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Full time employees get the normal benefits (health, dental, vision, time off, etc.), though the benefits are nowhere near as good as they used to be before Capital One bought this company (we used to be ShareBuilder, owned by ING Direct).","Where do I begin?

1. Leadership is always saying they want people to bring new ideas and question how things are done, but if you ever begin questioning things you are quickly shot down.

2. The CEO of the company, Rich Fairbank, touts a work/life balance that seems to apply only to him. Salaried employees are expected to constantly travel and put in hours upon hours of work but when he goes on his annual ""Strategy Roadshow"" he can't even be bothered to come to Seattle. He spins this as a sweet little story about not wanting to spend time away from his family, but it's just disrespectful. The rest of us spend plenty of time away from our families. FUN FACT: When Capital One says you have the option to work from home, it usually doesn't mean you get to stay home and work. More often than not, you come home from a long day's work at the office and just keep working remotely.

3. As others have pointed out, the annual review process is a joke. Associates are stack ranked against each other and their managers are thrown into the pit to decide who gets what bonus. If you had an incredible year of work but your manager doesn't speak up (or another manager argues better for one of their people, regardless of what they accomplished in reality) you're going to get the shaft. Period. It's a political mess and neither your dedication to the company's values nor the quality of your work have any bearing on your bonus.

4. Possibly because of the review process, there is a culture of withholding information and taking credit for work done by others that permeates through a majority of the organization.

I could go on, but this should be enough to make reasonable people second guess accepting an interview."

The work life balance if great and I think it's one of the reasons much of the tech staff has been patient but that's waining","The re-org that took place in order to move teams onto new technology platforms was needed but with the change getting drug out over 6 months it was the most poorly executed change I've seen.  

The company is using the stack ranking approach that Microsoft abandoned after much churn last year.  The end result is you could be doing stellar work but 

* if your manager isn't politically connected your chance of getting a good bonus is slim
* If your manager is shy or lays back you won't get the bonus you should
* Your manager can only hold up a limited number of names so if they have too many they won't be holding you up for a good bonus


And my favorite (encountered this year)
* If you changed managers once or twice during the year the manager at the end doesn't need to incorporate feedback or scoring from previous managers so you don't get the bonus you should.

I went to talk with someone who has been here a long time.  Her response was that yes, this isn't uncommon and you just have to find a different manager."

Have seen blacks and Indians targeted over the last few yrs in such a way that I'm surprised there is no law suits.

Performance management system in combination with the above reality causes some people to be solely competitive rather than collaborative.  People who are promoted deserve it.  Some hard working dedicated associates could end up on the wrong side of the system.  It is unfortunate as they add value.  I feel it is an unintended consequence."

Employees who worked there many years are very knowledgable and courteous","I've worked here since 2004 and the company isn't what it used to be. Too many levels, too many layers, way too many folks involved you don't know who is who. They're hiring directors and VPs who aren't leaders they're taskmasters. Very hard to get work done given very frequent org changes. Even Rich Fairbanks who I loved has changed his soul and tries to be hip and it isn't working. I loved this company, but it is going downhill culturally. If you're into the hipster scene and you like buzzwords and kissing butt, you'll do fine."

There are not much pros about this company .","Though the vision of the company is to become another FB , Google , Yahoo , Intuit they do not have the resources , caliber or the balls to become one in current market . This company is probably few years behind compared to any true tech company . The commitment ( verbal ) is to build the skill set or to hire people who can or are proficient with coding aspects of emerging technologies but they necessary doesn't show while implementing it. All it cares about is being politically right and definitely people can get promoted who are good Project managers or who can suck up to their management .

-The performance management system is completely out of whack.  All departments have completely different stances on promotions and raises, so equality is basically non-existent, but you are still rated against your ""peers"" (aka those with the same job title as you) at year-end, regardless of what your individual jobs entail.  The system also basically tries to eliminate any attempts at negotiation of salary by delivering the final decision to you in a tidy little package with seemingly no other options.
-The pay is much lower than the industry standard.

Working in complaints there were always lots of bonuses to be had, awards to be won and socials to get involved with. Flexible working hours arrangements to fit around your life/travel. Great holiday allowance. Managers followed a process and so they couldn't go too wrong and the senior team were visible.","Rewards and bonuses within complaints team were there to create as much output as possible and I was never entirely sure that the customer was always getting the best service as the staff (myself included) were solely driven by money and reward. 
Temps and fixed term staff offered no security and generally fobbed off for as long as possible with regards to what may happen with role, particularly when nearing end of fixed term. I and all people on same contract as me were given minimum notice and I know full well that it was done intentionally to prevent productivity dropping off. (As that was the be all and end all)
Promotion generally happened to management's favourite people. It was never about what you knew...always who you knew."

8399,Capital One,Bad for females,2016-01-26,2.0,Data Analyst,Flexibility since you will be given Laptops. Compensation is good,"Since Male-Female ratio is not good. Being a female employee you might have to face lots of challenges if you are not willing to compromise on several factors. If you do not want to get involved with co-workers, then be ready for unfair treatment, ratings and work related challenges. The lobby culture is quite popular here and if your are not part of any lobby, you will be sidelined badly. Policies are good but when you want to avail it, you will be denied."

Job became nebulous and difficult to perform in the wake of so many organizational and mission changes.","Extremely difficult to get a promotion. The process expects that you work at the next level (in a ""stretch role"") for at least six months, sometimes a year, without any increase in pay. Additionally, the process states that there must be a need for someone at the next level in order for a position to be open. But since you're already doing the job while you're at the lower level, there's never a need to promote you or pay you more. Massively unfair catch-22. 

Nearly constant org changes. Very little value put on consistency of management presence -- it wasn't unusual for people to have 5 or more managers in a single year. The Virginia sites seem unable or unwilling to work with other sites across the nation. The culture on the Capital One campus in VA is strong, but they did not know how to make that culture work outside of VA."

Campus is great and the ability to work mobile/remote is valued. Some managers care about their employees and can be great mentors/leaders.  Opportunity exists to move around and try different jobs as wanted.","Performance management is brutal.  You are expected to achieve at a high level all the time and continue to take on more and more.  There is no work-life balance (trust me, I was there for over 15 years and I know what that looked like in the past).  If you don't work at least 50+ hours then you will be lucky to get a strong (meets expectations) rating.  Constant reorgs/shuffle of leadership.  More and more the focus is to bring in new college level resources and to hire outside management.  Most of old school Capital One leadership has been shipped out.  Also, promotion process is more about who you know (political) than your actual value/abilities.  It is a meat grinder at time...culture is now about what have you done for me today.  I definitively feel bad about how things are there now (have many friends there, all anxious about what will come next and if their job will be move to another location or cut or even managed out if they don't want to continue to work long hours with high stress)."

The pay and benefits are great and the people who work there are amazingly supportive and wonderful. I can not say enough of how well they treat employees and the amazing work life balance.,The only con was that being such a collaborative culture does sometimes slow down movement on projects. Also if not on a main campus you don't get as many perks (such as on site cafeteria or gym).

They really do not care about technologists. Very political. Even providing creative solutions that save the company lot of money will not get you rewarded. Layoffs every 3 to 6 months. Constant team changes every 6 months. I would not recommend this place for technologists if you want to rise up in career.

Of course, it will vary but I've been to several branches for training and everybody was nice. They aren't as pushy when it comes to sales goals like CHASE or Citi, but you are still expected to prospect each customer you take and offer them a product or to sit down with a banker. Retail banking is sales so its no surprise.",Branch Managers that micro-manage their employees.
8420,Capital One,Data Scientist at Capital One,2016-01-20,5.0,,"(1) Interesting work: Capital One satisfies all three rules of the ""advice to data scientist on where to work"", as provided by Stitchfix. We leverages data Science for its strategic differentiation; we already have great data to work with (as opposed to aspiration to great data); and we are applying big data technologies to many green field opportunities for the first time. 

(2) Great team and great learning opportunities: since data scientist is still a relatively new profession, one of the most important criteria in my mind is whether you can still learn new things on the job. Capital One as a company is strategically embracing open-source technologies such as Hadoop, python/R, Spark, AWS... etc, and there are many open-minded and experienced data scientists on the team, so that we can still continue to improve our capabilities.

(3) Competitive compensation and great work-life balance. The work life balance is definitely encouraged here. Some people have long commute, but if their job nature allows them to work from home, there is no cultural stigma associated with that. In fact, several members in our extended team work from home on a regular basis (a few days a week).

(4) Company culture: we really are changing banking for good, and the actions we take as company reflect this core value.","Financial industry is heavily regulated as a whole, so if you are used to software-industry speeds, you may feel that things don't move as quickly (especially on things that concerns financial regulations)"

8440,Capital One,Treasury management,2016-01-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Treasury at Capital One is filled with amazing potential.  The excitement is so thick you can feel it from everyone.   The innovative approach pioneered by the card group flows throughout the organization.  Almost everyone is supportive and encourages using the consultative approach and adapting new practices for the improvement of the bank.,"Management is too 'old school' bank focused.  There is a glacial pace around innovation that is extremely contrasted with the card side of the bank.  Management is quick to use buzzwords and speak the language of design thinking, agile methods, but when a decision point is reached the team reverts back to traditional, waterfall style management.  This lack of real innovation is coupled with a horrible political management style that is promotes through who you know more than what you produce.  It is a shame because there is so much potential waiting to explode out of the commercial bank the tension is exhausting.  The better team is small business."

8551,Capital One,Be aware of what you're getting into,2015-12-11,2.0,,Excellent pay for my field,"Good old boy network is in full force at Cap 1. I am in a technical role and expected for the stellar pay that everyone hired would have commensurate technical abilities. 80% of my team had NO TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE at all and were hired to run a data center. Out of those 80%, ALL of them were ""buddy"" hires. Cap 1 works on antiquated tech policies that are barriers to getting anything resolved quickly. It's as if all Cap 1 full time employees came from the government sector. The brilliant idea to hire offshore technical support is just asinine. In my 2 years here I have only met one offshore counterpart that knew anything that could be remotely construed as actual technical knowledge. The money they lose in downtime of systems alone is mind-boggling.  

Now for the bad news. Ready? If you're a contractor you have a 2 year life span. That wouldn't be so bad if you went into the gig knowing that, but most likely your recruiter fails to mention that. In fact no one on my team knew that until almost their 2 yr mark. Several people only had a 2 week notice their contract was ending. This was 4 days after Management came in to address that we would be there for several more years despite technical changes to their model. Apparently no one, including Cap 1 Mgmt or the Recruiters ""knew"" it was a 2 yr contract, as if it was a surprise to them. Ironically, my entire team reported to and was directly managed by Cap 1 mgmt. And with that announcement came the real face of Cap 1.  After stringing us on with becoming full time employees for two years, we suddenly became anathema--- just disposable contractors. I couldn't even get management to return my emails on anything, including their plan to supposedly bring us back on after a 90 day hiatus. Neither could my co workers. They did bring two people over as full time associates prior to the announcement. And ironically, they were two members of the good ol' boy network. 

That aside, management is clueless. They are all ""yes men"" marching in lockstep to edicts from above that are devoid of reality in the trenches. The pay was great, there was little politics I had to deal with at my level, but the reality is you;re a second class citizen and no amount of hard work, loyalty, or dedication is going to change that. If you go into it knowing it's at MOST a 2 yr contract and can plan accordingly with that, you should be fine. Don't buy into the hype though, mostly they are looking for warm bodies to fill positions as a numbers game because their inefficiency and productivity isn't one of their concerns apparently."

The dialer is a disaster and crashes half the time. 

My manager was atrociously bad. If questioned, she would put her own team members off onto another manager because she didn't know the answers to problems. She yelled at staff and encouraged them to quit if they fell below 100% because they would make her look bad. She had the ""best"" Mini Miranda team in the location because she would bully and humiliate employees until they quit. 


The system and phones were slow and often crashed or hung up on customers. It was not uncommon for the computer to freeze and crash once a day or more. The entire system would crash for the entire site and we would have irate customers screaming at us while we couldn't use the system to take payments.


The QA team is extremely meticulous, which is fine, except agents are not trained on what counts against them. There is varying answers among teams. You will almost never get a legitimate answer because every single manager believes QA does something differently. These passings/failings mean you don't get bonuses depending on how bad you did."

The pay is high for the Richmond area and the benefits are better/as good as any other company around.,"The culture is now of a BIG bank and they now have lost the culture that originally drove folks to apply.  The performance management system is rigid, political and competitive to a fault (I am a high-performing associate, but don't like how it works - good people get screwed over).  There are continual cuts every year, and it seemingly is targeting long-time/older folks in the workforce.  A ton of experience has been redeployed from the company over the years.  There is a move to Mclean, DL, and Chicago for jobs, so Richmond has the most limited hiring, which limits your options for growth.

8695,Capital One,"Innovative, congenial culture - definitely not your traditional bank!",2015-10-29,4.0,"Principal Associate, Scrum Master","I've been there 5 years, working mostly in Card Technology, and the company feels more like a vibrant academic laboratory than a stuffy corporate office. It's a real dynamic, open, collaborative and modern environment. There's a huge corporate focus on innovation, and my colleagues are extremely intelligent and hardworking. Company is a great place if you are personally open to change and dynamic (and I mean constant change every 6 months in terms of organizational structure and strategic priorities); on the other hand, it's not a great place if you are a old time 'good ole boys' kind of banker. Another positive is the organization is structured around cross-functional teams and so usually decisions are driven by consensus and not by a single authority - so the decision making process on almost any task requires continuous collaboration among associates at all levels and roles. GREAT company if you are right out of college and looking for meaningful work. College hires are given meaningful work and given a wide latitude of ownership. Also the benefits packages are great: 7.5% 401(k) matching, medical / dental / vision plans, and (while definitely on the lower end) there's modest educational assistance although some star middle-manger performers are given full-funded MBA tuition. WORK/LIFE balance is awesome! You get 3 weeks vacation plus 10 paid holidays and unlimited sick time (within reason). Overall, associates are super friendly, congenial and excited to come to work. It's really this entrepreneurial, hardworking and amiable culture that's kept me here.","Given the company's 'start up' feel there's no real career pathing. This can either excite you or distress you - and it's not uncommon in some areas for an associate to have sometimes 4-5 people managers in 1 year. Capital One really requires you to 'own your career,' meaning it's up to you to manage your manager, write your objectives, and move your career at the company in the direction you want it to go. I find this exciting but others get burned out by what they feel is lack of support and direction. But on the plus side I've never had a manager who didn't encourage me to explore new opportunities. Another downside is performance management can overly focus on softer items like communication, etc. which can seem at times nit picky and trivial, ignoring meatier results and hard skills."

We are only a number here and truly hold no value to the company. We were told they would rather hire new employees than to invest in current employees. A lot of favoritism, very obvious. If you are not a favorite no chance for advancement. Work life balance is not what they preach especially if you are on the lowered end of the pay scale, you have to work longer hours to even compare to your peers.

People can embrace change if it is well presented and implemented as a smooth transition as opposed to the shot gun approach used currently. Many of the current senior leaders are relatively new to the company (less than 5 years)and have made drastic changes to the culture of the company with less and less focus on people over processes and tools. Associates are not respected and receive important communications via pre-recorded messages or email with no ability to ask questions. The recent exodus of key leaders is concerning and politics is king as the remaining leaders try to keep their jobs and newer leaders attempt to make their mark."

In more recent years they seem to have lost their way. Coherent, integrated strategy is lacking. Performance management focuses only on results and bright shiny objects. Managers have a cursory knowledge of how to effectively manage people, and leadership is lacking all around. Some departments are hiring only externally and ignoring internal candidates in favor of fresh blood. Ironically, this hasn't done much to improve the quality or speed of products coming out, nor has it helped overall morale. Most people I know here are smart, capable and deeply unhappy - they see it as a means to an end. A lot are trapped as this is one of the top employers in Richmond. This will change over the years as new companies start to move to town, but evolution here is slow. The people who are the most successful here are the ones most willing to play the game and play at the expense of others in many cases. A lot of senior management has been here since the beginning of time, and this is all they know."

It's a dynamic environment in which you are always challenged to do great work.

If you are a young engineer or developer you are currently primed for a good run at Capital One.","Like any large corporation, decisions at the top of the house don't always play out well for the rank and file. After two tours of duty resulting in two layoffs Capital One became an increasingly tough place to work and move up.

A very hierarchical environment. COF wants to portray as a cutting edge technology company, while the core business is financial services. Everyone is after the ""coolness factor"" and just hop on buzzwords like cloud, big data, devops etc. and there is too much talk and no much output.  Changes are too frequent, and layoffs at unexpected time, when you think the company is doing great. Recently, management thinks software programming is the only great job and wants all IT folks to do coding work."
8853,Capital One,Too Many Changes,2015-09-20,3.0,Senior Process Manager,"Great people. Work/life balance is top notch, and depending on one's position, there is a lot of flexibility for working remotely or at different sites.","Too many changes and too many layoffs, especially if tenured, well performing employees.

It's very progressive, both in business and in its social stances and efforts. It's large, but its structure feels relative flat, and they value independent input and questions. They don't squash down constructive dissent, they welcome it. They don't brace against change, they embrace it.","They embrace change, and so you can expect a lot of it. That makes day-to-day work challenging at times (but also exciting), and it may mean that you get changed right out of the picture, which is what is happening to me as part of a site closure. That said, they've been more supportive about that change and transition than you can imagine, so even that isn't very much of a con."

Definitely need a Type A-go-getter-Activator (make things happen) kind of person-which I think one needs overall to be in the banking industry and you'll fit well with the corporate culture.  Fortunate to be part of retail branch teams that really had a good team mentality kind of culture which I think comes from the corporate culture in general.,I would not exactly call it a con but something to be aware of before applying and when hired and working for and with the company.  They have not been in banking as long as other banks so up your adaptability skills even more so.  They have definitely grown and evolved over the years.  I left awhile ago (not b/c of this) so ask someone who is currently working there if you can to get an even more accurate picture in the retail banking segment of this corporation.

While there is a vision of where we want to be and an understanding of where we are, there isn't a clear direction of how to get from A to Z. It feels like every year the company is changing direction and what you've been working on for the past year is no longer worth anything. 

Plus there is a pressure in the IT department for everyone to be able to do everything - which will only lead to everyone to being the jack of all trades but the master of none. 

Also, for a company that want to be the google of banking, they need to do more to remove barriers to innovation."

8899,Capital One,Great Company With A Lacking Culture,2015-09-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Working at Capital One was honestly a breath of fresh air compared to a number of other financial call centers and how they interacted with their customer base. There was more of a focus on customer satisfaction and resolution rather than sales or time spent on a phone. Supervisor roles were given great autonomy to take care of phone agents with customer concerns as well as develop needed work skills to attain new or promoted positions within the company. The people were always amazing to see and you really felt like the people you worked with were a second family.,"The major downside I had with Capital One is that they have an almost forced culture of doing the right thing and being encouraged to promote new ideas/concerns to company leadership. This all sounded good to the front line/customer facing associates, but rarely anything was ever done with agent feedback or ideas and simply stowed away for tracking purposes. Reasons that action was rarely taken was a lack of resources within certain departments or more often than not self serving interests of senior leadership did not feel the proposed feedback was important or necessary at that time."

The performance management process needs a complete overhaul and do not match the company's values. 360 feedback reviews are a political tick the box exercise and are a complete waste of time. Cross calibrations in some business units unfairly penalize certain positions if they do not fit into a standardized job description. Middle management is poorly trained in people skills and does not encourage career development, despite the encouragement from senior management (VP+). As a result, advancement is nearly impossible, based on favoritism, and is definitely not merit-based.

Choices on gear such as iPhone 6 vs Galaxy S6 (and 64 GB models too) and Mac vs PC. Even better, techies get administrative permissions on their computers and access to the latest software tools, patches, etc. That was seriously shocking.

Very good location, near Mel Lastman Square, so close to subways, shops, and lots of good restaurants (especially if you like Asian cuisine). Facilities have really nice spots for more casual relaxation or comfy work with a cafe, foosball, pingpong, x-box, and more. 

Work-life balance is more than expression, it actually exists and encouraged. There are fun days, opportunities to engage in charitable efforts, and more. It's refreshing to work in company that actually encourages you to get out and involved on company time.

The company sees itself as being a digital technology leader that happens to be in the financial world. From the CEO on down, the plan is lean, agile, tech savvy, and future focussed with a willingness to spend to make it happen. You can't ask for much better as a techie, but even for non-techies this is good. Bringing in agile coaches and scrum masters to help their business teams become agile is well-nigh unheard of and is great news because, in my experience, many attempts at agile software development die on the vine because the business doesn't go along with them.","It's not all sunshine and roses, obviously, but the cons are not that bad and many are starting to get knocked down.

Capital One is in a very regulated industry, banking, and so there are some rather onerous processes and gates to get through much of the time. The company does want to fix this, but that's a slow moving change and much of that is related to risk mitigation.

The company is still very meeting oriented and many of them don't actually resolve anything. It is improving, but I've never had 6 concurrent bookings in my life until Capital One! Mind you, nobody seems terribly offended if you skip their meeting."

You are sold on the idea that Capital One wishes to hire people to take care of their customers, and the customer is king/queen and all that matters is your amazing skills with the customer.  In fact it is an ""inbound call center""  looking for butts in chairs.  Once you are past the sales pitch  of HR  you realize you didn't read the fine print someplace along the way.  In your role as work at home customer service front line agent, be prepared to play C.Y.A. to the extreme.   You will be blamed for any problem that exists within the company.  From technical issues to legitimate customer complaints you attempt to escalate for resolution, it's all entirely YOUR fault.  No one else is doing anything wrong at this company EXCEPT the front line employee. You can be fired in a heartbeat for anything at all.  I quit in disgust, but after talking to persons who were fired, there is never any hard fact to back up what managers say.   They can apparently say anything at all and HR just goes along and signs off. 

 If you look back at reviews you will see a very negative one from 2010.  I feel the same way today and it is 2015.  You will also see an ""answer"" from management stating ""we have an open door policy reach out to us""  That was around 2 years ago.  I have no idea who is above my up-line manager, the name of my site HR representatives, nor even who manages this site.     The only person i can reach out to is my manager who is going to write me up any chance they get, and never educates me as to what I can do to improve my performance.   In fact my manager does not follow company procedures when it comes to customers. It is clearly stated that it is part of our job to call customers back at time of their choosing if we cannot resolve their issue within the call.  A representative is supposed to be given time to make these calls.  However you are not.  You must make these call backs when you have ""slow time"".  It is currently back to back calls without even a second of breathing room in between.  Well if you don't make your outbound calls then you are going to get  people on your back for that.  This is just one example of how entirely impossible this company is.   If you are a person who can figure out how to cheat the system and likes sucking up to your boss and is totally self absorbed and likes to lie to customers then this job is right up your alley.   If you are used to facing problems straight on, coming up with solutions to them, and having this heard and implemented, then not the company for you.  If you are used to teamwork and consulting your manager and other departments in the interest of putting your heads together to work out issues for the customer, this is not the place for you.   If you believe that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect from the janitor on up to the top, this is not the place for you.  You will see plenty of good reviews for this company.  Most likely they were sent an e-mail, and given time off the phone and told to complete a ""survey"" all within the watchful eye of a manager.  Because I don't know a person I have talked to that feels in any way this company is  doing what is right."
9000,Capital One,"Great place to work, but check group turnover before accepting a position",2015-08-18,4.0,Senior Director,"Challenging, team - oriented environment.  Great place to learn and develop critical skills, including effective communication and consensus - driven decision making.  Senior management team is exceptional and the reason I joined the company.","Quality of life differs significantly from team to team.  Before accepting a position with Capital One, try to learn promotion timing and turnover data for your prospective team.  It was striking to me how in one department, associates on two teams had entirely different experiences."
9001,Capital One,Questionable Values,2015-08-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"benefits, starting salaries are pretty good, mostly a good culture","if you are not a female, moving up can be really difficult in certain divisions.  Capital One's focus on being a top employer for working mothers overpowers promoting people for their respective contributions.  Even their benefits are very slanted toward providing more protection to females.  If you are a male with a disability, you can forget being treated equally. I would certainly never go as far to say that women in the workplace have had it easy, but does it make it right to punish males for this??  It's a new day and age, time to move forward and recognize people for their contributions equally."
9002,Capital One,Awesome Company,2015-08-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,EXCELLENT culture; fantastic learning opportunities; great benefits.

9006,Capital One,Nothing but smokes and mirrors,2015-08-17,2.0,Senior Coordinator,"The benefits are fabulous at Capital One and the free coffee was great. The office I have worked at was also conveniently placed, close to public transportations.","For my couple of years with Capital One, we were promised a better salary as it was much lower than the competitor. This promise was only keep for the least paid employees, many of the employees slightly higher were completely ignored. Promotions were also very iffy. Very often promised to be open internally first but many of the new promotions are often announced late or hidden from internal employees. Many of the new promotions are also ""reserved"" to preselected candidates and employees are often discouraged or prevented from applying to new position. Job security is also a big issue there, employees were laid-off even if they had decades of tenure with the company and as someone who had access to their performance numbers, I can attest that the reason was not their performance.

I also did get laid off so it may seem that my opinion may be biased but consider this. I worked very long hours off the clock (overtime was discouraged), including Christmas eve and Christmas day. My position involved very specific work and against impossible odds, I did manage to keep myself on time with everything. I was laid off under the pretext that I did not perform well in certain areas that was not the main focus of my position. Evaluations from peers also went against my superiors' opinion on those performance points. 

My goal here is show you that I never felt that it was a great place to work. Surveys were forced to us and the worry of a prying eye often forced people to give a positive score no matter what."
9007,Capital One,Traveled a long way to find out it was just like everywhere else,2015-08-17,2.0,Manager,"At first, Capital One seemed to be an ideal place where customer service and associate engagement were not contradictions in terms.  Certainly the site management, with a few legacy HSBC exceptions, did their part to ensure the culture was maintained.  The front line incentive has been generous and based only on QA scores, no sales.  The company seemed to be dedicated to bringing customer service work back in-house and on-shore in spite of the expense, and made multiple investments in the site and associates to underscore it.","The punch line is that Capital One hired a new Sr VP of Card Channels, and her vision was to outsource more service work under the guise that it was needed to be ""scalable"" in a more digital world.  Also blamed was the city for not making it easy to recruit or retain employees.  All of that seems like a ruse.  The truth is that the folks in Richmond and McLean want to control everything and don't want in-house leaders making them look bad.  If you are seriously looking at a Capital One job outside of HQ, recommend you pass because they are likely to up and move at any time."

Want to be a ""tech"" company, but are a large financial institution.  This conflicts with federal regulations/controls/and risk reduction practices needed to support a financial institution.  Also has a tendency to do a full pendulum swing verses really thinking through broadscale shifts in direction.  In this new agile world, senior leadership should pilot, implement, learn in smaller pockets vs. taking an all or nothing approach to everything they do.

If you find yourself in a category that is not valued, you will likely never be promoted. Don't let them convince you otherwise.

If you are being hired in as a professional - not college - hire, make sure you are at the correct level. HR/hiring managers are notorious for interviewing at one level and then offering the role at the level down, saying they want to ""set you up for success"" and you can get promoted in 6 months. It is not true and you will never catch up to the right level.

""Reorgs"" happen at least every 6 months. Usually these involve layoffs and massive organizational challenges. I had managers in the double digits by 3 years in. Very disruptive both for getting work done and also for career trajectories.

Super hierarchical; no one owns anything, so it's hard to get decisions made, and when they're made, they can be undone by one person questioning the decision or thinking something else; highly regulated environment; lots of bureaucracy, so it's hard to get anything done."

If you need something to hold you over while waiting for something better.,Very mismanaged company. Specially with their work at home core dept. Advancement is oportunities are minimal. They will change your schedule without your consent with a weeks notice. Started in a class of 20 and 6 months later 7 were remaining. Every employee is micro managed. Could be there for a couple of years and all of the sudden you can recieve a phone call telling you that you are no longer employed there without an explanation! Managers heve their favorite employees who they favor more than others. Oh and if you leave involuntary or voluntary you will recieve a letter by mail months later asking you to pay your vacation back.Thats not all. If you leave involuntary they will lie about the reason why you were terminated so you dont get unemployment. Hahaha What a joke of a company.

9104,Capital One,Great Company/Bad Management,2015-07-26,3.0,Teller,Excellent benefits and extensive training program. Administrative offices are highly-organized and the employees are very professional. It is so unfortunate that the branches are the exact opposite....unorganized and unprofessional,Excessive micromanagement and communication issues from lower-level and upper-level management.

9107,Capital One,Fraud Intake Coordinator / Fraud Account Supervisor,2015-07-25,2.0,Fraud Account Supervisor,"PTO, available after 3 months, health benefits, and 401K matching are great. You probably won't find any place better for a call center job. Some managers are really nice and do legitimately care about you. I loved my manager and that's what led me to stick it out as long as I did before quitting for a job with less stress.","Don't let the title fool you, you're customer service, just in the fraud department. There was a time that the job wasn't so bad, before the Home Depot compromise. After that, the department got slammed. Back to back to back calls, no time in between, from angry customers because Capital One's oversly sensitive fraud detection software rejected their purchase and having people fax documents (fax...it's 2015, come on) to clear up ID concerns. It's interesting for a while, but then you just wear down and begin hating the phone. You cannot really take a breather in between the back to back calls because you're graded on time in between calls, it's one of the stats that goes into your ranking which impacts your bonus and chance of moving to a better shift. QA scores are completely random. You could do the right thing, say the right script 99.9% of the time but if the manager so happens to pick that on call where a customer threw you off and you missed saying something, there goes 12 points and your chance of bonus that month. The stress of QA scores ultimately drove me away..and that was even with me getting a top bonus over 50% of the time in my year+ there. There are no advancement opportunities in this position. You can move to a different department, but about 1 out of every 200 hired employees might have a chance to get promoted to the CAAT team and from there about 1 out of 10 may make manager...eventually. But it will take a while. Pay was poor. I started at $13.01 an hour and got like a .05 or 1% raise after the first year."

The pay, benefits and ancillary perks were amazing there, as was the cafeterias that were available to eat at.","There is a complete disconnect between upper management and everyone else regarding job expectations and performance; leading to a ton of confusion as to just how you're supposed to perform so that you get a good rating and bonus at the end of the year.  It seems entirely subjective, from the outside looking in.

They treat their full time people like temporary hires, including moving you from one location in the country to another, and then eliminating your job.  The morale seems to go down further every 6-10 months, as they announce more layoffs, excuse me, ""redeployments"", and as they reorganize constantly."

- competitive salary
- nice people
- if you are in management you will love it to bits (not being sarcastic, you work with great people who pretty much manage themselves)
- everything depends on which group/location you're at, I hear some are good though I haven't personally experienced this","if you are looking for a company where you will never do anything interesting but get paid well for it, this is a great place for you. There is so much red-tape and bureaucracy that you will literally spend 3 months  on something that would take 1 hour in a regular technology company. (You only think I'm exaggerating because you haven't worked here. Yes, I was surprised too but it's possible, trust me.) 

Basically, they hire really smart people who are then told to ""wait"" before they can do something. Most of the employees think the whole charade is ridiculous but pretend it's okay because the work-balance and salary are good. So you are surrounded by nice folk who share in your misery of having nothing whatsoever to do.

You are essentially getting paid to shut up and do things you know are wrong.

So ask yourself something, are you prepared to surf the Internet all day long while you wait for someone in another location to become available for a meeting (two weeks from today) which is necessary to be allowed to get started on doing your work? Then you're set. Do you enjoy endless meetings where you are mentally checked out? Then this is a great place for you! Do you enjoy a changing landscape where yesterday's words are rendered meaningless by the new directives of today, which will be equally meaningless tomorrow because none of it matters? Do I have a company for you.

If however you'd like to grow your job skills and are worried about becoming obsolete in your profession in a couple of years, avoid at all cost. If you are one of those sad people who like their work to have meaning, avoid at all costs. If you want to come home after a day of work and say, hey, I did something interesting today, avoid at all costs.

You have been warned. Choose wisely, grasshopper."

The company's got a pretty strong strategy and seems positioned to do really well in the industry.","Maybe it's because the headquarters is so close to D.C., but I never thought a corporate job could be so similar to an episode of House of Cards. Expect each and every one of your coworkers to play the political game extremely well. Capital One structures its performance reviews around a process that pits you directly against others in your job family to determine who gets the few coveted high ratings. So it behooves everyone to spend 99% of their time making themselves look good and making their coworkers look bad. 

Unfortunately, because of this, little to no actual work gets done, as everyone is more concerned with making a friend or two that will help them advance and backstabbing everyone else in the process. With such frequent reorgs, there is ample opportunity for ambitious people to try to wrest control of teams or entire departments from anyone who tries to focus on getting work done rather than playing the game.

If it weren't for the paycheck, there's no doubt that I'd call Capital One the worst decision I ever made."

There is tremendous overlap across teams and departments, so you're constantly facing redundancies and duplicative work. No one has a clear role so everyone is fighting to ""own"" something and it creates lots of tension. I work in Brand Strategy, only there is NO strategy. We just react to everything and change our minds every 5 minutes, so it's impossible to accomplish anything. Processes are rigid and get in the way of doing work, rather than helping it along. People are fairly nice, but many are in the wrong role and don't know what they're doing, which further slows things down.

- Smart and friendly people. The culture is pretty open - but see cons.
- Good cafeteria in McLean. Richmond's is worse.
- Very focused on development. Tech/finance skills are weighted equally with presentation/influence skills and you are strongly encouraged to work on these through practice and classes.","- Capital One is trying hard to become a tech company but not much is changing. Buzzwords abound but few understand what they mean (and they keep leaving). Some people work on innovative side projects, but the core work stays the same.
- Too many highly qualified people are stuck doing monotonous work.

9294,Capital One,Not bad at all.,2015-05-28,5.0,Fraud Account Supervisor,"Awesome benefits. The starting PTO is amazing.  My manager is great.  There's a reason why the CEO has over 90% approval rating.  The company really cares about it's associates.  Ignore the other reviews which claim that you get fired for anything.  Those reviews were made by employees who simply didn't try hard enough.  If you're not performing up to standard, then your manager WILL be there to help you develop your skills.  However, if you're still not meeting minimum standards, then you're let go.  That's how it is in EVERY company. Capital one literally gives you more than 3 months to improve.  If you can't show the slightest bit of improvement in more than 3 months, the job just isn't for you.  Favoritism is there, but there's always favoritism in every company.  Make yourself known, be outgoing, talk to everyone you meet in the lobby during your breaks.  The managers are all nice and friendly and are more than happy to stop what they're doing to answer any question you may have.  When it's not busy, there will be between  8 to 10 minutes between calls.  Another positive is that you get to learn a lot about fraud in general and how it affects card holders.   You primarily get calls from people with high credit limits (meaning they're pretty rich), so it's always nice striking up a conversation with them about their job or business.  You may even get to speak to a famous person too..  I recently got an incoming call from the co-producer of ""Resident Evil: Extinction""  in regard to his declined transaction.  Pretty cool.","The job itself can get a bit mundane; especially if you keep getting the same types of calls throughout the day.   The pay is not great.  The potential bonuses are good, but even if you make top bonus every month, the overall yearly pay still isn't great.   Like the other reviews say, the room for advancement is very slim.  If you're not networking and not keeping your stats up every month, don't expect to be promoted.  A big negative is having to fix the errors that the over-seas agents make on a constant basis.  Nothing is worse than  getting a call from someone who didn't receive their card after they requested it 3 weeks ago, only to find out the over-seas agent forgot to request it."

9318,Capital One,Excellent place to develop skills early in your career,2015-05-17,4.0,Senior Operations Analyst,"Joined Capital One as a member of the Analyst Development Program. The program is world-class in terms of developing employees analytical, quantitative, and technical skills, and gives new hires fresh out of college the chance to own high-impact ($MMs) projects right out of the gate, with lots of exposure to senior management. Analysts operate under an 'internal consulting' model, with internal clients or customers for whom they are responsible for providing analytical support for various projects. Culture is very similar to that of a consulting firm, as many of the firm's senior leadership initially came from consulting.

Skill development in the program is phenomenal, and analysts leave the program with a very robust skillset that is applicable not just in financial services, but a wide variety of industries which value analytical talent. Expect to receive numerous inquires on LinkedIn etc, if you have Capital One on your resume. 

Company also promotes a strong work-life balance and a collaborative work environment, where learning and development is highly encouraged.","Simply put, managers at Capital One are, for the most part, a total clown show. Traditionally promotes employees to management roles following strong work as an analyst, but unfortunately, the company puts in very little effort at developing actual human people management skills. As a result, managers tend to be very strong analytically and at problem solving, but horrendously poor at communication and influencing, motivating, and developing their own employees. This is compounded by the fact that the company has very vague and subjective criteria for evaluating employee performance, and puts too much weight on things that are not important in the grand scheme of things when it comes to performance. As a result, the performance review and promotion process tends to be a nightmare. 

Company is also very inefficient with regards to their decision-making process, due in part to being overly reliant on PowerPoint presentations, and in part due to the many levels of hierarchy that must be cleared before any decisions are implemented. Even policy decisions with the smallest level of customer impact require a 10-page PowerPoint presentation to at least 3 levels of management + a third-party office responsible for evaluating credit policy decisions. As a result, the pace of change and progress tends to be rather slow.

Compensation and benefits are good enough, but pay levels could be better - especially with respect to other Financial Services firms."

- Rich Fairbank might be ADD. He demo'd Tableau one day (This was before my time so it's a second-hand story) and it was all the rage, now I hear they're pushing SAP Lumira as the BI tool of choice.
- Base pay is definitely below market for Data Analysts and Data Scientists despite a lot of these people having very valuable skills. (some combination of Python, SAS, Shell, SQL, HBase/Hadoop and R)  Richmond, VA or Plano, TX pay is alright when adjusted for Cost of Living, though."

Yes, this is true and I am not kidding. I took my issues with this person to HR rep. And it went on deaf ears. This person tore apart the structure of the team and hired all new people and fired nearly everyone else just to save $. I guess the old employees were too much $.  I never saw this manager EVER work even 8 hours a day - totally unplugged could care less about anyone on the team except número uno. Even after I went to HR multiple times, they did nada. And now the loser manager is leaving cap one. And in the process has literally destroyed the team. All I have to say is I am SO glad I don't do ANY business with this company. YES I mean it!
The net result of POOR management is the customer suffers. And that frankly is why I don't do any business with this company. I really wanted this to be the company that everyone one wants to work for but frankly was so naïve. This company must have bought its way to the list of Forbes 100 best companies.

2. Their software is using some pretty old technology, but they have meetings to practice and discuss newer technology and they occasionally bring them into operation if management likes it.  

3. They seem generally interested in hearing employees concerns and addressing them.

4. Annual bonus is nice if you get a good review.","Working late is expected if your team needs to meet a sprint commitment.  

The 70/20/10 rule is used for performance reviews.  I usually land in the 70%, and once or twice in the 20% high ranks, but each time the reviews come around, there is a lot of anxiety and self doubt.  

The way it works is your manager has to advocate on your behalf in a big meeting and convince everyone else of your value.  You are compared against all other employees with the same rank as you.  If your manager isn't very persuasive, even if you are one of the best employees, you could end up in the bottom 10%.  Also, a manager who is a great salesman could sell a bad employee into the 70% pretty easily.  So rather than measuring employees to get rid of the worst 10%, they are really just punishing employees who work under a bad manager.  This model seems to really highlight the old saying, ""A team is only as good as their manager"".  

Also, the system also seems to encourage leaving coworkers out to fail publicly so that you can get a leg up on them in the next review session.  I've never done it, but I can see the strategy working for some.  Because its agile, you have an incentive to keep your team mates on track, but there is no incentive to help Joe from the other team."

Then we train at a training center for 9 days and we learn the whole system and policies and procedures. We practice a lot so we can get it by the time we get to our branch. After this week then we will shadow at another branch to see how they do it. The life balance is great 9-5 job and on Saturdays 9-1 and no Sundays, so it is great.

I was a little disappointed when I left and lost my contributions, due to a vesting schedule that was NOT well communicated. Auto enroll me into the 401(k) without my consent, but not let me know how long until it's vested? Pretty lame

I took advantage of the tuition reimbursement and wasn't disappointed. 

Pay and bonus potential were good, but depending on your branch location, traffic, demographic, you'd either be doubling your salary with incentives or making your base salary ONLY, no matter how hard you worked.","Incentive program changed rapidly - sometimes 2-3 times a year, based on the direction of the company and how they felt if too many bankers did ""too well."" It's their game - they make and change the rules whenever they want.

Being a branch employee is like prison - while there may be work-life balance, there's no leaving outside of branch hours for life/family/adult responsibilities. 

I moved onto a Loan Officer role after they began to remove the Assistant Branch Manager and Sales and Service Coach positions that I was promised and working so hard towards. 

As I moved to mortgage origination, Capital One destroyed the majority of my book of business. 
1) deceptive advertising - how much money did they spend on a No Closing Fee loan that almost NO ONE met the underwriting criteria, leaving inquirers upset and disappointed?
2) ridiculous lack of communication and flow through the mortgage department. There's a reason they abandoned mortgages all-together for quite some time. People often left the process and moved onto other institutions. 
3) forcing people into products they didn't want. No one wants your high interest rate, low closing cost fee ""first lien"" home equity loan.

And many other issues. 

I finally went back to school and left banking for much more lucrative pursuits. You should all consider the same."

Of course it is still good to be a BA also (although some are starting to question that, and attrition is going up).
Performance management, while a 360 process, continues to be questionable at best.  Promotions don't always make sense and clearly are not always results based (no different than many other companies, but good to go in with eyes open that it is far from perfect here despite our 360 process)

9540,Capital One,"Like working at a (technology) startup that has good funding, great benefits, and decent work-life balance",2015-02-16,4.0,IT Manager,"This is an update of a review I previously posted

Benefits are great. 401K up to 7.5% company contribution, short/long term disability paid by company, discounted company stock purchase option, vacation days (able to buy more during open enrollment), unlimited sick days, 3 family care days, free financial planning consultations via Fidelity, free use of athletic trainer in company fitness centers twice a week (there is a fee to use the fitness centers, but no additional charge to use the trainers). I find the medical insurance (bronze/silver/gold options through Aetna) to be expensive compared to the HMO I can get through my spouse's employer, but I don't think the Aetna costs at Capital One are out of line with what I have observed at other companies; I'm not a fan of the high deductible though. Capital One does try to brunt the pain of the high deductible by offering free health clinics on site at major locations (no copay - family members can also visit) and no copay to visit CVS minute clinics. Very progressive company - just announced expansion of maternity leave to 12 weeks PAID, 2 weeks paid paternity leave, 6 weeks paid adoption leave/surrogate leave (if your child born via surrogate), $10K contribution toward adoption expenses, fabulous medical benefits for families with autistic children. Company will contribute up to $1000 toward your flexible spending accounts (medical/dependent care). 

My manager (and senior leadership team in general) have been absolutely fabulous - when my dad died, I was told ""take the time you need"" - very humane.

I had severe culture shock after joining Capital One for a very long time... I have encountered very few ""slackers"" and am continually impressed at how responsive most associates are to any requests/questions I may have - it's highly unusual for it to take more than 4 hours to get a response. Capital One takes pains to hire very intelligent, data-driven associates. I am very satisfied with my work/life balance, but that balance can be a bit unpredictable at times (mainly because I am in an operational role - stuff happens... and you have to deal with it right then).

Capital One has taken great pains to recruit/retain associates hired as interns/new college grads - this program is very well-designed/run. They would be well-advised to pay a reasonably equivalent level of attention to experienced hires (obviously, more seasoned hires don't need as quite as much hand holding).  While there is clearly room for improvement in this area, I've observed some progress on this front over the past few months - a *lot* of energy spent on trying to improve the onboarding process for experienced hires within my line of business so that they have everything  they need to do their jobs once they finish the 1.5 day long HR onboarding process (which incidentally is *very* well done).  Similarly, I've observed some efforts aimed at reducing the red tape that makes it difficult to do your job efficiently and reduce the ""environmental"" learning curve associated with being a new hire. While you might be a subject matter expert in your area, you can't be effective without also understanding the company environment.

I am thoroughly impressed by the company's commitment to doing the right thing by their customers. While I won't go into any detail here, suffice it to say Capital One gives up a LOT of $ by not following the same practices used by many of the other large financial companies. The latitude given to call center associates to satisfy a customer's needs is unprecedented.  

Capital One University is a fabulous resource for associates ... many different types of training courses (online, instructor lead) are available - many at no cost to the associate's department. Subjects covered are typically either line of business centric or role centric (e.g. project management college, software engineering college, information security college, etc.). 

The corporate culture is heavily oriented toward recognizing associate contributions. The size of your pay raise and bonus are heavily predicated by your performance review rating  (which is in turn based upon your contributions); the higher your performance review rating, the larger your pay raise/bonus.  Bonuses can comprise a very significant portion of associate compensation - the higher your paygrade, the more significant the bonus is.  

Any associate can recognize another associate or team of associates for their contributions. The recognization can range from a simple thank you note to points that can be redeemed by the associate for gift cards from a wide variety of vendors to cash awards. 

Promotions are a *HUGE* deal at Capital One.. they are generally recognized twice a year. All promotions are publicly announced (typically first within the individual line of business, then company wide). If you are on the receiving end of a promotion, you can count on being flooded with congratulatory IMs, emails, and phone calls from fellow associates once the announcement is public. It can be a bit overwhelming if you aren't expecting it.  Promotion recipients are also invited to a luncheon with their managers and members of the senior leadership team.  I personally have felt very empowered to ""grow my flame"" here.

Mobility within the organization is excellent - there are many, many  roles available within information technology. If you get tired of your current role, there's an excellent chance there will be an opening in a different area of IT that you can apply for.","The ""startup"" culture at Capital One can be a double edge sword - if something isn't working, just wait six months (or less) and it will change. 

If you are a person with a ""glass half empty"" attitude or someone who greatly values organizational structures/processes etc. remaining static over a long period of time, this is NOT the company for you. 

There have been big changes in the senior leadership team (most external hires) in my line of business during the time I have been at Capital One, a significant number (1100+) of associates hired (many as part of the drive to insource key functions). While I think the CEO and very senior management have good plans for the company (e.g., identifying key objectives each year, and making solid plans to reach them), objective identification/planning within my own line of business has historically been shaky at best, largely due to understaffing/lack of resources and multiple reorgs. I have noticed some positive movement in this area  over the past 2-3 months - I do like what I'm seeing/hearing - but will reserve judgement for another few months.  If this changes significantly for the better, I'll up my rating from 4 to 5 stars.

Predictably, mentoring of associates is not what it should be in my line of business given the staffing challenges.The company does pair up a ""buddy"" with new hires who request it. While I had a buddy, I didn't find it useful because the buddy was not in the same location or same role as me, and so was not able to answer many of the questions that I had.IT has been switching over to agile-based methods (not just for software development), while also shifting to a federated model in which IT resources are assigned to a particular line of business rather than a centralized pool of IT resources. While there are some distinct advantages to that approach (e.g., IT resources are intimately familiar with the applications of their line of business and the associated network infrastructure; fewer issues with prioritizing needs across different lines of business), it makes it difficult for the remaining ""central"" IT organization to keep track of everything that is going on. Time will tell how this gamble pays off.

Associates in general don't like the performance management system, but overall I think it provides a decent measure of fairness. Everyone that I've known that has received a promotion truly deserved it.. 360 feedback is strongly emphasized as part of the performance management process. Forced ""cross-calibration"" sessions amongst managers of all associates at the same level are performed biannually as part of the performance management process to ensure everyone uses the same standards to rate associates. This can be a little awkward if you are at the same level as your manager (yes it happens). Your manager's ability/willingness to advocate for you during these sessions is key. If the managers participating in these cross calibration sessions don't think highly of you, you're sunk...You need to be *very* aware of that in your daily interactions with other associates. One of the main criticisms of the performance management system is that it emphasizes individual performace more than team performance. Some steps have been taken to shift that, but too soon to judge the effectiveness of that change."

I am in the call center line of business in an hourly position) you will not be able to make more than 2 pay grade jumps (even if you are qualified fully for a salaried position in another line of business ie. IT). 

My advice: apply for what you plan on doing in the long run, this is an easy company to move around in (as long as you are in the same pay grade), but if you plan to get your foot in the door with an hourly position just to move to salaried because you are finishing your degree in a year, think again. You will have to leave and come back to Capital One to be taken seriously, just as I am in the process of doing. 

Some call center departments are being run to the ground, and floor managers don't always have best interest of their people at hand."

If you don't kiss *** then u will not get picked for anything no matter how much you know or how long you been there. QA is too over the top with grading, they nitpick over everything on one call, grading is entirely too strict. They update policies and procedures almost everyday ( who does that)On almost every call you have to check policies and procedures to make sure nothing has changed which takes too much extra time. The nerve of them putting a limit on our talk time with all this extra unecessary things they want us to do while the customer is on the line. Capital One really needs to get it together, that's more than likely why they have a high turnover rate, no one I began training with is there anymore."

Promotions are not based on results but rather being best buddy with manager and there is so much instability with management if you happen to get momentum you will have a new manager that will not have any history on you. 

Compensation is far below the market in the same industry for similar job. A lot of focus on levels as a way to get things pushed. 

Claim to be about front line people engagement, however only a few areas actually live this and rest is lip service. 

Exodus of people close to happening like did before when people left to competition. Playing favorites is common here: a few select few (not actually any better) will get promoted every year to 2 years, the rest will never move up and those moving up will give foolish reasons why others shouldn't."

The corporate heads have a great vision & great ideas.","No appreciation for employees, the vision gets lost the further down the chain you go.  There are way too many politics at play.  They do not value long time employees.  I've seen employees who have been with the company for 40+ years transferred to another location and then the branch closes & the employee laid off.  They lay off employees when they close a location,  employees are encouraged to apply internally, but are rarely hired.  Capital One is looking to going ""digital"" so they want very few branches, so that mean very few employees, so if you want a company for the long haul, avoid here!  They make big promises to get you on board and then there is no follow thru.  In my 4 years, I've seen so much turnover, everyone below the CEO to me has changed.  I've had 5 different managers in less than 4 years.  
I've seen older employees pressured and pushed out and managers advised to push older people out In favor of younger employees.  

There is very little career growth.  Every person above me who was hired the past 4 years was external and very few people promoted, the ones who have been promoted have been ""in"" with leadership."

Required days of Monday, Friday, And one weekend day would ensure no opportunity of consecutive days off that included weekend without using vacation hours. Shifts also for later in the day.  Therefore rendering just completed vacation bid useless and upending work life balance for the majority involved.  Disrupting class schedules for college students who've been registered and paid for and with results not being available til mid January, unable to make timely adjustments in class schedule. Happy holidays.  As an employee, the need for weekend coverage is understood and would be easily implemented.  The complete upending of our personal/family lives at short notice does not coincide with their mission statement ""do what's right"" but is an unfortunate reminder of our place in the organization.  When questioned as to why the added measure of no concurrent day off that would include one weekend day beyond the new work hours and weekend the answer was that most companies would not even warn us.

I'm lucky enough to work in one of the newer organizations, where the status quo is constantly being challenged and we're pushing in the right direction.

9658,Capital One,A great place to start a career in banking,2014-11-22,3.0,Relationship Banker II,"A fairly new bank which was established after the financial crisis of 2008, so they are growing at a fast and healthy paced without worrying about paying hefty penalties as other banks continue to do do for their mishandling of bad mortgage investments.  I worked in the branch and I had left before the bank was launching a new training program and beginning to look after their employees by providing them more promotions and opportunities to move up. 

The benefits are great, especially their 401K and tuition reimbursement program.","Your experience in the branch will mostly depend on who you have as a manager.  I'd say most of them are talented, dedicated individuals, willing to work as hard as their subordinates.  But like in any other company, there are a few who could make your days miserable and contribute little to the success of the company.  All they do is sit behind their desks talking to friends and barking orders, instead of creating a plan to get more business.  

What I also noticed during time at the bank is that it's easier to get a job in the corporate office if you apply as an external candidate than if you are an internal candidate (branch employee).  You could be a branch employee for several years, but even then, the recruiters would pass up your application. Hopefully that has changed."

Like most businesses, many of the processes are known through tribal knowledge only."
9662,Capital One,Capital One is the Worst Company I ever worked for,2014-11-17,2.0,Senior Applications Developer,"The benefits are very good.     The heath insurance and 401k options are better than average.
In many departments, they allow people to work from home when needed.","1.  There is no job security and no stability in management,
2.  There is always a large amount of staff turnover.
3.   They encourage people to move around from one position to another almost every year.
4.   If you stay in one position more than 2 years, you will be considered stale and a candidate for their redeployment process which really is another term for layoff.
5.   In the banking side of the company, they rely 100% on vendors to do all of the IT processing and changes.   They even hire contractors to do the unit and system testing.
6.  There is very little in depth knowledge at Capital One about how the  IT system that is used for their retail banking operations works   
7.  Every new hire must pass a 'personality test'.    This leads to an environment where everyone is alike and very boring.
8.  Since all of the day to day operations work is outsourced to vendors, the Capital One employees really just work on meaningless task to please the directors.    Nobody below 
executive management does any 'real' work.
9.  The review process is an example of HR gone to the extreme - it takes up a ton of time for both the employees and managers .
10. If you have any morals and try to treat others as you would have them treat you, you won't survive at Capital One.

11.  The environment for the day to day non executive management staff is a model of survival
of the fittest, but since most of the work is outsourced to VENDORS, it is more like game of
survival.

12.  You job becomes navigating the review process and changing positions quick enough to keep on keeping on.

13.  The executive management team makes very good decisions on what banks and credit card companies to purchase.   But they have no idea on how to run the internals of daily business.

14.  Everyone who worked with me at Capital One had the same point of view as I did.

15.  If you want a career at Capital One, you should be prepared to step on people and basically your main task will be to navigate through the yearly performance review process so that you survive another year."

Overall, I enjoyed my tenure at this company.","Starting salaries were lower than expected, but there are performance bonuses."
9666,Capital One,Horribly Political Environment.,2014-11-13,1.0,Vice President,Salary and benefits were very strong and exceed anything I had experienced elsewhere especially with regard the medical premiums which were fantastic.,"The induction to the company speaks to the core values and competencies.  The CEO of the company also reinforces these aspects.  Yet sadly those messages and behaviors are completely lost once in the business, especially at the SVP level down, where I mainly interacted.  

It is a completely political environment no matter what the location, and I found more weak SVP's and VP's in COF than I have ever seen or would have believed.  Owing to their weakness they live in the blame culture but do this in deceptive ways, i.e. make emotive statements of unhappiness, but have no evidence to back it up.  However the damage is done as the other weak line management would react to the statement and not be strong enough to stand up and ask for proof.  Hence most of the time is either fire fighting, or trying to politically CYA or deflect these statements without substance.  Trouble is it is endemic within their organization and will take  a significant clear out to change things.

I tired of incorrect statements constantly being made to me of my staff and any attempt to not act in the way the rest of the company, i.e. demand proof, is met with accusations that you are not a team player and didn't I know that if an SVP expressed their concern at person X, they didn't need proof, their comment was more than enough.... Serious.

Coupled with this, sadly their promotion system is so convoluted and without credibility is is actually causing great people to leave, rather than retaining the talent.  They run a system know as cross calibration, where all line managers from a team sit together and discuss every member of staff and rank them accordingly.  Trouble is how do you compare a lawyer with a financier?  Much less if I want my team members to be ranked at X then I need to argue down all of my peers until I 'get my way'.  A horribly amateurish and unprofessional way to determine pay raises, bonus and promotions, which in themselves take at least 12 months to achieve from an exceptional rating. Needless to say many many great people got fed up of this and would leave, meaning the attrition rate was shamefully high and the loss was of the top caliber people.

Needless to say after 18 months I found an alternative role outside of the company in a culture much more respectful and transparent."

There can be a lot of opportunities depending on your manager and leadership teams and you can usually move internally within the company.,Too many reorgs that are followed up with poor leadership and no direction from senior management.

9722,Capital One,Would not return,2014-10-12,2.0,Operations Analyst,"Given five promotions in six years for work above and beyond. Found anyone wanting promotion had to press the flesh with the right people and work the politics. Hard work and awards alone weren't enough. Leadership was sometimes lacking. I went four months on one team and we did not have a manager in that time. Team was eventually absorbed into other groups. Corporate perks that can be used in the community are great, if you can afford them.","Not family friendly, despite what you hear. I was written up and nearly fired for missing one day to bury a family member. Missed one day of work and immediately let my manager know and returned with an obituary. Nearly fired again when child hospitalized for serious illness. Shared news immediately with my then boss and he threatened to fire me, as my child was struggling for life in the PICU. 
Company values performance more than anything else and nobody in leadership wants to hear about problems or issues. Many colleagues came to me almost daily for answers that should've come from managers."

Annual review process is somewhere between ‘alright’ and ‘a mess’ 

Ultimately, your experience will be highly dependent on the specific team you are on. Some teams are growing quickly and have the support and visibility of senior leadership, others are not. Guess which type of team is more fun to be on."

You will probably change managers frequently.  The 360 review process and dreaded ""cross calibrations"" make the review process more like getting into a college fraternity than properly assessing your performance.  You can easily get ""blackballed"" by a manager other than you own.  You will have to spend time on political tasks that advance your ""brand identity"" to as many managers as possible.  This, however, is a fact of life in the modern corporate environment at Cap One if you want to advance.

Cap One is now so top heavy in risk management and process management that it really is becoming ""just like any other bank.""  Additionally the work environment, at least at the West Creek campus, is like being in kindergarten where everyone sits around a big table to work.  Great if everyone is polite and considerate, but not so great for those who talk on their cell phones or hold conference calls on speakerphone.

There is no sense of job security here. I felt as if managers are not interested in developing their employees or may be they are just not competent enough to know how to develop associate and employee retention is just not their concern. There was no Exit interview when I left."

When you sell a Real Estate secured product it will close in 8 to 12 weeks. Process for processing loans in Plano TX is ridiculous & Senior Management  did nothing to fix it.  I don't think anything happened but the addition of another layer of management. 

Keeps its Internet Bank separate but deceitfully tells customers it's OK for them to use branches. The only that works regularly is the Credit Card company. Very frustrating wasting the acquisition of several good banks."

From my experience the company would rather offer an open position to an external hire with No experience or training in the role versus take an average performer in another role within the company whom they have already invested in training and orienting to the culture.

- They hire smart people, but most of them don't have any other experience.  So they only know the Capital One way of doing things.  They're convinced this is always the best way.

- High Potential Program.  There is an official ""high potential"" program they arbitrarily choose people and treat them differently.  This creates a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy, but more importantly breeds resentment.

- There is a weak approach to expense management.  As a result.  Most of the office is traveling at any given time even though they don't need to be.  People will habitually fly from Toronto to Richmond Virginia for a single short meeting.  People go on trips simply because they are young and like to travel.

- Some members of senior management are religious fundamentalists and it shows."

Despite our top-performing customer reviews and excellent ratings in the area, the manager felt the need to treat the employees (specifically the younger ones) as though they were children as opposed to adults.

Hours of operation is in par with the industry and travel time between home and branch is pretty reasonable.,I believe that Capital One overall is behind in the technology field and needs to focus on catching up to the rest in the market.

9809,Capital One,So far so good; Fraud Intake Coordinator job review,2014-08-15,4.0,Fraud Intake Coordinator,"I just finished classroom training so my review will be based on that and updated later on. Classroom training is eight hours a day for four weeks long. It is A LOT of information, but the trainer is really good at her job.Also, being in the classroom with people who had experience and with people who didn't made it easier to learn things. There's a lot of managers, and each one came in multiple times throughout training to meet us. So far, management looks laid back and personable. 

BENEFITS BROKEN DOWN:
All benefits including 401k matching,health,dental,vision,education assistance,adoption assistance, start on DAY ONE!
The benefits cant be matched elsewhere. Yes, hourly isn't anything to write home about, but you're offered a ""differential"" to work a later shift of about 10%, over time is given if wanted and theres monthly bonuses that add up to $1250 that agents can get. From what I have heard from current agents, they aren't too hard to get.
Health care: This is the best health care I have seen for hourly employees. Again, it starts on day one, and their most expensive plan for one person is about $30/month, which includes no copay and free walk-in clinic visits. Add dental and vision on for about 2 extra a month.
I didn't get insurance, but purchased life insurance. My $138,000 policy is about 3 dollars a month.
Education assistance is $5500 for Bachelors and Masters degrees

You even get 3 weeks of paid vacation your first year, which is more than most other companies.  Some of the managers are helpful with career planning, and can be flexible with scheduleing if you are responsible about it and don't take advantage.","Nothing is stable as far as business processes, procedures and systems.  Things change constantly and you better pay attention to the signs because they seem to layoff quite a bit or just move you to another position with little or no advance notice and no increase in pay, but more and more job duties.  They don't really keep you informed about changes that are going to be made.

The website and mobile app have constant issues but there seems to be no qualified employees in place to make timely fixes.

Tons of red tape for day to day operations, and the promotion process is unlike any organization I've ever worked for.  You have to have a champion submit your request for a promotion, then IF you are selected for the ""stretch"" opportunity you work the role for at least 12 months, at which point you will be told if you get the promotion or not and that is when you will see the increase in salary."

A lot of the rank and file are genuinely good people.","Most of the senior IT leadership is incompetent, with most of them being unprincipled Peter Principled project managers promoted way, way above their competency level who know little about technology, less about leadership, and nothing about building and fostering a healthy organization.  But they are really good at playing politics and deflecting blame for their failures onto suitable scapegoats.  If you aren't in the right clique - your career will go nowhere.  If you are technical, your career will go nowhere (but don't worry, they have been working on a career track for technical people for the last 6 years that will eventually take it beyond the manager level, honest, it's coming any day now).  Unless you come in fresh out of college, it's unlikely you will leave the company with a better set of skills than you originally came with.  If that's not enough to dissuade you, here are a few more cons: they have a meeting driven culture - as in all day, all meetings.  Nothing can get decided without several meetings involving up to a dozen or so people to discuss it.  Even if it involves only one person actually doing something.  The ""anonymous"" opinion surveys...probably aren't anonymous.  If you aren't already tagged as being targeted for promotion, you probably won't get a great rating, no matter how great of a job you actually did.  And if you aren't in the right clique - guess what, you probably won't get tagged for promotion.  If you are in the right clique though, get ready for champagne wishes and caviar dreams."

All that's recognized is that the project was delivered, but few remember how poorly planned it was.

You are given tons of training up front (in fact take advantage of an entire library of web based training). Its a good company to get your bearings of Corporate America. Their benefits are good with generous vacation and work from home policy.,You are stereotyped by the role and projects you have participated in. Senior management is mostly male and are isolated from day to day activities.

I lost my position due to cutbacks and even though I had tons of internal people trying to help me get a new position, and had excellent performance reviews, I wasn't able to find other work within.

Employee experiences vary greatly based on who your unit manager is. 

Limited opportunities for growth. 

Training seems very good and thorough while you are in it. However, once out of training, you realize it is not relevant. 

If you are hired July or later, you will not receive a raise (of any sort) for 18 months minimum. 

Each manager perceives the QA requirements very differently. So based on your team, you could have very high QAs when really your QAs should be average. Of course the opposite is true too. You could end up with very low QAs when your QAs should be very high. Bonus is based on what your QA is compared to everyone else in your department.

They present it as a simple job in training, but there are potentially thousands of complex details and you don't know them going in and are marked off on them. Management evaluates 5 calls per month and you don't find out until the last day of training that you have to score an 84 consistently to keep your job. They say there is no script but you are shown a basic one in training.  What they want is much more than that, and if you don't do things in a specific sequence they mark you off, and of course it is subjective according to who is grading you. I think it is so they don't have to pay you the $1100 per month bonus that they dangle for those who score 100%."

Upper management is excellent in my experience-very dedicated.  It's a good opportunity for career auto industry people.  If you aren't 100% committed to auto finance or the auto industry in general, not only will this be a temporary gig for you but it will also have a limiting effect on future career opportunities (and good luck trying to get a Capital One recruiter to help you with an internal transfer: they are simply not interested in helping current employees).","Work on the weekends, call center environment, open cubicle layout and it's business-casual despite the fact that you work over the phone all day.  Your success in the role is highly dependent on a lot of other people, i.e. teammates, customers, managers, underwriters, employers, etc., so a lot of things (including your success in this position) can be and are out of your control.

Being monitored constantly especially when dealing with angry or upset customers most of the time is just not worth the decent pay and benefits. The software used to handle customer accounts is very flawed and so is the process used to carry out certain customers requests such as credit limit increases. Employees are not given any information to explain everything needed to customers, making them angry most of the time. Just sitting in the chair all day taking calls is too depressing, definitely the worst job I have had and I understand why they try to pay decent and offer benefits because the job is so depressing! Also it seems like advancement to manager or CAT is based heavily on social factors instead of merits. The company claims to have customers service on par with Discover and Amex, but the in-call requirements and structure required to receive high quality scores completely prevents an agent from having any shot at replicated the magnificent customer service received with Discover and Amex.

Mind sets are slow to evolve and there's a total lack of real experience, but a mindset that they think they are great and better than everyone around.  A company who grew up in Richmond has to grow up and out of its old ways of thinking or it will be taken over by the likes of smarter and better players like The Wall Street banks."

We constantly hear how this company make BILLIONS in profit, and how they are a FORTUNE 100 company, yet they pay wages WAY BELOW the average.

Cross calibrations/Performance reviews are a year round process.  It is all based on comparisons to your peers throughout the company who are all working on different types of projects.

Additionally, the annual  employee performance review is not based necessarily on how well you have performed over the past year but how you compare to others in the same level but who may not be doing anything related or close to what you are doing.

The place was hell bent on showing how open it is to certain historically disadvantaged groups and gave favorable benefits to them inspite of work not upto the mark.

Capital One also pays fairly well and encourages associates to volunteer regularly.

I think your experience at this company really depends on your role and the organization you report into.  It only takes one senior leader to make your department miserable.  I switched departments a few years ago and was relatively happy before.  But not now!","The company is unstable, quietly laying off over 700 associates last October; this is the third round of layoffs since I began work there in 2010.  Attrition has been extremely high at the Sr. Leadership level; over half of the CEO's direct reports are new to the company within the last few years.  Of course any turnover is always followed by the ""everything's fine"" email or meeting.  

The health benefits are also horrible.  Extremely high (over $1k a month for a family) monthly premiums, PLUS a deductible, PLUS 20% coinsurance.  And that's their best plan!  Anyone with ongoing medical problems knows that's completely unaffordable.  

The performance management system is garbage too, forcing associates into ""distribution buckets"" (you could be an awesome worker, but if they need someone to go into the ""inconsistent"" bucket, it could be you!).  

Capital One preaches diversity of thought and it's always about ""the associates"" in the annual strategy meetings, but it's all a bunch of b.s.  The dumb ones just eat it up, though!  For the record, I'm super low on the totem pole.  I've always been rated a v. strong or strong and have no issues with my manager.  I'm just not stupid, I see the writing between the lines and I don't feed into the crap that others do.

This leads to people being promoted into people management positions that have no idea what it takes to really manage people.  Rewarding people who do nothing but socialize with higher ups is not the way to run an organization.
(2) Very stressful environment where backstabbing and politics are common - I was placed on a PIP because I asked to change managers and the PIP contained untrue information about my work performance.  After my PIP was completed and I did everything I was told to do, I was told that I didn't meet expectations and let go - with a huge severance and the option for re-hire.  This is due to the fact that they knew I could sue them for gender discrimination and disability discrimination (I ended up having to go on stress medication due to the bullying I endured at Capital One).  Severance letter released me from being able to file legal action.  In my entire career, I have had better than satisfactory performance reviews and have been promoted over and over again - I have never been written up for performance in my entire life until now.  They have trashed my reputation and my career.
(3) This company has a known reputation for being a horrible place to work.  When I mentioned my experience to people who don't work at Capital One (such as my doctor), their reply is always that they have heard this happening several times with other people."

Oh they're sharp too, but for starters, there are are ridiculous number of managers...and some seem to exist mostly to tell other managers to get the work done, apparently having no idea how to actually do (or even guide) any of it themselves (ironically, they're usually the ones making the big bucks).  A lot of micromanagement as well, ie emphasis on creating reports/""tickets""/etc detailing what you've done - sometimes I swear half the job was saying what you did for your job.

Also it is the ""coldest"" place I have ever worked; teamwork gets lip service but is non-existent.  Why?  Mostly because managers care *nothing* for their employees - especially contractors, who they treat more like a disposable resource than human beings.  They have layoffs one minute, then start hiring back the next.  Training also ranges from weak to non-existent.  

Frankly I think most people hate it there (walk around the campus - you won't see many people smiling, but you will see a lot of stern/angry faces), but stay either because the pay is good or they just haven't found anything else in this tough economy.

Capital One is a feedback culture, so you can always learn how to improve. You can tell your boss candid ways for him to improve as well (and he actually acts upon it).

Every day is different. You can keep pushing yourself to learn more, and it's relatively easy to change roles if you find something more aligned with your interests.

The CEO makes it a point to talk to the entire company once a year, even though it requires him renting out huge theaters all across the country and spending several days repeating the same speech.

They swap contractors in and out in this perpetual revolving door, treating them like 2d class citizens (if even human beings at all).  Worse, they're constantly shuffling positions, cutting them short out of the blue, laying off people one minute and hiring the next.  Further, most managers and even some of the more veteran staff are very stand-offish, with their little cliques and nothing in the way of genuine friendliness to outsiders coming in - again only barely enough for CYA purposes.

It is - by FAR - both the least stable and ""coldest"" place I have ever worked.  The little extra money one might (might) get working there is not worth the stress of working at a place you hate - and unless you get REALLY lucky, you'll hate it, trust me."

*Selection process for a candidate is very rigorous and heavily focused on case interviewing for analyst candidates.  Does one's performance on a case dictate their success in the role? Is our process too rigorous where it could be screening out good candidates? Just because a person fails a case doesn't mean the person is not a great fit for Capital One.  They still maybe able to perform the core duties of the job.  They just need to sharpen their case interviewing skills and that only comes with practice and time.  That's not innate."

10207,Capital One,"Join the company, benefit from training but don't stay too long",2013-12-05,3.0,Senior Manager,"Capital One is a good employer, the pay and benefits are good, the business training is solid and executive communications are beneficial. The people are young and smart and I have made wonderful friendships during my 12 1/2 year tenure.  I have worked in diverse areas such as the functional areas of HR and Finance and US Card and the Bank in various positions.  It was easy to move around until the past few years when the company became flatter (limited promotions) and horizontal mobility was determined to be a business risk requiring at least 12 months tenure in a position.  Potential candidates should consider their postings, as they may be enjoying the role for a long time. 

Flexibility is a big benefit as it is the culture to work wherever you are, from home, from the office, from the cafeteria, from Panera.  Hours can be flexed as well to suit a work/life balance.  Get to work early, as sometimes it is difficult to get a seat near business partners, as work tables fill up fast in the morning unless your department has assigned seating.","This is a company that recruits the same type of people - young, smart, analytical, results driven and integrated thinkers, managed by the tests that candidates must pass to get to the interview.  Sometimes diversity of opinion is not valued and there is pressure to succumb to popular opinion.  

The burnout factor is high, as the annual performance management process is highly competitive. It's hard to have a family with after hours activities and remain competitive from a performance standpoint with those that are young and career-focused 24/7.  (I'm not saying that there is age discrimination but my situation was curious.  A few months before I turned 50 I was redeployed and my role was given to a younger male with less experience, even though my end of year rating was in the top 10%.  My attorney commented that this is a common practice for the company but the way that Capital One redeploys in small batches and since that statute of limitations is short, it's difficult to prove illegal practices.)

The company reorganizes frequently and I have been redeployed three times, two of which I stuck around and found an internal role but the third time I took a package. There is a glass ceiling and career progression can be limited to the selection of assignments received."

- Some managers are no good at managing people, but by definition they have to. No option to progress with hard skills.
- Direct manager plays too important a role in a person's career. All your eggs are in one basket. No avenue to get around it unless you want to officially complain about your manager.
- Promotions are very political, despite efforts to make it transparent. It all comes down to how much the aforementioned managers are willing/able to fight to get you promoted, and your ability to suck up, for lack of better word. No consideration whatsoever for experience/tenure (they pride themselves on this).
- Re-orgs are way too frequent. While they don't as frequently let people go, there's a good chance you or your manager have no control over drastic changes to your actual role."

10327,Capital One,Overall working at Capital One has been a great experience,2013-08-29,4.0,Finance Manager,"Capital One offers great benefits, including non traditional benefits outside of dental/medical categories. They have a gym with personal trainers (for a small fee), a doctor's office for you and your family, a post office, and a bank all on site (at least at two of the corporate locations that I have visited).

Capital One is open to flexible work arrangements. Some groups are more flexible than others, but there is a general push towards ensuring that everyone feels that they have a good level of flexibility in the workplace. I have been lucky enough to benefit from this, as I am allowed to work from home some days ( i do it at least once a week!). This is one of the reasons that Capital One has been consistently ranked as a top workplace for working mothers.

In general I feel that Capital One hires great people. Most people that I have encountered are intelligent, driven, collaborative people. Most of them are friendly as well, which makes coming to work a lot easier!","I have noticed that there is a tendency in the culture to want to meet about everything. This is good from a collaborative point of view, but it seems to me that some meetings are scheduled ""just to be had."" This eats up time to actually do the work- there is a lot of talking but not a lot of actual process! Some groups have a tendency to over-complicate. Some groups seem to expect a high level of multitasking ability, which is proven to be an inefficient way to work."
10328,Capital One,"Very political, less focus on work",2013-08-28,1.0,,Business casual dress code is nice.,Promotions appear to be based on the buddy system instead of merit.

10346,Capital One,Becoming a big corporation and all that entails,2013-08-07,3.0,Business Manager,"Great hiring process and tends to land well above-average people, especially in M&A. Depending on the role you land, work-life balance can be very attractive, and benefits and pay are competitive. Problems tend to be interesting to solve, and very cooperative and helpful culture compared to other large organizations. Excellent place for either college student looking to work at a great company for a few years before their next step, or a middle management type with family priorities who can accept a good work-life balance and great culture in return for marginal career growth. Roles and org structures tend to shuffle every 12-18 months - this can be an up or a down depending on the situation. Credit roles are overvalued to a fault, but if you can land one its an excellent way to accelerate career growth.","The last five years have brought a few changes: First, a number of extremely competent senior leaders have left the company. In addition, career advancement at all levels has slowed significantly and, as at many large companies, become more based on executive favor than competencies or results. Depending on your role and your management chain, you can have either a favorable work life balance or find yourself working I-Banker hours but without any commiserate recompense. Promotions lately tend to be based more and more on political positioning and executive favor; as a result senior and middle management tend to lack fundamental management skills, leading to low morale and turnover in middle and junior buckets. If you're ready to play the game you can do well, but don't expect much career mileage out of the quality or quantity of your work."

- Promotion cycle is slow - even with stellar performance, the ""who you know"" matters for promotions - not a merit based culture
- Low employee morale due to recent cuts
- Options for international mobility are limited as the company is located in the US/UK.

There are several great managers in the corporation and also really great oppurtunities to move up within the company.,Like most companies immediate managers have a great deal of power over their associates or workers. Here there is too much power given to managers and also so many changes being made without the proper training being provided. They will hold you accountable even had they not provided the proper training to you. I have also seen people fired for personal reasons between a manager and employee. Not a great example of ethical responsibilityffrom a manager. The turn over is more consistant then it was 4 years ago with all the changes in the company and also the people that are being hired for entry positions are alot less professional then 4 years ago.

Managers will use assorted data to hide behind making any true managerial decisions. There is a hiring freeze in Richmond, making mobility very difficult.

Constantly changing agenda/strategy. 
 The rating is determined in management calibration sessions which rate your performance against everyone else at your same level (not job title). So if someone at your level has gone above and beyond (which always occurs), this then creates the standard for which you should've followed. This makes it impossible to set goals and be confident that if you've met them you've performed well, since you are ranked against your peers not against goals set by you and your manager. This process leads to less teamwork and knowledge sharing and more individualism. Technology is lacking and in some ways is less than the industry standard.

The company used to always be about growth/innovation and had retained part of its start up culture roots for a long time.

There is also a real emphasis on work/life balance and senior management seems to really mean it.  Nice benefits package too.","Capital One has hired a lot of very smart people, which sometimes means that things are way more complicated than they should be.

It's a pretty good place with smart people, great work life balance, good compensation, great benefits and flexibility in work location.","One of the best things about capital one has always been the bottom up innovation in the strategy setting and product development. However, the recent spate of acquisitions has added a lot of beaurocracy and moat of the work being done is driven by senior management with the ground level employees simply finding ways to do what they are asked to do. Also, the performance appraisal process needs more transparency. The way it works today, its a popularity contest. If people above you like you, you get to be on the high profile projects and get promoted as a result of that. The others just get stuck in a viscious cycle of getting the same vague feedback again and again."

The pay isn't enough for those with various backgrounds in the financial industry. The year appraisal end process for associate is based strictly on personal opinion and favoritism to managers.

10440,Capital One,I've worked fro Capital One for 7 years - great company to work for.,2013-05-09,4.0,Graphic Artist,"Best reasons to work for Capital One:
• Good pay
• Excellent benefits
• Flexible work schedule 
• Exciting company with vision and innovative ideas","Drawbacks:
• Advancement is rough - very competitive and hard to move ahead
• A lot of acquisition in the last couple of years has led to some culture clash
• Constant re-organizations of staff"
10441,Capital One,Excellent !!!!!!!!,2013-05-09,4.0,Operations Analyst,"Great working climate, excellent telecommuting experience, forward thinking, open to innovation.",Capital One grew fast and is now contractings so ability to move amonst departments is a bit limited.
10442,Capital One,"Open culture mentality is a farce, political",2013-05-07,2.0,Senior Project Manager,"Decent benefits, insurance plan is through Aetna, 401k with matching, paid federal/bank holidays 20-25 vacation days and sick time is at your will (meaning it is paid and unlimited for exempt). Ability to work remotely HOWEVER it is at the discretion of your supervisor and many do not allow or encourage it.  Most departments have a good work/life balance. Pay is ok, merit increases and bonus potential","The culture is very political and all about how well you play the game.  If played exceptionally well you will go far.  Your work does not speak for itself, your ability to play does.  This is evident in the performance review process. The fact that you've successfully done your job well can still lead to an ""inconstant"" (below expectations) or ""strong"" (which is average and most common) rating.  The rating is determined in management calibration sessions which rate your performance against everyone else at your same level (not job title). So if someone at your level has gone above and beyond (which always occurs), this then creates the standard for which you should've followed.  This makes it impossible to set goals and be confident that if you've met them you've performed well, since you are ranked against your peers not against goals set by you and your manager. And these are peers in various states and locations so you more than likely will not even be aware of what others are doing. This process leads to less teamwork and knowledge sharing and more individualism.

As with most companies, your direct manager can make or break your experience.  There are good managers, however, there are a lot of managers who are self serving and not supportive.

With the numerous mergers and acquisitions, the company looks at the acquired employees as inferior and their opinions and recommendations based on experience is not welcomed. Conform or else.

The ""Best Company to Work For"" ranking is questionable.  I've never met an employee who felt that strongly.


Advancement is contingent on the above and can be limited or non-existent.

Job security is non-existent constant acquisitions and reorganization creates rolling lay-offs.

New to the banking industry, but not willing to learn.  Lots of federal compliance violations exist (but not widely discussed). 

Technology is lacking and in some ways is less than the industry standard."

10444,Capital One,Great Place to Start,2013-05-06,4.0,Senior Business Analyst,"Capital One is one of the best places to start a career, because they place a lot of value on development and training.  Campus recruiting starts new hires in an Analyst Development Program that trains job specific skills and provides an avenue to network with peers for the first year at the company.","While the job as a package is very attractive to college graduates just starting out, it is sometimes difficult for Capital One to deliver on its description of job role at the company.  Business analysts are supposed to drive in market strategy, but are sometimes used as a ""jack-of-all-trades"" to do less intelectually stimulating jobs."
10445,Capital One,Great learning experience and place to start your career,2013-05-01,3.0,Associate Marketing Manager,There's a great flexible work hours and many young people.

-Workspace is nice
-Free parking (for now, but I hear this will change soon)","Capital One has taken what was a really great company with an even greater culture and, in one year, have completely ruined it.  I'm all for change and was looking forward to Capital One coming in and making an already great company even greater.  Instead, it has become an environment where everyone is out for themselves and the general concensus is to always cover your own a$$, usually by throwing someone else under the bus.  It's political and full of cliques and if you're not willing to play the games, you are tortured until it is not worth staying anymore. I was with ING Direct for many years and would never have left if it wasn't for the change in culture and the desire of my manager to get ahead at the cost of her team.  Where I used to be proud to tell people where I worked, I became ashamed and would NEVER suggest that anyone leave a good company to come and work at Capital One 360.  Its a shame, but they are very quickly losing good people.  Now other companies are benefiting from their mistakes!  Do NOT do business with this company or go to work there. I assure you, you will not be happy.

Flexible schedules; pay and benefits are slightly above average.","Rapid change can be an interesting challenge but when change seems to occur every second of the day, it creates massive inefficiencies and frustrations at work. Work has become even more bureaucratic over the years and there are way too many cooks in the kitchen, trying to take ownership of everything. Capital One is a meeting culture, again, leading to many hours each day that are completely wasted. The collaborative environment is only good if you are an extreme extrovert, otherwise this is not the place for you as you will find yourself on the road with coworkers for hours on end, commuting from Richmond to Mclean, to the airport, business trips, etc all together. 
At the very top, Capital One is mismanaged. It can take several months or longer to roll out a new process while employees struggle to follow whatever the 'current' process may be on any given day. I have worked in the headquarters for 2 years now and have only seen execs roaming the halls a handful of times. You never hear direction come from the horses mouth, instead it comes from 5 levels below senior management at which point the message has more than likely become misconstrued and miscommunicated. 

Many wasted hours are spent on performance management which, as in most places, is a joke and unfortunately comes down to who you know/ who likes you. The ""diverse"" and ""open"" culture that Capital One raves about on daily basis don't seem to apply to the average person. Joe Schmo will never fit in at Capital One. You must come to work each day with a crazy frat boy-like story in order to fit in with the culture here. Good luck to those who don't!"

All the stalking and butt kissing you have to do to reach the goals is not worth it.  They treat you like a number or product, not a person/employee.

Each division has their goals to achieve, which requires cross functional teams. The result is managers are mired in too many meetings and the time it takes to complete is lengthy. Most projects take 8 to 12 months to complete because of all the levels to approve and committees that need to review. The focus is on top talent, but there are some employees that have come on board from acquisitions and have their heels dug in on how processes should be even though they are outdated compared to the marketplace. The recognition program is focused mainly on front line staff, leaving out the mid level managers 
who feel sandwiched between some employees who feel entitled to be recognized and their manager who continue to push down on mid level managers for recognizing staff without giving them recognition."

When I started, you could come up with a good idea, run it by two levels of management and then at least get it tested on a small group of customers. Now I have to go to my manager, all of his peers, several other department's managers, a steering committee, (at least) two ""project prioritization"" groups because none of them alone are allowed to sign off on anything. Implementing good ideas can take 6-18 months over all.

Stock purchase plan.  In-office gyms in Richmond and McLean. Pay is average.  Company is young and can channel a lot of energy.","I am neither a stupid nor inexperienced professional, but nearly everyday that I have worked here, I have been spoken to like I am.  My experience has been insulted, and my attempts to draw upon past experiences and accumulated skills to enhance project work has been de-valued and discouraged. 

Management has a filter on with regards to divergent opinions, and devotes lots of talk to analytical thinking, problem solving, hanging out shingles, professional development and transparency but takes actions frequently inconsistent with those values. There is an awful lot of talk, but little if any follow through.  Lots of arrogance that would put Wall Street to shame about how innovative, smart, analytical, and high-performance they are.  

Opportunities are defined by how well your manager likes you and how well he/she advocates for you in the performance management process with the ultimate decision-maker (the process itself is wildly imconsistent and laughable).  They will describe your performance with poorly defined qualitative stories  and personal anecdotes then try to ""benchmark"" them against a quantitative scoring systems that creates the appearance of rigor and objectivity in the rankings. Creativity in thinking, business judgement, and results matter far less than your personal style and desire to take-on extraneous responsibilities unrelated to the business.  

People managers are generally young and poorly-seasoned at managing people and work.  They fundamentally do not understand the role of a manager in another professional's development, in managing work effectively, and taking responsibility for their own failures as managers.  Professionals are more like line workers here than knowledge workers.  You will be asked to do things your manager just doesn't want to do, he/she will act as if the work is beneath them, and your manager will not take responsibility when they make an error.

Overall, I would say the value proposition for working at Capital One is not particularly distinctive or defensibly different from any of the other large banks."

10597,Capital One,Worst company I have ever worked for.,2012-09-28,1.0,Relationship Banker,"The benefits are excellent and most managers will work to accommodate your schedule. I have heard of horror stories with other managers telling part-timers that if they didn't drop out of school and go full time, they would be ""let go.""","They treat you like a dog. They figure that since they pay you your salary they can abuse you in any way, shape or form. They stress building a book of business and following up with your pipeline contacts but all of that is thrown in the garbage when they force you to jump around branches last minute and miss scheduled customer appointments you have setup. Then they ask you why you're having trouble meeting your numbers.
There is very slow growth within the company. Management doesn't want to promote employees if they're already doing well in their current positions since it's hard to find quality bankers. At the same time if you're not doing well you can forget about working the ranks. 
The district manager ignores exaggerated and inflated daily branch results just to make herself look better. The DM's also ignore the fact that there are many managers who discriminate against customers. I've worked with some racist managers who would purposely give a hard time to certain ethnic groups for no apparent reason and when I would step in and say it's not right what they're doing, I got the cold shoulder and they would give me a hard time from that point on. I wouldn't be surprised if the ACLU investigates them in the near future.
You can be as loyal as you want to this company but you will never see the opposite. Employees get laid-off without just cause and the turnover rates are ridiculously high.

Dental, Vision, Term Life, AD&D, Disability insurance offered as well. 401(k) match 3% dollar for dollar, and the next 3% .50/dollar. Employee accounts also include free checks, cashier's checks, and no service charges. Training is also very well done, and their internal policy database is very helpful.","Recently there has been a change in upper management. As a result of that change, and the Dodd-Frank Financial ""Reform"" bill, there have been severe cuts in staffing and costs industry wide. Now management is micro-managed excessively and needlessly. This is a from Top-to-Bottom problem. From Tellers up to Senior Management there is more coaching taking place thank actual work.

 Emphasis on customer service seems to be lip service. Employees are not empowered to make meaningful decisions at any level, and redundancy is rampant. 

 Sales and service incentive tracking is archaic at best, and in-accurate on a good day. Sales tracking systems often crash several times, causing people to be paid incentives incorrectly or not at all is not uncommon. Incentive program payments have being reduced approximately  25% annually for the past three years. 

Oftentimes new product or business lines are rolled-in or rolled-out in unrealistic time-frames, with no real support.

Examples:
-Mortgage products presently can have up to a 60 days lag time before they get to underwriting, causing duplicate credit applications to be required to proceed with the loan.
-Unsecured loan products were completely canceled with three days notice to branches. 
-Mortgage leads can oftentimes go 30-60 days without being called due to lack of staffing, or lack of accountability. 
-Underwriting is excessive, unrealistic, and completely without accountability.
-Branches have previously been told to stop proactively selling credit-cards completely with short notice.

The computer systems are not integrated, and are a patchwork of programs which make accomplishing simple tasks tiresome and difficult. Branches are staffed at a bare-minimum, and customer service suffers as a result. 

Promotion from within has also suffered as of late, and a large percentage of the senior management comes from outside the bank with little or no experience with the company. Promotion and talent development internally has fallen off a cliff in recent years."

Now, all the responsibilities that the Assistant Manager performed is now falling on everyone else, and to top it off - we are receiving No additional training or compensation for it.

-The performace review process needs to be looked at as well.  Many associates receive raises (or no raises) based on the performance of their branches versus their individual performance.

-Tuition reimbursement for PT who reg works 20 hrs/week (up to $2500) and for Full timers (up to $5k).
-If you are unsure of a procedure, need guidelines, or have legal issues, they have a customer service number for employees to call and get directed to the right department.  You can also obtain policy and procedure guide on the intranet.  The intranet is very resourceful.

The company itself offers many opportunities and a lot of aid for their employees.  As a Relationship Banker, if sales is not your passion, then don't apply.  Any sales job can be stressful and time consuming, but if you're into sales, Capital One would be a great place to work.","-If you're not sales oriented, this is not for you
-Some procedure takes a while to do, sometimes you would have customers sign things and then you later organize everything after hours.  Notes are helpful so you can remember what happened between you and a customer, potentially to obtain sales later, but if you don't have it, you will be frowned upon or cause your branch to fail an inspection from the sales and service coach.  Bc of this, you could also be staying after hours to add volume to your notes.
-Follow ups schedules, possible an hour to open an account and add a checkcard, coin machine bags needing to be changed, and there's only two of you while there's 5 people waiting.
-If you're not doing good or just doing ok...prepare to be micro-managed.  Logs and trackers on how many people you've talked to, how many you've helped, any sales from any conversations.
-If you're not meeting your goals, or just meeting the bare minimum, you are indirectly hinted to find new jobs.  So the implications could be ""Sales is not your thing, find another passion/position"" or ""We're going to let you go if you don't start producing the numbers.""

If that makes sense to you, then you will have a very long and successful career at Capital One. If you are left wondering how you can show your process when there is no end goal and why you wouldn't want to have an end goal in the first place--then you should proceed with caution.

It's an endless cycle of creating decks and having meetings to prove that you are ""thinking"" and ""producing"" but little to no actual work ever gets completed. Long-termers seem perfectly content with this set up. However, it can be maddening to goal oriented people.

It's also a very political environment. Bonus are based on what essentially are gossip sessions between everyone who is at a level above you.

Well-communicated agenda and ambitious outlook that is infectious.,"A very process-bloated organization.  An elaborate network of people/processes/initiatives that they think 'ensures' high quality results (speaking from the Digital side).  Being a (primarily) credit-card oriented company, the work pipeline is looked at from a capacity/operational perspective and cannot be tied directly to revenue.  I come from an IT/Software vendor where work was done right the first time, and FAST - because it was tied directly to revenue.

The meeting culture here is bizarre.  My previous company had a high ratio of remote workers, so we EFFECTIVELY used email and stuck to conference calls to get decisions moving.  Here, half the people in my meetings aren't paying attention and busy instant messaging about something else.  The meetings end up with little to no headway and always include the words, ""it sounds like we need to have more conversations about..."".  I'm not exaggerating.  The worst part is that these people can't be in my meetings because they're double booked in someone else's.  All the while, mine was TRULY more important to the organization than the one they attended.  So, two meetings are shot while one of them could've been dealt with via email in a smart manner.  Every time I craft comprehensive well-written emails, people want to set up a meeting to discuss because they don't want to take the time to read it and think it through.

10776,Capital One,Not as great a place to work as you are encouraged to believe,2012-01-31,2.0,,"benefits are good and on par with marketplace
physical workplace environment is very good 
salary compensation if coming from outside is comparable or above market
however, once you are inside the compensation process is extremely slow and does not keep pace 
coworkers are among some of the best people","performance management process leaves much to be desired  
little chance for promotion unless have management support
favors youthful go getters willing to work long hours (60-100 plus hrs per week)
can ""try""  next level role without pay or title change 6-18 months and still not get promotion if  management does not agree or they eliminate role/department
work life balance doesn't truly exist below management level 
open culture only works if you agree; woe to those who question you'll find yourself moved out"

Nice campus and provisions for people to get isolated from the stressful life.","Challenges gets shortened with the hierarchy getting involved at multiple stages.

10779,Capital One,A respectable company with great benefits and one 100 best companies to work for.,2012-01-22,4.0,Operation Production Coordinator,Great benefits and always have expected amount of work flow everyday. The  comapny provides bonuses if you meet performance standards.,Not many career advancement oppurtunities available for my field of education. Merit increase is extremely limited to a minimum with excellent evaluation.
10780,Capital One,Laid back atmosphere and awesome compensation,2012-01-22,5.0,Risk Associate,The pay is great and there are plenty of great people working there. I have great benefits and the opportunities are numerous.The company really shows their appreciation for the employees they recognize your work and accomplishments.,It can be tiring at times and the work gets repetitive. You can get burnt out with dealing with the customers constantly so try to get rest.
10781,Capital One,Learning lessons every day,2012-01-22,5.0,,Ilove the people and culture,Need to stop Outsourcing to offshore
10782,Capital One,Very good,2012-01-20,4.0,,"People are really great here

More people to compete with for jobs"

- some really talented and analytical people in the company","The con is that they are low on the comp side, especially for the people who have been working there for a number of years. \"
10784,Capital One,Good place to work,2012-01-16,4.0,,"Smart people
Great Campus
Great training
Interesting work","Performance management awards perception more than real results
Promotions seem to be based more on who you know"
10785,Capital One,Great place to start one's career but later it may slow down,2012-01-16,4.0,,"Bright, smart people and plenty of learning opportunities.
Management listens to your ideas.
Great campus, nice facilities, flexible working environment. Not very political","Becomes very bureacratic once you need to implement your ideas.
Performance management means to be scientific but often is based on subjective perceptions"
10786,Capital One,More work for less pay,2012-01-13,2.0,Director,Good decision making by C level executives to save the company twice in the last 10 years through MOU and the great recession.,Emphasis on cost saving resulted in large numbers of inexperienced hires. No career advancement without brown nosing. Highly political environment -good old boys club - no good for minority/foreigners.
10787,Capital One,Good while it lasted.,2012-01-11,4.0,Collections Representative,"Great company, loved my co-workers and managers, pay was decent.",Never know when they will reorganize a department.
10788,Capital One,Very Disappointing,2012-01-10,1.0,Customer Service Associate,"Day one benefits, salary, location.","C1 thinks that passing out Jolly Ranchers, rolling around snack carts and catering in food keeps employees happy. SO NOT TRUE! 

Trainers are two-faced and play favorites!

They insist that their ""Half-assed"" training methods are sufficient for learning the job!

They put extreme pressure on brand new employees while in the ""Nest"" meaning, training while on the production floor.

Not guaranteed to compensate employees for time worked before they've separated from the company. Pretty much have to fight for your money.

""CUSTOMER SERVICE ON STEROIDS,"" as they call it, is a joke! QA (Quality) marks off for every little detail. It's like they set people up for failure right from the start!"
10789,Capital One,Great but could be better,2012-01-05,4.0,,"Analytical, open, challenging  and democratic","Too analytical, slow decision making"
10790,Capital One,great place to work,2012-01-05,5.0,,great place to work and learn. great people to work with.,too many meetings at times and you'll need to be focused to get things done
10791,Capital One,Company is unwieldy and poorly managed in some sectors.,2012-01-03,2.0,,appears to be currently growing.,Not employee friendly or merit based.  Poor communication throughout organization.
10792,Capital One,"Flexible work environment, great for working mothers.",2011-12-29,5.0,Application Developer,"Every building on campus has a Mother's Room for women who need to pump breast milk.  This is awesome.  They are also very flexible about work hours and working from home.  This is great for working mothers.  If a kid is sick and can't go to school, you can work from home.","The company is so huge that you can sometimes feel overlooked or neglected.  When I started working there, nobody knew who my manager was supposed to be.  I felt like I had to figure everything out on my own."
10793,Capital One,I have worked for other financial institutions and Capital One is by far the best. They truely practice what they preach,2011-12-14,5.0,Senior Project Manager,"Levels do not matter when it comes to adding input or suggestions/comments/concerns. I have worked in several dept's at Capital One and you truely are treated like an equal no matter if you are entry level, or a Senior level. Capital One gives all its associates the opportunity to learn and grow from those at a higher level and is very patient and encouraging when it comes to personal growth and development.","The performance management cycle is bittersweet. If you perform well, you are rewarded highly. But, if you work in a large department that means you can get lost in the mix of other associates you are calibrated with at the end of the year. Its hard to stand out and shine if you work within a large group of people at the same level."
10794,Capital One,"Mainly good folks, but lots of posers with power in Richmond",2011-12-03,2.0,Project Manager,Some of the best and smartest people I've worked with in terms of sheer analytic skills and ability.  The West Creek complex has lots to make the working area fresh and enjoyable - albeit a bit short of space.,"Make no mistake - the place is politics to the nth degree, and not in a favorable way.  If you're looking for candor and transparency in leadership this in not the place to look.  I'm not saying that all are vile, but I would say that there is an 'old guard' in mid-upper management that has lost its way.  And the self-interest of these folks severely limits the ability of the company to be the best.  People are pawns, and contractors... well they're something less, but at least provide cover."
10795,Capital One,Analytics trumps leadership,2011-12-01,3.0,,"-resources are there to do your best work
-bright co-workers
-beautiful facilities
-company quickly learns from past mistakes and moves on
-conservative financial management increases probability for longer-term success
-analytics (fact-based decisions) reduces tendencies for inefficient meetings & discussions","-good people management skills are not fully appreciated nor rewarded
-over-reliance on performance management process, comp & ben features to ""engage"" & motivate associates
-soft skills often rated more highly than actual results
-must be OK with being a mobile worker (no place to call your own)
-performance management process is often used to defend political decisions
-analytics can over-shadow common sense & lessons learned from experience"
10796,Capital One,Ok place,2011-11-30,3.0,Customer Service Representative,Most of the other employees are cool. Cap One is very good about helping you get days off if needed for any reason.,You have very little time off the phone. It's hard to get a different position. The QAing system needs some work.
10797,Capital One,Too many cooks in the kitchen,2011-11-28,3.0,,"Great work/life balance with flex time and work from home options.
Base compensation is solid.
Many experienced co-workers and managers","Too many project managers with little business knowledge.
Decisions are often made without input from employees affected by changes.
Too many layers of management.
Innovation from anyone other than project managers is discouraged.
Management not open to suggestions and feedback."
10798,Capital One,Great employer to work for,2011-11-22,5.0,,"Focus on career development, good work life balance balance",Salary slightly lower than industry at sr analyst level
10799,Capital One,Contractor Purgatory,2011-11-18,2.0,,"Capital One is a brand that many future employers will recognize and carries some clout in this area.

Contractors are well-compensated for work.

Working from home and flexible scheduling allows for a nice work-life balance.

Fast moving.

Nice co-workers.","Contracting feels like being a stranger in a strange land. There is a certain hierarchy that is built into the way things are done there, and contractors are at the bottom of the rung. It is reinforced not only by differently colored badges (Yellow vs. Blue) and CONT after one's name on email and IM, but also by involvement and perks, such as not being able to use the gym, health center, or Career Development Center. Also contractors are excluded from other events with the exception of department potlucks. 

Space is at a premium at West Creek, so don't expect a cubicle or an office to work in. The PODS can be very noisy, thus headphones are a necessity.

I have personally found that several managers dangle the conversion carrot to increase productivity from contractors only to renege at a later date. The decisions on who to make an associate are not always clear.

Do not expect much in the way of training or assistance after the first week or so in the job. This is SPARTA.

All that being said, a good manager can negate many of those issues. Managers who view contractors as team members rather than as resources make all the difference.

Culturally, Capital One moves very fast. Reorgs and change management are very common. However, these decisions are not always well- considered or fully funded. Capital One loves processes and data, but doesn't always know what to do with it. 
 
Too many meetings, acronyms, and as other posters described, empty words."
