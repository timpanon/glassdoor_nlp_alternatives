Work life balance is a concept which is looked down upon and if you do somehow find the courage to voice this problem they will chuck you out of the organization on same lame excuse. 
If you are talented don't waste your time here, especially for operations & HR profile. The work environment is toxic to the extent that shouting as a Manager is not only encouraged but applauded (behind the scenes). The organization encourages Managers to build fake cases against employees whom they don't like as they are not ""Yes Sir"" kind of people. 
Any review you read talking about ""Great Culture"" is all fabricated. At middle- top management a lot of employees are sadits & masochist who put even more pressure on employees during Covid last year. 
It's a shame to see such companies still surviving."

Merit is certainly not the criteria. And sadly if you have no support you will be no where and bullied by the biggies.
-No job Security- we all know how Girnar has always been in news for layoffs. First they hire then fire. During covid they fired so many employees stating cost impact and the very next month hiring starting happening, ads with actors. Atleast don’t lie to the employees who worked with you for so long. 
-Horrid culture - well the culture flows from top to bottom. Few business leaders don’t even treat their employees as equals, they shame and bully their own team members. Things are no different in the HR team which should lead in setting the right culture. Infact things are even worse there. 
-Fudged data & reports made and presented in every team ( Window dressing everywhere) 
- The HR team lacks spine even now.
- Some businesses/ processes start and then shut down coz no one cares to check what’s actually happening on the field. Employees are filling their own pockets with the aid of the dealers. If you raise a voice you are not heard. The ombudsman is far from being fair and just."

2. Your learn to be agile and lean at the same time.
3. Top management is reachable.
4. If you are in sales/business side and if you perform well then sky is the limit.","1. They don't give much importance to tech. Tech for them is just an enabler. More importance is given to business and sales people. Even though CEO himself was techy once upon a time, but since his focus has shifted then entire firm's focus has shifted too.
2. Tech's budget is made extremely low and after a certain level you can't expect any promotions.
3. No concept of One on One in the company. This management line just below CEO is incompetent to be called as leaders"

(cmon guys that is my salary amd my incentive you r holding and you have no right to do that) 
I am sure that I took the right call of leaving this company and worked there for three months only.
Reasons for leaving - 
its totally a messed up structure where roles aren't defined at all. 
Even the salaries are not defined as per the roles , one of my team member was getting as much as I earned. 
The ratio of variable and fix income varies, some people i knew were drawing all fixed and no variable at all.
No policies are in place, even the HR is a mere formality. 
6 days a week ( it's high time guys, stop exploiting your people, MNCs handled by non indians have stopped it way back, when are you going to be able to understand that we as indians are still  a backward because of the thought process we have). 
No matter how hard you work, bosses are never gonna see it or realise it because nothing is documented, even the incentives are given based on relationships and word of mouth spread over. 
People are judged on the basis of perception and not performance. 
They lack ethics. 
They don't know what does doing the right thing means and for them as long as they have the jugaad to do the job or solve an issue, they are good and they don't even possibly believe in looking at making long term processes.

- You might have good work life balance, depending on the project you are working upon.
- They don't have ""you're being watched"" type culture.
- Politics is less but people working here for couple of years, always get priority over others. No matter what!! 
- CXOs are easily approachable. Though that hardly makes any difference.","This gets a big list. If you're coming from a good MNC(as it was with me), the list gets even bigger. Let me start with Tech stuff -
- They claim to work on cutting edge technologies but reality is, they are using technologies so badly that  in order to fix things, you'll get confused where to start with. Completely immature implementation of any small or big framework for that matter.
- Mostly people working here, are working here only since beginning of their career. This includes CTO. They have their small universe. They just can't think of other ways to implement things. You'll even have to fight for obvious things if that differs from how they are doing it.
- In my less than 6 months of tenure, I've met multiple people, some of which are from IIT, who are tired of these and have quit/thinking of quitting.
- If this was not enough, let me talk about admin/hr. High chances are, you won't get a permanent place to sit. Every day you would need to search for a place to sit. On top of that, the quality of chair is too bad. Most of them are broken. Despite highlighting it multiple times, CXOs could be heard saying, it's the problem of whole office, and not just yours. No sync between departments.
- Let's talk about HRs. It took 2 full days for them, to complete onboarding process. 95% time I was idle!!
- They have really bad health/life insurance benefits. No health insurance is there for parents. Per family coverage is just 2 lacs, with no option to get more. 
- I got a broken laptop, to which IT people told me, that I was lucky enough to get it on very first day. BTW I had to reach back to them. within a week as charger stopped working!!
- Only reason they are able to survive is, funding.

My reason of joining this company was, I wanted to shift to Jaipur and only they could match my current salary.  So if that's the case with you as well, i would strongly recommend to look for other options."

They are incurring losses and with the web 2.0 bubble burst they are gonna go down too. 

Too many people in HR department. This is because their only focus is on hiring and then firing and then hiring for same position again.

No appreciation at all. You might think that you have delivered a master piece, but don't expect a good word from top management.

At the time of joining they said, usually we don't give appraisal to those who join in Nov or later but we will give you appraisal as a special case fo please settle for a salary which was lower than I was asking for by 2 LPA.  
At the time of appraisal, they all denied saying it was not given in written. What about fixed salary which at least was given in written?
They will head hunt you and when the business doesn't work because of their own fault they will say you were an under performer and hence please look for a job. 
My last 8 months has been a hell. The boss was as abusive and insulting as possible. In the beginning I used to think how can a person talk like this. When I started retaliating and showing his faults and incidents where he had manipulated number to save him, he made sure that I leave the company.

There is a blame game culture in the company and no one wants to take ownership or listen to his or his own team's fault. I am talking about my own boss as well. He is a psychopath and when I raised the concern they all tried to cover him up because he is at a senior position and he licks everyone above him. 
If you try to improve the process for a sustainable business, no one is there to listen to you. It's a pure LaLa type company where in the name of process they use whatsapp and call.
