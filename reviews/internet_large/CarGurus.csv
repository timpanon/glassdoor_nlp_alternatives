0,CarGurus,Amazing place to work,2022-04-07,5.0,Manager,Incredible benefits and training programs. Upper management actually takes the time to get to know the lower/mid level employees,nothing to mention at this time.
1,CarGurus,Great company who take care of staff and reward hard work,2022-04-06,5.0,Dealer Relationship Manager,"I have worked with CG for the last year and I have found them to have a very inclusive culture where they focus on staff wellbeing, I have been challenged and supported to learn more and grow as an individual. 

They reward hard work. Targets are set high but there is a lot of support and an array of products to sell. If you exceed target you are rewarded for it.

The best work life balance I have had in a job yet, if you are structured it is a dream job.",We are about to move back into the office from being fully remote which will cause some difficulty.
2,CarGurus,Great work life balance,2022-03-29,5.0,Sales,Working at CarGurus allowed me to have a great work life balance. The perks were also very generous and it was clear they wanted us to be happy.,Quotas changed each quarter and there was a delay in getting them to us
3,CarGurus,Best of both worlds,2022-03-27,5.0,Marketing Director,"CarGurus has vibe of a startup but the resources and structure of a public company. The culture is casual and fun, but the work feels ""big"" and you know you will get the support you need to be successful at your job. The business is also really diverse and interesting--I didn't realize the extent of this until I started and learned more. People were super welcoming and the work life balance is pretty real. I know a lot of companies say they care but I really believe they do here.",There is turnover but I don't think it's a reflection of the company but rather broader trends (great resignation) and also people who long for the pre-IPO days leaving to to startups. Though the upside is that new people who are coming in are very energized about where the company is going next.
4,CarGurus,Still the best after 6+ years!,2022-03-25,5.0,Senior Regional Sales Director,"People, pay and a kick-butt product! Sam Zales is truly the bright spot at CG!! Wouldn’t be the same without him!!",Attrition. Always sad to see people you know and love move on.
5,CarGurus,Buyer beware!,2022-03-21,1.0,Sales,"I want to start by saying it is hard to find pros, When the last time I left a review I believe it was deleted. But here it goes again… They try to make a Silicon Valley type office with lunch, snacks, even some games and happy hours on the premise.","Not even sure where to start here. I worked at CarGurus for roughly a year and a half. In the year and a half I started regretting my decision roughly after training started. In a year and a half I burned through about four different managers - All of which made promises that were never kept.  If you are a favorite in the organization, (generally this is Men), you WILL succeed.   If for some reason (that you will likely not be made aware of) you get on the wrong side of your manager or their manager, look out!  After about six months into my tenure I started having that sick feeling on Sunday nights. About two months later the sick feeling started coming on Saturday nights, by the end I started feeling sick in my gut Fridays because I knew that Monday was just a short couple days away and the threats and stress to be better would just keep surmounting!  This place is a glorified fraternity. If you’re not in the inner circle You might as well start looking for a job. Buyer beware- this company is a lemon!"
6,CarGurus,Amazing,2022-03-13,5.0,Account Executive,"The product is simple to understand  and offers excellent value compared to main competitors. 
KPIs are very achievable, and a 6-month ramping target is very fair. 
If you want a job where everyday is different and the culture is fun and challenging, this is the place to be . Management is supportive and leaves you to take responsibility for your own targets and to organise your own day. 
The office is in a great part of Dublin with free catered lunches and a fully stocked kitchen.
Pay and benefits are excellent and ahead of a lot of Tech Companies in Ireland .",Nothing really other than from June we are back in the office 3 days a week  when a lot of the team are now use to full WFH
7,CarGurus,Great company with a solid work/life balqnce,2022-03-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good perks: bonuses, commuter benefits are paid for, free lunches, snacks in office, health/dental are solid, and they did perk boxes during the pandemic
 
Culture is very much based around work hard, play hard. A slack channel for every hobby or interest. Warm and inclusive environment.","Products debut without care for the teams that support them. Business decisions can be short sighted. 

Snacks in office aren’t exactly healthy."
8,CarGurus,Great place,2022-02-22,5.0,Account Executive,They care about you as an employee and have clear career paths.,No full remote option offered.
9,CarGurus,American companies just do it better!,2022-02-22,5.0,Marketing Executive,"Amazing perks and benefits (including shares and monthly free gifts)
Generous salary and bonuses 
Big friendly community feel
Big on diversity 
Cheesy (but fun!) American spirit 
Lots of fun work events, seminars etc
Senior team is honest and open","Some areas still lacking in diversity
More investment needed in technologies and infrastructures 
UK teams feel a bit divided from rest of the business
No London office"
10,CarGurus,Pretty great company,2022-02-18,4.0,Digital Marketing Consultant,Overall great benefits & cool swag gifts,Management seemed confused and unclear at times.
11,CarGurus,Mediocre at best,2022-02-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The company culture used to be amazing,"Culture has gone severely downhill since they did layoffs in the early Covid days, attrition has been around 35% in the last six months. They are bleeding good talent"
12,CarGurus,Great Place to Work,2022-02-10,5.0,Senior Manager,Great place to work with super benefits & culture,Not too many downsides to report.
13,CarGurus,"Great culture, good vibes, relaxed atmosphere, little micro-managing",2022-02-09,5.0,Sales Executive,"- Easy product to understand and sell
- Low KPI's (a handful of 3 minute calls per day for instance)
- Very competitive pay and benefits
- Commission paid monthly
- City centre office provides free breakfast, lunch and snacks daily
- Extremely sound management, willing to leave you to your own devices if you put in the work
- Great team culture overall, everyone helps everyone and wants everyone to succeed. They are building something special in Dublin","- Repetitive, cold calling (this is the biggest weakness)
- No consultative approach here, pick up the phone and dial! (I get flashbacks of Wolf of Wall Street when I say that)
- End of month gets a little stressful with pre 9am meetings every morning to discuss your daily forecasts etc."
14,CarGurus,"Good Company, Great People",2022-02-03,4.0,Account Executive,"Industry leader, good brand recognition, developed salesforce with access to market","they removed the outbound sales position, only account management functions"
15,CarGurus,Undervalued and Overworked,2022-01-31,1.0,Account Manager,"CarGurus regularly gifts employees, however I believe this to be a cleverly disguised bride in order to hush everyone about the horrible working conditions.","Where to start?

The product is not good, in fact compared to competitors its one of the worst out there. The customers have zero respect for the product or company because the jump in pricing for renewals is too high and berate the reps on the phone. 

Everybody is afraid to speak to management about the feedback received from the customers for fear of being told you are bringing to much negativity to team meetings. This is despite the fact the whole team hear the same thing day in day out. This creates unbearable tension because you feel like you are struggling but also feel like you can't speak up. 

Management are incompetent. They gossip and moan to team members about other team members which is totally inappropriate. The team is top heavy which means they have plenty on time on their hands to micro manage, checking dials, checking time lapsed between dials, even reading transcripts from calls! They have a list of favorites who they push to the front at the cost of other reps. They give favorites the better accounts, push them for promotions, call them out and clap them on the back for the most minor of tasks. But be careful, should you dare to have one bad fall they will not help you back up. In fact they will kick you while you are down and make sure you stay there. They would rather believe you are a bad sales rep then look at why reps are not hitting target. This has to be one of the reasons why there is such a high turnover across all the sales teams. Shame on our USA counterparts for not looking into this more thoroughly. Shame on you! Why are you not questioning the level of turnover in the Dublin office?"
16,CarGurus,"Great people, Great leadership",2022-01-29,4.0,Sales Manager,Great group of people to work with. CEO and leadership team very caring. Excellent benefits.,Tough industry to sell into but if you do the work you get the results.
17,CarGurus,Great starting place for Tech Sales,2022-01-29,4.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),Amazing benefits including food. Nice office.,"Seemed to hire anyone. 
Month to month targets - not quarterly"
18,CarGurus,Great place to work,2022-01-25,5.0,Software Engineering Co-op,This company offers fantastic benefits and treats interns/co-ops as members of the team. I was able to do real valuable work and learn a ton in a very supportive environment.,Can't think of any of the top of my head.
19,CarGurus,Skip,2022-01-25,5.0,Account Executive,Great people to work with- Great company,Nothing really comes to my mind
20,CarGurus,"Average  product, poor management",2022-01-24,2.0,Account Executive,Good salary. Fun and supportive work environment,"The company sees themselves as a major innovative disruptor to the market. They're not, the product isn't good enough to compete with auto trader. Sales management had no ideas on how to win more business other than make more calls and make more calls."
21,CarGurus,Ok,2022-01-18,4.0,Account Manager,Room for promotions and a lot of education offered. Good benefits,Money could be slightly better
22,CarGurus,Exceptional Place to work - Culture would win a gold star!,2022-01-13,5.0,Recruiter,"Culture, Support, Tools, Communication, Salaries, Benefits.",Lack of car parking but it is city centre based so thats pretty normal.
23,CarGurus,Great place to work,2022-01-11,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Great place to work. I really enjoyed working there. The management is exceptional, Wendy was a great mentor and humble with the people. It was the first time I met a Manager VIP who was sitting on the floor with you and called you by name. She really cared about the peeps and the company. The environment was really collaborative and inclusive. Great talented people.","Unfortunately, covid happens and most of the team members were left home."
24,CarGurus,Great Comp and benefits,2022-01-10,3.0,Account Executive,Incredible comp and benefits package and reliable team atmosphere.,Not as much training as is needed and also quite a big micro managing culture
25,CarGurus,Great Benefits & Perks,2021-12-20,5.0,Field Account Manager,"~Pandemic Remote Perks they send you a random gift every month until RTO occurs ( They've sent an air fryer, small smores making kit including a small camp stove etc..) 
~3 weeks of vacation time on year 1
~Actual unlimited PTO that they encourage you to use 
~If you go into the office catered lunch's every day and you can choose your meal
~Flat organization. You can probably send a message to any of the corporate leadership and they wouldn't care at all. Super down to earth.","~Base compensation could be a bit higher with the rapid inflation going on
~There is technically a ""Sales draw"" in the sense you could owe the company money if your performance slacks
~Health Benefits premiums are on the higher side"
26,CarGurus,Fantastic Company,2021-12-09,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"The people around you horizontally all want to succeed and succeed with you, they'll go out of their way to help you with whatever you're doing. And vertically there are levels of people up the ladder who all know me and care for my and my team's success!",Nah it's pretty solid. Sometimes they have slip ups as they try and turn into a larger corporate company but at the heart they're always trying to do right for their employees.
27,CarGurus,High turnover and big egos,2021-12-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Random things sent in the mail (mostly CarGurus advertisement for you to wear),"Recently a woman left a review here with her experience. Immediately after it was posted, it was buried by a five star review. I would not put CarGurus past writing 5 star reviews for themselves to silence feedback regarding a woman’s experience in the workplace. As the previous reviewer mentioned, CarGurus fees like a “boys club”. Management has favorites. Compensation is underwhelming. Roads to career development lead to dead ends. Constant surveys asking the same questions, but never lead to internal changes. VERY high turnover rate."
28,CarGurus,Great workplace,2021-11-30,4.0,Customer Success Specialist,"Employee first focus, great healthy environment","Varying schedules, Monday-Friday work week"
29,CarGurus,"Good Start, women in tech unwelcome.",2021-11-30,2.0,Engineer,Compensation only slightly below market. Nice learning path offered through Udemy.,"This is not 1960. When I explain to other software professionals how my team works, the word that people use is toxic. Team mates tear each other down and steal choice assignments. Need to work on accepting people as they are and avoid pre-judging. 

If you want to fit in, you'll have to figure out how to join the old boys club, and curry favor from management. Favoritism is how people get promotions, raises, and good assignments, not merit.

There are many other reviews that point out these problems. CarGurus responds saying they are aware and dealing with the issue. This is not my experience. I see a turnover problem, with many experienced people leaving from ICs to C-suite. This is bad enough to be discussed by the CEO in a recent all-company meeting."
30,CarGurus,"Great perks, but poor mid-level management shows blatant favoritism with no follow up by HR",2021-11-18,1.0,Finance,"Top tier perks, employee gifts, free lunch, stocked kitchen 24/7, great facility space with games and alcohol","You could be a star employee with no mark on your record, but if you are not a ""favorite"" of the manager you will miss out on career/promotion opportunities year over year. Unethical hiring practices and personal or intimate relationships between a boss and subordinate allows for any kind of poor performance feedback to go unanswered (poor performer can even be promoted by their spouse). I saw an employee refer someone for a job on their own team, get paid a referral fee, interview that person, hire them, negotiate their salary and sign on bonus, and then eventually promote them (multiple times) later on. The fact that one person could do all those things is very unethical and HR did nothing about it."
31,CarGurus,Great place to work,2021-11-12,5.0,Sales Executive,Great place to work- flexible and love the people I work with,A lot of changes- changes are good. But too many changes over the course of short periods of time
32,CarGurus,Currently Lacking Technical Leadership,2021-11-09,3.0,Principal Data Engineer,"* Tight nit analytics community

37,CarGurus,Great place to work for beginner SDR’e,2021-09-16,5.0,Sales Development Representative,A very helpful sales team that makes sure all SDR’s succeed. Fun and fast paced environment.,A lot of inbound calls would not be sales related so we had to deal with customers who were angry about their membership.
38,CarGurus,Great place to work!,2021-09-14,5.0,Technical Recruiter,"The culture here is amazing, great work/life balance and management really cares about their employees. C-Suite is super transparent as well",I have no cons for working here
39,CarGurus,Company vision is only topped by the culture,2021-09-14,5.0,Recruiter,"Awesome company culture, centered around collaboration. Compelling business/product vision with high upside. Endless benefits, perks, forms of compensation that leave me feeling like I am a valued employee.","While it is improving drastically, I still sense a disconnect between the employees and the execs. But that is honestly the worst thing I can say about the company."
40,CarGurus,Not a good company for people of color,2021-09-12,1.0,Engineer,"- every 3 months I’ve cream

45,CarGurus,Great place to work,2021-07-22,5.0,Senior Recruiter,Lots of autonomy in my role and ever increasing transparency and collaboration with other teams and departments to better forecast needs. Senior management genuinely seems to care about the people below them and what to make sure they are kept in the loop of where the business is going. The company has gone through a lot of growing pains but I think it has taken really big strides and has seen a lot of improvement.,Career development is still not where I would hope it would be and is not as structured or transparent as I would want it to be but it is getting better and being actively worked on.
46,CarGurus,Good place to get experience,2021-07-12,4.0,Account Executive,"Great employee benefits, great people to work with",Automotive sales industry has taken a major hit with the pandemic making it hard to stay successful in sales.

Perks were great when we were in the office.","CarGurus sales organization has gone though so many changes since the pandemic has began it is unrecognizable. Upper Management has either quit or been replaced and quotas are constantly being changed by teams who are not familiar with the sales department. Most have been waiting for compensation to align with the market rate but that is clearly not happening and management see's no issue, which is why they are losing top reps and managers. They have not listened to what their employees have been asking for and the messaging and communication from management for the last year has been non existent or erratic."

You can take any days off even if the whole department will be out no structure or having to worry about what days you want off.","Everyone is out for themselves, if you seem to be progressing be careful who you confide in because they will throw you under the bus. Employees tear each other down! Don't make any mistakes because they will be brought to management. Rethink who your friends are at this company because they are not, especially if they are on your team. Sad to know when I leave I will have no friends from here.

Upper management promised over and over again there would be no layoffs due to covid and would even get on calls with employee to reassure them. Guess what they lied and laid off 13% of the staff completely damaging the core value they are so proud of as well as the culture. The pros seem good but there are so many other companies with the same benefits. 

No room for growth unless you're here for years. I'm so disappointed this isn't working out because I drank that cool aid hard and for too long but it's just not getting better."

- Generally nice people to work with and an energetic company overall
- Big name in the Boston tech scene, so nice resume recognition
- Increase in ERGs was a welcome change and gave specific groups within the organization a lot more voice","I was at CG for a little over 1.5 years and in my time there I saw 0 opportunity for advancement within my team. Some middle managers were held to higher standards than others. Unfortunately, and I hate to say it, female middle managers had a sharper microscope on their strategies. I went a whole year with 0 goals to work towards and my requests for setting KPIs/goals also fell on deaf ears. Even if I wanted to move up to a new role, I had nothing to measure against besides my own self-imposed goals.

Any 360 feedback given to managers at review time fell on deaf ears. I never saw any improvement or addressing of the issues within a team or department. 

The work is as a whole, uninteresting. CG is an advertising company parading as a tech company. That's been made very clear over the last 2 years as competitors & Facebook Marketplace has eaten into their marketshare. Many of the marketing and sales messages developed were just regurgitations of the same messages developed 1-2+ years prior. Nothing innovative or interesting to share with dealers, and it hurt us. 

If you're looking for an easier job to coast in, CG is for you. If you're looking for a growth trajectory or career advancement, the work is simply not challenging or interesting enough to get you there. And management doesn't help you get there either."

Incredible leadership team

In what was a challenging year for everyone I couldn't have been happier to spend mine at CarGurus. They were incredibly supportive and understanding of the challenges faced outside of the work place. They have a genuine desire to create a work/life balance.

Like most Account Executive roles you get out of this role what you put in. A willingness to dig in is required to succeed here.

The leadership team don't feel like scary ""powers that be"" there is a sence that they are equally as part of the team as you are. One manager in particular was the best I've ever had in all my years of employment. He had an incredible way of approaching any situation and an ability to execute well thought out strategies to overcome them.","A slight hint of favouritism 
No target reduction for leave/ time missed"
84,CarGurus,Amazing Company!,2021-02-04,5.0,Regional Sales Director,Very fair to its employees and one of the best places I’ve ever worked!,No cons for me right now.
85,CarGurus,Not getting any better,2021-02-03,2.0,Anonymous,"CarGurus pays well and you'll have the opportunity to work with some really smart folks. Certain teams are extremely well-run, with opportunities for meaningful contribution and personal development. The company has money to spend and rewards employees well with comp, benefits, and bonuses, generally speaking.","The biggest drawback recently has been some of the management hires/promotions. CarGurus has struggled mightily to get the right people into Director and VP roles. Some of those management hires left or were exited within months. Others still work there, and their teams are losing people left and right due to their poor management and people leadership. In cases where certain leaders have been exited from the organization for good reason, CarGurus hasn't done much to own up to their mistakes. Employees notice this, and lose trust in leadership. This has impacted engineering, product, sales, sales ops, marketing, and more. Some of these bad hires have set entire departments back years.

Another unfortunate development is the lip service paid to DEI initiatives. CarGurus says the right things most of the time, and sometimes does the right thing. But there are still plenty of missed opportunities. Too many.

Despite my team being amazing, the work became progressively less fun and engaging during my final year. New leadership brought new formality. You can't expect a company to stay ""young"" forever, but I think we lost a lot of our positivity."

96,CarGurus,Lacks Leadership and Direction,2020-12-28,2.0,Software Engineer,"- Pay was decent.

- Engineering colleagues were talented, and the collaboration culture was strong.

- Middle management genuinely cared about their reports. This is more than I can say about other employers in Boston.","- It felt like leadership mentally abandoned our existing product offerings to dealers. While the company had been profitable selling software and ad space to dealers, by 2019 the company seemed uninterested in optimizing our core profitable products. This created a situation where feature teams felt written off when direction was roadmapped at the company.

- Leadership’s investment into new product offerings felt misguided and poorly executed. Our P2P marketplace functions seemed unadvertised and phoned in, and our historical offer test alienated our dealer base (look up CarGurus Carvana Offer Test). It’s hard to feel excited about these new directions when the company can’t execute properly.

- The COVID-19 layoffs were large, painful, and poorly communicated. After weeks of leadership saying that “we have the cash” and that we’d be able to weather this storm on sheer firm economics, hundreds of employees were RIFfed into a bad job market. Many high-level directors had no say in who was RIFfed, and the decisions around which teams had cuts (and by how much) seemed political. This created a culture nosedive that the company still hasn’t recovered from.

-  Engineering felt constantly under-resourced and understaffed. During my time there, it felt like I had to build out technologies and products that would need 4x the people to build at any other company. This led to a big culture of burnout, and that burnout culture was amplified after the COVID-19 layoffs.

- It felt like there was a lot of institutionalized sexism at the company. The company hired a few VPs that would degrade and belittle the women around them. This created a culture that felt hostile towards women."

108,CarGurus,A tech company in disguise,2020-11-02,2.0,Software Developer,Benefits and pre covid office environment were fine. Has the facade of caring about the employees.,"Clearly this will not be a flattering review and will be buried in the tide of astroturfed 5 star reviews gushing that everything is great.

CarGurus advertises itself as a tech company but it is a tech company in the same way WeWork is a tech company. It just so happens to have more people and a more recently developed website compared to its competitors and rides on the coat tails of Facebook and Google to resell advertising services to car dealers. Nothing it does is new or innovative and its ""technology"" is a monolithic mess that no one knows how it works and no one with the authority to spend the time to fix will want to do. You are tasked with fixing a near decade of technical debt but you have to do it the way your managers want else you are just harassed and bullied until you leave or they finally weaponize HR to just fire you.

You will see the salary, the benefits etc... and be lured in but keep in mind that it is unlikely to move up and you will have to move on in a few years to keep your career going. There is no career growth and the usual review processes are setup for everyone to fail so they have an excuse to not give you a pay raise.

Management is a mix of internal promotion of people who were there the longest and are drowning trying to do a job they have little experience in and no support or external hires who are the ones in the inadequate hiring process wore the best suit and made the white, middle aged, male managers at the top of the org chart feel the most comfortable. If your boss is the former then you and your team will flail around without direction and be blamed for not meeting unclear, unrealistic and unfair expectations. If your boss is the latter then you will either do what they say regardless of if it is the right thing to do or as previously stated be made to feel so uncomfortable you leave or your manager using HR to come up with some reason to get rid of you, mainly so they can hire in their friends from their previous company.

COVID-19 caused the offices to be closed and people to work remotely which is something senior management railed against constantly when asked and in communications since have been trying to get support for opening the offices as soon as possible so they can go back to having their staff under their thumb in the office once again. Of course the no one works from home rule is for some and not others as plenty of people had unwritten agreements with their bosses about being able to work remotely and quite frankly the resistance to not wanting to do so is just an attempt from poor management to control their staff because they don't trust they will work unless they can be surveyed from a corner office.

The CEO is absentee and just wants to run a forever startup and has lost interest going as far to moving all the new product work to a subsidiary and moving all the people he liked into it so they can play in the sandbox forever and ignore a directionless company whose stock is around a third of what it was at its peak. Langley if you are not interested in running CarGurus then sell your stake and go start something else. Clearly you are happier in that initial flurry of activity with a start up.

The rest of the executive board are yes men at best and negative contributors at worse with the board room being a game of musical chairs to who is going to get the blame for the latest mess.

This is getting long so I will just summarize:

Not a tech company, a marketing and advertising services company
The technology that does exist is a shambles
Senior management are absentee or underqualified
Middle management are every stereo type of petty to underqualified
HR is Catbert but with better PR people to write their nasty grams
You will never get a pay raise
Everything is your fault unless you are friends with senior management then no matter what mess you make it is never your fault"

Most of the people who know how it works or if it works have moved on, so you’re on your own when refactoring or deleting “dead” code that should have been gone a long time ago.

119,CarGurus,Best Place I've ever worked,2020-08-25,5.0,Recruiter,"After reading some of the reviews, I feel compelled to give my honest opinion on the company and my time at CG. I've worked for many companies from Wegmans to Wayfair, to AT&T and by far, this is the best sizeable medium-sized company to work at. At least on my team and throughout HR, people are treated with respect and as family. As a new employee, I was able to book time on a C level executive and have a 1:1 within my first couple of weeks. My team also supported me in my effort to fundraise money for a local food bank where we were able to donate close to $3,600 as a team. Yea, there are everyday things like free food, commuter benefits, and other things. However, after working for Wayfair, which was a nightmare, I realized that culture and pay are better here. You are free to speak your mind, and the company is trying to make a difference in terms of social justice and diversity. I haven't seen any of the negative things mentioned in other people's reviews. We are working from home during COVID until at least January, and the company gave us a random one-time bonus($300) to be able to buy things.",There needs to be more of an effort to higher diversity at senior leadership but this common in most tech companies. I really don't think COVID or sales compensation is a reflection of the management. If anything we are all working in a very strange time and trying to make the best of the situation!

People in sales are lucky if they’re making a third of their OTE monthly commission and probably one tenth or less of what they’re used to making.  

Not only is the pay horrible during covid but they were able to find 100k to donate to social justice while their own reps are scraping, thanks guys.  And get ready to be lectured beyond belief about your political views, every day there’s another book club or seminar about white fragility.

125,CarGurus,a place to go if you want to stunt your career,2020-07-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,an abundance of free stuff.,"CarGurus from the outside looks like the ideal tech company to work for but once you get in there it is the total opposite. They love to fire people and then lie to their fellow employees on what happened to them. They love to promise promotions and then keep coming up with ways to stall them or prolong the date. They hate growing people’s careers. During my time I saw many people from all different departments leave because of the lack of career growth. You will often find that they protect managers who discriminate against their employees and find reasons on why that was socially acceptable. They claim to be diverse but when you enter most teams your lucky to find any minorities. During my two years I had witnessed coworkers be discriminated for their sexual orientation, race and disabilities. CarGurus tries to pride itself on being forward thinking by posting all sorts of campaigns for how they are tackling social injustice, but they are the problem. The team they created to deal with the lack of diversity was comprised of only white people.
 CarGurus also does not value its employees they want you to work yourself to your grave. They have been known to fire great talent because they had health issues or couldn’t perform due to legitimate reasons. My own manager had been fired for being on medical leave and they didn’t want to deal with it. My advice to any LGBTQ or minorities steer clear of this place we have enough problems you don’t need it at your job."

Unfortunately, their candidate experience is exhausting, with no respect at r consideration of the time & work invested by the candidates. Also, I’ve noticed that is you are a person of color, it will be harder to get an opportunity unless they fall into tokenism.

There are all sorts of exciting projects to work on and opportunities to learn while the company continues to grow and innovate. My team and leadership have been great about making sure good work is credited and recognizing everyone’s contributions. 

Additionally, I feel safe and supported during the pandemic - knowing that our company was able to pivot from minimal WFH to full time WFH when safety was in question makes me confident that our leadership puts people first.","Changing priorities and timelines from both an executive and cross functional level make planning difficult. Once leadership decides something is a priority, there is huge pressure to get the work done as fast as possible (not necessarily the best work possible). When something isn’t a leadership priority, it gets pushed off to the point of being difficult to address."
130,CarGurus,"A Place to Survive, not Thrive",2020-07-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- People: For the most part, folks are intelligent, willing to help, and are great to work with

- Openness to change: Culture has gone a long way in the past two years, from the emergence of employee resource groups (ERG)s to the expansion of certain benefits such as WFH

- General benefits: Free lunch deserves its own callout, transportation (T-pass or commuter rail), compensation includes equity and bonus, standard tech company fare (drinks, snacks, games, etc.)","- As you might have read in the other reviews, there is a layer of politicking that happens throughout. Some hires or promotions are the results of favoritism in spite of very problematic qualities. While it's hearsay that nepotism exists, exec leadership has not been upfront in acknowledging it authentically and implementing processes to prevent (very public) hiring messes in the future. Sunlight is the best disinfectant - acknowledging that this is an issue (at least on the surface) is the first step to start solving it.

- Lack of psychological safety: transparency is lauded as a core value, but I've seen multiple instances of critical feedback loop back to hurt the employee. As a result, it becomes disadvantageous to your career to speak up against mainstream ideas or hold onto an unpopular opinion. CarGurus is a big company, and I'm sure there are managers who have been able to create this environment for their teams, but I've seen enough examples (especially in engineering) to notice a trend. For this reason alone, I've discouraged developers in my network from applying.

- Resistance to (large) change: it might be strange given the pro I listed above, but CarGurus likes to make incremental change even in areas when significant change is needed. The most salient example is the ""closing the book"" of going from 1 to 2 days WFH a month. Not only is leadership ignoring the needs of employees, but they're also causing CarGurus to lag behind peer tech companies. In practice, many managers ignore this anyway because it doesn't make sense. It makes one wonder if there's some weird incentive to dealerships to encourage more driving. 

- Poor retention plans: for a company that likes to boast about its compensation, it's baffling that the retention bonuses are so low. Expect inflation-level (or heaven-forbid, 4%) ""raises"" for great performance with minimal-to-none stock refreshes. I'm not surprised that developer retention is so poor."
131,CarGurus,Best Place I've Ever Worked,2020-07-13,5.0,Team Lead,"I've worked for CarGurus for two years and have only good things to say about the experience. Not only does the company genuinely care about it's employees (evident through summer outings, happy hours, perks, compensation, more), but my colleagues are some of the most conscientious people I've ever worked with.

I changed roles after 1 year with CarGurus and the process was pretty easy, and I felt supported by everyone involved. I've had opportunities to mentor colleagues as well as be mentored by many.","Not many bad things to say. I fear that the CarGurus culture took a hit when we had to reduce our force because of Coronavirus. Also, it's hard to feel the same connection to colleagues when we're all remote, but this isn't necessarily a criticism of CG, just the world in which we currently live."

The innovation is driven by a solid analysis of numbers and data to ensure that it's not innovation for the sake of innovating. The company recognizes that creating something new brings with it a risk of failure, learn from that an move on. There are practically no barriers between teams and this is refreshing. Unlimited Personal Time Off is great for those that are care takers or for that visit to the bank/office that has to be done between 10 - 4.","Work from home policy was not great, but I fully expect this to change seeing how successful we have been in the COVID-19 enforced office closure."

The compensation is great. If it's pay, commission, snacks, lunches and dinners when you are overworked at the end of every month. Compensation does not equal happiness.

Peers:
Everyone is in the same boat, so people can get along and be friendly. Teams don't spend quality outside of hours time together.

The click:
If you are luckily chosen or you have managed to get on the good side of management, the rules then change for you and you are at an advantage.","Career Opportunities:
There is no clear career path within CarGurus. You are told to ""keep doing what you are doing"" and ""be patient"" and opportunities will ""come up"". The rules change based on employee too, all related to ""The click"" above in pros. You need to be a politician and push the rules to go anywhere.

Mentorship:
It doesn't exist. The mentorship process is about ticking the box, nothing more. Peers look after each other but mentor plans are not solid.

Micromanagement:
Don't believe interviews and responses on these reviews. Micromanagement is what runs the place. Revenue, calls, time on phone, opps created, stage changes, proposals, demos, meetings, deal reviews, call shadowing, time you leave the office and more. You are constantly worried about missing a certain metric, rather than being good at what you do.

Work/Life balance:
If you are single, money is the most important, work late, prospect in the middle of the night or early morning to have an advantage, say things you don’t want to say, do things you don’t want to do, not take breaks, eat your lunch at your desk and put on a happy face, CarGurus is for you. It's either your life outside of work is working or you bring work home with you. 

Culture and Values:
It's all about revenue and KPI's. Everything revolves around it. The values are not shown and it's not focused on people and helping others. People are toxic and are in fear of not making quota on the micromanagement processes above. It should be shaped around helping dealers but it's not.

Loyalty:
It’s a flavour of the month type of place. No matter what success you bring, it is always forgotten. If you have sacrificed time outside of work to work, took a chance on a role they said would be the next big thing, not take holidays to hit those numbers, worked late every day and more - it’s all forgotten when it’s a new month and there is no loyalty to those who have given the most and are not in with “the click”. 

Glassdoor Reviews:
Don't believe all the ""no cons"" reviews. After the company receives negative reviews, certain people in each team (who have been looked after - ""The click"") are asked to write a review on Glassdoor. There was even a day in the office while we were working, that certain people were asked to write reviews - In December 2019, after genuine reviews were left in November.

CEO: 
The CEO has never visited EMEA offices. Regardless of the size of revenue, the face of the company has never spent time with his employees. If you are lucky enough, you might get a minute or two at the presidents club - good luck."

- The senior Leadership team is very sound.
- Exposure to global projects and senior management.
- Start-up vibe and teamwork.
- Communication through the organisation.
- Autonomy to do your job.
- They fly the whole Dublin team to Boston for the Christmas party! Also for your onboarding.
- Macs and 4k monitors are the standard.","- Very limited opportunity for career growth. You can grow only into management roles and there are not many. All the operations are run from the US. If you just want to sell and get paid, the money is good!
- No compensation for working overtime.
- Inflexible working hours.
- Working from home is really restricted and under very strict and specific circumstances. It's pretty much just like not having it.
- Crazy amount of admin work. Management wants to measure everything even if it doesn't bring value to the customers.
- Automotive is not from everybody and you won't be handling hi-tech SaaS solutions.
- They have quite a bit a of tech debt and improvements can take ages."
137,CarGurus,"Overall great place to work, but not somewhere you make a lifetime career.",2020-06-03,4.0,Digital Marketing Consultant,"Great health and commuter benefits and perks, fun young culture, flexible hours. They understand you are a human with an outside life and outside needs, and depending on the management you're under they let you do what you need to do, as long as you get the job done well. Stay long enough and you will make true lifelong friends that will ACTUALLY last and keep in touch once you leave.","Don't work here if you're looking for a high growth opportunity. There are rules in place so that you can't be promoted, or even move departments, if you've been in your position for less than a year, so upward mobility is extremely slow. Also, the company has grown too much to be able to keep up with the honest and open ""transparent"" culture anymore, despite it being a core value. 

Work from home (before COVID) is only allowed 2 times per month (recently upgraded from 1 day per month), and upper management has somehow fooled themselves to thinking this is average for the tech industry. 

In the last year or so things have become noticeably more corporate and political than they used to be, from my own and experience and from speaking to (former) colleagues who have been there 4-5+ years. There are a ton of hoops to jump through and roadblocks in order to get a raise or promotion."

The work was good and my colleagues were some of the best I've had the pleasure of working with.  Lastly, the view at 55CP can't be beat when on the Charles-facing side (if at that location)!","The one con I would have to mention would be management training.  Even though the pieces were there, there are still some missing steps in terms of actually training managers to really be empathetic towards their reports.

159,CarGurus,No more mojo,2020-02-11,3.0,Sales Account Manager,"Excellent benefits and daily lunch. However, those are needed to counterbalance the crap you'll experience if you're going to talk to dealers.

Good people work here. You will not be disappointed with your colleagues. 

CarGurus does give back with charity and community.  They're continually improving the benefits as well and that is appreciated amongst everyone.","Don't get me wrong, this used to be THE place to work, and I had a blast during the rise of it all with an excellent culture, awesome colleagues, and a product that truly differentiated itself amongst the competition. Those were the good days. Now? No innovation, no new products that add value or even work, and full of distrust from clients due to multiple 50-100%+ renewals year after year with declining performance. They're moving away from large mass renewals, but the damage has been done. 

Leadership has its own club as mentioned in later reviews. Promotions within? Sure, but they know who they want before the interview starts and it doesn't mean they're qualified. From there they will then continue to get promoted year after year. Very few managers coach up, and it's a lot of just telling you to hit the phones and sell because of the inexperience. VPs of your department walk past you in the hall without any acknowledgment making you feel unwelcome and uncomfortable while the COO walks the floor, says hi to everyone, knows more about you than your direct manager, and says thank you with sincerity.

In the end,  I recommend not wasting your talents or let yourself wither away talking to car dealers that are already pissed before you walk in the door. Positive reviews for CarGurus are from those not talking to dealers, so it's better with roles that aren't customer-facing or sales driven. 

To my colleagues and friends still there: The grass is greener, and morale is higher elsewhere without the dark cloud you feel day in and day out. 
To HR reading this: Your surveys have shown all of the above as you've told us. The exodus of talent has given the same feedback in their exit interviews, and your response of ""We're hearing similar messages"" hasn't prompted a change in a ""We move fast"" fashion"

They do 401K match, and you get a yearly bonus. You are awarded stock (RSU's), and the amount can vary based on how much you earn at the time of hire.","At my time of hire, diversity numbers were rather low. There were, and still are, very low numbers in regard to women, people of color, as well as women of color. That can be extremely discouraging to someone who is interested in establishing a career at CarGurus. There is a high degree of nepotism, and opportunities for advancement are limited, unless you're interested in sales, then take your pick. 

If you're not interested in high school drama, condescending personalities or self-serving managers, I'd suggest you run. By all means, avoid Customer Success, Co-Op and those who manage them."

The benefits are unbeaten - best quality healthcare/dental insurance, bike to work schemes, commuter benefits, gym memberships, Holidays,  and best of all- free lunch everyday...

Management- Easily accessible and appreciative of hard work. All managers sit on the floor with the sales team and are always there to lend a helping hand.","Truthfully, no cons stand out for me.

Product tests have been run in a really poor way and there is NO INNOVATION in Europe about what they do. In 2020 it's hard to think a public company doesn't have tools to compete in different markets (ex. Apps IoS or Android, labels for specific car research,etc). For this reason is incredibly difficult to manage customers, achieve targets requested without be competitive on the markets above all if we add the poor management to deal with these situations.

Another important point regards people don't take in consideration suggestions given by teams and employees.

- Things actually get done. Unlike other tech companies I worked for, things actually get done here. Without stress nor crazy working hours. I attribute it to the fact that engineers are experienced and the managers get to the position based on being good managers, with common sense and social skills, rather than legendary coders who many times can't manage more than themselves.","- Branding: The recruiting process is very picky, which is a good thing, but lack of branding results in getting candidates that rarely pass the job interviews. I feel that we spend much more time than needed in trying to hire new talent.
- Not all teams have the same kind of dedication and proficiency. Most teams are a pleasure to work with. There are very few teams that lack the talent,  will, or both. Still, these teams can create a very frustrating bottleneck for the rest, when working on a joint project."

There are probably many factors at play, but I really think the root of it all starts from hypocrisy. The company, and by extension my dealer-facing team, preaches certain “core values”. At the same time however, our job involved either breaking these values on a daily basis, or experiencing these values not being put
into action by CarGurus itself.

Two of these “Core Values” are Transparency and Integrity. Let’s talk about those.

Internally - I’m still not sure how the commission plans totally work. The language can change on a monthly or quarterly basis. We also moved away from using a professional compensation planning program, to receiving our data through an Excel sheet or Google Doc. I would expect this at a small startup, not a $4 billion public company. The commission data is often not released to us until we are several days away from the actual pay date.  We also need to crawl our book of business revenue each month, to make sure we are being commissioned correctly. 

Enhancements or product tests have been run without informing the dealer-facing job functions, leading to poor customer service situations when we don’t have the correct answers or the latest information.

Externally - we have run a renewal model over the last several years that relies on raising dealership subscription rates so they are more in line with “market rates.” The tough part here is that we have no clear guidance into what the “market rate” should be and why. We might use one metric as a pricing threshold in certain instances internally, but then are encouraged not to use this metric when speaking with clients.

There is also no consistency with pricing across the internal teams. Reps. discounting leeway changes daily, depending on their (and the team’s) monthly revenue needs. This leads to frustration on the customer’s end, as they are told different reasons each year as to why their rate is changing. Reps. are also forced to juggle a comp. plan that is split between attaining maximum incremental revenue, while limiting churn. Adding to the complexity- it is CarGurus, not the rep., who determines which subscriptions will be renewed, essentially forcing churn if the rep. is unable to renew them. They will inevitably be brought back on as “new business” several months later.. and the cycle continues.

Ultimately, I had no problem raising subscription rates, or dealing with irate customers, but I wanted to know there is justification in doing so. Really- give me any reason that makes sense. Maybe that’s where this all started. When CarGurus finally did reach those “market rates” for most customers. Instead of a plan for what was next, we decided to just keep squeezing. Each rep. is feeling less and less runway for themselves. For a Sales team, this is not an ideal situation, and stems from mismanagement at the upper level."

Technically unlimited PTO but they track it to make you feel guilty about taking it.","In retrospect, there were a ton of red flags in the hiring process.

First, the interviewers were completely disorganized. I don't think any of them had actually looked at my resume, and they certainly didn't coordinate at all. Two of them asked me basically the same question, and one was literally the same question that I had done in the phone screen.

Once you're hired, basically you go into a queue and when you start you're put on whatever team has ""dibs"" on the next people. There's no attempt to match people to their skills or interests. I got on a team that I had no experience for, and they were unwilling to accept a ramp up time, so I was in trouble from day 1 for not being able to contribute fast enough. I tried to get switched to another team and there was no way to do that.

If you're on a backend team, you're expected to be available 24/7. The site breaks all the time, so you're literally always working. No mercy if you have any kind of social life outside of work."

Since the first day of contact, my experience with CarGurus has been amazing. The interview process was well facilitated and the recruiter I was in touch with gave me a good background on the company and the role. The training for new hires went very well and it was obvious that this company is headed on a rocketship trajectory.  Some of the brightest minds I have encountered has been at my time here. Besides the excellent work, team members, location, and offices they provide an extremely competitive benefits package. 

I recommend those that are looking for a fun and challenging career with a company that is dominating its field to work for CarGurus.",No cons that come to mind.

We have free lunch, equity in the company, free T pass to work, cold brew tea, coffee and beer on tap, game rooms, awesome swag and more. Seriously, the perks are great but the reason why you should apply is the people. You will be welcomed in as a Guru the first day you start and you will never look back. It's a fun work environment where your peers will become your friends. You will learn something new every day and will be in awe of the people you work with.

196,CarGurus,A place I am glad to be at,2019-01-12,5.0,Engineer Manager,"I feel that the mission, culture,  ability to support my quality of life and desire to get things done are all areas that CarGurus meets beyond expectations. One area where perhaps being jaded by prior experiences I was not expecting to be so happy about was the general quality of the people I interact with every day. 

We all arrive to work everyday burdened with the worries and frustrations that sometimes affect our lives, but in the short time I have been there the quality of my interactions with all my colleagues has been amazing. I work with talented, intelligent, polite, collaborative and positive people. My interactions have never had a tone of negativity or conflict. Any organization has areas where pressure to deliver and perform cause emotional load, but people seem open to taking opinion, and offering different and sometimes opposing views in a honest and objective way. I always feel I can voice an opinion, and enjoy that same activity from my peers. 

In my role within the Engineering organization I have access to modern tools and am constantly asked for ways to learn and leverage more of them, which is something that was important to me in a new position. 

The current state of CarGurus is past crazy startup and well before overly played out, overly middle management ridden destroyer of hope organization.  I look forward to coming into work.","CarGurus is pretty open about their expectations that “we feel people do their best work in the office”. Coming from a environment with a really relaxed office presence policy I was fearful this would be difficult. The fact that there is no limit on reasonable personal or sick time covers the worries about making appointments or taking care of things that come up helps.  You are expected to log this time, but it does not count against accrued PTO. I thought this would be more of a “Con” than so far I have found it to be. Three weeks of vacation felt low, but that is non inclusive of 11 holidays. 

Being in Cambridge the commute can be a bit of a nuisance, but it’s location also means there are more options to commute, and in addition to the normal public transport subsidies CarGurus will alternatively cover a large majority of parking. The parking is in the Cambridgeside Galleria which for me turns out to be a pro when I need to pick up something needed on my way home. 

I thought the daily free catered lunch was a going to be a bit of a gimmick along with the free snacks, fruit, yogurt, kegs, cold brew, video game area, but not having the daily worry about what to do for lunch is actually nice, and I end up with more money in my wallet at the end of the week. If I want a change there are tons of other options within throwing distance anyways."

205,CarGurus,Great Place to Work,2018-09-13,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Top-of-market pay. Good benefits. Free parking is a nice touch

- Free lunch is very cushy

- Good snacks with healthy options

- Automotive market is extremely lucrative and company is positioned for high potential

- While it's not a company where you could sit down with anyone and start a conversation, folks are nice and happy to be here

- Although the team doesn't always do things the right way, the team is fairly senior and doesn't need too much convincing if you know a better way to do things

- My manager/lead is very on-top of things and understanding of tradeoffs

- Minimal micromanagement

- Tolerable amounts of tech debt. While I'm running into lots of ""we really shouldn't be doing it like this"" moments in general the team is on-board with changes and no single problem is so bad that it is unsolvable

- Work-life balance is great. I have been able to leave my laptop at work most days (have brought it home when I had some late risky deploys going out that I wanted to be able to follow-up on)

- Really solid place for top performers. Lots of opportunities for growth and making an impact. Low-pressure, high-reward environment is really refreshing and the company works hard to help you focus on what matters most","- Work isn't terribly exciting but could be in a few years. Lots of helping the company dig itself out of holes. I was a bit surprised to find that the scale of our problems was significantly lower than other smaller companies I've worked for

- E-mail is a total joke in Engineering. Spammed to death by bots to the point where all of my info needs to come through Slack or in-person. Office 365 for everything is also a real pain

- On-boarding was a bit chaotic

- I'm a little tipped from training, but the company culture and values statements are pretty weak and generic. The company allegedly came up with them only a few years ago and is trying to force them into the day-to-day for the sake of it. In my frank opinion - the company is just a good working culture; producing results and getting things done but keeping a steady pace and taking care of its employees along the way

- Coming from startups I was pretty frustrated by how much was gated off that I had to figure out how to get access to, but things are good now

- Technical skill level and care is a few steps lower than what I'm used to. As someone who is highly experienced with the tooling we're using this isn't a problem for me but this may be a poor place to learn how to do things the right way. On the other hand, it's a good place to execute and get the company to doing things the right way. Playing the role of technical babysitter gets old though

- Haven't seen any high-level plans of what we're doing and why. Again, maybe there's town halls and all that being planned, but cross-company communication is very poor

- Not a huge con, but I wish there were more social groups

- I'd like to see more diversity amongst the team"

Culture includes a supervisor who sneaks up to surprise people and a women screamed at work as she was frightened.   Another example of toxicity, supervisor intrudes on people's personal lives when it's none of the company's business and overstepped lines of respect.

Company helps used car salespeople sell new cars so the work isn't satisfying at all so that combined with the poor culture.

Culture is full of under qualified personal referrals who make the culture tough to work in as there are many different levels of competency and let others steal cases to pad their inaccurate stats.

While a lot is constantly changing and there are moving pieces as you would expect of a fast-growth company, we are open about what's going on, what the challenges might be, and what our successes are. There's a lot of opportunity for growth both within your role (annual reviews allow for annual progression) along with within the company if you are able to show you are a top performer in your current role. When people state that ""there aren't opportunities for growth"" that is generally people waiting for something to be handed to them, which isn't going to happen. But through hard work and an ability to work closely with your manager/coach, promotion and internal moves are definitely possible. 

There are also a vast number of thought leaders at the company who are open and willing to teach and mentor. The number of years in the tech industry in a variety of roles contained under this one roof is unparalleled and allows for great professional development.

It used to be a lot better back in 2016 early 2017 but after a revolving door of managment and new leaders in sales the whole atmosphere completely changed for the worst.","Managment is absolutely awful! Not saying every manager is terrible but majority are immature and not qualified to lead teams. They are promoted within due to a lack of options which creates inexperience account executives leading teams of mostly inexperienced sales reps. 

Expect to be micromanaged each and everyday with meetings after meetings filled with non sense and filler so the managers can prove they provide value when in reality they do not. Also expect to be asked if you even want to work at CarGurus even though people work long hours and stay late constantly. Also make sure you pick up that phone all day or you will hear “do you know how much money you make? Earn your paycheck”. 

Moral across the sales floor was always so low and everyone always looked miserable. Another issue is that CG signed up basically ever car dealer so there is a serious lack of prospects to sign but upper managment would tell you differently. If you are looking at positions that do not revolve a quota or sales then CarGurus is great but if you are thinking of applying to a sales role I would think twice."

 (Another shout out to Sam Zales knowing everyone's names....this means a hell of a lot to everyone!)","It's great that CarGurus boosts their employees internally, but because of this, lower management is not up-to-par in terms of training and experience. While formal leadership training is great, my suggestion is to make sure that mid-level managers are fully prepared to be coaches to the lower-level managers that they oversee. If a manager doesn't feel like they themselves have a readily-present and involved supervisor, no amount of formal training is going to teach them what they need to know.

Life is probably great in engineering, marketing and HR. They probably enjoy autonomy, valued work and a lack of micro-management. Not so much in sales/dealer relations.","This was both my favorite job ever, and my worst. Years ago, this was the best sales job in Boston but with new mgmt came new priorities. Morale plummeted within a year like I've never seen before. Micro-mgmt to an insane degree, placing ALL the blame on sales and not the decision making of senior leadership, changing goals/metrics on a dime (based on whatever the flavor of the month was), and just an overall decline in enjoying being part of something we all helped grow. Yeah, there was food and games..but those became taboo and you typically ate at your desk and avoided the gameroom.

Promotions here are 100% ALL optics /favoritism and nothing more.  Work a Saturday, lots of reply-all emails, be vocal to the right people...BOOM, promotion! 

Most importantly, avoid the various sales departments at all costs. You've never met a group of people more miserable then those on sales. Again, it used to be the greatest sales job in Boston but it only took about 12 months to make it a miserable place to be. Constant fear of losing your job; sneak attack firings, mgmt out for themselves and does not have your back; zero culpability from mgmt for anything.

The popular move became Dealer Relations since the US market is fully sold at this point (though they will never admit it). On this team your responsible for existing account upsells into a dead banner-ad market and renewals that reach 120% in increased price...seriously. Imagine having that conversation every day of your working life. But that team is 100 people now and there is nothing to cross-sell at all. The good news here is you don't actually fear for your job on this team (hence the move for sales here). 

And now CG is about to go public so it's even further downhill from here. Keep looking, Boston is a thriving market and there are tons of great jobs out there from companies that offer good pay and autonomy."

If you want a job that is the same everyday, doesn't challenge you or create growth opportunities, then look elsewhere.  If you want to work with highly intelligent people, tackle complex problems and create great solutions, then I would apply to CarGurus."
229,CarGurus,Masters Of Misdirect,2017-06-12,1.0,Sales,"Coworkers, free food, parking, happy hours,","Pay plan changes that reflect metrics and not actual sales skills/ numbers, no clear vision for the future and they more and more are becoming just like the competitors they said they would never be like."
230,CarGurus,Closed door management and shady practices,2017-06-07,1.0,Dealer Account Executive,Free lunches and great peers,Used to be a great place to work but new management operates behind closed doors and constantly changes direction in a way that benefits revenue over employees. Quick to remove people from teams and the company without warning. I would have been happy to recommend people to this company for the longest time but now I would steer someone elsewhere.
231,CarGurus,Great company to be part of!,2017-04-23,5.0,Dealer Account Executive,"Every day, I don't loath about going in to work, I look forward to going in. That's simply down to all the people who work in the company. Everyone is there for the same purpose - grow your own career, feel challenged and have fun while doing it. 

A lot is provided - great package: pay, insurance, dental, stock, freebies, tuition fees funding, gym, holidays, lunch, snacks, happy hours, team nights, travel, pension and a great environment.","With all that, still being relatively a start up company in the U.K., it can feel that there is a lack of stability and empowerment of the product we offer. 

As the States is obviously the main focus, communication & engineering focus on the U.K. can be stagnant at times, but he other side is that we don't actually see what is being worked on and what progress has been made. That is why communication needs to be a focus and they are improving on this.

Frustration can also come into play and that is because the company is number 1 in the States and we hear how great the product is and how big we are, but we are no where near that in the U.K. as there is work to be done on the product and we are not the biggest by a long shot."
232,CarGurus,Playing favorites.,2017-03-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Free lunch and office,"I thought this company was really promising when I first started, but the more time that went on the more dysfunctional it became and the more the lack of communication became a serious issue. They play favorites and promote the people who they like over people who are qualified for the job. Senior management is the worst I have ever experienced."
233,CarGurus,"An amazing Company, based in Trust and Transparency",2017-03-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I havent worked in a company that is so clear and that take so much care for their employees, and believe me I have worked in some pretty awesome companies, but CarGurus in particular is a company that always seek the employee well being, from having healhy lunches and snacks, to gym, family orientated and other great benefits. Not only the benefits make the company also the approach to work with our Dealers, Shoppers and employees internally. It is all about Trust and Transparency. This is extremely important and valuable because you know were you are standing and deliver that message to everyone that interacts with us.

I am very fortunate to have found CarGurus and make an impact everyday. With ups and downs like in any company or any given day, CarGurus is a fantastic place to work for. 

Our International expansion is a great opportunity for anyone that is interested in working towards something big! Big Challenges with Big Opportunities make this journey an incredible ride.","I dont see any cons that I cant think about CarGurus. I love the passion of every team and every individual, it is contagious and very special.

I must say that the Car Industry can be challenging because of the nature of the market, but it is a good challenge to have as we are here to change that and deliver transparency when it comes to make the second most important and valuable decision in our lifetime. Buying your car!"
234,CarGurus,Chaotic start up.,2017-03-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits, perks, office and people","Upper management is so unorganized that little tasks become chaos. The pay is okay, but not for the stress day in and day out. I had high hopes working here, but honestly it's just another unorganized start up with big ideas and no way to put them into action."
235,CarGurus,Sales,2017-03-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are free lunches everyday.  People on the floor are nice.  Beer on Tap.  Free Snacks.,People aren't what they seem. Management plays favorites are deceptive.  Becoming corporate and process just for process.  Few opportunities.  Limited leads.  No new products that work.
236,CarGurus,Still Great Place to work but overhiring,2017-01-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great Culture. Great Product. Free Lunch.,The Sales strategies are coming into question.
237,CarGurus,CarGurus,2016-11-18,5.0,Dealer Account Specialist,Amazing culture and benefits with a laid back management approach. Continuous career development and great to be a part of a company bringing transparency to a notoriously shady industry.,In a transition period for the structure of the organization but doing a great job of being transparent with employees.
238,CarGurus,Excited and Proud to Come to Work Every Day,2016-11-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexibility, autonomy, growth opportunity, work life balance, paid transportation, gym membership, free catered lunch every day, amazing company culture aka I work with THE BEST group of people and I genuinely look forward to working alongside them each and every day.","Only downside I can think of is that I didn't hear of the company sooner, would have made the move in a heartbeat."
239,CarGurus,Sales Development Representative,2016-11-06,5.0,,"Culture and perks are the best. Office is beautiful, right on the Charles. Ping Pong, Shuffleboard, foozeball, beer on tap, FREE(delicious) catered lunch, company outings, Not to mention the company is skyrocketing, with lots of opportunity for advancement. Getting in before they go public would be key.Honestly can't recommend enough.","They don't match 401k, but sounds like they're considering it. That's really it."
240,CarGurus,Great Start Up Company,2016-11-03,5.0,Dealer Account Executive,"CarGurus is actually my 2nd successful pre-IPO start up that i joined. Having experience in going through the different stages of IPO in my previous company that set a very high standard (great people, culture, travel, perks etc) i was curious to see what CarGurus can offer. 

CarGurus really impressed me from the start with their own unique culture and great people that are working towards one goal! This is a true start up where you're hustling everyday and trusted to do your job. The office is located in the prime area of Dublin with impressive views. The perks are really sound as well. 

I personally believe that CarGurus will have an outstanding IPO and i am looking forward to this journey ahead.",none that i can think of
241,CarGurus,"Great Company, with Great People Focused on One Goal!!",2016-11-02,5.0,Dealer Account Executive (UK),"The Company's culture and approach to business is fun, but at the same time majorly focused on results and Growth. All team members are focused on the same goal and everyone is willing to help each other out so we can achieve the same goal. I am personally really encouraged by the chances to progress internally, with so many changes and advances in the coming months, I am looking to best apply myself so I am eligible to put my hand up when the time is right.","At the early stages there is a bit of a disconnect between the office in Dublin to USA HQ, i.e resolutions of issues or amendments to our service relies on US team devoting time and this is tough as the US office is so busy, and time differences doesn't help. But this is just a minor issue that really hasn't effected our day to day running of our UK office."

252,CarGurus,Best Work Experience of my Career,2016-05-27,5.0,Dealer Relations,"I absolutely love coming to work. The benefits and culture are fantastic, but the work itself is also very empowering. I am able to attack my job in a way that makes sense for me, and am rewarded for delivering results to the business. 

My department's management team is fantastic - very transparent, a great balance between demanding results and creating a fun work environment, and everyone on my team feels valued and knows their voice is heard. My career path has been discussed at length with the department head, and I know how I can move up and what I need to do to make that happen.","Very little on the negative side, only suggestion would be the Executive team to be a little more visible to everyone else in the business."
253,CarGurus,Dealer Relations Account Manager,2016-05-20,5.0,Dealer Relations Account Manager,"Great work environment all around. Fast growing company with tons of upward mobility. Sales can be very lucrative. Free lunch 5x per week, stock options, game room, beer on tap.","Pay plan changes quite a bit. The company is growing so fast that they typically operate out of multiple buildings, which makes direct communication difficult."
254,CarGurus,Quite possibly the best employer in Boston,2016-04-03,5.0,Massachusetts,"It's the best place I've ever worked and I've had several jobs at tech companies post college. Amazing benefits, catered lunch everyday, gym membership, they pay for my T pass, beer on tap everyday, tons of snacks, really great culture overall.","The company is growing insanely fast, which is great, but it is constantly changing and you need to be ready to switch your desk once every few months or so. Not the worst thing in the world by any means."

The product/platform is fantastic. 

Company is ambitious with international goals. 

Nice office space.","Needs to bring new products to market faster and more efficiently. Understaffed engineering team slows product development, which hurts other departments.

Could greatly improve interdepartmental communication.

Culture has been declining for the past year year. Workloads are steadily increasing for many departments and a lot of the fun stuff gets pushed to the side."
257,CarGurus,Great place to work!,2016-03-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"Very tight, team oriented environment with extremely low turnover.  Team members are motivated, highly skilled and collaborative by nature.  Having such co-workers makes it easy to contribute and pickup new skills.","Benefits are great in general, but company match on 401k would be a welcomed addition.  In it's current state, the code base can be daunting to some engineers, but that's changing with time."
258,CarGurus,The Right Priorities,2015-08-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Our CEO Langley has always said that growing a company is a marathon, not a sprint.  At a lot of companies that is just a line, but having been at CarGurus for a long time that has proven to really be the culture.  Engineers do work hard, but the emphasis is getting the job done, not on keeping certain hours or trying to meet arbitrary deadlines.  I think this works at CarGurus because my peers are smart and experienced, but not arrogant about it.  I can trust that everyone is going to do their job and not be shy about asking or giving help.  As we continue to scale and expand internationally there are also plenty of interesting problems left to solve.","CarGurus is extremely light on management and meetings.  Generally, I like that as I'm not a fan of meetings for meetings sake, but sometimes this also translates into a lack of communication about the bigger picture direction of the company.  Now that we are settled in our new space, I understand there are plans to have short catch up sessions over catered lunch a couple times a month, so I'm hopeful this will help with this."
259,CarGurus,Dealer Account Specialist,2015-07-24,5.0,Dealer Account Specialist,Great perks! The environment is super fun and upbeat. You have a great time working for them and they definitely make you feel appreciated. I would suggest this company to my friends for sure.,I had an issue with time management. I felt as though I was required to put way more time into the job than I had originally thought. During the slow periods (the winter) it's very tough to hit numbers. They were becoming extremely metrics based.
