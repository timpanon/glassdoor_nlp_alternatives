The deals (stuff like Omaha Steaks, HelloFresh, T-Mobile, etc) suck and no company should be paying Care.com to use this service. Most of these offers can be found throughout the web, usually on the actual merchant website. I worked here for 2 years and never bought a thing thru LifeMart.

When we had to work in the office, this place was a 21st century version of Office Space. Very hierarchical and the higher ups were thrived on a culture of fear (resorting to PIPs without even talking to you). For reviews, they make you review your own performance and then cherry-pick mistakes to make you look horrible. It's beyond degrading. 

Zero support for working parents and only 3 days of paternity leave. They also drug test for a job that you could do half asleep. Raises are non-existent and no bonuses. I was the only non-white person on my team and management took zero interest in me and my career goals. It was very isolating. 

I was ready to leave after 1 year. The pandemic delayed this by a year. 

My manager had ZERO boundaries and would give me unsolicited advice on finding childcare just so I wouldn't ""be distracted"". Sorry, my child has interrupted nothing and you have ZERO authority of what I do at home."

161,Care.com,Great benefits and management,2016-05-01,4.0,Customer Service Representative (CSR),"Care.com is definitely all about ensuring that their employees remain happy. Right before I left, the company announced amazing benefits for even part time employees, including paid vacation time, dental, and vision. Overall, there's an understanding in this company that a happy employee is an employee who's going to do good work.

I also appreciated that the managers I worked with constantly had my back. A lot of customer service positions involve managers reversing the CSR's decision to appease an angry customer, but in this position, I always knew that I had the managers' support in following the company policies and procedures. The managers were also frequently available to help out whenever someone had a question or was facing a really confusing problem.

Compensation is pretty good for what amounts to an entry level CSR position. You definitely won't be able to buy a new Porsche with it, but if you're looking for something to pay the bills while working from home, it's pretty good. Also good was the commute, because not much beats working from home.","At the end of the day, this is a customer service position, and it does involve dealing with often unhappy customers. Many of the policies in place didn't seem fair to the customers or seemed deliberately misleading, which resulted in more than a few abusive phone calls. That sort of stress can and does wear on a person--after all, nobody likes to spend their entire work day being cussed out by strangers for something they have no control over.

The remote CSR team is a small one, which fosters a sense of camaraderie but also creates a pretty sticky situation if an emergency comes up. There aren't many people necessarily available to cover shifts when those emergencies do arise, and that can lead to some stressful times and other sorts of trouble."
162,Care.com,Surprising - In A Good Way!,2016-04-29,4.0,Manager,"While the company itself has some PR issues, they do care about their people and treat their employees very well. I appreciate how senior management tries to tackle difficult issues head-on and do their best to make it a workplace where you can grow and feel supported. Flexible environment so you can get your work done remotely if need be, decent benefits, lots of onsite perks like cafeteria, massages, manicures, yoga, snacks, etc.  People here are generally incredible smart and cool - data and analytics plays a big part in decisions, so even if it's not an obvious part of your role, get comfortable with numbers and large overarching goals.","Work life balance can be a struggle at times, but mostly people put pressure on themselves as opposed to management heaping it on. Priorities can sometimes be unclear and change a lot. Some departments are difficult to work with, but for the most part, coworkers are very cooperative and relatively flexible. Company / department goals can feel unrealistic and hard to hit most of the time. Traffic to Waltham is killer - a Boston satellite office would make things better for many people. It's easy to get lost in the shuffle - a lot of immediate managers are so busy trying to get their work done, there aren't a ton of (visible) opportunities for mentorship for newer folks - it's on you to figure it out and network twice as hard, especially if you are in a remote office."

166,Care.com,"Stay for the people, leave for the money",2016-03-19,5.0,Senior Marketing Associate,"I was here for 2.5 years and the people are by far the company's best asset.  I became genuine friends with the majority of my colleagues, hanging out both in and outside of the office.  I genuinely looked forward to going to work every day because, while there was often a heavy workload and tight deadlines, you are surrounded by friends.  What's nice about Care, is that typically includes your direct manager, as well as your peers.  This type of personal relationship was great for open and honest communication, teamwork and trust.  Every manager I ever had kept their reports' best interest in mind, ranging from leaving their team for a new opportunity or leaving work early to attend a personal event.  The trust and friendship made everything easier, more enjoyable and was beneficial to all.  Of course, I can only speak to the teams that I was on (Marketing and B2B), and not say, the creative team.  But everyone who I ever worked with on my teams were A+ friends and role models, and I'm assuming that's true for most.

Further, the people here are all very smart and always willing to help.  If you're just starting your career, this is a great place to come surround yourself with good, smart and helpful people.  My advice would be to come get your experience, learn as much as you can and then get your promotion/raise elsewhere.

Lastly, a major perk is the freedom.  Depending on your role and manager, the hours can be pretty flexible, with the ability to leave early, one late or work from home when needed.  Get your work done, show you can be trusted and the freedom is nice.","If you move around internally, don't expect to be paid market value.  In my experience, and in talking to others, when you're given a raise/promotion to a new role, it's given on the lower end of the allocated range for that position.  It was explained to me first hand by someone in HR that I wasn't eligible for more money because I was internal, when the range clearly indicated there was a budget for a much higher salary.  The big money is reserved for outside hires.

As the company grows and scales, there are some growing pains.  For instance, new (and seemingly endless) approval processes can lead to some wasteful time, blown up projects and last minute changes that can be frustrating and make you feel like you've lost autonomy with your projects."

There's so much going on that if you refuse to be accountable for maintaining your own work/life balance, you may experience burn-out. But as long as you set limits, prioritize, and ask for help when you need it, you'll keep growing at the rate you need to keep up, because the company isn't slowing down."
183,Care.com,Beware of care.com!!,2015-06-05,1.0,Virtual Customer Service Representative,"At first it seems extremely easy-going and laidback; they offer these interesting perks in the beginning: free massages on Mondays, first manicure for free at manicube, free snacks, and reassuring as well as positive feedback.","Then the other shoe finally drops and the fugazi suddenly lifts and this is when reality finally hits: the company is led by inexperienced twenty-somethings that constantly contradict each other and even themselves when it comes to everything from company policies to training schedules to even the rate of pay which became lower than what was put in their online job description.They preach that their first priority is customer service, but in reality, they care nothing for the customers or employees for that matter, and it is only money that motivates this corporation. Now I understand businesses are in the business to make money, but when their plastic personalities slowly begin to fade away, the ugly truth that they care for no one unless that person is advancing them in some way. Many of the employees throw other employees under the bus to make themselves look better, almost as to ensure their job security. I unfortunately believed the hype, and actually thought I was employed there to help those who are in desperate situations, whether looking for employment or seeking an employee, but instead, I was repeatedly prompted to take advantage of their desperation by taking money from them without providing any real service. I am utterly appalled by how this company operates, and was honestly thankful that I was terminated for helping out a customer with her profile and providing a refund for her frustration only because all the positive feedback I had been receiving had damaged their over-inflated egos. My advice is to stay far away from this company because if you do not take heed, you will end up doing all kinds of work that was never included in the job description without being compensated for all your hard work."

Overall footprint with consumer is huge. Great brand - talk to any parent and they have used Care.com or either have heard of it.,Lack of mobility. Senior management does not grow their people. They are more interested in hiring from outside instead of rewarding and growing internal talent. In my time at care I saw a number of very talented people whose work was never recognized and they had to leave the company to grow their careers. Questionable senior hires. The previous poster is misguided in the sense that the issue is not race but the quality of hire.

The c-level team is stellar and offers a high amount of visibility into the business . The energy at Care.com is friendly and inclusive.

Care.com is growing fast and that means opportunity for ambitious and talented people.  There is an opportunity to build culture and leave your mark in this company.  Innovation and entrepreneurial thought is valued.,"Fast growth means that you have to be flexible and keep the picture in mind.  While Care.com is now public, it is still only 8 years old and you have to be willing to work in a different way than you do in a well-established company.  Care.com is still learning and rolling out management tools, technology and career development training to help employees grow, but if you don't advocate for yourself, build relationships across the company and get involved, you could find yourself frustrated that the red carpet isn't rolled out for you."

Culture is nice and you get to work with highly driven and talented people. Lots of interesting projects going on and the middle management that I worked for are nice people.

People feel supported through major life changes. Managers and Directors are accommodating and go out of the way to help you out through critical transitions that normal people face from time to time - babies, illness, sick parents, divorce etc. You can work from home when you need to, and I did not see people misusing it. Most people have strong work ethics.

The new office space is beautiful and every detail has been thought through. Kudos!","Care.com used to be great at identifying and hiring talented and passionate people. This is not true anymore. New C-level execs on the West Coast have hired entire teams from their past companies with inflated titles. While this new layer has been created, people in Waltham have no visibility or influence and have been turned into worker bees.

Every one knows at Care, that you have to prove yourself to grow through the ranks, one level at a time. They don't make it easy but when you start reporting to people who cannot execute, have zero quant skills and their only credential is that they are from the same ethnic group as a C-level exec, it is disturbing. Running joke is that if you don't drink bubble tea - you don't have a chance.

There are meetings throughout the day with total disregard that employees need to eat and get work done. Lot of folks work after hours at home because it is impossible to get anything done in the office. While the management team's fancy lunches(Lobster Cobb salad, Lemongrass chicken) are ordered from nice local eateries and their admins whip them smoothies and lattes, other people sit through meetings starving. This is not an exaggeration. The cafe in the building is just bad, salad bar is disgusting and most people don’t eat there. Either you bring food from home or pay extra extra to grubhub to get food delivered."

When a new hire comes on, you are supposed to train them and do your ten jobs and the middle associates lives are hell. It's not fast-paced, it's warp speed. They keep hiring VPs, stretching the middle, and ""cutting costs"" by removing hard working employees. 

There is NO career path that makes sense. Promotions don't seemed earned. 

If you are young, single/married with no kids, expect to work your tail off. You will be there 7-9 and not get compensated for it. Their salaries are comical and many good candidates (who we desperately need) laugh at the salary. Culture isn't everything - and the culture is beginning to stink. 

If you don't drink the kool-aid and see what's going on, you'll want to leave. Care.com isn't there for its customers and it's not there for its employees."
