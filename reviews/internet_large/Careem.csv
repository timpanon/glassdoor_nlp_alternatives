262,Careem,A place to learn,2019-11-06,4.0,Analytics Lead,You learn every single day,Turning to be a corporate
263,Careem,Fantastic place to grow!,2019-11-06,5.0,Senior Manager,"I have loved (continue to love) working for Careem owing to 5 key aspects:

1. Autonomy: I'm given significant freedom to decide how to work i.e. which initiatives to launch, how to spend budget, which direction to take for growth etc. but at the same, I am held accountable for targets and this increases my sense of responsibility. The two are well balanced. 

2. Culture: I was hired early on when the market was launching and to a great degree, had an influence on the work culture in the office. I am reminded of the values of Careem which aligned very much with my own and I therefore found a place where I was constantly inspired to accomplish more. The people I work with on a daily basis are sincere, kind, committed and hard working colleagues. 

3. Leadership: The senior most leadership at Careem continues to inspire and lead the way in line with the potential of Careem and it's values. However this might begin to waiver or fade as it trickles down. Sometimes you would come across leaders that are seemingly working hard but may not fully live the values of Careem, causing internal friction - other times, you would come across some fantastic colleagues who both inspire you and live true to their word. 

4. Company Potential: It's invigorating to be part of a firm that is constantly growing by leaps and bounds and has an expanding vision across all directions. In my almost 4 years at Careem, I've never seen Careem slow down and the more aspects the business gets involved in, the more opportunities you have to learn.

5. Growth Opportunity: This is slightly tricky - Careem leaves the floor open for you to learn as much as you want (it provides online resources, easy access to colleagues, access to data, internal mobility) but the onus mainly lies on you. Additionally, career trajectory also largely depends on the kind of manager you get and if he/she is willing to take a bet on you, you'll have a bright future. If they're not invested in your growth/learning, you're likely to struggle even if you're a star performer. I've been lucky to have a manager that both recognizes the effort and pushes me to grow, which has made Careem a place I want to continue working at.","1. Compensation: Salaries are to some degree competitive but may not fully reflect the value that you bring to the company or what you might be capable of fetching elsewhere. It's easier to accept this when you have stock in the company because the future value of vesting the shares significantly outweighs a lower salary at the present moment.

2. Performance Reviews: This area is a bit tricky especially if the managers who are expected to rate you on your performance sit in another country. Your perception in front of that manager is key to how you'll be rated aside from how you scored on your OKRs and creating a positive perception is only possible if your name has been associated with big accomplishments multiple times and whether there are other members of the team who are recognizing the work you do, since everything is posted online i.e. on the company's intranet/communication tools. You could be doing a lot of the ""intangible"" work or things you work on outside of your immediate scope, but sadly that is never really factored in (understandly so) because the managers do not have view on this effort. Things that might be directly impacting your team's NPS which you are working on, but are viewed more as cursory initiatives rather than actualy contributors to a team's success, is another downside of working in a firm that does not hire for each specific need of a market but rather draws multiple things from the same individual and focuses on efficient hiring (keep one manager for multiple markets located in 1 place) than a manager in each. Bottomline: Your performance reviews may be something that you don't fully consider as fair evaluations."

But for a late joiner (on a below market average salary usually and tiny equity), that really makes no sense. All those years spent working non-stop will likely be remembered later on as pure waste."
