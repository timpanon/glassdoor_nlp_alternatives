2,CareerBuilder,Too many huge changes,2022-04-06,3.0,National Account Executive,"Work life balance, great coworkers, work from home","They recently changed the compensation structure and it's terrible! What used to be consistent bonuses for top performers now are cut in half, with the other half of bonus not coming until Q4 for most reps who have end of year renewals. I will not receive half my bonus until January 2023, which isn't practical. I can't wait that long to make bonuses that pay my bills :( 

It's sad because all the veterans and top performers are leaving, or will leave over the next month or two. Unfortunately this comp plan is the final straw for many of the best employees."

My question: how was commission even calculated for 5 months if the sales targets are unknown? Total bait and switch on job expectations and comp-structure from the interview process. Blatantly lied to about sales targets and having accounts added to your book of business (so you could finally make some money) only to again be told the night before commission-payout that your targets are changed yet again. I have never experienced anything like this in my 10+ years in sales, and it is no wonder there is a mass-exodus happening at this company."

Very little trust in the pros they hire, leaving them to scramble to prove themselves instead of being allowed to do their work. The CMO left, nothing changed. The director left, nothing changed. Major bait and switch on the job description vs. the actual job. Hopefully new CEO makes a difference.

If you consider working here, ask in-depth questions. Voice your concerns. It may not be the same forever as it was for us, but with a reputation like this, they need to prove if/how they've changed, not just say so. 

Health benefits were lacking - UHC was abysmal & didn't cover several basic things. The Empower 401k they used had astronomically high rates that made it a bummer of an investment. Don't know if it's still the same, but ask for the fine print."

The new targets were designed to fire us because CB took the loan from the government that only forgave the loan if they brought their furloughed staff back. So the loop hole was making it easy to get canned because if you didn't hit a target YOUR FIRST MONTH BACK...you were put on plan. I quit before this happened to me, as another opportunity came up that pays they way a senior AE should be.....which btw...CB sells a tool that shows what the average person is getting paid in a certain position in any given market, and they still only offer 60k to SENIOR AE's when the market demands for around 100k as a base. My new gig offers more in my bi weekly salary check than a whole month at CB. This place is the worst company I've ever worked for. I was talking to an old co worker and they gave this response when talking about the furlough situation: ""Yeah I found out from my manager once he was laid off that that was intentional. Irina said in a leader meeting that she wanted a “boiler room experience for sales reps” so she could churn and burn you"".....meanwhile management smiles to your face, smiles to the viewers of various news outlets pretending to care about their staff and the market....they do not. If you need the money, use this only as a placeholder while you search for something else, and do not waste time looking. If you have options...dont pick this one. Trust the reviews"

Literally Anything,2021-04-15,1.0,Account Executive,"Nice office, nice office furniture, nice people.","Inferior product, poor branding, poor sales environment. True churn and burn culture. Work anywhere else in Chicago. Seriously, unless you enjoy losing your hair, having reoccurring work nightmares, and seeking out the most stressful environment imaginable, all while busting your a** to hit 25% of your quota, look anywhere else.

If you are desperate for a sales job, look elsewhere in Chicago. Sales Assembly has a cool program called ""New Hire Launch"" that can help you find positions in organizations that were not born in the depths of hell and actually have a company vision that involves selling market solutions instead of non-refundable snake oil. Or you could always just go sell freight somewhere.

Taking a position here, even for a year, will set your sales career back at least three years. You will gain no valuable selling experience, and other highly regarded Chicago companies will throw your resume away in the future for being stupid enough to accept a job here."

I was apprehensive about a position with this company after reading reviews before but after speaking with my manager I felt at ease. I really loved my team and we were doing great and the. COVID hit. I’m not talking about furloughs or layoffs because the market dictated that. What I will talk about is how they treated me. After Covid they switched us over to being paid on a renewal percentage as opposed to commission on new sales, this was in an attempt to retain business in the down market, very understandable. So I had a super high renewal rate the first two months, I was re-signing clients like crazy and felt really good about it. Then my first bons check was $0.

How could this happen? They had put two accounts in my name; one had left two months before it was in my name, and the other had already given the verbal that they were leaving our ATS system a month before I got the account. They even had an early opt out clause in their contract. When I started, all renewals were through CSM’s, so even if they had been in my name before it wasn’t in my job description to renew them. For three months I was strung along and told my case was “under review” and ultimately was told that there were no exceptions whatsoever. So basically they got months of me working towards renewals for base pay, which isn’t that competitive. Basically screwing me out of 25% of my expected income.

On top of that, Sasha and Irina act like they care about their employees. They hold weekly meetings and do that fake corporate fun stuff in the guise of team building, but at the end of the day, they are both morally bankrupt. 

Also, their product isn’t that great. Indeed and LinkedIn eat their lunch."

There’s no denying that the hard times at the company brought a lot of us together instead of ripping us apart. We found comradery in the pain, tons of fun in the joys, and have maintained lasting relationships even when friends left the company. They are the reason I won't give CB only 1 Star, overall.","CareerBuilder wasn’t in outstanding financial standing even prior to the Apollo acquisition, but at least the previous executives treated you like a human being. Most of the current Executive team, aside from a couple who are wonderful, is vile and severely lack Emotional Intelligence.

The CEO, Irina Novoselsky, has no business in this role. She burns through sales reps with unrealistic goals to instill fear & drudgery (that she calls “grit”) because she only knows how to be an absolute authoritarian, rather than a motivational leader. She’s run this company, and more importantly, the livelihood of SO many people, straight into the ground through poor decisions and complete lack of care or compassion for the people who truly keep the company alive (using what limited tools are available to them).
Additionally, she chose not to share the results of the annual company survey at the beginning of the year (aside from stating the obvious “you all LOVE each other”) because they were a direct reflection of her incompetence and lack of leadership ability. It was a cowardly, repugnant move not to address it. Matt Ferguson, the former CEO, ALWAYS shared the good but focused on the bad with transparency.

The President, Sasha Yablonovsky, is pitiful. Judging by her horrid treatment of people, it’s clear she doesn’t want the responsibility of this job. She just wants the high title & authority that she thinks comes with it. She’s ruthless and callous, clueless as to how to engage with her own employees, and completely in the dark when it comes to her duties as President.
HOWEVER, I do think that if she worked under a compassionate, experienced, and inspiring CEO she’d be WAY different. I think her good side would shine through and her rare bursts of enthusiasm would turn into a real force of inspiration.

But together, under these circumstances, they’ve absolutely failed. They failed themselves, they failed the company, and most importantly, they failed the employees."
188,CareerBuilder,Not worth it,2020-09-28,1.0,Manager,Great managers and employees. Managers do a good job at shielding their teams from higher level leaders and keeping morale up while working remote.,"As many reviews have stated, CareerBuilder will not be successful under Irina and Sasha’s leadership. 
There is no consistency around promotions or pay increases. We’re told there will be no promotions or merit increases this year, we’re in cost-savings mode, but then some promotions still get approved causing internal pay equity issues and low morale among those who haven’t received an increase in almost 2 years and/or those who are already doing the job of a higher level role without the title or compensation to show for it. 
The small perks and benefits we used to get that balanced out the low pay are now gone. Our benefits package is not competitive and our 401k match is discretionary based on company performance (and we have been underperforming for years).
Sales and success are the only groups who get recognition during company calls. 
The voluntary turnover of our executive level leaders is insanely high, they usually quit after a year of working under Irina. That is not a coincidence and it is not normal.
We don’t purchase new  IT equipment/computers for our employees, everything gets repurposed from terminated employees but a computer can only last for so long. Our IT team is drowning with tickets because so many people are having computer issues but our leadership won’t invest in IT, sales and success are the priority. This is a confusing message when everyone is working remote for the foreseeable future and in order to do our jobs, we need working computers."

On the other hand outside of IT I did see promotions occurring, this was due to one reason, and that is Anthony Dupree.

The CIO Anthony Dupree has created a very negative atmosphere. He lacks people management skills and is very dismissive and pretty much micro managing literally everything. Numerous laders have left the organization, no backfills occurred but instead they placed a member of that specific team to manage the team, for these unfortunate employees there was not even a job title change. 
Recently I endured numerous stressful events, Anthony Dupree will get involved in nearly every matter and over rule it. Micro management in full affect right there.  He states he has a open door policy but will palm of any issues for someone else to deal with.

The environment is so unstable and there is no clear plan or objective set it is all wishy washy. So many cuts are taking place and operations are being shifted to India. This shows that they do not value their current employees and are happy for them to go so money can be saved. 
The damage has been done CB should employee a candidate who fits with the CB profile and has industry knowledge, the correct skill set to take charge of a department furthermore they should not get the job because they were chums in the previous organization. It is truly disgusting on how employees have been treated by C-Level and senior management."

It's been over a year now since leaving so I've had time to fully reflect on the mess IT became after the acquisition and I can't really put it into words.  All teams within IT continue to shrink and management’s expectations continue to rise with no compensation for those left to pick up all the work.  The amount of talent that has left IT in the past 2-3 years is absolutely insane, and it's even more insane that management has done next to nothing to replace those positions and left it to the poor souls still hanging around to pick up the slack.  I really can't imagine how Anthony thinks it’s possible to support the hundreds of users at the company's main office with less than 3 support techs on site and no management/supervision at that location for well over a year now.  It was hard enough when there was a full team of 5-6 of us, now the Chicago support team will soon have a grand total of 1 technician.  Actually, I can imagine it...it's because every salary cut is money saved and closer to EBITA goals so of course management doesn't bother with the fact that top talent continues to leave and then makes no effort to replace them.

How is it possible that a company in the recruitment space treats its own employees so poorly that there is an incredibly high turnover of staff? Even new hires choose to leave after a short period of time having been mis-sold a dream.
Maybe it's not the management's fault? This has been a bad project for Apollo. They failed to sell off most of the international market when they first bought CareerBuilder leading to higher operational costs than they predicted. Couple that with not getting some money in the bank and we are talking about a significant failure. In all likelihood, the decision now is probably to break off and sell the parts that will make some money and reduce the operational costs as much as possible.

In order to stop bleeding money, there has been a very specific game plan:
- move staff into worse/cheaper facilities.
- reduce headcount where possible
- only hire into positions that are essential, otherwise, let the remaining team suffer
- outsource where possible
- reduce bonus/benefits
- training is no longer available; you are expected to do it at your own cost
- mistreat/bully staff until they choose to leave
- not a friend of the senior management? Don't bother coming here.

They reference ""AI"" a bajillion times a day because its a buzzword they think will trick people into thinking they are investing in the products. The ""AI"", similar to their ""200 data scientists"" are all made up. Literally, imaginary. Apollo (current private equity owners) are just putting lipstick on a pig. Then they will take that little piggy to market and butcher off whatever pieces of the business they can sell. And then they will move on to their next corporate greed driven project. Are the new leaders Ivy League educated?...Yes. Are they morally and ethically bankrupt?...also yes."

People are fired constantly leaving the office like a revolving door of talent. All of the longtime employees seem jaded or scared. The best thing about working at CareerBuilder is the lounge owned by a different company. The sales directors are potty mouthed and unprofessional. The C-level team is also extremely unprofessional and have even been caught making discriminatory comments. The CEO actually came to the sales floor, cracked a transphobic joke and left. One of our team members was visibly upset about the comment and nobody thought to check in, except me. This isn’t a place for the young or hopeful. Your youth will be wasted.

Total sinking ship,2019-08-02,1.0,Small Business Account Executive,I worked at CareerBuilder in the SMB for over 2 years and established some really great relationships with clients that helped me learn more about the unique challenges they face.  I also learned the importance of keeping your head down and focusing on only the things that are within your control.,"Turnover: SMB reps were told by the top leader of the SMB that 1 of the biggest initiatives for CB in 2019 was to increase marketing/brand exposure.  We hired a new CMO last year and she was gone within a year.  No communication from the CSO or CEO about this. Many of the management/senior management roles have consistent turnover which is a big red flag for any company. 95% of the  sales reps that were in my hiring class are gone.  

Customer Support: CB recently decided to split the sales team into 2 groups. Sales focuses on hunting new business. Success focuses on renewing current business. The transition was a nightmare. My commission went from 4% to 2% on deals that I had previously signed.  Total slap in the face.  I was told my clients spending over a certain amount would receive US based support.  Those clients ended up receiving support from offshore reps in Phillipenes in Nicaragua who were not trained and not helpful.  Mentally, this took a toll on me since I was telling  clients they would get US based support if they spent over X amount. Ultimately, US support never happened regardless of their spend. It made me look dishonest.

Product: I knew it was time for to leave after I did not believe in the product.  The job postings do not perform well. CB tries to position it saying “it’s because of the unemployment rate, we provide better quality candidates, or your posting needs X content to make it perform better.”  SMB clients get little to no support.  At the end of the day, companies are getting more candidates and better quality candidates from other sources."

It became a case of bravado and who had the higher connections.  If you had a wimp of a boss, you were screwed.  With the new ownership/leadership, its magnified, except don't disagree with anyone within the ELT.  It will cost you your job.  I see others comment about how the new leadership doesn't understand CB products.  This isn't anything new.  The old leadership didn't either. The problem is the old leadership fed the new ones the information.  Neither the old or the new have actually been dealing with the people on the front lines or meeting with the core clients.   Meeting with the largest opportunities doesn't count as most of CB's business is small to medium size businesses.  The small and medium sized businesses have different issues and are just walking away, while our leadership is spending time insuring one of the top 30 accounts is happy enough to renew FOR LESS.  In the meantime, 50 customers just walked away completely.  OMG COMPRESSION!!!!  ""Compression on an account will not be allowed "" Ummm, OK, we will be sure to tell the customers that ....  Its more like clients aren't compressing, they just aren't renewing.

""But sell them background checks!""  Ha!  Ok well teach us how to sell background checks.  The sales cycle there is not 30 days more like 6 months to a year and you have to talk to entirely new portion of the organization.  But I guess reality is not acceptable!

Too many clients have pulled up their hiring report how they aren't hiring anyone from CB.... Hello to Hire, more like Goodbye, your fired!

Head-scratching moment:  Why build and promote a product that enhances your search experience and act like this is revolutionary when 1) CB Clients don't search within the CB environment and 2) the product is unstable.  We had to have a recorded demo during our sales presentations as we couldn't trust it to work without an issue during the call.

Another head-scratching moment:  Who wants a virtual reality app for job hunting.  I mean seriously, in what world do you live in that you think people are going to walk around and look at the world through an app  on their phone to find out that some company on the 20th floor of a building downtown is hiring for a sales engineer.  OK, great so what should I do?

Instead of trying to bring traffic to the site to yield a better ROI to retain and attract new clients, we are hit with a quota that really isn’t obtainable.  Our clients can see we are struggling.  In a sales meeting, Sasha literally told us If we continued to operate the way we were, we were on the verge to close our doors by end of 2019.  (Not really motivating to stay).  With the new comp plan, they really screwed everyone not only with raising quotas by 5x but also putting in that you need to be the original signer is an agreement to get revenue credit on it.  With the turnover rates the way they are they know reps would have to work months and sometimes years on this account before you actually get credit for it.  They expect us to upsell clients and submit new contracts.  Problem with this is not everyone wants to do this.  So if you have that situation guess what, you’re working for free on that account.  They took away benefits like presidents club (they brought it back for this year but let’s be honest about 2% will actually qualify just because they got lucky and brought in a big background check deadline), wellness benefit, 401k match (which is based on ebita now), half day fridays etc.  it’s just not enjoyable to work here anymore.

Good people and training/development existed 2015-2016

There were once solid benefits and pay","When you're ""easy to do business with"", you end up letting a lot of outright or borderline fraudulent ""employers"" onto the site. Software isn't your product. Candidates are your product. When you don't care about how often they're spammed with irrelevant or fake jobs, they stop using your site. 

Zero leadership development. Sales managers were routinely put in positions that they weren't ready for, and given no support to improve their leadership skills. 

Luckily I got out of there before it really got bad, but I've heard horror stories about life there now. 

Management's obvious attempts to boost their ratings speak to how dumb they think their current and potential employees are. I get why they do it (I do not envy their recruiters), but it's painfully obvious when the ratings trend is so negative, but then 4-5 positive reviews pop up all at once.

They tried to sway it by making crazy unrealistic quotas that IF you hit, which you won't, you could be making X. This is insane!

Culture destruction. Hemorrhaging of top talent. Irina and crew have ruined what was an amazing company and she did it fast. Irina truly deserves her embarrassing 16% approval rating. (I’m shocked it’s not lower). 

She, and Apollo, have destroyed the lives of hundreds (500+) employees who gave decades of loyal and committed service...all for penny’s on the dollar. The old CareerBuilder philosophy was ""employees are a company's most valuable asset."" The new Apollo/Irina philosophy is ""employees are a toxic and cancerous expense on our balance sheet and should be cut quickly and cruelly."" 

Thanks for nothing! Hope you can continue to afford your designer shoes and expensive cars while the rest of us now pinch penny’s to provide food for our kids. 

Hope you one day see the damage you have done to great people like us. We have very real families to feed and very real bills to pay...but guess you don’t care."

Most accounts are in a bad spot, reps need their leaders more than ever.  Yet, leaders wont accept an open conversation about reality.  EVERYTHING IS NOT THE REPS FAULT! A rep isnt bad if they cant sell a 8 year contract, or background checks.   The reps want to win as much as you do, why do you treat them like idiots?  The HC group is notorious for being a group of lies.  All the reps are afraid to talk to the leaders, let alone tell them the truth of what customers are saying.  Naturally it's the reps fault if a client is not happy.  Also, be prepared to be lectured.  Every chance HC leaders have they will stop any meeting to let everyone know what they would say, or what they did 8 years ago when they sold to car dealerships.  SRG, this is the bro group.  Your stress will be lower in this group, but you will have a harder time proving value.

356,CareerBuilder,From Hope to Despair,2018-12-01,1.0,Customer Success Manager,"When I started the pros were overwhelming and I was SO PROUD to be hired by such an amazing company.  The benefits, the people, the culture, the focus on building employees through training and coaching, the fun, the leadership, and looking towards the future were all part of the day to day CB activities.  I met the most amazing people that I still keep in touch with.  My tenure was 2016-2018, which I recognize some will say was well after the height of CB, but even so it was amazing in comparison to where I had been prior.  I learned a lot but I am grateful to have left CB and joined a fantastic company that actually  cares about its employees.","The change when Irina and team took over was a blow to everything positive that I mentioned above.  It was a scary and demoralizing time.  I remember sitting at my desk on conference calls watching as text messages and instant messages rolled in about secret HR meetings and people being laid off.  This happened at least 3 times in the last 9 months that I worked there.  I left one day shaking because the man who was cutting heads had veered towards my desk at one point.  

The culture is dead, the people that are still there are mostly there because of the benefits, especially if they want to have children.  It’s fairly easy to glide along there without putting in much effort as long as you are ok with being stagnant, experiencing constant negative change, and watching all of your co-workers quit which results in more and more work for you.  They say you don’t leave companies, you leave managers...not in this case.  I left the company because that company does not care one bit about what it does to it’s employees now (regardless of what you might see in some of the positive reviews here).  When I gave my notice, I got a form email for termination and a survey for my exit interview.  They had to move to automated exit interviews because so many people were quitting.  I don’t think they care about the answers you provide. 

I still have a bit of left over jitters from working there and anything out of the ordinary at work now makes me nervous, immediately making me wonder if I’m being laid off or fired, because of the way CB handled the layoffs."

Had a round of layoffs in sales just weeks after the Apollo acquisition.  Then Chief Sales Officer set expectation that this was not going to happen again.  Well it did.  Lousy severance packages for those laid off of one week for every year, which can only be described as pathetic and heartless.  Basically a total disgrace as to how they treated people.

I also got a supervisor that was brand new to the role with severe favoritism. Not a great combo.

He is the CIO (even though he didn't know what that position was as a young boy, and still doesn't) and is a huge reason for the low morale in the office. He literally walks around to see what's on everyone's monitors to make sure we're working. He implemented this new concept called ""Utilization"" for Support; this means we literally have to track the amount of time we spend on every interaction with each client to make sure our time is being spent appropriately. According to his standards you should be tracking/logging 50 minutes out of every hour towards your tickets, yet that's not how multitasking works so it's a made up metric. Also, I'm an adult. In a Support meeting with the directors, Anthony hijacked the meeting unannounced to tell us how horrible we're doing and literally addressed the room by calling us his ""lowest employees"". Don't be fooled like I was and think ""I'm not high up enough to be a C-level's concern"". WRONG. I've never met anyone in my life as degrading as this bloke. I truly wonder how it feels to be the most hated person in the office. 

Anyway, literally every single person I consult with is looking for a job. I don't see this company standing ground for very long. C-levels continue to boast about all of the money we've saved and EBITA, but let's consider how many salaries you don't have to pay to employees who left voluntarily and involuntarily, thank you captain obvious. This is a trickle effect that will eventually hit our clients hard, if it hasn't already. We recently lost one of our top paying clients and more will follow I'm sure. 

Also, our HR department is dwindling, that's a really bad sign. There's less people to represent us. Do yourself a favor and keep looking."

You know what, I’ll start with the fact that I can’t even believe I’m wasting more time talking about this sad, dying, has-been, stupid, valueless, unimportant once great company literally packed with pathetic men and women who continuously pretend every day like everything is fine; worse so, they act like things are great - not a joke. They say things are “changing” and “shifting” and that they’re being “disruptive.” Do they actually believe this? I can’t. Alas, people need to know the truth.

The only thing being disrupted at CareerBuilder are the employees. Irina, aka real deserving sharpshooter, is the COO. Girl, who gave you a megaphone to march around the office with? When I heard that was the latest sitch' happening, I was almost surprised. In what world is that an appropriate thing to do? That is so remarkably embarrassing and degrading and you owe your employees an apology. Also, who told you to wear a power suit and Christian Louboutins to work every day - was that you? lol I bet it was. No, do you girl - it makes everyone think you’re super cool and fashionable - so much taste. 

But honestly, who do you think you are?

People on Glassdoor reading this - the COO literally stumbled around the office shouting demands through a megaphone whilst also sounding off a siren. Yes, that happened… in 2018. Ever since she came to CareerBuilder things have plummeted into an unidentifiable darkness.

Newsflash - to every leader at CareerBuilder; everything is not okay. You know it - your employees know it, your competitors know it.  Also, your customers can read so they know it now too. Your publicly despicable and womanizing sales leaders should be fired for the sexual misconduct they’ve been accused of. You know the ones. They should have been fired years ago when all the sexual harassment was actually happening. I have girlfriends that have felt this sexual misconduct themselves and were too afraid to ever say anything in fear they’d be fired or worse, that nothing would come of it - how embarrassing. Finally, you have an opportunity to do the right thing - you should do it. I, along with many other men and women and families will be heartbroken if you do nothing.

417,CareerBuilder,A look back a year later,2018-06-19,1.0,Software Engineer,"Its a good place to learn how not to do software, which is not as bad as it sounds, some of the lessons I learned while digging through years-old mistakes have helped me tremendously in creating more resilient software. 

I left CB about a year ago, right after the acquisition and about a month before the first round of layoffs. I was expected those and was kind of glad they started trimming down, even in the haphazard way they did. CB had a longstanding tradition of hiring fast and firing slow, and protecting friends who honestly had no clue how to do their job. 

But mostly the people on the development teams were honest and intelligent and helpful. If those people are still there, then that's a pro, but I tend to think most of the ones remaining either can't find another position, or are hoping to grab a VP-level title as the uppers jump ship. Though with CB's reputation in Atlanta's tech scene, I'm not sure how much good that will do them.","The mismanagement of the software development teams was mind-boggling. We were called agile, but we had no process to create cards from business requirements or estimate time or even anyone to keep track of what we should be building. Mostly, a director would come by one morning, say, 'I want it to do x' and then one person would go off and build x for the next two months on their own with no defined scope.  Each scrum giving updates like 'working on x'. And then another manager of another team would come by them and say 'I want it to do x', and a person would go off and build that for 2 months. And what we ended up with was lots of the same things, built 8 different ways, for 8 different products, each one with its own bugs and a need for feature parity, once someone realized both products now do x. 

Not only was there no communication between development managers and the business, but even between multiple teams supposedly working on parts of the same project. I was on back-end teams for my time at CB, and we would complete some api to return some kind of data for the front-end to display to the user, and it would just sit behind a feature flag for months because the front end teams' managers would decide that the feature was no longer priority and the front end wasn't going to use that data yet, or ever.  Once I even went and deleted a full feature I had implemented because it was just dead code. Features that take a normal agile team a sprint, could take years at CB, simply due to never being priority for every middle manager at once.

Mostly it came down to what happens when a company in one industry (advertising) tries to pivot into another (software) and doesn't hire any outside leadership with experience in that industry. A lot of floundering and wasted effort."

Can you name another company that does not hire any leadership from the outside? Directors (""VP's"") on the enterprise and healthcare side of the business have no idea what is going on in their business and don't offer any help. When a big client does not renew they will yell and scream and accuse you of all of the things you did not do and sit back and tell you what you should have done instead of roll up their sleeves and help...you know, like good leaders do.   These same leaders have had hundreds of strong sales people leave the company, lose millions in revenue and have dozens of these negative reviews on them and they are still working there."

Leadership sells the story, ""we are rewarding people who stay and write the next chapter in CareerBuilder's legacy"". But the truth is CareerBuilder has a retention problem and changing the timing on bonus/401k distributions saves money on turnover. CareerBuilder had a lot of bloat prior to the Apollo acquisition, but the dedication to eroding benefits when the company is highly profitable is an alarming trend (RIP summer hours). Salaries for non-sales are weak. This year we received 2% pay increases 4 months delayed that weren't back-paid to Jan 1.

They say they care, but that's all talk - upper management doesn't give a hoot, except for hitting numbers. The workplace is depressing & quiet - you would think no one works there. They recently combined floors to create more ""energy"" on the floor, but it's really because so many have left, there is no need to have that many floors anymore. There used to be summer hours, and the people you worked with made up for the sub-par pay. Upper management has no idea what is truly happening in the day to day of the business, and all about hitting EBITDA goals. I've heard through the grapevine that they are finding any reason to fire people lately to hit EBITDA goals that Irina has put in place. Pretty sad for people who have given years of their life to this company, and gotten nothing in return except a walk out the door.  When people do leave, it isn't brought up, or talked about - it's like they hope no one is noticing.

But when you follow it up with completely changing the culture, not giving yearly merit increases, taking away the trip to Mexico for top performers, taking away quarterly team outings; well that's when this place becomes unbearable. 100+ employees have since quit and more walk out on a daily basis.

This used to be a company full of amazing people. Since Apollo took over, 90% of those employees have left for better opportunities. The 10% that remain are looking for other jobs at their desks (on LinkedIn or Indeed).

- Policy changes not communicated to employees until after they are in effect (401k matching was not paid until the end of the year, but they didn't tell us until a week or two into the year)
- The company would rather let knowledgeable people go without giving them raises to put them at market average, and then hire new engineers at considerably higher wage despite them not going to be ramped up for months.

CareerBuilder is losing accounts left and right, and it's because of the direction that the company has been in and not being as good as the competition.  However, it seems that all of the leaders want to blame the reps.  The sales reps take the hit for everything. Through my time there, I did not see 1 Director get on a call to try and save an account.  Instead, they waited until it fell through and punished the rep.  

I have been reading comments on here for quite some time now, and it seems that there have been a few ""positive"" comments posted lately.  I am willing to bet that it is the leadership trying to convince people that this is a great place to be that way their team does not get dissolved and they actually have to do something..like.... save accounts.  

HR is also a complete nightmare.  Trust me when I saw they could care less about the issues at the company, they will take the companies side and tell you ""that's just how it is.""  There are a few comments on here about sexual Harassment that was reported, but nothing happened.

Now with almost every perk removed everyone is leaving and getting about a 50% pay increase to go along with it.

Well, apply that idea to most upper management. I'm sure they were good at a job at some point, but they're all in over their heads now.

I think they, the powers that be at CareerBuilder, look at this as ""empowering"" people to improve, akin to managing their own small businesses under the umbrella of a large and irrelevant business. Especially on the marketing side of things. Ask anyone who has worked there about their absentee and recently ousted CCO. How much money did he syphon off or waste on his extravagant ideas that no one else could be involved with? How much did he get paid to show his ideas all the love he could afford without any goals in mind? Without any accountability?

Then, there's the head of PR and Social who has no business being where he is. He was an incompetent assistant to the head of PR who continues to have opportunities fall in his lap. How? Literally no one has any idea. Even before working at CareerBuilder, the track record of this individual preceded him. If he ever lifted a finger, found the means to develop some semblance of professionalism, and actually knew what he was doing in any field he's involved in, I'm sure he'd be a lot easier to work with.

Which brings me to their corporate values and the idea of ""being easy to do business with."" A translation: Don't challenge anyone on their ideas. Ever. Even if the ideas are astoundingly bad or off-base. Smile and nod, develop ulcers, and drink your stress away."

But getting on with it..

The CB I knew and the shell that it is now are really a tale of two companies.  Let's just do a quick side by side comparison:

[Old CB]: Invest in your employees, offer leadership classes to top performers, bring in industry experts for lunch n learns, be agile, offer trip.

[New CB]: Cut virtually all travel and training expenditures (though I've heard directly from the mouth's of execs this is not the case...so I've been lied to is what I'm saying), cut leadership training (""B/c I don't want to focus on a few people"" [ahem...your top performers for which you've rewarded with these courses for YEARS]),  'lunch n learns' w/ industry experts turned into webinars with 'oh btw, bring your own lunch', get away from Agile and go Waterfall and Six Sigma (just what young potential tech employees want), and then blame El Chapo as a reason for trip not happening this year (no BS - that actually happened on a sales call).

It's a shell of it's former self.  Some whole departments and teams are voluntarily leaving.   Stop telling me about 'We're not Google...(yet)'  Really?  You think you had to tell me that?   Transitions are hard, I get it, we've been around - but coming in and shelling everything, offering watered down versions of previous base options like you're throwing us a bone, all the while creating a septic environment based solely on EBITDA (thanks employee terminations to help with that!), and then wondering why ""culture"" is fading (but don't worry, it's not exec's fault.

You get promoted to be a solutions architect. As someone who did not begin my career with Careerbuilder, this made it frustrating to try and improve the overall performance in a specific area, because the team generally did not understand (or care to understand) what it meant to “work smarter.” Particularly the product and “Project Management” teams. Technology was consistently broken, implementations were ALWAYS behind schedule, and any recommendations to improve/correct were seen as negative criticism and were dismissed.  They rushed into the purchase of a benefit software platform who was rumored to have actually stolen their code from another company, and who botched the implementation of so many projects, their own employees refer to themselves as “Workterrable.”  They also prided themselves on the acquisition of a job posting distribution tool that put employers at risk of non-compliance, due to dishonesty and negligence internally, and any effort to correct errors was again seen as disrespectful.  All of this while ignoring the previous acquisition of a company which has the ability to seriously change the way business is done via big data.  As an organization, their best asset was their sales team. Then came Apollo. They cleaned house, but instead of firing the bro’s who were busy bragging about banging and ignoring glaring operational risks, they fired the best sales reps the company had, all in the name of a dollar.  They kept directors who have (present tense) a history of favoritism, verbal abuse, dishonestly and flat out discrimination.  They pushed out Retention Managers who had saved entire divisions.  Their only internal retention tool, after firing their biggest assets and crushing morale, was their benefits package, which they butchered without warning, notice, or explanation. In less than 6 months, their reputation was smashed and it seems this may have been the goal, in order to sell fast, hoping nobody would notice."

APOLLO: Because of Apollo, what once was a great place to work is now a wasteland of empty desks. Ever since Apollo took over, the morale of the employees has dwindled down to being basically non-existent. There is no longer a clear career path for anyone. They are dissolving groups/verticals who made the company a LOT of money to cut costs so they don’t have to pay out commission anymore. They changed the commission structure and on top of that retroactively TOOK AWAY money from their sales reps from deals that already have been sold..... (WHAT?!) talk about a slap in the face.

There are still some great people but this is a sinking ship with toxic leadership.,"The company culture is what made CareerBuilder great and valued. It was never the salary as most know, CareerBuilder pays below industry standard which even leaders will admit to when pressed. But everyone loved it because the culture and the people were amazing. I still keep in contact with people from the office and honestly have nothing but great things to say about them. However, since the Apollo acquisition, everything went downhill. There is zero transparency, disciplined freedom is long gone, the culture is horrible with everyone in fear, taking away all of the fringe perks one by one, I believe they are on their 4th round of lay offs and firing people left and right, promotion freezes, etc. And today, after making the employees wait an extra 4 months past year end, they announced merit raises to the tune of 0-2% with most getting 1%. Way to say thanks to the good performers you have left and are overworking. It is appalling how they are treating people.

Let me clear. I am not writing this to bash CB. I want people to understand that CB's legacy employees and Matt are no longer running the show here. Irena and the other Apollo leadership brought in are and it is just not what it once was. I very much enjoyed my years spent with the company before the sale.

Things such as half day Fridays, 401k match (you have to make it through the year), promotions, open door policy with leadership (CB leaders are no longer leaders.

471,CareerBuilder,Sales,2018-04-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"CareerBuilder really wants you to win as a salesperson.  They provide you the tools, resources, product knowledge and expertise to ensure you have everything you need to succeed.  Almost so much that it is spoon fed to you.  Accountability is big and they see to it that you're taking all the baby steps so that you'll be successful long term.  They provide you with a breadth of products to see so that, no matter the client you're calling on, you likely have something to offer.","While accountability is huge, it almost goes too far.  Sales people are in sales because they want to own their business and run it autonomously.  However, when you have managers and directors counting calls, meetings and recording both, it's hard to feel completely autonomous.  If the group is having a bad month or quarter, directors intimidate the group by enforcing metrics more seriously, which could take away from your task at hand.  They can sometimes place threats if you don't hit certain call/meeting/appt metrics.  Once again, this completely takes away any autonomy sales people like to have.  You're basically treated like a child who has to be told what to do, when in reality, everyone is supposed to have experience and shouldn't need that type of micromanagement.  Compensation plans were recently changed as well as a result of the PE firm takeover.  Many many sales people who were/are start performers are now making 30%- 40% less b/c of the new plan.  This is the absolute worth decision any company could make and b/c of it, many excellent performers have and are leaving.  

If you're considering a role with this company, don't trust this review alone.  Take 10 minutes and read others.  You'll see these sentiments echoed throughout the review section.  

Lastly, CB has iterated as a company over the years.  It's better now and products are better, but clients still know CB as a traditional job board.  Perception is reality.  Clients who once tried CB and didn't get result are just not going to come back unless a great incentive is thrown their way.  It's how things work."

Overall, there were amazing career opportunities, great leaders and great learning opportunities but that has all changed in the last 6-9 months.  Most people who understand business should understand that when businesses aren’t doing well, change is needed.    People can be angry about “change” but the majority of change and optimization was needed and that is just part of business.   

There is still a very strong solution set that can really help customers, especially the talent discovery platform, Textkernel and EMSI.   It is just a matter of how quickly they can get in front of customers and can reps navigate job posting performance to get new customers on these solutions.","I can honestly say that for 90% of my time, there were no cons.  Just standard things that happen in business like delays on comp plans, quick pivots but again nothing that was a true con.   But looking at the last 6-9 months, the cons outweigh the pros which is why people are leaving.   It’s a tough environment right now and there can be some upside but a lot of people have decided they didnt want to stick around for it and they would get a better return on their time/effort elsewhere."

I was condescended to in a million small ways, and more than a handful of bigger ways that I should have reported to HR.  This has been going on at CB forever, it is not because of Apollo.

For those of us that have been at CB for 10+ years, we KNOW how to deal with change and we actually don't like the status quo. We have all left (or are looking to leave) because Apollo only cares about cutting costs and we are not people to them. We are just numbers. They came in with a wrecking ball and had no idea what they were doing or who we were as an organization. How about hiring a CIO that doesn't have experience running a software dept nor does he have any idea what agile is? How great is it to know when your CIO is in the office because you can hear him yelling at some poor soul in his office with the door shut as you walk down the hall? The culture we all knew and loved is gone - it has been replaced with fear. We used to be a family; now people are turning on each other to save themselves.

Over the years I (like many others) have referred countless people to come join the company. I loved my job, I felt valued, and I have made lifelong friends. I'll always look back on this place as positive for the vast majority of my tenure. Very sadly, it's difficult to put into words exactly how much all of this changed after our acquisition by Apollo.","The ratings trends since summer of 2017 say it all. After the PE buyout, we have been faced with massive layoffs, one round after the other. Each time we'd be assured we'd made the necessary cuts, only to be faced with another one a few months later. There was no transparency in how large the cuts had been, or how large they'd be the next time. This led to an overwhelming amount of voluntary attrition as well. I can say, quite honestly, that I know exactly TWO people in the organization who are not actively looking for work. Morale and culture are absolutely non-existent.

Our developers are leaving in spades, leaving no one to build or maintain anything. Our sales group is at 40% of what it was this time last year. The majority of the people on the product side have also jumped ship. So, to be clear - we are rapidly approaching a point where we will have no one building solutions, no one providing guidance or a roadmap for these solutions, and no one to sell the solutions. And that's not even touching the turnover in PM / Fulfillment / Success. So guess what - there will also be no one to implement or support any of the solutions. 

I continue to be baffled that no one seems concerned about the fact that well over a hundred people now voluntarily turn over each month, and with zero innovation or vision it's pretty clear that Apollo's goal is not to provide capital to fund our future, as we were all promised. I'm not even sure what the goal is, at this point. To phase out our SaaS products that are the most profitable and somehow attempt to compete in the online job advertising space that was commodified years ago and is currently owned by Indeed? Up until Google or Facebook begins doing it better than them? In what reality can we compete at scale with these guys?"

Here why they probably left (since there were so few layoffs in engineering):

-Horrible Work environment up to and after the buyout
-Waves of engineers, leaving in groups of 10-20 within months then weeks then days of each other
-Lack of promotions 
-Lack of concern of upper management (and some lower management)
-Legacy code that isn't allowed to be cleaned up, instead new stuff is just grafted on like some monster

So many engineers have left due to mismanagement, a demoralizing work environment, and removal of benefits such as promotions, pay raises, bonuses, and monthly 401k matching that the current work environment consists of overworked and stressed out software engineers unable to turn around legacy products in desperate need of modernization.

Do not count on a stable job given Apollo’s likely goal to sale off the company. Please research Apollo Global Management before working here."

- Yes culture has changed drastically, but the core people have not. They still value there employee's and wants what is best for them, even under Apollo's leadership. 

- Yes, the budget was cut and we went through a whole round of layoff (which was not much for Site Tech). But if you ask, leadership will tell you at least what to expect. Maybe not everything, but you have enough to prepare for what is next to come.

- I still have my full range of creative coding that I can bring to the table each week and problem solve real world problems and add more for other teams. I value this more then anything because I can be free with my code and improve it. 

- The employee benefits are still better then most companies out there. I know I looked.","- Over sensitive people. But that is to be expected for a company that is undergoing change.

Apollo came in and has transformed the culture in a way that every week, seems more and more heartless, demanding, and anxiety-driven as people are becoming more and more afraid of their job security.

I was so proud to call them my employer and now I'm filled with feelings of betrayal, anger and disappointment.  They still aren't telling us the truth and rather than giving us the respect and ability to start looking for new jobs, they're overworking the ones who are still employed and stringing us along to do the work until they're ready to let us go too.

That's right, we don't know how we're getting paid this year and the month is nearly over. CSO announced last summer that the comp plan would be completely re-done for 2018 which is fine. Our plans are annual and it is OK to expect changes especially with the new products we offer. But that has to be announced and should have been in 2017.  Most of the year-long contracts for 2018 were signed in Nov-Dec. '17 or Jan. '18 meaning we had no opportunity to ensure we'll be hitting whatever sales goals and requirements are set. The only thing we know is that it's a complete overhaul of how we were always paid until this year.

This is unacceptable. CB reps get a monthly commission, paid last day of month on prior month's sales. In six days, Jan will close and we are completely in the dark on how we're getting paid.

Even if you are doing everything you needed to (with the crappy accounts you are given), you better make  sure you hit your dials and your talk time or else, you are now a failure. In result, you are getting put on plan. Most, if not all, of these metrics are completely insane and everyone still knows that upper management pulls them out of nowhere. Gets me to my next point: THE “LEADERS”!! These leaders (managers, directors, vps included) that are running the different Sales zones (minus Brandon Casteel) bring ZERO value to their teams. NONE of them have ever done ANYTHING they are asking the reps to do besides maybe sell jobs postings back in the day when that’s all CB offered. They have never shown the reps how they would sell new CB software products / shown an actual pitch whether role play or live with a client or were ever held accountable for the crazy metrics they are putting in place. In addition, it is pretty comical when it comes to the people these leaders would just hand over titles to. It doesn’t matter what kind of effort you put in year after year (even with the unrealistic quotas), be in the top 20% company wide and the next thing you know, someone who has been with the company for less than a year, has never been a sales rep, gets handed a sales title HIGHER than you and is now making more money than you. The best part about this is, these people getting handed these roles have not earned anything. AT ALL. EVER! What a joke. Honestly, the only reason I am writing this is to save people possibly looking to work for CB. Don’t waste your time.

Since then, there has been zero outreach to employees to learn their concerns or struggles. They have gone through SEVERAL rounds of layoffs without creating a plan to fill the gaps left behind from losing those roles. The remaining workers have had an increased load (without an increase in pay). On the contrary, they are taking away benefits - for example, the removed summer hours in 2017, they recently they switched the 401k provider from ADP to Empower (which has higher management fees for employees), and the 3% employer match is now paid out at the end of the calendar year, instead of by pay period - meaning if you lose your job or quit, you lose the employer match for the entire year AND you don't receive the interest over the course of the year.

Apollo management took over and quickly turned an amazing company with an amazing work culture to zilch.  They quickly got rid of most of the senior leadership and brought in some ruthless cronies who are only concerned about the bottom line dollar. Good part some of the old people are still there , though not for too long. People dont matter to these people . They have reduced benefits to nothing.

556,CareerBuilder,Acquisition Has Ruined This Workplace,2018-01-14,1.0,Software Engineer,Really some great people here.  The culture of good attitude has somehow mostly survived the recent problems.,"Where to begin.  The company was acquired several months ago and there has been no transparency in the changes that have come down.  In fact, there has been deliberate understatement and falsehoods regarding changes.  
After a round of layoffs in late 2017 we were told multiple times -- including the CEO during a townhall -- that we were all set for 2018.  Two weeks into 2018, another 1% reduction to our 3,000 person workforce.  Just as in late 2017, with zero notice or planning regarding the tasks those employees performed.  
     The current C-level execs are corporate shill replacements for our formed executives who were held in high regard by nearly everyone.  The only interactions with the new CIO have been him chiding the company for not making enough money.  Every question he answers is pure corporate-speak.  He essentially tells us there needs to be more internal competition for resources and we will be doing more work for the same amount of money.  However, prior to the acquisition CB was basically debt free and still profitable.  Our growth targets were not being met but we were still making money.
     This company is in the midst of the typically acquisition strategy.  Saddle the company with debt and extract as much profit as possible.  The new leadership was clearly chosen from the ranks of Apollo companies and have zero traits that the workforce admires."

The company is gearing up for a fourth round of (secretive) layoffs THIS YEAR, and are looking for any excuse to cut talent despite their history or performance with the company.

There also used to be a reasonable work/life balance for most employees and decent extras like half-day-Fridays in the summer, volunteer days, tuition reimbursement, bagels/beer/free lunches.","Sadly this list is growing longer by the day. Revenue has been stagnant for the last several years and the parent company sold controlling ownership to Apollo Group, one of the world's largest PE firms that focuses on Leveraged Buyouts and Distressed Assets. As a result, 4% of the workforce was laid off and this comes on the heels of massive voluntary attrition which lead to many teams being very understaffed. Many of the benefits that people once enjoyed are gone and others will most likely be trimmed to cut costs. 

This all happened because the company could not decide the direction it wanted to take between an advertising company and a software company. The winds constantly changed directions and Sales was forced to sell half-baked products that did not integrate or perform as they should. 

Additionally the company grew through acquisition, but did a terrible job of integrating these new companies, often leaving former leadership in place, many of which poisoned the well regarding CareerBuilder. This all lead to one company acting like five, with no real strategy to move forward, and customers noticed.

Finally, while CareerBuilder believes itself to be a technology company, it is not. Most of the tech is antiquated and requires daily deployments to fix bugs and keep the beast alive. The product teams have not created a new product in house in years (everything new was through acquisition) and the existing products have fallen to mid-tier at best. Updates to products were built using waterfall development methodology that took months or years to bring ideas to fruition. 

This is a SALES company, first and foremost and they make the decisions. Every decision that is made is down through the lens of Sales and all other departments are at their mercy. Even ""Solution Architect"" groups are really just sales teams and are just another voice to jam the flavor of the month down customers throat, regardless of what they want, need or can integrate with their existing technology vendors."

If you blow out your quota and get into accelerators, then you can reach $1M. Solid benefits.","Company's value proposition to the market is gone. The competition caught up in 2013 and has since lapped them so many times that it's now embarrassing. The effort to diversify their revenue stream from advertising into software has been a joke and that's being nice about it. The software straight up doesn't work. Leadership has reps selling this as the end all solution but won't even show the reps (much less the clients) a full demo of the product (usually just screen shots) and the reason why is it's never fully built!! Recently the new HCM/Ben Admin software was sold by a teammate of mine only to find out after that its only now in Alpha testing!!! How can you push reps to sell a product that's not even in Beta testing?!?! This is how all new products are rolled out. What happens is you sell it, client is mad that it doesn't work, then you have to protect that revenue the following year and sell that client more products but the problem is the client won't buy anything else and will likely buy much less than the previous year which murders your ability to even hit quota. 

There have been a few reps who've walked into a perfect situation within their accounts where a solution was needed immediately and they were there at the right place at the right time. One rep in particular made in excess of $2M in 2016. However this isn't a repeatable situation but leadership acts like it is and gets mad at reps for not doing the same. It's purely delusional. 

Reps are leaving voluntarily in droves. In my office we went from 20 reps to 7 inside of a year. In the month of June alone my team said goodbye to 4 reps. That's 1 per week!! People don't leave good companies in mass like this unless the ship is sinking and it is most certainly a sinking ship. 

No clear direction, products don't work, sales process is jacked up, reps are the only ones that carry the stress, next to zero help on anything and everything, executive leadership is so arrogant that they are oblivious to what is really going on in the meetings with clients. Our clients DO NOT have to have CB anymore and with our recent track record of poor performance, it's becoming impossible to sell."

There are always new things happening and new challenges to solve. Employees are for the most part treated well and their voices heard. There is a concerted effort to keep everyone happy and satisfied with their job.",Sometime in 2016 the overall quality of engineers severely went down. There was a mass exodus of engineers and with the advent of the acquisition looming a hiring freeze was enacted that severely crippled all the engineering efforts. The timing could not have been worse as the transition from an advertisement company to a software company was reaching its most critical stages. I wish I could say that I worked on failed products but the reality is I worked on products that weren't even used. The company has had an incredibly difficult time figuring out what it is and how to succeed in the complex software market. I have worked on successful initiatives but the time spent on initiative that never gained traction has far out numbered the former. It also doesn't help that the product team is severely detached from the more complex and harder to understand products. Either there was too big of a reliance on key players to move the product forward or there has been a massive communication gap between tech and product for years. Either way the two departments are horribly at odds with each other instead of being in sync and helping solve user problems. The company is also plagued heavily by senseless politics; things like retaining quality engineers and dismissing poorly performing engineers are riddled with the politics of head count and how it gets distributed across the department. There are specialists that drive quality work but the majority of the initiatives are performed by generalists and that's the overall shift of the company is towards generalist engineers.

Sales culture - This place is basically a frat house. Sales people are only focused on selling and happy hours. They rarely care about the client needs and push their agenda/whatever products management decide to focus on that week. 

Management - The leadership is completely inept and incapable of leading the transition from a job board to a software company.

My first inside sales manager was incredible!","I worked at CB for about 2 years; I worked as an Inside Sales Rep for 1 year, then I was promoted to Account Executive for 7 months and then promoted again to Senior Account Executive for 3 months and I quit my job due to the below frustrations.

CB tends to promote high-achieving sellers to management without proper leadership training in place, so many managers do not know how to lead well. I found that several of my managers were passive-aggressive and unprofessional. One of my managers had several complaints to HR (including one from me) and was very verbally abusive, but this person was demoted from their position as manager as a result, so I did feel that the company responded to our concerns eventually.

Overall, I would say this company engenders a boys club culture, albeit inadvertently. There are many men and women in sales roles, but the upper management levels are male dominated. Once, on a company-wide call with the Chief Sales Officer the CSO actually told people ""not to cheat on their wives"" at the upcoming holiday party. This was incredibly unprofessional and incredibly telling about the social culture at the company. 

High performing salespeople who sexually harass their coworkers are allowed a ""pass"" due to their numbers. I do not think this is a good place for women to work. As a woman who worked here, I felt condescended to by many my male coworkers and received many unwanted advances from coworkers over and over again. Managers saw this happen and did nothing to stop it. The social scene is heavy on drinking, so be careful if you work there and go out with coworkers. I once had to take a fellow coworker to the emergency room for alcohol poisoning after one of the CB holiday parties.

I do not think the products offered are being sold at the right price point and I do not think the infrastructure was there for the SaaS offerings. The company transitioned from ad sales to software sales very quickly and is still reeling from that change. It's not all bad, but I think they are still experiencing a lot of growing pains, so you have to be very nimble and roll with the punches."

I though old VP did not listen enough, but new VP is not listening either, however, he pretends he does. Same people are promoted every time and employers are not valued. Fair enough, changes all the time, changes happen to improve a place. But management is very bad, except for the current Manager of Greece, she is amazing and is not getting enough credit for the amazing management skills she has. 

If you want a career opportunity, sure go for it, but  you will need to move on soon as there are very little room for growth and sometimes it feels like you are in a nursery. 

Pay has improved a little, but compared to other companies, it is very low, and even though this has improved, when raised to VP he will tell you this is not his priority. 

Good luck, but if I were you I would stay away. I am looking for work just now."

Team leads told employees not to report discrimination and offensive marketing tactics to management because ""you'll make enemies"". You can see the offensive marketing videos on their youtube channel with gratuitous sexual content and jokes about harassing women. Particularly check out the one that has Selena Gomez in the title for what they thought was appropriate to release as an HR investigation was supposedly going on.

The pace of work was excruciatingly slow. 

Other teams would say publicly in meetings that they wanted to work on projects together, but would send you nasty emails when you contacted them to move forward on it. 

HR says they can't do anything unless multiple people complain, despite having documented evidence of multiple people complaining."

I have a lot of friends still there, and apparently it's just gotten worse. I actually left to go to a competitor, and I can't tell you how many time my clients asked me ""so when is CareerBuilder going to go out of business?"" 

Once you leave a company like CB, you realize how bad of a reputation they actually have in the industry. It's not hard to see why - they woke up one day and decided to be a SaaS company, and have leaders who have never even sold SaaS. Their salespeople are trained to be incredibly shady, to discount stuff/give it away for next to nothing because reps are getting some type of spiff bonus at the time, etc. This is why they lose so much business, and why salespeople are like a revolving door. 

There's also a lot of really bad managers here who have no business managing reps. 6/7 reps on my team before I left deserved to be managers more than the moron leading us at the time. She was a successful rep when all she did was sell job postings and resume database, but in my experience, was completely worthless when it came to selling software. She played favorites (favored all the boys obviously), showed up to team events stoned out of her mind, and just generally behaved in an incredibly unprofessional manner.

It seems they get promoted if they stayed long enough until there was no one else qualified to promote to leadership.  Tons of turnover, manager transition is constant so it's difficult to trust and build a partnership with your leader.  Your manager will make or break your experience at the company and it's all luck of the draw because you will probably have 4 or 5 managers and 2 or 3 directors in your FIRST year.  If you come from an outside sales role I would not recommend this position to you.  The company is turning its outside sales team into inside transactional sellers which means you are expected to make a certain number of dials per day/week/month in addition to having a high level of talk time.  Your director will also walk the floor and suggest you stand while you dial even when the majority of the sales team does not have a stand-up  workstation which obviously can be challenging. This is not your typical software sales role although that's how the position is sold during interview.  Most managers will micromanage you and make you feel like you are back in grade school."

If you are a contractor there be very cautious and don't bank on getting hired full time. They seem to enjoy getting peoples hopes up, way up, then back out at the last minute.

His company update calls are embarrassing. He has the grammar and public speaking skills of an 8-year-old. I can only imagine what the clients must think when he shows up at a meeting.  

Head for zee hills and look somewhere else until there is a changing of the guard at the director and vp levels."

The people I knew who were very nice and understanding came out of the management program acting like the client support reps were the crappiest people on earth and that managers were gods! 

Client Support is incredibly flawed and lead by an incredibly flawed good ol' boy system. If you don't know someone's father,mother, brother, sister, cousin, or second cousin twice removed then you are nothing but a piece of trash as far as leadership is concerned. Yes they will make a bunch of empty promises and make you feel special but they are backstabbers. . Management is totally clueless with how to improve the workflow and just throws mindless ideas at the wall to see if it will stick without going through a proper testing phase. 

If the managers don't change their way of thinking or the actual mindset then this company does not have a chance on making it on their own."

They have a habit of not letting the natural sales cycle take place. The VBU (the division of CB the position is at) is mainly a approach/strategy beta testing ground for higher level sales positions within the company which can be painful when a strategy doesn't pan out. Too many activities that take away from selling time and when you are paid on commission that can be a big problem. A very unfair practice where you have to make up metrics missed from PTO (even sick days) or you are placed on plans leading to potential termination. Lastly, you are almost forced out of that division to take a promotion once you hit 12 software deals to the next role that makes considerable less money."

After 2 months, a new supervisor with no supervisory experience was brought in. A nice person, but obviously immature and absolutely terrible leadership skills.

Also the people that work at CareerBuilder tend to be young and up-in-coming sales professionals which offers a nice dynamic of you like working around people. If you hit your numbers and sell there premium products then their is high earning potential.,"It's an inside sales role so you will spend a majority of your time on the phone all day working towards weekly metrics.   Their primary sales initiative changes pretty regularly and can be difficult to keep up with, but it is generally focused on software sales.  Almost all efforts go into new business generation with little to no attention focused on client retention until the end of the sales cycle and time for contract renewal.  This can make it difficult to get renewals and minimize churn.  You'll have monthly quotas to hit on top of your weekly metrics you that you MUST maintain to avoid preemptive measures from management.  Most top talent will outgrow the role before they are eligible for promotion (which qualification for promotion elegibility changes in criteria just as frequently as their sales initiatives).  This can leave strategic, ambitious, and talented professionals feeling bored, locked-in, and unable to grow within the company.  Ultimately people within the company, especially their VBU roles are looked at as a replaceable commodity and are afforded very little respect by senior management.

If you hit your numbers and are savvy navigating internal politics, you can move up quickly in this organization.","Sales Managers: The company's fast-paced culture has put a middle management layer in place that is not prepared to manage software sales reps.   The sales managers were all successful selling job postings in previous roles, but have no background in SaaS sales.  It creates a lack of credibility in many cases, while turning some managers into micromanagers.  But I should note there are a few managers who are good...  Want to find out who's a good manager and who should be avoided?  During the interview process, ask the manager about their turnover rate. 

Lack of Consistency: Very little consistency from month to month, or even week to week.  One month we are told to put all of our focus on selling software, then the following month we are told to increase our focus on job postings.  Given the long sales cycle required for software, this approach is very counterproductive. It tells me the company isn't sure about its transition to a SaaS company and wants the best of both worlds.  Whatever the case, you get the sense that upper management is constantly sending down new directives to middle management based on changing winds.  

Work-Life Balance:   Careerbuilder has a few nice perks like half day Fridays in the summer and occasional happy hours, but when I am in the office I feel like I am chained to my desk. I feel a sense of guilt or ""big brother watching"" if I walk in a few minutes late.  The concept of ""disciplined freedom"" is just lip service. CB has created an environment where reps don't have a desire to go above and beyond for the company unless they see a direct benefit. You can see it play out at 5:00 each day, when everyone gets up and walks out at the exact same time.  Id rather work in an environment where I can get my work done in a manner that works best for me and my clients.

The daily dial and talk time requirement makes little sense if we are transitioning to a SaaS company.   But as mentioned earlier, management doesn't seem to know what we truly are.  So perhaps we should keep it for now. 

There is a real sense of frustration amongst many account execs at the Sr. and Major levels.  Many reps are looking to leave while new reps seem to come in and disappear after a few months.  The transition - or lack of transition - to a SaaS company is taking a real toll on everyone.  

Constant shifting of clients from rep to rep: This causes several major issues: 
1) good clients are very frustrated because they constantly have to deal with someone new who doesn't know their business. 
2) low spend and zero biller clients feel like they are being harassed by careerbuilder reps, and just when one rep gives up, another starts harassing them again.
3)   If you get an account that was managed well by the previous rep, you're in luck.  If you get an account where a previous rep burned a bridge, you're screwed.
4) Tenured reps become frustrated when accounts they've been working are given to someone else, then 3 months later they watch another rep get the credit (and bonus) for closing a deal they started working on a year prior. "

Excellent entry level sales training, work like balance is great, half-day fridays in the summer, annual trips for President's Club, young culture and lots of happy-hour related events. You can make $100K+ here at a very young age, but my fear is CB's best days are behind them.","Beginning of 2015 was almost 100% SaaS focused, and leadership basically changed their mind halfway through the year. SaaS Rollout has been a disaster. Executives cannot figure out how to grow AND sell SaaS units at the same time, and the ship has officially lost its rudder – which has led to a mass exodus of talented sales reps. Advertising and search products have been surpassed by competition and HR Software cannot make up for the lost revenue. Bottom line, our Chief Sales Officer recently compared us to Lyft – ya know, the car service that no one uses? I don't know about you, but I sure am motivated! 

Mixed Messaging: I truly believe if you put all the executives in different rooms and asked them the vision of CB they’d have different answers. Are you an advertising or software company? Because you’ve proven you can’t do both at the same time. 

Pay: Comp Plans revolves around SaaS Sales, though I’m encouraged NOT to sell it in an effort to maintain growth. Pay is lower than most SaaS companies – and the comp plan changes with the wind

Territory: SCATTERED, logistically this makes absolutely no sense and makes traveling a nightmare

Training: Managers whose only experience is selling job postings holding trainings on selling software is a joke. Hire managers / trainers who’ve actually SOLD software

Advertising: Still effective, but competition outperforming CB. Customers can get similar return for less $ elsewhere. 

Search: New advancements are too-little, too-late. CEO admitted “we went years without any innovation” What do you think LinkedIn was doing then? This is why you’re losing.  
Technology roll outs are a mess, forcing tech on customers who do not need it

It’s frustrating, because what was once an awesome place to work has reached its peak. You can make a career here, just know it is always changing with a major lack of direction from those steering the ship."

While the company is moving in a beneficial direction with huge upside potential, they have no idea how to get there. They have not made any new hires in regards to operations and that is where they are coming up short the most often.","Over the past 18 months, about 35% of the sales reps and leaders have left. Why is that? Well, in an effort to change as a company from an advertising focused company to a more SaaS company, CB has completely lost it's culture. While some of the middle and upper management is still there, they know nothing about software sales as they have been with CB for 7+ years and have never sold anything but job postings. With that said, there are unrealistic expectations in regards to everything sales related because none of the management overseeing the sales teams has ever done what they are asking their reps to do. This leads to a lot of unnecessary stress, an ever lowering morale within the company and a lot of resentment towards management. 

While I once loved working there and was proud to say I worked for CareerBuilder, I have never been more stressed out and demotivated. I am currently looking for a new opportunity and will be leaving as soon as I find one. So many good people have been pushed out or left due to the poor management that it is no longer a place anyone wants to be. With each person that leaves, I hear of more people that are on their way out. 

On top of that, there are so many new hires coming in that don't know anything about the core product set and are also trying to learn about that SaaS products that they are being set up to fail. Furthermore, because the managers really don't have a great grasp on how to sell software, they are tasking the reps with being on call trainers for the new hires which is getting in the way of getting anything else done. This is also in addition to the fact that the support staff knows very little about what they are doing as well, so the reps are asked to be Project Managers, Implementation Consultants, Integration Specialists and more when they are supposed to be focused on sales."

Great location in the loop. 

Good Training","I have been here over three years and WOW have things changed. What once was a really fun company is now a thing of the past. I find myself coming home every day in a worse attitude. This place drains the life out of me and I now hate waking up in the morning. 

It is a very hard place to work. Our products/solutions are very intricate and requires unbelievable amount of time and energy to learn about it (integration, data mining, workflow analysis, and so much more). What makes it worse is that we get such ridiculously little support, that learning about all of this is all up to you. I spend more time trying to find answers to questions then working with actual clients, and let me tell you THERE ARE ALWAYS PROBLEMS.

Our products are great in theory, but they are soooo overpriced and always have bugs. Now when I sell a tech deal, I get bummed out thinking of all potential problems that I am going to have with implementation in the near future. There are so many great recruiting tools out there that are way better than the ones we provide. We are so full of ourselves.   

Because we are losing market share, the company transitioned into a software company. This transition is unbelievable rocky, with a huge potential of failure. The sales reps are caught in the cross hairs. Accounts are being moved around, we are product pushing, new divisions are being created, and more has led to complete chaos. This has caused our revenue to take huge hits and we are losing customers. Reps have even harder Quota's to hit on top of this so no one is making the money that they thought they would. Moral is just so low. 

We also pretend to have a Work Life Balance, but that is such a smoke screen. It is anything but that. Half day Fridays in the summer – HA! “Hit your unobtainable quota’s and metrics, then you can go home”, all while the managers are at home or at a golf event.

Careerbuilder pretends to be that amazing company, but we are just as shady as the next. 

Let's be honest, there are a million places that are worse than CB, but right now I would totally steer clear. Wait at least two years before you come aboard to see if they get their stuff figured out."

The company has a tendency to promote unqualified people to hold management positions from within the company.  Just because someone is good at their job does not mean they can lead others.  They also do not train managers on how to manage people.  My manager forced me to take a training while out of the office for a  religious ceremony, this infringed on my rights as a US citizen.

young/fun environment","The company is transitioning a lot. In turn they are treating their employees awfully and are trying to ""trim the fat"" it's clear they have no idea what they are doing with this new change and we are all just lab rats at this point. A year ago I would have suggested this company to everyone but now I would not encourage any one to work here."
912,CareerBuilder,Incredibly broken company,2015-06-08,1.0,Client Support Specialist,"Benefits are fairly good
No weekends","- Very poor hourly pay, inflated/misconstrued salaries as they factor in quarterly bonuses to your offer that are very hard to get the full amount

- Management only cares about quantity, not quality.  Many people know how to play the system and do very little work - while those of us who put in effort and did quality work usually go unnoticed. 

- Many of benefits that are touted of this company are not really applicable to this role/department...i.e. ""Disciplined freedom"" is not really a perk of this role if you want to do your job properly.  Half day Fridays during Summer are not existent as they make us split 1 hour over multiple days instead.  ""we are customer service so we always have to be available when other teams are having fun""

- Huge turnover in this role and low staffing has created exponentially more work for us.  Our team has lost a SIGNIFICANT amount of people this month and many more are planning on leaving by month end due to the reasons here.

- Poor management, they just don't understand how to manage a customer service operation.  They all put in as little effort as possible to get by - I have heard MULTIPLE managers on multiple occasions make comments about ""just trying to get by and get a paycheck"" or ""im not paid enough to do that or to care"" this just carries down to your employees..

- Incredibly inefficient systems and process that create TONS more work for everyone and any kind of change/improvements are usually counter productive and very slow to roll out.  For a software company, they are very slow to develop internal systems and rely too much on third party softwares (Salesforce, Fuze, ADP)

- VERY poor communication between other teams - it's often times like we are enemies when we communicate which is regularly.  Teams hate/dislike other teams and cause a lot of unnecessary frustration and create extra work.  We are expected to treat everyone based on company culture/guidelines - yet other teams do not have to abide by these same rules.  Our department get's walked over/taken advantage of by sales teams on a regular basis.

- New phone system where every employee can see what every other employee is doing, whether they are in the phone queue as they should be, who they are talking to, how many calls they've taken has created even more drama and people not caring anymore about doing a good job

- Upper management asks for surveys and how to make our job/roles better - but no action is ever seen that actually helps.

Overall, if anyone is considering a position with this company, I would recommend you to look elsewhere.  There is a reason our team and others are losing people by the week.  The Glassdoor rating for this company is grossly inflated by teams like sales and development that do get paid a little better and receive full company benefits.  For customer service roles, I honestly believe the rating should be <3.0 due to the above"

The benefits are very generous, similar to other dot com/IT companies.   The culture is still good  overall (it used to be awesome!)  Culture varies widely based on who you report to and what department you are in, so the folks in Sales have it a bit tougher because they have a lot of demands, and sales is more ""traditional corporate"" whereas IT and other support functions are more ""hippie"" and casual.  So whether it's a plus or not depends upon your perspective and what you like.  CB has a long history of caring about employees, even during the 2009 lay offs everyone (who wasn't let go) came together as a team and really pulled through - leaders care about employee well being, I can't stress this enough.   The company also really encourages creativity and idea generation, with lots of opportunities to be rewarded for new ideas.  If you have ideas how to improve products or come up with new ideas for revenue generation, there are no limits to your opportunities to share ideas (and be rewarded for sharing).  Work life balance is really good, I never saw people burned out from overwork.

First  I have to say that the culture has changed dramatically over time, not for the better.  It was sort of a family at the beginning and everyone helped each other.  That has since shifted to now being political and ""looking good"" is more important than being honest (candor is ironically one of the company core values).   There are lots of reasons why this has happened, but suffice it to say that the company has reached the bureaucratic, maturity stage in its lifecycle in my opinion.  The result is that employees feel self-conscious and feel like the environment is unstable, in a way that never used to be.  Also, new product development needed!!!

The company still heavily pushes itself as a 'Sales' type of organization, even though they are pushing software advances very hard. This means that salaries for IT related jobs are below normal.

-- Great domestic travel opportunities to visit customers.
-- The incentives and perks are ok.
-- Worked with some fun people.","-- 1st year salary at 100% of quota is about 65-70k.......not the 98K that you are told by the recruiter/management. 
-- CareerBuilder really needs to take a step back and look at their management base, as immaturity runs rampant throughout the middle - senior level sales managers.
-- If you are not in the CB Clique.... Don't bother. I witnessed mediocre sales reps who sucked up to the Sales Director and move from sales...to management...back to sales, because they ""felt"" like it and all the while leaving their sales team struggling without leadership.
-- Training consisted of learning over 100 different products in the matter of a 3 day course that begins on your first day of work. 
-- Ridiculous incremental quotas. You must sell the ""Flavor of the Week"" as opposed to something that the customer actually wants or needs. 
-- Revolving door for sales reps. Customers definitely don't expect you to be their rep for very long.... And that makes it hard to build trust and a relationship."

Great suite of products to services clients.,"Contrary to the American CEO, the Canadian office has no direction or leadership. Senior management pushes reps to work extended hours and micromanages more than anything. 

The revolving door that was witnessed in my tenure is ludicrous. Your job is continuously dangled infront of you. No security in any way. 

No real motivation from management."
1042,CareerBuilder,"Good company, but...",2014-04-19,2.0,Major Account Executive,"Abundant resources, very good training and product offerings.","A boys club atmosphere, very political and fraternal.  If you attended WVU you are in with the clan, if not, you are an outsider.  Un-realistic sales goals and overall expectations regarding time frame for closed deals.  Micro managing to the hilt.  VERY high turnover creates difficult climate with your named accounts. Clients don't expect you to be their rep very long so it makes it very hard to build trust.  Clients DO NOT come first.  It's all about revenue generation.  Sometimes in dis-honest ways.  Management does not provide you the time to build the trust and create a collaborative relationship.  I was out the door at YTD 93 % quota and with multiple active all jobs trials.  Management never gave me the chance to convert the deals.  They didn't want to hear about delays on the client side.  Very cut-throat, stressful atmosphere.  The summer hours and work life balance are a joke!  Perhaps this benefit is the case if you are not on quota.  I worked 60-70 hour weeks, worked weekend and did not take a vacation during my time there.  A lot more to say, but my time is worth more to me than to rant."

The healthcare benefits, college, and transit programs were top notch.  Having a chance to have a place in the world where you get to put people back to work is truly rewarding.

The T1, T2 and T3 training is truly unmatched by any other sales group","You will enter a sales role in which the true value of selling what a client wants is thrown out the door and be forced and or rewarded to sell products that the executive team wants you to sell.  The flavor of the month will at times switch to flavor or the day, which is all micro managed by your manager who has the ability to listen to every phone call you make.

The comp plan is very hard to get used to if you have any financial responsibilities, but because everyone is under 27 years old CB (CareerBuilder) leverages that workforce who don't truly care about long term career plans or money.  As a slap in the face, CB will bring in a financial consultant to tell you how to manage a paycheck that is 50% less than what your industry competition is paying.  Yes, Monster will pay you $60k plus bonus when CB will only pay $30k plus bonus.  Linkedin, Simplyhired, Indeed and ADP will all pay almost double for a starting salary.

If you make it more than 9 months, the 4th quarter payout of the comp plan will finally pay what it needs to.  Each sales division is also set up differently.  Enterprise is set up on revenue so you get paid when your clients use the product..........thus you will force your clients to post jobs when they don't need to, with clever training seminars to tell you how to create that talk track.  

If you get a job, make sure you make your manager and every equal or greater manager in the company as your friend.  Nepatism is top of mind at this company."

1049,CareerBuilder,Trending The Wrong Direction,2014-04-01,3.0,Senior Account Executive,"- CareerBuilder truly is a great organization that employs some fantastic people.
- The bonus potential and rewards trip are excellent motivators 
- Benefits are top-notch (wellness reimbursement is an exceptionally nice perk)
- You will gain valuable knowledge that will allow you to excel in other roles","- Management. Hire people who actually know how to LEAD other people. Note: there is a big difference between management and leadership.
- To continue on this note, bullying and humiliating your salespeople will not make them more effective. A little positive reinforcement can go a long way.
- The blind devotion to becoming a SaaS organization has resulted in ridiculous product quotas in some groups. People's jobs are threatened not for lack of performance, but for failing to sell the product de jour in the way leadership wants you to sell it.
- Passing the buck. It's no secret that the support groups are not well paid. That being said, the people who (at least in theory) support the sales reps constantly shirk responsibility. It's always somebody else's problem with them.
-Training: In several business units, you are not provided with much in the way of training. Leadership is very good at telling reps what to do but not so much in terms of helping you develop the skills to do it.

If you are new to sales and are considering starting as an AE or SAE, save yourself the grief and just start in the Inside Sales Group. At least you'll receive the sales process training you need and the client interactions to make it stick."

- So many to list
- Compensation until you get to quota
- useless trainings (any reason to pull you off the floor)
- unrealistic quota expectations; growth in accounts should be expected however the CEO said it himself ""we lose as much as we grow""  So how about better pay for maintaining accounts and large bonuses for bring in new business
-  Better support for sales; its a mess right now.  We have to go through cues to get support for accounts, which takes time.  Then rather then getting what you need support has an agenda of stuff they need to complete in order for them to be compensated.

When we tell them that is why people are leaving, all they (bosses) ever say is, "" well if they are just leaving for money they wont be happy and they'll regret it. Well you know what.

There is also a lot of training available so you can grow your professional skills and abilities as much as you'd like.

The healthcare benefits are great.  They also offer a wellness benefit that CB will reimburse the employee $400 annually to spend on something fitness related.

There are team outings and happy hours and employee parties to help build teamwork and morale as well.  However, this is more of a small distraction from your day-to-day duties more than anything.","The amount of responsibility and workload you are expected to have for the money is not worth it.  You are consistently given new and different metrics that you are measured by.  A decent portion of your bonus is tied to the sales survey given to the sales reps you support. If a sales rep decides to give you a bad score for whatever reason your small bonus will suffer substantially.  

There is also a lot of favoritism present as well so be prepared for that.  If you want to play the game and jump through hoops then this might be a good opportunity for you.  However, the amount of extra responsibilities they want you to take on to get a promotion is generally not worth it.  Even when promoted to Senior CSS you will still be making around 40k with bonuses.  In order to make a decent livable wage you will need to be promoted several times within this department.  I would suggest using your experience at CB to find better money for similar work elsewhere within the first year or two.

If you are looking to get into sales this could be a good fit for you if you are willing to relocate.  However, if you want to stay in the Atlanta area there is a lot of red tape before being able to get promoted into sales."

The base salary is well below what you can make elsewhere and they recently deferred much of the bonuses until the latter part of the year.  From a business perspective I can respect why this was done but I believe this is going to result in significantly more turnover of top performing reps who have been with the company a long time.

1161,CareerBuilder,Positive Outlook that ended with Disappointment,2013-01-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"co-workers, valuable product offerings-ahead of competition, constant innovation, promote from within, good benefits","unrealistic expectations, stress-job is in jeopardy every day, difficult systems, confusing comp plan, lot of administrative work, moral decreased significantly"
1162,CareerBuilder,It's hard to complain about ANYTHING at CareerBuilder - they know how to take care of people.,2013-01-21,5.0,Data Scientist II,"CareerBuilder understands how to manage and keep their employees happy and consequently, hard working.  The 'pull' job structure ensures that micro-managing will never occur and that employees are given what they need in order to complete the tasks in front of them.  Never have I been told to 'wrap it up', give less than 100% or limit my hours on a project so that it can be completed before some artificial deadline.  In almost all cases, the work is complete when you say that it is.  Despite this seemingly slow philosophy, projects get accomplished at an astounding speed at CareerBuilder.  

The technology we use at CB is like no other place I've worked... we use virtual desktops for everything, the advantages being that we all have all the storage and processing power we could ever need and in the rare case we need more, all it takes is a call and IT can 'add' virtual storage/power instantly.  We see the same 'desktop' and files regardless of where and how we log in - whether it be in the office, from home, from our VDIs or laptop, even iPads and tablets; everything just works and the outstanding IT department is responsible for this.  

I'm overlooking quite a bit of the positives, but lastly I will discuss the benefits.  I'm not aware of any other private sector company that provides benefits as wonderful as CB's.  Beyond the standard UHC health insurance (of which the company pays +80% of), what makes CB stand out are all the contest opportunities that exist within the company.  Every quarter, for example, we have HackDay or Hack-a-thon where everyone is given a day to throw together an original idea that they believe can bring value to the company in some way, outside their day to day responsibilities.  A week later, we all present our ideas and the (usually top 3, sometimes more) winners are selected and given $10k and anywhere from 2 to 5 weeks to make their idea a reality.  That means they are completely free from their regular work and are focused on their personal project only.   Additionally, there are other contests, one which is annual and pays over $100k to the winner.  There is the Diamond Club contest each year that sends the top employees (as selected and voted on by management) to some enjoyable location for a week - all expenses paid.  This year it is Cabo San Lucas.  There are so many opportunities to prove yourself at CB, if you have the desire to do more than the minimum, you WILL be rewarded nicely in time.  

That's what it all comes down to, in my opinion.  CB is a place where passion thrives and is [more than appropriately] rewarded.  If you have that entrepreneur type work ethic and love what you do, CB gives you chance after chance to profit from it.  Further, they give you the chance to see your ideas realized, and in most cases, you retain the rights to your own ideas, as well!  How many other companies can say that?

Additionally, the company just spent a few million dollars renovating the Norcross office - we now have a beautiful new work space, break room (including top of the line ping pong table, pool table, foosball, arcade games, etc), all new furniture and gorgeous conference rooms loaded to the ceiling with technology.","The only con I really make [and it's less of a 'con' than a personal belief] is that I would like to interact with upper management with more regularity.  While I work closely with my boss every day, it's only once a month or so that I may actually have a meeting with his boss.  I think many of the projects we work on would be improved and ultimately completed faster if there was more interaction between management levels.  Aside from that, there's nothing else worth complaining about.  CB is full of excellent, hard working people with excellent leadership and it shows in my inability to find anything worth really complaining about."

I realized that this organization is a place where I'd like to build a career. My graduate degree will only help me get even further ahead here than I will through hard work and dedication.

A LOT of people who come to work for CareerBuilder are either fresh out of college or don't have a clear goal or career path (I'll be honest, that was me during my first go-round working at CB), and they find it very difficult to keep up with the demands of this job. I think this could go in the con section, since I feel that, to a point, the hiring managers don't really give those coming into the company a real idea of what is expected (you get more of that ""jump...how high"" talk in training). However, I think it has a lot to do with the fact that many people think sales is a cakewalk. It's not. You have to work extremely hard to ensure your current customers are doing well and have the help they need, and still get out there and hunt for new business. You get out of this job what you put into it; I put a lot into it, and I love it. I'm also succeeding.

Biggest pro: BENEFITS. CB spoils you like no tomorrow. We get reimbursed for an amount spent on wellness every year. Yup, you basically get paid to go to the gym. Full medical/dental/vision...sounds pretty generic, but you'd be surprised how many companies don't offer that anymore. And awards...you hit quota? You go on vacation. All expenses paid. It's almost too good to be true. It's true, though...I've seen it firsthand. It's almost ridiculous (but please don't take that good stuff away, Matt!).

Basically, if you work your tail off, you can make a LOT of money and be VERY successful with this company. You just have to want it.","The only real downside from my perspective is the ""ramp up"" structure in the VBU. At this juncture, new employees are ""setting"" appointments for veterans on their team. You lose a lot of what you learn in training about how to really sell the CB products by just setting for someone else.

Also, the compensation structure for that ramp up period is based on quantity over quality. Granted, the more practice you get, the better you get; however, you do sacrifice quality at a certain point when the bar is set too high on an activity side of things. It's a bell curve, and this ramp up strategy/compensation structure hasn't found the right point on the curve yet, which is a detriment to not only the employees trying to hit those ramp up numbers, but to management, who then expects those people to transition into a role where they are expected to show quality in all of their actions."

* Very flexible with scheduling, work/life balance
* Management team empowered us to make our own decisions 
* Learned a lot about the industry in a short time...great professional development
* Management Team is quite competent
*Competitive benefits","* The salary for non-sales people sucks across the board. Many on our operations team started as contractors, so they got the horrible CB salary, and none of the benefits. 
* Sometimes a bit of a ""high school"" like atmosphere, ""who you know"" is very important
* Sometimes a lack of communication between sales and operations, leading to project confusion."

1224,CareerBuilder,Fantastic workplace - salary disappointing,2012-01-16,4.0,Research Analyst/Consultant,"Leadership is great, the communication is very active and clear and the company seems to offer a lot of stuff to try and make its employees happy.",CareerBuilder pays well below market rate for many positions outside of sales.  It's a great company but the low pay makes it diffcult to stay for many years.  Some of the best employees leave because of low pay increases and low starting salary.
1225,CareerBuilder,"Terrible, A grinding machine that doesn't care about people.",2012-01-04,1.0,National Account Executive,"Salary was good, their actual product is pretty solid","management is terrible.  Basically two people make management. Top performers that often happen to fall into success by chance when a big account decides to move off of Monster to CB.   No real talent here, just luck.  The second is people that sleep around as this is rampant at the company from what I saw.  It all leads to management that is ill equipped to really manage and work towards sustained growth.  Just look at their numbers..."
1226,CareerBuilder,Technology experts,2011-12-30,3.0,,"Let me first make this clear that CareerBuilder is the only product of it's kind in the industry. 
- What ever I've learned so far in my career of 4-5 years is completely due to these guys.
- During these times, I worked with two direct teams; experience has been phenomenal with the  technology wizards.
- No tech teams in this industry has got the tech experts as careerBuilder has. 
- Excellent architecture.
- Openness in the culture.,Excellent guys to work with. 
- The kind of technical depth Norcross office people have is exceptional.
- Belief in lean philosophy; this has impressed me the most.
- has a great vision, and strives constantly to move towards that.

I'll always cherish all those days I've worked with you guys. Hats off to you guys.","This applies to Offshoring team only -
- Why doesn't the CareerBuilder has a direct say in the appraisals done at Bangalore office?
- There was no way till I was there; to identify performers from non-performers; everybody got the same hike every year. I also saw a lot of favoritism being involved in the India teams managers.

I don't see any cons with careerbuilder.com. Instead I would say that I would love it to be back with CaeerBuilder; but not at this moment. I want you guys to be more smarter in handling and involving yourself more at deeper levels with offshoring teams."
