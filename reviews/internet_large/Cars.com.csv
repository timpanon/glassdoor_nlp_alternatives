Upper management is EXTREMELY accessible and involved in a positive way in your normal work day and the whole company has a common drive for success. The amount of recognition and shoutouts people get for hard work here is remarkable and constant (and ins't forced). 

CARS did an amazing job with a fully virtual new hire onboarding and training experience. I have never stepped foot in the office once; however, I have been able to excel in the job so quickly and that is due to the training and the way that they have made work from home so natural. If you're looking for a good virtual work experience, this is the place - they've absolutely killed it!

From the moment I started working at CARS, there was already an open and ongoing conversation about what my next step would be. Management invests time and effort in your career development and wants you to succeed. Can't say enough good things!","Sometimes working with dealers can be a little disheartening, but if you take what you learn in training and keep a positive attitude, you truly can be successful and get good at the job."

The company truly cares about their employees and invests in them in every way they can. We were one of the first companies to start working from home when Covid hit, and are still working from home for the safety of all of our employees. 

Not to mention, understandably our pay got cut by 10% for a few months in the early on of the pandemic, and  they paid it back to us last month. This shows you how much they care about their people. 

There is a lot of support from leadership and direct managers. I work with some smart and humble people who are always ready to help.

It’s a solid crew across almost all sections of the various brands. And the office spaces are cutting edge and fun places to work within.,"Many of the key decision makers are ‘No’ first and the Cars platform and its support are all focused on pushing to ‘keep the site running’ as opposed to ‘keep moving the site forward’.

The technology of the Cars platform is incredibly antiquated and doesn’t allow for new ideas and new thoughts to become reality without a huge influx of $. The platform is one giant set of handcuffs that doesn’t allow for new ideas or new ways of thinking within the space.

The intersection of cultures between Cars and Dealer Inspire is palpable. These cultures should be integrated but for some reason, the two entities are allowed (and encouraged I might add) to be pitted against each other in competition. It’s awkward at best and extremely toxic at the worst."

2) Opportunities to learn. Working at Cars.com accelerated my career significantly. If you're hungry to learn and can work well with others, the ceiling is high.
3) Clearer strategy. Early on, strategy wasn't clear. In the last year or two, Cars.com became much clearer on their end goal to be a solutions provider for automotive dealerships.","Cars.com went through several ownership changes and went public during my tenure. This meant lots of executive leadership changes and lots of strategy changes. I personally feel like the company is in a much better place now, but that constant change can be hard for people.

The major issues stem from the fact that there was no tangible vision or strategy in place for several years. Things could change with the new Chief Strategy Officer, but only time will tell. 

There is a lot of lip service about developing employees, but that is impossible when people are cut or leave and never get replaced. No one has time to do their job let alone take time out to improve much needed skills. The HR team (I'm sorry, PXT) makes promises they can't keep and when they do get something done it suddenly becomes urgent for everyone else. Quit hiding behind ""agile"" and say we don't know how to pivot.

Cars used to have a relaxed atmosphere where passionate people came together to do great work and have fun. Now the general atmosphere is cloaked in fear an unease about the future.

- The work loads of AM’s aren’t evenly distributed. 
- There are Am’s who have reps that barley reach out to them, but then there’s markets that reps reach out extremely proactively. 
- The metrics within the department don’t measure the true success of an AM or help show that you’re helping grow the company. It’s more of a justification to say you’re doing some type of work while at work. 
- It’s easy to not do much during the day and get away with it. 
- The direction of the department is very unclear. Every week we were pivoting in a different direction that wasn’t always clear. Often times you would be asked to complete task with little knowledge/training of how to successfully complete the task. 
- There are a lot of politics within the department, and people who actually work hard don’t always get shown appreciation for their hard work until they’re about to leave the company. 
- You might be told there are career advancement opportunities, but that means going to sales. About 1 out of every 20 AM might make it out of the AM department to a different department other than sales. 
- There are senior AM’s, but they do the same thing if not less than what regular AM’s do. You won’t be gaining any new skills as a senior AM, it’s more of a title to put on your resume. 
- The main experience I received while at Cars in the AM department was how to work Salesforce and build minor reports. 
- Task that are expected of you are very simple and it gets old when you’re continuously completing simple task everyday when you know you’re capable of achieving more. 
- You’re constantly told that the company has a great future. After a couple of years of hearing the same thing, you start to not believe anything that you’re being told anymore because nothing changes."

The work/life balance and time-off benefits were really nice. 

There have been some recent hires—people who had careers at other companies before moving to Cars.com—that really seem like they know what they're doing.","I can't emphasize enough just how much of a chasm exists between the upper management and frontline employees.  The C-level has twisted themselves into knots in an attempt to rationalize away company-wide poor engagement as anything other than their own actions.

The online automotive space—honestly, the internet as a whole—has changed and is changing too fast for anyone in the company to really get. Cars.com was founded by newspaper people, and it is a media company at heart. The .com in the name is an accident. You'll spend a lot of time working on products that would've been nice when they were initially pitched three years ago but were shelved due to internal turf battles between product, technology, marketing, and sales. 

Some directors are absolutely amazing and want to help you be the best employee/person that you can be. Some directors absolutely want to be VPs and will undermine your work in a heartbeat if they think it can get them recognition.

It didn't used to be, but very much now is set up as a call center where you will make X amount of dials a day, with X amount of talk time, this is non-negotiable. You will learn basic sales 101 that you can take to another organization or move into a field sales role within Cars.com, if you're willing to relocate and the field decides to hire internally.","Lack of Training and Development: 
This spans the organization, but as it relates to the inside sales team - employees looking to grow and move up are often asked to take on additional projects outside of their actual work in order to build their brand and help the team with little to no acknowledgement and in most cases no reward, other than the potential that one day there may be an opening. Management often pits individuals against each other in this capacity, fighting for promotions that don't actually exist. It is a continuous cycle of leadership dangling a carrot to keep your buy in with no real results or change. The Management team does have a lot of talent, and I believe, the right intentions but have been given little to no resources or training to actually make a difference. 

Lack of Diversity: 
This is a real problem on the inside sales team, and as people leave and leadership hires new talent, this gets worse. The team is mostly comprised of young bros, very few women, less people of color, and even less inclusion for the LGBT community.

Compensation:
Across the board, Cars.com pays well under the industry average. The base is low and on the sales team you will be praised for closing deals but are lucky to see any of the validation in your commission checks due to the comissionion structure.

Using Shame as a Motivator:
It was not always like this but in my last year with the company this became the driving force for the leadership team. You would be shamed into staying late, shamed for asking  questions, and worse, shamed when you tried to provide feedback and create an open dialogue about the culture of the team."
172,Cars.com,Loved my Job at Cars,2018-06-05,4.0,Inside Digital Senior Media Representative,"I want to thank Cars.com for giving me my first job on the corporate level. I learned so much from this job. I was promoted a few times, and loved most of the people I met there. The culture is great but young minded. Make sure you enjoy the 'young culture"" before applying. The new office space is beautiful and they really thought of everything. Since going public the culture took a bit of a hit, but that is expected from a public company. I definitely miss the company as well as the people I worked with there. I can't recommend this company enough.","Growing pains from going public, too many managers and red tape to get promoted, some departments run in cliques, some a managed with the ""good ole boy"" mentality.

However, the issues employees are upset about stem from CET decisions. CEO was asked if he read Glassdoor reviews. He responded by saying he doesnt read glassdoor reviews. He then quoted Doug Collins and compared reviews from current and former employees to outside media...

-CET talks about looking for inefficiencies, yet looks over biggest inefficiency...husky sales team. It is constantly asked why the sales team is so big and there is no legitimate answer...Sales is placed on a pedestal and yet revenue has been stagnant...

-The company just is not innovative. Behind in SEO, worried about customers wants instead of focusing on  features CONSUMERS want.

-Compensation is uneven. Most employees are severely underpaid and are finally offered market average wages when threatening to leave.

The move of tech under the Product org was nothing short of disastrous, as it meant no one was really focusing on tech, and anything not product-focused was ignored at best, decimated at worst. The recent RIF - one of the ugliest, most political acts I witnessed there - nuked the agile team and gutted central IT so badly they went limping off to Finance where ostensibly they'll get some actual care and feeding. But the damage is done, and now that the company is public the constant purging will just get easier and more tempting. Other org moves like splitting the CRM team and shoving Ops under Sales are bizarre, misguided exercises that will not help the company long term. 

Sadly, there's few left in power who can fix the mess - HR is dysfunctional, adrift since their embarrassing rebrand a few years back, and is part of the problem so can't be looked to for solutions  (talking diversity while allowing a significant swath of women in tech to get sent packing is only one of their many sins over the past few years).

(But everything's fine, really.) The ""leaders"" that are still here after multiple rounds of layoffs are lame bobblehead types who have no idea how to move things forward.

Unless you can make it to being the favorite of a manager/director, do NOT expect your hard work to go noticed or dare express where you'd like to move UP to in the company. 

I would highly advise anyone looking for a job at Cars.com to avoid applying for a Digital Ad Production Specialist position, unless you're really hard-pressed for a job.  You will be a Data Entry lackey.  You won't be able to skill build for another position in the company without outside courses.   Even then, you will be passed up for a promotion to another department because DAPS doesn't work with a certain tool or software application, even if you know it already.  

Also, the coddling of incompetent Salespeople will be enough to drive you away.  What's so hard about signing a contract or filling out an enrollment form?

Benefits are on par with others in the area, nothing special though. It’s a good place to start your career.","The PXT (People Experience Team/Human Resources) team is one of the worst in Chicago. The so-called Business Partners will only correspond with Directors and above while avoiding everyone else.  What kind of HR team does not want to talk with people?  Furthermore, confidential information is leaked all the time and when you bring this up they state an investigation into this matter is a lot of work.   

The Operations (call center, fulfillment, account management, etc..) department has been blown up and turn it into a support sales ONLY model to drive revenue.  

Many of the Product owners have no experience and as a result we’re making silly mistakes that cost the company revenue on a daily basis. Cars has no active CTO which is vital for an origination this size and it’s clear that Tech’s only function is to support Product maybe that’s why most tech staff is leaving at a record pace.   

Sales controls the company and are untouchable! Most of the sales departments have no respect for others in the company and will manipulate anyone to get what they want to hit personal goals. In addition, we have roll-out plans for products that calls for sales to pitch a certain number of units and yet reps will not do it. Are you telling me there is not a single customer in your area that might be interested in a new product to help them?  Even a ""no"" would help us drive change. 

Leadership has not communicated an action plan around these Glassdoor reviews in years so it seems the strategy is to just avoid it and hope they go away.    

The CEO recently got many of us together in the lunchroom to talk about the issues with the company and a few old school employees at my table were not interested which was disappointing….maybe that is why nothing ever changes!   Also if your tight with the CEO or CRO your untouchable no matter your performance . 

The employee review process changes every quarter and your manager is suppose to have a conversation with you each month to talk about your performance, yet the majority of managers do not including VP’s and CET (Cars Executive Team). 

Compensation is not close to market or based on experience regardless what HR says.  

The culture is different depending on what floor you work on which is sad for such a small organization.   "

205,Cars.com,"A decent place to start, not where you want to end up",2017-11-20,2.0,Analyst,"1) Great people/culture - Hands down the best quality of the company. I could wear a hoodie, jeans, and sneakers to work every day if I wanted to. I genuinely enjoyed the presence of 90% of my coworkers and a lot of my work friends became real world friends. There was an odd abundance of fledgling comedic improvisors working there, not really a pro or a con, just a thing. 

Besides the people I worked with directly, the executives were pretty laid back and managers/directors seem to be qualified (most of the time). There was a certain sense of humor permeating the atmosphere and it was a pretty consistently positive work environment. In my experience, management didn't scrutinize the way you spent your time as long as you were performing.

2) Good benefits - from commuter benefits, to good insurance, to drinks and snacks to cheap gym membership, the bonus perks are solid. You'll probably take home a lot of Cars.com ""swag"" during your time there, e.g. random cheap merchandise with the logo printed on it

3) They'll show you a good time - being in entry-level departments, there were lots of parties and other events that were thrown for us on a semi-regular basis, which was cool and appreciated. I'm sure those were intended primarily to encourage complacency with our below-market-value salaries and frustratingly convoluted job requirements, but, hey, free beer is free beer.

4) You can get your foot in the door - I was able to go from Customer Service to a data-oriented technical role in a few-year timespan","(not in any particular order, obviously all based on personal experience)

1) It seems like they try to come off as a ""cool"" corporation, but it's just corny and disingenuous

The Human Resources department rebranded itself as the ""People Xperience Team"" not too long ago - ...wait, what? Departments have brands now? That phrase doesn't make any sense, all three words are ambiguous, and the Xtreme spelling is completely unnecessary. Is that an after-school club or something? How old is your target audience?

A lot of stuff didn't make sense there.

2) Our CEO routinely called us a tech company. Cars.com is not a tech company, they are a media company that publishes advertisers using a website, as opposed to some other medium. 

They focus greatly on the front end of the site, which is awesome, buuuuut in my experience the back end systems comprised one big frightening disaster, a house of cards on the verge of collapse.

Just, trust me on this. I can't go into any real detail, but, I'd spent several years with our back end tools and.... ugh. Garbage. Everything was broken all the time. Good riddance. I didn't leave because I wanted (primarily) to make more money, I left because I burned out from constantly having to find workarounds to system errors, all in the process of completing job tasks. It was otherwise such an enjoyable place to work that I put up with it, but, everyone has their breaking point.

I guess hearing the CEO drop the phrase ""tech company"" left and right was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back for me. He should try sitting where I have, his terminology might change. 

3) They talk a lot about valuing people, but don't seem to care more or less than any other corporation. 

As I'm sure you've seen in the other reviews for this place, you won't make as much at Cars as you could doing the same job elsewhere.

HR would refute this, sure, but the employees are no strangers to this concept. It was all a part of the package, in my mind; good insurance + low expectations + laid back culture = comparatively lower salary (or that's how I would justify it to myself; it's not like it was a rule of thumb)

It was best used as a place for me to get valuable experience, which I then took to an actual tech company to make actual tech money, while seeing the same cultural benefits and then some.

The vacation benefits were nice when you hit certain year marks, but it didn't seem like there was much  of anything keeping  executives there for any considerable length of time. I've personally known several people that had spent years there, held multiple positions, and then found they could get paid significantly more elsewhere and left. The company wouldn't match the offers these people were provided."

It is such a tight nit culture but also an open, welcoming and accommodating to new faces as well.  I recently left the organization but was inspired and motivated every day by my co-workers. I personally experienced a tremendous amount of growth opportunity, moving upward and across different departments.  The organization acknowledges and rewards hard work, collaboration, integrity and accountability.","Cars is going through some expected growing pains as it evolves from it's spin off from the parent company.  Leadership is actively trying to solve some of these growing pains but there is a certain amount of ""get stuff done at all costs"" going on that is taking away from time spent developing people and aligning everyone under a common purpose.  To get back to 5 star status I feel that the organization needs to get back to some of the things that made it the best place to work in Chicago, the people and culture.  The great news is that leadership is aware and cares. Before I left I had several meetings with members of the C-Suite who were very open and honest about the challenges and are genuinely interested in making things better. Turnover has been an issue as of late as folks that have been around for a long time look more for what they appreciated about the organization in the past.

Some folks get to pick where they go but if you are newer and don't have those connections expect to get dumped somewhere.  A lot of your time will be focused on methodology and process and not the product you are supposed to build.

- good scores on employee engagement surveys (expect on Marketing where score are lower)

- HR is outdated, bureaucratic and delusional: gave itself a new brand (People Experience Team) but have no idea about HR trends toward advocacy and training/ ""development"" program is embarrassing.
- No career planning or progression is available.
- for a tech company, it's too hierarchical, functional, and information culture is ""too secretive""
- people resign or are terminated more often, and that's causing stress.
- Two recent rounds of lay-offs hurt morale, erosion of trust in the leadership
- lots of pressure from Wall Street, and top leadership has no business acumen or business education to handle that.
- company lacks clear strategy despite ineffective attempts. That's because the leadership is butting heads a bit. 
- Salary seems to be a common complaint (where it isn't?)

If you are fortunate enough to accept a position with Cars, you will immediately be impressed with the importance they place on helping you succeed. From the on-boarding process to the on-going training program, my experience was first class.

Once in the field, I received great support from my DSM and other team members. I also attended off-site sales meetings in Madison. At those meetings, I got a chance to interact with other DSM's, our RSM, and all the folks that make up the sales force for the Midwest region.  I saw time and time again that the ""helping"" motto was more than just lip service, it is a part of the company's DNA, and the idea that the culture is based on. 

As a side note, I noticed that the night the Cubs won game 7, the CEO announced via Twitter that employees could start a little later that following Thursday to ensure everyone was well rested following a late night World Series victory. Talk about a guy who gets it. It seems to me that the culture is being driven top down, and in this organization's case, that is a good thing.

I ultimately left to pursue a significant opportunity that developed from a previous client relationship. That said, this would absolutely be a company I would consider working for again.","The biggest challenge from a sales perspective with Cars.com is that given the ""clutter"" in the industry, dealer partners struggle to understand which third party partners deliver results, and which do not.

Was continuously compared to previous employees. Usually worked 7 days a week and nights. Manager encroached into personal life. Used scare tactics to get me to stay at my position (How will you find another job? How do you expect to make money?

311,Cars.com,Financial Analyst,2016-07-12,3.0,Financial Analyst,"Cars.com was a good place to learn how a business runs, and what's needed to keep that business going.  If you're willing to learn, you'll learn a lot - but none of your bosses will teach you.  It's up to you to ask questions, read any and all mgmt decks, really try to figure things out on your own.  Of course, they'll teach you the core roles & responsibilities that belong to your team, but nothing really more than that.   Great thing with their Finance structure is that each Analyst/Manager/Director is embedded in the dept. they support.  If you're an analyst that supports Marketing, you'll sit in the heart of the Marketing dept.  If you support Sales, you'll sit with the Sales people.  Etc.  Etc.   This is really where you'll learn A TON - but again, if you decide to pay attention and be engaged.  It's like a mini-MBA in the field you support.","Pay is horrible.  Depending on the dept you support, your work/analysis will be a waste since VP's tend to care more about one area of the P&L than others.  As mentioned in the Pros section - this is a place to build your foundation, once you've got it people tend to leave for way greener fields.  Tough to move up within the Finance organization.  Depending on your manager, he or she might not really be all that vested in your career - not to knock all of them, because certain ones were - just not sure if those are still at Cars.  They're all extremely nice, and happy to answer any questions - they just don't have a lot of career path convos with you."

- Great coworker
- Great outing","- Communication breakdown 
   High up propose new idea, went to pivotal to learn pair programming, learning new technology CMS and protractor to re platform and make the site responsive and adaptive to mobile device all at once.
    Sounds like a great idea, was executed badly and was not understood, the directions were blindly followed by many mid-level managers and directors, which eventually, the product was badly built in the rush using newly introduced technology.
    Took 1+ year to make 25% of the web site to be responsive with the draw back of slow performance and buggy(while other company took the same amount of time to revamp the entire site without any performance issue). On top of pair programming, the idea to have developer do Unit test and Automation at time was too much to be handled, and was not fully accomplished
    Almost all Product teams are divided, re-platform/responsive effort should not execute based on one team after the other,  cross team communication was challenging, within team weekly action item was ""better communication"" and will continue to be that way. That add more complexity to the re-platform/responsive effort,
    The reason why most concerns were not heard or being ignore was,  mid-level managers and directors would conceal from high up or  was told this is the direction of where the company want to be. 
  
- Fail Fast but slow in fixing issues got introduced in each production deployment
   In the mix of all that, frequent deployment is new to the company and was not well thought out, causing more pain and defect, which don't do anything thing good to the company site.  Left most group scramble to deal with weekly issue, add more action items to the board in retrospective meeting then continue to drink and having happy hour."
316,Cars.com,A good place to start,2016-06-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Great place to get your feet wet and become familiar with a .com sort of culture.

There is plenty of opportunity to network and build strong relationships across the organization. The benefits are good and there is a great work-life balance.,The pay is not the greatest and there is opportunity to be more competitive in what they offer compensation-wise. The stacked rank system is flawed and not appropriate for all teams in Operations.

They did a lot of fun things around the office after hours. Beer, games, social structure is very big and it's fun to participate. 

They tend to trust their employees and managers tend to be pretty good overall. They listen, set realistic goals, and help you work toward them. 

Lots of room for growth for a person who is new to the corporate world, though it could take a while to get to where you want to be.","Low pay and definitely cliquish. I suppose it's the same anywhere. If you bring an offer from somewhere else, they won't even try to match it. They'll just let you go. If you get on the wrong side of your boss's boss, you're screwed. It's very hierarchical. 

They rely heavily on metrics for everything, but don't necessarily look at the right things (though for the most part, it's good). 

Promotions always come right around the ""yearly merit raise"" time - and so, they only give you a tiny - and I mean tiny - amount more than you might get as a merit raise in pay, and then they don't have to give you a merit raise because they've just ""given you a raise"" and you haven't been in the job long enough for formal evaluation to take place. So you take on a new role & more responsibility for the same pay you would be getting had you not been promoted. 

Their pay structure and raise structure is such that there is only so much to go around, so the most you can expect is a 3% raise and that's only for excellent performers and/or people in low paid positions. 

They are very concerned with appearances and so even when someone is a ""given"" for a job, they will post a job req to allow others to apply. It's used to teach fresh out of college kids how to interview for a new position within the company. It's also done so they don't get sued."

They spend 4 months have conf calls to get ready for a rate increase then the next 4 months dealing with all the cancellations from the rate increase.

Getting wasted at company events/gatherings and making fools of themselves, it is hard to respect them.  When sitting in a meeting you just smell the day old booze and cigarettes.  Your performance is also largely based on if you fit in to their lifestyle. Bottle of alcohol litter under desks and people hide beer from the keg in the morning in coffee cups. Half the staff is drinking ALL day!

Also- too many meetings. You've seen the meme ""I sat though a meeting that could have been an email."" That is this culture. Everyone is constantly meeting to avoid doing real work. You need a better system Cars or you are going to loose all of your good people and the ones who have been there for 10 years flying under the radar as untouchable will continue to weigh your team down.

350,Cars.com,Cars.com Strategy and Business Development Team,2016-02-12,5.0,Associate Manager,"Very smart and motivated group that really helped me grow professionally and personally.  

I joined Cars.com's SBD Team after working at a startup for a few years.  What drew me in was the team's interest in seeing its members flourish.  

I started as somewhat of a generalist, where I was able to rotate between different focus areas--areas like strategy, product management, ancillary revenue, research and analytics, training, and more.  The team's (and especially our Sr. Director's) interest in seeing teammates grow was very empowering.  Furthermore, the broad interest and awareness in company initiatives provided insight into what senior management focuses on, which was interesting to learn at the time, but undoubtedly will be even more valuable as I continue to climb the corporate ladder and continue refocusing on broader company value.

Because of the great general business experience I received while on the SBD team, coupled with focused work on product management (managing a web property Cars.com owns and operates), I was able to recognize my passion for product development.  My manager recognized and supported my interest, allowing me to shape my work so that it could be better leveraged to move internally to the Product department.  Without SBD's ability to give me exposure to product management, while also building out my business skills, I don't believe I would have otherwise had as much luck landing the job, nor the ability to succeed in the new role as quickly as I have.

My internal move should be an obvious vote of confidence for the company, but in case it's not, rest assured that the company as a whole is a fantastic place to be a part of. I believe our CEO and VP of HR are both seriously dedicated to creating a work environment that employees from all departments, from tech to sales, seriously enjoy. Renting out Wrigley field, the house of blues, hip spots in the Fulton market area are some examples of company-wide celebrations. But all the way down to having the most entertaining security awareness training videos I've ever seen, and joining employees from all departments to participate in hackathons, it's clear the company is focused on keeping employees happy by providing us much more than a paycheck and flexible work schedule.","The SBD team often gets the call from other departments and/or senior management for last-minute work that will be reviewed at a c-level.  This means that quick re-shuffling of priorities and heavy involvement from team managers can feel micro manage-y, but that is understandable given the short deadline and high impact of the work.  I know this bothered some teammates, but after stepping out of the department, I also see why the work was structured in such a fashion."

The way I came into the company is VASTLY different than the change I've seen it evolve into. When you start feeling more like a number as opposed to an employee, you think you've outgrown your welcome. Operations is a good foot in the door but don't stay in this area for more than 9 months, otherwise, you will be under the microscope. They are only concerned with NUMBERS. (ie: The ""Ops 10 Survey"" - did we hit 90%, did we outdo ourselves in promotions from the previous quarter? ) The feel of being about PEOPLE is depleted from this department.

If you want to proudly sell or build products that deliver results, work here. I've worked in a number of companies, and this is one of the very best. 

My coworkers, for the most part, were phenomenal. Sure, there are always people who are there for a check. I didn't see a lot of them, but it's a big company now and there are lots of places to camp out and coast. No one customer facing does that, ever. If they do, they don't last long. There are still enough old hands there to keep the commitment to customers going. 

Plenty of room to be myself, and develop new skills and knowledge. I was also lucky to have been surrounded by people a lot smarter, and younger, than me (JD talkin' about you), and they taught me a ton. Very good energy, especially on 8 in the very well run Inside Sales Team, and definitely in the field sales teams!","You get paid what you negotiate. It is what it is. You don't like it, you go somewhere else. I found all of my roles gratifying over the 7+ I was there, but ultimately there wasn't any chance for more managerial growth. To credit candor and honesty, I was informed that I'd gone as far as I would go anyway, so it wasn't a Con in the end. It was just truth, and that's much more valuable than the usual BS you'd hear from a senior leader.  I hated to hear it, but I respect it. 

Some of the decision making at HQ, made at Director or lower levels, was sometimes vacuumed and ill informed. Field sales leadership is pretty damn smart at Cars.com, and very dedicated, and they know how to run their turf. Stay out of it unless you are really ready to get your hands dirty alongside them. Customer Care/Ops is run by one of the best I've ever seen, so no problems there."

Most of management is there because of tenure and seniority. Worse yet, the company changes so frequently that most managers would not even be capable of performing the job they supervise and seem to not care or notice.

Micromanagemet is huge at this company, no matter your role. You will be required to log and document every thing you do and will be called out if it appears you aren't logging enough. By far the biggest con of all is the lack of pay. It is offensively low across departments and roles. Opportunities for pay increases are very rare. You would think they would make up for this with benefits but their benefits are very much industry average.

Encouraging team leads and fun environment (people were the fun, not getting yelled at all day over the phone).","As I said, you take every complaint and have to handle it as if it is personally your fault. The metrics (though heavily emphasized and important) don't mean a thing. I performed incredibly well and still was treated the same as those performing incredibly poorly. Not to mention what they measure your ""success"" and ""progress"" on is constantly changing in order to ""improve the ranking system"" which does not equate to how well the employee is doing. Oh, and if you want to go to the bathroom, you better make sure you're aware that this hurts your ""adherence"" or time that you have to be ready to take a call from someone upset, angry, and thinks everything is your fault when it is actually their fault. The Sales Reps are miserable old people who have been in the sales game for far too long and don't even know a thing about the product(s) let alone how to use the internet.

They also implement all these processes that essentially make the website more difficult to use for employees and customers. Account Managers call you to solve problems and make updates that they should be able to handle themselves but they are just too lazy. Mostly, they are girls that came from working retail and Urban Outfitters who shouldn't have been hired but they knew someone who already worked at the place so they were. Account Managers essentially did not do a thing and knew it, and laughed at the fact that they could get away with it. I spoke to so many Account Managers who call in frantically, about to cry, fixed their problem and walked them through how to fix it next time. What happens next? They call the next day with the same issue, and I do the same thing.

Managers are nice and walk around sincerely making an effort to connect with employees in support. However, they have no idea what we do day-to-day and just care about ridiculously meticulous checkpoints that are expected out of each call, even though some calls it is not necessary nor applicable.

In short, you are really just just a rag doll that everyone treats like crap and you have to smile while it happens and take blame for things that are their fault, not yours. On top of that you have to fix their problems. I like customer service, but taking so much blame for something I did not do/cause is just absurd. You can't even respond in any way that asserts yourself as knowledgable/assertive because you will receive a terrible Quality Assessment score. If you like taking crap from people all day and having them explain how they screwed up but it's your fault, then this job is perfect for you."

I've worked for Cars.com for over 8 years, and the access I've had to mentors, conferences and the level of training, specific to your role, or simply something you'd like to learn more about, is available to all employees and top notch.
Every senior leader, from the President down, works in an open environment, no offices...they don't hide behind closed doors.  If you have a concern to share, or simply want to seek out advice from industry leaders, the senior leadership team from all divisions make themselves available to every employee.
Company culture is often talked about, but Cars takes it to an entirely new level.  Team outings, rec leagues, offsite team building, in-office Friday ""Last Friday"" events are fun and encouraged by all.
Having the newest technology, clean, well taken care of office facilities, as well as being located in the heart of downtown Chicago (if you work at HQ) are often overlooked but play a huge role in the long-term view of employment.  Many Sales team members work from home, and Cars offers the best technology and communication tools to keep them informed and able to do their job away from the office setting.","As the company matures, (it's nearly 15 years old) there have been shifts in how decisions are made, and because of the company culture, it can seem at times that too many people have a say in what or how things should get done, which can lead to delays in progress.
While a conservative and steady approach has successfully driven Cars.com through the dot-com bubble, as well as the economic recession, these past few years have proven to be a time in the online automotive space to be very aggressive, and Cars.com has missed out on some key opportunities to be leaders in the space due to ""analysis paralysis""."

Also, if you don't smoke I suggest you start.  The smoking section is where you will meet most of your connections (and you'll get more breaks). 

They boast about internal promotions but the statistics do not support that statement. This is due in part to the fact that there are very few actual promotions. You have to apply to all internal positions through the same process as external candidates (even for a position on your current team). It did not appear as though there was any advantage to being an internal candidate. Brown nosing trumps capability and dedication. I often saw hardworking and knowledgeable/ fully trained internal candidates passed up for advancement opportunities due to politics.

Do not take a temporary position with operations, chances are you will not get hired on full time.
