The experience of walking in to 50 businesses per day every day (70 during training) with the intention of closing a deal at every location is one that sends the majority of employees packing within 3 months, but it is an experience that is a sort of badge of honor for anyone who can make it at least one year.  Basically, you will toughen up or you will quit, and I can honestly say that this job toughened me up and made me a better salesperson. There is also good training on giving an effective sales presentation that I have carried with me to this day.","One of the worst aspects of selling that I encountered during my time was poor reputation and online reviews, based on the aggressive sales approaches of some managers and salespeople. More importantly, the push for sales sometimes led to poor recommendations that left very unhappy customers, who had to fight to get out of contracts they no longer wanted to uphold. 
Now that Cbeyond has been bought by Birch communications, perhaps these issues have been addressed, but I would look into it."

The learning was non-stop, there are courses that you can take online provided by the company through what was called Cbeyond University. Also, there were many advancement opportunities, and the commissions were uncapped.","The products don't work that well. Some of the very basic services worked ok, but any of the technologically advanced services were poorly supported. In the Spring of 2014, Cbeyond was acquired by a company called Birch Communications and backwoods rinky-dink outfit hell bent on destroying everything good that Cbeyond founder Jim Geiger created. Birch's primary means of sales are from POTs lines, the most basic of basic phone lines (POTs stands for Plain Old Telephone, like pay phones and elevator alarms) and have no interest in ""Solutions"" for customers. They also are very cheap, ""nickel and diming"" customers with things like overages on long distance, and having too many emails in your inbox They are slowly but surely driving out all the employees that have high salaries, even going so far as to refer to employees as ""Cost Centers""."

In order to cut money, they decided to up the cost of snacks and sodas in the vending machines to 45 cent.  Might not seem like much, but it was a real shot to the moral."

They offer a great sales training program. Use this job as a stepping stone to get the sales job you want. Young culture, weekly competitions, and spiffs. And they have a great advancement program, so if you work hard and do well you'll get promoted really quickly. And by quickly I mean within weeks.","There is nothing glamorous about this job. Every day you are out there beating the bushes knocking on door to door of local businesses. And here's the thing... the businesses/business owners hate you. Because you're interrupting their day and trying to sell them a product/service they do not want. That someone else has already tried to sell them 20 times. The gatekeepers usually know who you are the moment you walk in the door. The Management team has really unrealistic expectations of their sales reps. They require that you hit 50 doors (business) a DAY and if you run an appointment that counts as 10. So yeah... 50 cold calls a day. Lastly, I wasn't that impressed with their product/service offering so I didn't feel that good about what I was selling. I never felt like I was giving the business owners a valuable solution."

Majority of employees enjoyed work and were great to work with.",The product offerings were too diverse which lead to large development hours on products that never sold.  Sales never understood cloud products and most came through Individual Case Reviews.  This also increase Operational costs as there was no repeatable model.  New software solutions were poorly vetted prior to purchase and many need not meet needs.  End result is decreasing revenue vs increased cost and we were bought.
123,Cbeyond,Best Company for Career Growth,2014-09-09,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Cbeyond/Birch offers their sales reps to make $100K+ entry level, Senior AE's $150+ and the top rep in the organization makes well over $200K.  In the Oak Brook office there are standards to come to two morning meetings a week, run 4 new appointments a week and hit your sales quota.  It is a sales organization, so of course you are expected to sell.  Work life balance comes with any sales job.  Unlike other organizations you don't have to be in the office or in the field from 8-5.  You make your own schedule around your appointments.  

As far as culutre, there are fun branch events like private dining at Mastro's, Del Frisco's, and Chicago Cut.  Every year we go to a Cubs Roof Top game.  And yearly there is a President's Club trip.  Even through the acquistion this culture has been kept whole in Chicago.  

If you are not passionate about sales and making money this company is not for you.  The office enviornment definatley caters towards the younger generation with creative thinking.  Management is mostly under 35, have energy and understand the needs of their people.","Customer care used to be challenging to work with.  However, through the acquistion it is like night and day.

You really felt for the most part like you were part of a big family. I met majority of my closest friends while employed.,The Board of Directors got greedy and sold the company out from under the CEO. Very sad. Cbeyond was acquired by Birch Communications.

Good Ol Boy (or, Good Ol Girl) mentality when talking about promotion. EXTENSIVE micromanagement expecting unrealistic numbers instructing to knock doors of prospects (old school approach) that HATE the brand when most say, ""I will never have Cbeyond again"". Lack of post sales support and bad service has resulted in tens of thousands of ill fated web reviews of Cbeyond service left by customers exposes ALL OR MOST of your newly interested prospects to the horrors other businesses have had to deal with which kills your POTENTIAL deal and flushes all your hard work, money spent on gasoline (which is NOT at all fully or properly compensated for), and your career at a failing company, DOWN THE TOILET...Don't make the same mistake I did and fall for their lies saying you could hit 6 figures and above in your first year. Its virtually impossible. The top rep at the company was near 90k and that was only because he had a tech vendor spoon feeding him 'free deals'...Maybe you will get lucky.

Happy customers are hard to find and there are plenty of unhappy ex customers. 
They tell you that they are making some big positive changes when they hire you, and that you are one of them, but you will find out that they hire and layoff sales people regularly and that they told that to the previous reps. 
They practice a common business tactic where they have massive layoffs in the fourth quarter to make sure their fourth quarter reports look better. If they are paying half the people then they arent loosing as much money.
You'll find when you go to an account and they will tell you ""I will never do business with Cbeyond again."" When you try to tell them your changing they say that's what Cbeyond has always has said.. Some businesses actually have ""No Cbeyond"" signs on their doors.

I left to pursue a ""job"" at a very successful start up company. Benefits were fantastic, atmosphere was wonderful but it was missing the things that glue a business together. The ability to grow and learn was missing, the passion for the customer was missing, and the ""team"" environment was not there.The honest truth is the job is not always easy. Job posts sound appealing because that is what they are meant to do. I am grateful and blessed to return to a place that is going to allow me to complete the career that I started.","My honest cons were my own. I want to list what I complained about then explain. When in Tier 1 I did not like 30 min lunches. In Tier 1 and 2 I thought there should be more formal training. Honestly these werent real company issues. The 1st was a preference, and the 2nd was a fault of my own and many people. Training for work is no different than school. If you dont invest personal time, you will never grow.

A lot of yelling at people, clear favoritism, will only train or support the people he likes, doesn't listen to anyone, ever.....just barks orders at us.

Thank goodness a friend of mine got me a direct hire role with his employer.

I never got in trouble there. Never written up but I was threatened with it. Constantly. They have their procedures that you follow no matter what or they will fire you. No common sense. One particular issue I fixed without taking additional, unneeded steps and wasting time, only to be threatened with a write up and possibly not going permanent. Didn't matter that the client was fixed and had not called back in and it had been over a month since the call. Just one of many, many situations like this.

HR is so clueless that in my exit interview, they were ""shocked"" when I told them how awful they were and how practically everyone on the floor that I knew felt the same, but were too scared to say anything because they might get a bad name there.

The products offered are great, you just need to understand them and you will feel passionate to sell. You have flexibility as long as your are selling. Everyone is very friendly. Lots of incentives.

Cloud products available are very exciting to sell. CBeyond offers a one stop solution for small businesses.","I love this place because my manager and my team are so amazing and I have grown a great deal thanks to them. Unfortunately not all the managers are great since some love to micro manage to a point where you feel as if you are being treated as a child. Asking for 50 cards a day , checking matching zip codes, and then marking them is just ridiculous. Some team leads are too focused on themselves and wont help new employees in there teams. Sink or swim. I feel bad for the reps that hate working here because they are micro managed  and are miserable. 
On the other hand there are some managers that are very supportive, give you flexibility as long as you are selling and are always involved in helping you succeed. Like in every business you have some stronger teams than others. Salary is less than industry standard."

It is both interesting and entertaining the amount of people who post negative things about Cbeyond. Ironically, they are all from people who either sucked at the job because they didn't put in the time, work and effort, or they are people that quit within the first month because they were too 'micro managed.' Please. This is how a good sales person learns, and my guess is that those people either don't work in sales any more, or are still job jumping because they are finding that every sales company expects delivery and results.","- antiquated technology

204,Cbeyond,Cold Call or Quit,2013-10-02,2.0,Territory Sales Representative,"Leadership at Cbeyond has great intentions. They truly do want you to be successful....so that they can make more money as well and meet their quotas!!!! You actually learn quite a bit about yourself and are forced to put yourself outside of your comfort zone which is a positive thing in many aspects. The pay for someone just out of college is solid, especially if you can make sales. The team building events are actually pretty fun....The cloud managers are awesome. I wish the job was exclusively cloud based (server environments, application hosting, remote IT support). The employees I worked with were all pretty cool individuals and there is definitely a team culture present, although it is also relatively competitive. Lastly, if you DO happen to find that you are great at sales, are fearless cold calling, and stumble across some BIG accounts you can make A LOT of money as a young man/woman. There are definitely reps that make close to 100k a year although this is rare and by no means guaranteed with hard work.","If you are not aggressive in your cold calling: hitting many doors everyday and keeping thick skin in response to the many rejections and rude reactions you will get; then you will fail miserably. Not performing here is embarrassing as you are forced to go through your sales funnel, daily projections, past performance etc. on a daily basis in front of your team. There are also some politics at play, certain reps are given deals while others are left to fend for their own. In many cases the most successful reps are merely those who have family/friend ties and can lure them into doing business with Cbeyond. If these accounts are large, they can result in individuals getting numerous deals every month meeting or exceeding quota solely as residuals of the original deal. This is great if it happens to you but annoying if it doesn't....so make it happen. With this company, it seems that their ""costumer service"" essentially disappears after the initial contract is signed unless it is a bigger and more lucrative account. The products have issues and I ran into multiple people who had headaches from all of their clients continuous issues with Cbeyond or simply ignored them and let the account go. Many deals never actually result in commission as the business owner can cancel anytime during the first month. It is a bad sign that this happens so often on the part of the company. Their use of Salesforce as an application for reps is more of a micromanaging tool than it is efficient by far. Micromanaging is extreme at Cbeyond although they will tend to say they do not do this. Furthermore, salesforce work (30min-hr) is to be primarily completed once you are home along with many emails etc. This stretches your work day from 8 am until around 6:30 or 7. It can be a ridiculously long day if you follow the ""cadence"".

Some of the managers have serious ego issues and superiority complexes. It is definitely a money-defines-success/the person type of environment. The intellectual will find him/herself out of place here mentally. Furthermore, bad mouthing of those recently let go/resigned and those even still working is pretty rampant. I have heard managers call people explicit names etc. on numerous occasions. It can all get pretty unprofessional in a setting that constantly attempts to emphasize its said professionalism. 

If you don't want to start your day at 8:00 with a high strung TGI Fridays-esque manager asking you ""where is your energy this morning?!?!?!"" prior to hitting 30 doors (supposed to hit 50) and perhaps coming back mid-day to telemarket until 5:30 then do not take this job. I would estimate that over 75% of the people here do not make it past 6 months. The pay is decent, but if you plan on doing something else as a young person from a career standpoint in the near future you are simply not going to have enough time in the week to work toward anything else. If you want to eventually go to law school, grad school in general, work on personal projects etc. you simply will not have much time. It is about 60 hrs of work a week if you choose to actually hit doors until 5 pm everyday."

I worked in the Corporate side (non-sales) of Cbeyond, and my experience was outstanding. Below are some of the pros that come to mind:

- Cheap vending machines on every floor ($.25 - $.50)
- Free gym on-site (AWESOME gym. Towel service, showers/locker room, free classes, great equipment, etc etc.)
- Results-oriented atmosphere (promotions, salary increases, etc are based off of your performance... not your tenure)
- GREAT atmosphere... the people made working at Cbeyond as enjoyable as it was

247,Cbeyond,Sales Rep to Market Director in 3 years,2013-01-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This isn't the company for people who are looking for a job. This is the place for those who are looking to accelerate their careers and pass up their peers. I started here four years ago as an entry level sales rep with a base of 31500, and the road was not easy. The first four months were as hard as everyone says, but through the extensive training Cbeyond provided, I was able to improve and start making some serious sales. To be fair, I wasn't your average rep. I was one of the first in the office and the last to leave because this was something I really wanted to take full advantage. By the end of the year, I had been promoted to Team Lead and had made 70k in my first year out of college. 

Four months later, I was promoted to a sales manager. 18 months later, I was promoted to market director. I made 96k my second year and 127k my 3rd. I'm 26. 

This is a tough gig and it's not for everyone. However, those who are able to make it 2 successful years are heavily recruited at pharm companies and med device sales companies because as recruiters have often told me, if you can make it at Cbeyond, you can make it anywhere. 

Don't waste your time there if you aren't confident that you're in the place and time in your life where you want to make a career leap. Be honest with yourself because if you're not ready for Cbeyond, it will crush you. If you are, however, it will make your career and your wallet a lot of money.","High turnover so your friends might not be there the next month, but a great place to make friends. Lots of fun, young people. 

Difficult job. Anyone who says long hours has a different point of view than I do. In my opinion 55 hours a week is not long hours. But, others may feel differently. It's tough in the way that there is a lot of rejection in the field."

Other than that cold calling enables you to learn how to communicate with a diverse group of business owners.,"The turnover rate speaks for itself. 90% turnover within the first 3 months. I came in with a class of 15 people; after 2 months there were only 3 left. That speaks for itself. Definitely a churn and burn environment and unprofessional atmosphere. Parallels a college fraterntiy or sorrority. You begin your days at 7:30am, and do not leave until 7:30-8pm in many instances. The reason for this is because you are expected to ""socialize"" with your c-beyond ""family"" after work. Extremely ridiculous. In essence, you aren't expected, nor can you have a life outside of c-beyond. In conjunction, there is an excessive amount of micromanagement. You are expected to hit 70-90 businesses every day, regardless of the conditions. Your blackberry will continuously be bombarded with phone calls from your manager, which further contributes to the stresses of the position. There is a huge amount of attrition. Most reps don't stay longer than 6 months, and obviously there is a reason for that. A sales consultant was telling my class that he came in with a class of 20 people, and he was the only one remaining. Huge red flag there. In essence, if you want to get adequate sales training and attain some cold calling experience, it's worth a shot. However, this is definitely not a company where you will build a career. There are many better opportunities elsewhere. There is a reason why C-beyond's stock has been falling since 2007."

You are cold calling in territories that have been called on by countless reps before you. I've walked into some businesses that showed me a stack of business cards from Cbeyond reps before. There are some companies that would be a great fit, but they have no desire to do business with Cbeyond because they are just flat out annoyed by constantly getting cold called. 

You're required to cold call every single business in your territory. The cheapest package that Cbeyond offers is in the $400 range and there is no way most of the businesses in your territory budget that much for phone and internet. 

You're spending a lot on gas and if you get stuck with a territory thats a long way away from the office, you're going to be spending even more. They reimburse gas with $50 per month and a little more per appointment you set, but in the first few months, it is not enough by a long shot."

294,Cbeyond,Best place to work if you want to learn how to sell.,2012-03-08,5.0,,Great Company to work for,Get ready to work hard
295,Cbeyond,Excellent company to start your sales career...,2012-03-07,3.0,,Cbeyond provides some of the best training for sales I have ever seen.  When I started I had no experience but became very successful quickly due to training and my manager.  You can get promoted and make a ton of money if you are willing to work hard and hit your quota.  Great for your resume.,"Long hours and hard work.  Micromanagement.  Have to follow a very specific schedule.  With that being said, this job is not for everyone.  You need to be very motivated and money hungry to succeed here otherwise you should look somewhere else.  A lot of people coulldnt stand the long hours and the daily activity required but honestly it is the best first job if you want to become a sales professional."
296,Cbeyond,"Great Sales Training, Horrible Career Move",2012-03-05,3.0,Sales,Wonderful Sales Training for entry level professionals. Decent rewards for sucess.,"Back-breaking cold calling/business to business, long hours.  Immature managers, culture as a whole.  No communication concerning changes within organization.  Primarily, sales reps are brainwashed to be selling robots."
297,Cbeyond,Fantastic sales experience. Very hard job. Not for everyone,2012-03-02,4.0,TSR,"Overall I think my time at Cbeyond was a great experience.  The team is made up mostly of young, ambitious and fun college grads and I definitely made some friends while I was there.  The base salary and benefits were great for a job that doesn't require much experience and if you do well the commissions can add up fast.  The promotions are strictly based on your performance and meeting sales goals so you don't have to deal with favoritism.  Overall you need to be willing to work had and be extremely ambitious and outgoing to be successful.  Many people think that can cut it here and they are gone in a month.","The ""door to door"" style of sales is old fashioned and doesnt work like it did 15 years ago.  In this market our brand image had been damaged pretty extensively so that most people already knew of us and had a negative opinion.  They are not very accommodating to family issues and you will find yourself working until 7pm on a regular basis.  The Siebel software they use for CRM is both inadequate and under-utilized.  Their products are also much more expensive than the competitors and offer basically the same thing which makes them difficult to sell in this economy, especially to small business owners."
298,Cbeyond,My experience at Cbeyond was below average.,2012-02-23,3.0,,"Good training program, great for entry-level college grads.",Micro-management and intimidation tactics used to manage.
299,Cbeyond,"hard work, not for everyone",2012-02-23,3.0,Sales Associate,"good start pay,good benefits, some of the managers are really good, great co workers, great bomuses in place if ypu make the numbers","bad system in leads, high rotation of employees, high price for the broadband, its getting killed by the cmpetition, the employees really in a lot of tricks and lies to make numbers"
300,Cbeyond,entirely underwhelming as a career launch pad.,2012-02-16,2.0,Territory Sales Representative,"Compensation is decent right out of school
Promotions are attainable if you are good and there are 0 politics involved
If they like you they will try and help you as much as they can (which is expected)","The product is nearly imppossible to sell (I was hitting my quota on skill alone)
The management is too young to understand how to really manage someone.
Micro-Management is taken to the extreme here (counting doors hit, phone calls made, time allotted for tasks, morning meetings about ???)
The company seems like a better fit for places that are not tech savvy,  The overall solution they sell to customers does not work in the silicon valley because the package when bundled does not bring more value to the customer than 5 other solutions from other companies combined.  Cannot be a VAR if you bring no value to your customer base.
Heavy working hours that makes your REAL wage must less than it actually is."
301,Cbeyond,Best entry-level sales position for college grads,2012-01-27,4.0,,"One of the best training programs in the industry, help to educate about technology and create a sales foundation that successful reps will utilize and grow upon for the rest of their sales career (cold calling, teleprospecting, sales model and overall approach)","High energy right out of college ""party"" atmosphere, young managers that micromanage, life-work imbalance, ""do what it takes to get the deal"" tactics"
302,Cbeyond,Don't believe the Hype!  Job Hunters beware...,2012-01-17,1.0,Senior Sales Consultant,"If you can sell (their way) they will pay you well, the new comp plan they rolled out mid 2011 was solid and finally included retention bonuses and recurring profit.  The benefits were pretty good once they actually kicked in 90 days later.  They do hire some pretty good people.  The sales training was pretty good too, very thorough.  Really good if you have never been in sales before.  They teach you how and expect you to work hard and be very aggressive.  From the beginning it starts off looking pretty good...  But...","Management tends to yell at employees (a lot) and no matter what you do, it is never good enough.  There are a few good managers but they usually leave once they get the title they want and take their skills elsewhere.  Most of the managers are there because they were foolish enough to stay there and/or don't have the social/people skills to get a better job.  They don't understand people and think that hard selling is the only way to sell, and if you don't follow the ""model"" they will embarrass you in front of your peers and scream at you while you are on the phone with customers.  Just imaging the hazing in a bad college movie stereotype. I watched them ridicule and publicly humiliate people which only stifles their future performances and retards their growth.  It is humiliating and the customers actually don't like it either.   They try to lead through intimidation and if you offer your opinion they will squash it immediately as balderdash... and try to make you feel stupid for trying to improve on the current topic.  

This company creates robots and want you to follow a ""model"" that is overly aggressive and makes sure you only hard sell the customers and pressure them to sign right there on the spot.  God forbid you go back to see the potential customer more than once, otherwise they tell you to move on to a new prospect.   This is not a relationship building position, you get in, get out and move on to the next customer. 

Now when you are in the field, the aggressive tactics can get you the ""seat"" with the potential customer, but that is only if the Cbeyond employee who had your territory before you didn't annoy, irritate, insult or offend them by coming in week after week belittling the ""gatekeeper"" and forcing his/her way into the office.  They commend the employees for getting kicked out of the office just as much as they do for getting ""the seat""...  This not only gives the company a bad name in the public eye, but also makes the job much more difficult for future sales people.   Oh and that is if you are the only one in your ""territory.""   It isn't uncommon to hear a potential customer say, ""you guys were in here yesterday"" or ""last week"".  I was once told by a receptionist that ""if anyone from Cbeyond comes in I am told to immediately ask them to leave""...   Seriously.

Now as far as HR issues...   They verbally harass employees and constantly threaten people with termination as they think is ""motivating"" when in actuality it only makes the person work hard enough to not get fired, thus making them a short term employee.  This has a direct correlation with the next topic…  Micromanagement.  Since all the managers are so busy watching their own backs and the threat of termination is always looming around the office, they micromanage people too much.  They make you start your day in the office, which is fine I prefer to be in the office early, but they also insist you check in at the end of the day and they will literally count the cards you collected and judge you on the spot.  Again, when they call for “high activity days” people will go out and just get cards and not focus on quality leads just so they can make the predetermined number set in the morning meeting.  They do not believe in quality over quantity.     Nor do they believe in trust or loyalty.  They also mark your cards with different color markers or punch holes in them so you don't/can't use them again.   

I was in a training class of 10 people and after 8 months there was only one of us left...  and the remaining employee has been looking for a new job.   High turnover is par for the course and as I mentioned they also force people to quit.  There are not too many people that are there for more than a year for a reason.  A few of us had a discussion with the HR people outside of work, and one of them was in tears when we discussed what was going on during the day in the office and in the field.  This company turns and burns people faster than they can get them hired, for all the aforementioned topics and more...   These are just the ones I think need to be discussed.

Lastly the managers are all the people that were able to sell and follow the model exactly and don't care about customer (or employee) satisfaction or ethics.  They just want to hard sell the customer and move on.  They all try to be just like the VP who is actually a pretty good guy, but he is convinced the authoritarian way is always right...  because it is how he was taught...  (more cloning).   They all act obsequiously to get the position they have and sadly they don't have minds of their own.   The worst part is they all use the same jargon and if you do anything differently after you get yelled at in public they will then deem you as ""un-coachable"" which is ironic is that one needs a coach in order to be ""coachable"", and these people are definitely not coaches.  If they were coaches, people would stay longer and would actually respect them.

303,Cbeyond,Easy to get burned out fast,2012-01-17,1.0,TSR III,Great commissions with good base and benefits,"Hard to sell. Territories have been blown up by other reps and most businesses we walk into hate us. Hard to stay motivated to keep going. Always seems to be drama at the office, carrots dangled in front of you to make you keep going. Started with 9 in my training class, down to 4 after 7 months. I've been a steady, high producer, but completely burned out and unmotivated at this point."
304,Cbeyond,It was the perfect first time entry level job with the potential to learn valuable communication skills!,2012-01-14,5.0,Territory Sales Representative,"The company culture is like none I've ever seen before! There is always incentives and bonuses, and they always find a way to make your job more fun and motivating. On a weekly basis you are recognized for you hard work, and always given feed back on how to do better. I really learned solid communication skills, time management, and negotiation skills. It was the perfect first time career outside of college, because it enabled me to learn about myself, and how to work as individual and as a team!","Cold calling- no one likes to do it but its a job, and money! Also the majority of the time you are out on your own finding new leads to write deals; so if you are not self-motivated this is not a job for you! But it is also so rewarding because you learn communication skills, presentation skills in front of business owners, and you really learn how to sell yourself, and how to never feel uncomfortable. Gas money is also a variable, but you can write it off in your taxes at the end of the year!"

Good place to meet other people fresh out of College. 

Decent Base Salary for someone without any formal work experience.","Most everything that needs to be said has been by other Cbeyond survivors but there are a few things that stuck out to me:

Some of the territories have been hit so hard by so many reps, businesses have put up No CBeyond Reps signs in their windows. Wow...

You will be driving your car up to 100 miles a day and you will be paid back pennies on the dollar for fuel costs not to mention wear and tear on your car. 

You will work a bare minimum of 60 hours a week.
