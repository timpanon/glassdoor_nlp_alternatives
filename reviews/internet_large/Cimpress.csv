Great till you are a developer","Leadership across different quadrant are unaware what is happening in other quadrants. As a results promotions and growth are hampered.
Leadership fakes about caring attitude towards employees when it is related to career but in reality they do not care 
There is lot of bias behaviour but showcase they value the employee
Many reorgs without any rationale
Compensation is a concern as leadership does not care about it at all. When asked they don't have clear clarity 
Some quadrants are bullish and dominate a lot. But due to their higher rank in the company no one comes forward."

Most of the people I've worked with here are talented, intelligent, and a pleasure to work with.","Re-orgs happen frequently (though those are not usually accompanied by layoffs) A decentralized team structure also contributes to the general chaos caused by re-orgs, and we often pivot on priorities. Work gets done twice by two different teams, or gets done once and then thrown away, etc. 

I've rarely gotten the chance to fully finish/polish tools I've worked on, often being forced to move onto the next big thing, which in turn also never gets fully finished. 

Some teams are also noticeably less competent than others, and it's implicitly expected (and sometimes necessary) for more competent teams to give others direction or pick up the slack."

You can achieve an amazing work life balance. Especially if you don’t tie any of your self worth to your career.,"- All the good coworkers/managers I knew have chosen to leave at some point or another due to entrenched politics seemingly designed by unqualified people to keep themselves employed
- In my experience, there was a poor understanding of how to measure success, leading to most software initiatives failing. This also leads to most new initiatives being a complete shot in the dark. 
- Leaders I worked with seemed to be in place solely based on tenure. At other companies I have worked at, I don’t think they would have met the bar.
- In my career, I had never experienced those situations you see on HR training videos. The toxic environment created here really put me to the test on those.
- Compensation is lackluster. The equity given had such a long time until realization that they might as well not even offer it."

69,Cimpress,My Review working as a Graphic Designer at Cimpress India Pvt. Ltd for almost 2 years,2021-08-02,1.0,Graphic Designer,"When you are selected for Cimpress you feel really good and happy with all the amenities they provide you with. You will get a nice PC to work on, good work environment, lots of facilities.","The salary is extremely low, not even 15k INR/Month for two years of experience and work life balance is not there. work is just not appealing and team leads just put pressure on you to complete the targets. All you can expect from this company after getting selected is a lot of pressure to complete targets on time, NOTHING creative work here, I repeat, no work is creative there. One should think before joining this company because even after you have worked for 1.5 or 2 years at Cimpress you are still a fresher outside as you don't have any practical knowledge as a graphic designer, all you were doing is just completing targets. I think they should not fool job seekers who want a graphic designer role but end up just completing targets everyday. They should mention that its a post to complete targets not a graphic design post.
The salary is the biggest drawback working here, they provide such a low salary and don't give any bonuses ever. All you will get is parties on major Indian festivals. Not a good place to start your graphic design career, especially if you want to grow and learn something for real than DO NOT join this company. Some of the team leads are arrogant and don't have any knowledge apart from how to terrorize employees and complete targets."

- Lots of personal and team autonomy.
- Great tech if you know what you are doing.
- Some people are really nice but most of them left or are leaving.
- I was lucky to be in a great team.","- Lots of tools have changed but not because of quality/productivity concerns but rather for cost or just because this is ""cool"" now.
- Politics are a big thing in this company, from the lowest level up. People are not rewarded based on their performance.
- Speaking of performance, the rating was always flawed, nobody in this company could explain what needs to be done in order to get top marking. It was ""reserved"".
- Taking responsibility is not something common here. That's how bloated organisations with lots of people appeared but only about 20% would actually deliver.
- They always look at other big tech companies and try copying them but it never works out, I believe because the culture and experience is rather different here.
- Incompetent people were kept around (because line above) and as a consequence lots of people decided to leave.
- Interviewing questions are 15 years old in this company, that should tell you something.
- There is no plan in place to grow people anymore though that was a big concern in the old company, Vistaprint.
- CTO is highly inexperienced and not prepared to give a direction inside the company from a tech perspective.
- Vistaprint is a very customer focused company while Cimpressed lacks a lot in that regard.
- There would be employees encouraging other employees to put positive feedback here because the rating of the company is going down.

Just when you get comfortable with your current situation, something with change that changes your job.
-Management doesn't always recognize your hardwork.  When you go above and beyond, you will not be rewarded.  Staff will end up doing the work of a manager without any recognition.

- Excellent CTO trying to build a high-quality tech company. 
- Tech stack is pretty modern. Very few legacy systems following transition to microservices

- Rampant dead-sea effect. Long-time Vistaprint/Cimpress-ers getting influence beyond abilities as everyone else leaves. Frustrating the young talent away
- Some feeling that the long-term strategy has been abandoned in favor of driving the stock price up after several quarters of disappointing stock price growth
- Equity offering is poor
- No peer reviews. Incompetent, politically-savvy people can find a niche and stay there
- Waltham is being diminished in favor of cheaper overseas workers

209,Cimpress,Was better in the past but frequent reorgs and lack of direction,2017-12-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you get in on the right team or under right manager, you could find a good niche.   Good benefits - solid insurance, free food pretty often, parking gym game room, good 401k match.","Lots of reorgs and layoffs, seemingly without a rhyme or reason. Too many politics.  Gating factors on decisions are politics involving long time Vistaprint-ers/Cimpress-ers.  Lack of ownership for failed strategies from the top, just reorg and let some people go.  Redoing team structures does not make up for bad business decisions or initiatives."
210,Cimpress,I guess if you really need a job...,2017-12-11,1.0,Principal Software Engineer,"- Competitive salary and benefits; not top-tier anymore, but reasonably good
- Nice campus in Waltham; free garage parking, on-site gym, reasonably priced cafeteria with healthy options.
- If you're somewhat political and know how to keep your head down, you can collect a decent salary for doing next to nothing; just be ready to find another job quickly.","- Constant reorganization and head cutting.  Really, no one in this organization enjoys any semblance of job security any more, regardless of performance or seniority.
- No clear business strategy other than keeping the stock price up.
- No technical strategy, discipline or leadership.  As it is, the software architecture is an undocumented mash-up of buzz-word technologies with nothing quite finnished or working as intended; hysterical amounts of tech-debt.  
- Very unsatisfying work for those who like to build things.  Given the recent cuts, most engineers spend their time cleaning up other people's messes and getting ready for their next gig."

Great work life balance. Many people have opportunity to work from home. Some work remotely full time (or very close to full time). 6-8 week (can't confirm the exact time given) Maternity/full-time care giver leave (100% paid with optional long term disability insurance) or 2 week paternity/part time leave. Flexible work schedule (Come in, do your work, work 40 hours a week more a less, make up time if you feel you need to/work less next week if you put in more hours. Figure it out, you're an adult)","Frequent restructures cause layoffs. Seemingly poor performing teams and organizations are not dealt with.

You might get lucky and land in a good squad - although there are fewer of them these days (the overall level of talent has gone down).","It used to be a good technology company, but years of constantly reorganizing has silenced or removed the managers who understand software.  What's left are the ladder-climbers. Cimpress has made some business gambles in the last few years that haven't paid off. Now the individual business units are under pressure to improve their numbers and the business leaders have lost patience waiting for the tech organization to fix the software. Feeling the pressure, the tech organization is doing short-term work to patch over deeper problems, which is making the software worse. All this happens under the guise of being Agile. The current tech leaders may be aware that this is happening, but they are more interested in not getting fired than in giving an unpopular message to their business counterparts."

230,Cimpress,"Great Perks, but Lacking Vision/Silo Mentality",2017-05-31,2.0,Finance Professional,"Perks and benefits are definitely the main reasons to join: 
- Health insurance premiums have been increasing every year, but they offer multiple plans (HDHP, HMO, PPO) and it's still a pretty good deal. 
- Free lunch twice a month (food trucks during the summer months).
- Garage parking (no need to sweep off your car or worry about entering into an oven in the summer).","The company is confused about its vision and the culture depends largely on the business and team.
- As a result of the strategy constantly shifting, reorganizations and turnover are a certainty. FYI - there’s been at least one reorg every year I’ve worked here. 
- Working in finance, I have yet to find a company that has a good work/life balance and this place is no different.  Long hours are to be expected during the close and budget cycles. The difference between here and other companies is that the constant reorgs extend these hours even more so. 
- There is a persistent culture of scapegoating – I’ve seen many smart people that were let go just because they were in the wrong department at the wrong time. Guess what? Just cause the strategy has pivoted doesn’t mean the underlying problem has gone away. The problem just shifts to another department where it will take even longer to figure out because everyone who understood the context was let go.   
- The culture in teams and departments will vary – Corporate culture is more cut-throat whereas if you’re in a revenue generating business, the people tend to be friendlier."

They provide the necessary environment and freedom for employees to improve themselves and learn new/cool stuff. One can use almost any programming language to build microservices which is completely independent of the rest of the legacy technology stack.","Compensation is not as high as other tech companies.

Teams can work on anything they want with the technology they want.  Frequent reorganizations keep the business focused on what is important instead of languishing in the past.  When change needs to happen management ensures that it does.  Good work is usually rewarded, and Cimpress gives teams and team members the power and responsibility to drive the company forward by pushing decisions down to where the information is.  At Cimpress it is every team members job to determine what is best for the company, no one will tell you what to do, or how to do it, but instead they'll win you over with why.","Like working for any company for a long time, some fellow employees become adjusted to certain level of entitlement.

Company is pretty good about work-life balance.","Company has a serious case of not-invented-here syndrome, and many of the software developers are long-timers who have never worked in another company, so the technological base and diversity is not very different from team to team. There is a very obvious tendency toward favoritism of people who have been with the company for significant periods of time, even if they don't have the best ideas.

Career growth for senior developers is very hazy and ill-defined. 

Company keeps trying to reinvent their process and internal organization, with very mixed results.

There is no real motivation for ambitious developers to do more than the base minimum - parts of the company just move so slowly or are so insular that high-achievers are going to be left very bored or feel like their work is unappreciated or pointless.

Technological leaders like to take point from companies with very questionable practices like Amazon.com, and implementing half-measures like bogus scrum."
