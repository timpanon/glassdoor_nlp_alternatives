1. No work life balance at all. Management will treat you like their servant. They think in IT is normal to work 12-13hrs a day including weekends
2. They are really bad at planning and estimating time to develop a product that is the reason for point 1. But they never learn from their mistakes as this happens for every product
3. Employees working long hours under pressure without any breaks tends to make some mistakes. But even for a smallest mistake they would tell you that you won't get a good appraisal. There's goes any motivation to work hard.
4. Micromanagement makes all of this worse. Product deliveries are often delayed due to bad planning and estimation on management's side but developers and QA's are blamed. Management will constantly bug you for progress.

1. In some teams quality of work is very good and mentorship is great.

2. It's a startup but still it follows mature practises like RCA (root cause analysis) in case of a issue to avoid repeat of a issue and doesn't blame individuals but rather focusses on fixing the processes.

3. Can make/create significant impact within a short span of time.

4. Engineering management is receptive to opinions and it works bottoms-up instead of team-down thereby enggs have more say in day to day things.

5. Follows good engineering practises around unit-tests, continuous deployments & code reviews. Lot of the repetitive tasks have been automated.

6. People who create impact or go out of their expectations and pull of exceptional things do get rewarded.

7. Extremely fast rate of learning. I learned a lot in 2 years which helped me moved to a better place.

8. Apart from tech, I learned a lot about finance.

9. Good hiring bar that ensures high quality folks.

10. There's conscious folks to measuring tech-debts and keeping them under control.

11. Managers actually focus on growth on team members by giving them opportunity.","1. It's not a 9-5 job as Govt keeps tweaking tax laws which often carries hard deadlines. Also, the company is growing fast.

2. Pay-wise it's same as big companies so if thinking for short-term (<3 years) not much would come out. However, the company has potential in long term so ESOPs might be rewarding.

3. Coming to ESOPs, there's a exercise price > 0.

4. If you're not interested in finance you will feel left and growth might be difficult as you won't be able to connect to most of the day to day problems that need to be solved.

5. At senior positions, there's chaos (as expected)."

291,ClearTax,Insight into the Tech team,2019-01-22,5.0,Director of Engineering,"I have been with ClearTax for more than 2 years now. And I have been lucky enough to see different stages during the growth of the company. One thing I did realise though - we do not talk enough about a lot of the great work that happens within the ClearTax Engineering & Product teams. Some folks even surprised me asking if ClearTax has a dedicated tech team. This post hopes to provide some insight into that topic and hopefully reduce the percentage of those “some folks” out there.

When I talk to most folks outside about ClearTax, they seem to be aware of just the Tax filing product from ClearTax. It is definitely THE name-to-fame product and Millions of Indians enjoy using it the platform. It is the #1 e-filing product in India, with high growth rates year-over-year & an NPS of 70+. For these consumers, we have also been building out one of the fastest growing Mutual Fund Investment platforms in the country. Our eventual goal being - help consumers on all aspects of wealth management & personal finances. 

In addition to this, the Tech team has been continuously working on a lot of interesting products to solve problems for Businesses in India and Financial Experts as well. We call this the B2B wing inside the company. 

In July 2017, the Indian Govt introduced the GST regime - and permanently changed the way how businesses will transact in our economy going forward. We, in July 2017, launched our B2B suite of products as well. Today, we already have lakhs of businesses on the platform and we are marching towards millions of businesses using us for their compliance, accounting, invoicing & other financial workflows. Since our platform has an understanding of their invoices, items and counter-parties, we will be able to understand the business transaction graph in India, and then help businesses with their working capital, supply chain problems, invoice discounting, deep data insights about their own business, their working patterns, etc., - to name a few. We can help businesses drive better decisions around purchasing, selling - essentially simplifying their financial lives.

Of course, we couldn’t have achieved all this without an amazing Tech team - which is core to the company’s success. In the last 2 years, the Tech team has grown as well - from 16 engineers to around a 50 now. And yes, we will be growing further. 

Currently, our Engineering & Product teams, 
* Comprise of strong Tech minds from some of the best companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Flipkart, Myntra, Ola, Adobe, multiple startups) and colleges (IITs, NITs, other Tier 1) in the country
* Build for scale on a daily basis - With such deep product investments and growth, scaling needs arise. At our peaks we - use 200+ servers concurrently, publish 20million+ events, handle multiple TBs of data. All this, working under the constraints of accuracy, speed & security - that comes with the FinTech domain.
* Are given enough autonomy - and they take the high ownership that comes with autonomy 
* Believe they can personally create an impact through their work- simplifying the financial lives of millions of Indians
* Are pretty young - with the median age  probably being 25 :)
* Have become TT super-stars who might soon start playing for India - that is if our TT table is not broken... again!

No denial that we have had our share of the typical growing pains that come with fast growing startups, but we have also evolved significantly with learnings from that journey. Our leadership team currently comprises of senior leaders who have been through interesting growth journeys at Flipkart, Yahoo, Myntra, Ola, etc., Our daily motto goes along the lines of - becoming one of the best FinTech startups to work for in India. We are constantly moving the needle in that direction. 

Feel free to reach out to any of us from the management team for further conversations. We are quite approachable and happy to help!",- We are running out of seats. Looking for larger office space soon.

318,ClearTax,Culture and hiring the best,2018-02-07,5.0,Member of Staff,"I have been working full time for ClearTax for more than 2 years.  I have seen the company grow from 25 member team to 350+.

As I look around me at ClearTax I see Artists, Storytellers, CA's, Inventors, makers, and doers. We have laughed, screamed and cried together and gone through an entire agony and ecstasy of building something meaningful here. Our team is so amazing and its great to come to work to just see them.

ClearTax hires only the best.  Our people are alumni from the best places in the world namely Amazon, Flipkart, IIT, NIT, ISB etc.

We have a world-class engineering team which delivers highly robust and scalable software as a service for B2B as well on the consumer side.

We at ClearTax wish to live and breathe the Cleartax journey from 0 to 1 and give flight to its dreams - Not just to be better than our next competitor but to leave them so far behind and achieve something so extraordinary that will make us remembered by our customers, partners, employees, competitors and investors forever.",None keep up the good spirt

You can take your own initiatives and everyone else will support you in that.

324,ClearTax,"Get Your Act Together, CT.",2017-11-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,None so far. Unless you find some good teammates by mistake,"Many, starting from the top management to everyone in the bottom."
325,ClearTax,Career-Ruiner,2017-10-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There is Zero efforts put in the direction of Pros,"Its not that it is a startup and hence the flaws, the cons are really attributed to the attitude of the management, the kind of senior management they hire and the zero importance to commitment and effort that is needed for building basic processes in place. HR is ineffective, the person responsible has zero HR skills, often blames members of own team without context and lacks basic knowledge of how to function in a startup, hence proving counter productive. In the name of 'Speed as habit' (one their values) the management technically hires people for an objective they wouldn't be able to achieve themselves within a randomly determined short time frame, 'cause-Speed. Period. Like that is all that matters.  When it clearly doesn't work, management's only solution is to fire and hire anew.
There is Zero strategy in hiring (except of cost effective hires). There are times people have been hired for a role barely defined. 
HR's least concerns are creating unique culture, employee engagement and vision/moral sharing with the company-for which there are ample opportunities in a startup with young minds like in here. Instead, there is hasty decision making, lack of insight and almost a greedy compulsion of only knocking tasks off a checklist.
For a company that's 6+ years old (even for a startup) the payroll processes are gravely ineffective because they are bureaucratic in nature. If you are joining  here after working in a very professional environment and  from a really good pedigree, your compulsion to leave within 3-6 months is absolutely certain."
326,ClearTax,Life at Clear Tax,2017-10-24,2.0,Business Development Associate,get to learn a lot of new stuff,NOT THAT GOOD SO FAR. Management skills is poor

328,ClearTax,Amazing Experience,2017-05-24,4.0,,The whole team from the Top management to the bottom is very supportive. All of us Sit together. There is no seperate cabins for the top management- they sit next to interns and help us in closing sales deals including the VP. They take feedbacks from employees and implement it and always encourage learning,Need to work more to survive
329,ClearTax,Bad,2017-03-02,1.0,Anonymous,"- Very few good and smart people

- Good product","- Too much lie during hiring

- One of the founders says anything off the top of his head and loves making people wait for him

- CEO is bad at making decisions, likes flashy things, has no real substance.

- The company gets excited about a new product every now and then. After the initial launch of one, they quickly get excited about another new product. There is no true focus on any.

- Struggling to make reveneue despite so many products

- CEO quotes DHH and at the same time feels proud about the investment he has raised and YC

- Hiring anything from Flipkart

- Encouraging fake reviews on GlassDoor

- People who speak a lot and stay at office all the time are very much liked by the seniors at the company"

336,ClearTax,Many interesting technical and real-world problems to solve.,2016-11-12,4.0,Software Engineer,"ClearTax is coming up with new initiatives apart from the main tax-filling application and so multiple new projects are underway. The problems it's trying to solve exists in real and impacts a lot of people and business in India.

It's a good place to be if you like the idea of being involved in the development of a product right from the beginning. Be it interacting with business people to get clarity on the requirements, coming up with software architecture & design, finalizing on tech-stack, coding multiple micro-services right from scratch, an engineer get to be involved in all the aspects.

Lots of opportunities to learn and grow. You can wear multiple hats and get to know about the product and business side as well.

I found the people working here to be humble and helpful. During hiring process, a special emphasis is given on identifying culture fit. During interview debriefs, cultural values are given equal emphasis to technical skills. This ensures that everyone gets to work not only with skilled colleagues but also co-operative and helpful colleagues.","True that some of the engineering practices have scope of improvement. But that also offers the opportunity to an engineer to be the change they wish to see. If I see that current code review practice or coding guidelines are not good enough, I can go ahead and propose the changes. The satisfaction of bringing a positive change to engineering practice is immense and not easily achievable in other organizations.

Also, ClearTax today is very different from Clertax six months back.So, the older viewpoints on this site doesn't reflect current culture and I didn't faced any such issue. Senior people from established successful companies have joined and they are bringing in the good practices. Practices like OKRs, leadership principles, weekly tech-talks etc are in place and things seem to be in control."
337,ClearTax,Really like working here,2016-11-02,5.0,Member Of Technical Staff,"Hi all

Sharing my experience about working at ClearTax: Solid engineering, product used by lakhs of Indians, very popular product.

I am happy with people who work here. Fellow engineers are very helpful and supportive.

Fantastic office is a nice perk.","I think we can improve by adding more engineering test cases to make the code base less brittle.

Overall I like that ClearTax has solid engineering practices of writing unit tests, peer review of code and great hiring bar."
338,ClearTax,very irritating place to learn,2016-10-25,1.0,Front End Engineer,great engineers to work with and good office location,"no scope to learn or experiment to improve on, false promises"
339,ClearTax,Good Place,2016-10-20,4.0,Technical Staff,"Engineering team is amazing  with lot of senior Engineers . 
High ownership . 
In my earlier company fellow engineers would rarely help when I am stuck with an issue . Here at Cleartax I would always get some guidance from Senior Engineers . 
CTO is an amazing guy .
Less Bureaucracy.",Currently Cleartax has lot of product lines and I don't see same level of commitment for other products like taxation product .
340,ClearTax,I like working at ClearTax,2016-10-15,5.0,CA In CA Team,"am working in CA team of ClearTax - I like it here.

The people and work culture is very good. My suggestions are taken up seriously. I enjoy improving the product. The people are very motivated to build a great product.

The engineers are very good and helpful.

I recommend ClearTax and in fact I reffered my friend to join the CA team.",I don't have much to say in cons. In fact long back we were 6 days working and that was changed to 5 day working week. That used to be the common complaint and that got fixed.
341,ClearTax,Worst Company,2016-10-14,1.0,Member Of Technical Staff,"- CTO is great guy and very helpful if he has time, other than that there is nothing great.","- Tech Stack - you have to work on .net/windows platform and you'll be always micro managed.
- They talk about all fancy stuff to get you excited during the interview but post joining you end up doing regular tasks which is very basic work.
- There are lot of talks around new initiatives but no one has clarity on what to do next
- Trust factor is zero
- Reimbursement is a pain, you have to followup,remind multiple times and even then the money will not be credited on time.
- CEO has lot of mood swings,he abuses everyone including the founding team on the floor and in front of other employees
- CEO doesn't meet people on their time even if his calendar is free.Employees have to wait till 
7pm to meet him.Even after setting up meeting as per CEO's convenience,the meeting doesn't start on time, expect delay of minimum 45 minutes to an hour. 
- Co-ordination between the founding team is almost zero.everyone talks a different version
- Very high attrition, employees are pissed off as there are no benefits and company doesn’t bother about employees.
- Even the senior guys in the company are not allowed to express thoughts and make decisions.
- CEO doesn't spend a penny but expect miracles to happen at free of cost."
342,ClearTax,"Friendly folks, lot of good work, Fin-tech startup",2016-10-10,5.0,Software Dev,"1. You get large role as ClearTax is lean and not overstaffed.
2. Founders: I really enjoy working with Ankit who I work with directly. Archit I interact less often but he's technically quite sharp. He is also busy with non-tech. Srivatsan is fun to hang out and I like his product insights.
3. I like working with Prasanth and Ananda. They are great listeners and work very hard to create a culture of transparency.
4. New office facilities are comfy. Pantry has good coffee.
5. CA team is very friendly and patient.",1. It takes some time to get product context as Taxes and fin-tech is new for me. So early on its a struggle. I have suggested new process for new joinees.
343,ClearTax,Solving problems for real users.,2016-10-07,5.0,Sales,"- Nice people who are supportive and patient
- Great founders who are always helpful and available
- Nice office facilities","- It is a startup so policies etc are sometimes not there
- Not much cons"
344,ClearTax,"Good People, Excellent CTO, Terrible Management, Sub standard product.",2016-10-05,2.0,Software Engineer,"1. The CTO of the company is a gem to work with (he could very easily quit cleartax to work at biggies like Google or something but he sticks, showing his faith in the product)
2. I am really happy with the hiring standards at ClearTax and the team is extremely talented.
3. Its a startup, so has its own ups and down. It is initiative driven and if you want to do good you probably would.
4. The situation is better than it used to be back in the day, I can assure. But there is still a lot to do.","1. The ideology of the company has a serious baniya problem, which makes the company being run like a grocery store and not like a company.
2. The management doesn't seem to care much about the stuff till they can save some more bucks from the huge investment made in the company. As an example, it is okay to buy a cheaper office space in the other of the city but not caring about how the existing staff going to pay for their Uber to reach.
3. There are no perks, apart from a work from home culture, which is really good. No lunch and the offer letter, equity promises are jokes since nothing is documented.
4. The CEO of the company usually prefers big names over substance. It is okay hiring extremely senior managerial staff without having the workforce to actually build the product.
5. If you are okay doing donkey work and not smart work, this is the place for you. Number of hours put in is weighed higher than the output itself.
6. The morale of the company, especially engineering is at its lowest right now considering the attrition being extremely high. The management doesn't understand that it takes a good amount of time get the relevant tax knowledge, and by the time the engineer has it, he is too frustrated to continue.
7. If you are not an engineer, don't join. There is a massive bias between engineers and anything else (be it support, sales, marketing etc.) and also as they are massively underpaid."
345,ClearTax,Wake up CEO,2016-10-01,2.0,Member Of Technical Staff,"Good tech team
CTO and the new VP of Engineering are the best people 
You will work with some of the best engineers in the industry 
Good product 
You will get a lot ownership","Recent hire in the leadership team f engineering is a pain to work with.

Beware he sweet talks and stabs you in the back.

He is not a people leader.

People hired in the business side are a pain to work with. 

Compare everything in Flipkart. Common guys we are not Flipkart and we don't want to be Flipkart.

CEO talks about hiring in all hands and has no idea how to retain employees.

We are not CA  firm so stop taking advice from a CA who acts as the right hand of CEO"
346,ClearTax,A startup with potential,2016-09-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Good opportunity. In the fin-tech space in India, ClearTax has a product-market fit, and has a lot of opportunity to make it big
- Good people. In the past 3 months I have been here, people are helpful and friendly
- Good tech team, company is investing a lot in technology and hiring. I take that as a good sign","- If you are coming from a big company/well-setup place, you will see more unstructured way of working. My sense is processes and policies have to be setup here - as of now it is still a start-up
- Context is deep. Taxation and related areas need some time to get adjusted to, and will require some time to get used to"
347,ClearTax,great opportunity to build a large fin tech company,2016-09-23,5.0,Karnataka,"smart and talented colleagues 
committed to build products that users want
great exposure to building a large fin tech company","Very little downside, commit your heart and soul and have patience as company works out small kinks that comes with fast paced growth"
348,ClearTax,"Average place, good people",2016-09-07,2.0,,"* Good and competent people around, at least in the tech team.
* Salaries and hikes are on par with other good startups. 
* Founders are fun people to talk / hang-out with, especially Srivatsan and Ankit.","* Except for the ClearTax website (which is a solid product), the founders seem to have no idea what they want to build. Ideas are plenty, but the management and planning is really bad. ClearSave, a recently introduced product seems to be going nowhere.

* CEO doesn't treat people with respect. It was very common to see him shouting on employees the last year. A couple of senior people left ClearTax for this same reason. Things have kinda improved since then though.

* Getting reimbursements is a pain. One has to keep reminding the founders to get their money back. This is a huge pain because people are often asked to cover expenses for parties and outings from their own pockets in hopes of getting reimbursed later.

* Promises made during the time of hiring (eg., ESOPs, choice of gear) are usually not fulfilled."
349,ClearTax,Its like working in a hell,2016-08-31,1.0,,"-The people working there are are great. You get to meet some very good talent. 
-The CTO is an amazing guy.","The list is endless but will mention a few:
1. The founder/CEO is very bad at managing the company and i have no words to describe the other co-founder, I actually feel sorry for him. 
2. They have no respect for people and treat them like slaves
3. They follow a hire & fire policy. While hiring they promise you big things and in reality the workplace is a nightmare. The esop component in your ctc is the biggest joke.
4. The attrition is very very high, you would probably find just about 5% people working for more than a year. People are just stuck as they dont want to move within a year.
5. The morale of the tech team is very low and you find comfort by cribbing about your work life as everyone feels the same.
6. Work life balance goes for a toss as you are forced to work long hours and on weekends.
7. There are absolutely no benefits or perks
8. The series of positive 5 star reviews were written by one person only.
9. Not a healthy environment for female employees 
10. All the no. which they show are fudged. They openly lie about their market share. I have no clue on how they publish the same in news articles without checking it.

Note: I am forced to restrain from using strong and derogatory words as it is against the policy of glassdoor else i would have used an f word in every sentence."
