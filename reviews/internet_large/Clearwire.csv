The business model is greatly constrained by Sprint's influence.  Second, too much ownership is wrapped up in the hands of too few people.

34,Clearwire,Rotating Sales job,2015-11-18,3.0,Clear Sales Representative,Easy hours at multiple locations. If you are good at approaching strangers and trying to sell them. Then this is the job for you. The best part is that this is a good product that you won't mind selling.,As with any sales jobs quotas need to be met and they are strict on them. One con is that you work out of Best Buy stores so you never really know week to week which store they will station you at. Also working at a Best Buy sometime you get caught in the trap of helping out a customer when the Best buy employees should be doing that .

While the job was well below my skills and experience level, every single person who worked there was super friendly and eager to help customers if they could and I enjoyed my time there. The people were great and for the most part, it had a very ""we're all family"" feel. The pay was low but in a down economy, any decent job was better than no job.","I had been assured that there would be opportunities for me to advance up into a position that better suited me but after a few months it became apparent that the call center was on borrowed time and that a lot of very good people were going to find themselves looking for another job soon. Fortunately, an opportunity came up for me to take another position just as Clearwire began transitioning its call center operations to the Philippines. Sadly, many of my former coworkers were not so lucky and close to 500 jobs that were desperately needed in the area were now gone. This happened despite all of the incentives that Clearwire had been given by local government to get them to open the facility in the first place."

The perks weren't bad, and there is a really attitude of ""We are all in this together"" that really makes you feel like part of a family.",No certainty about the future and once Sprint came in moral dropped and the layoffs began.

66,Clearwire,Good till the last drop!,2014-07-22,4.0,Operations,Great group of people involved in the day-to-day operations at the end of Clearwire's line.

Clearwire hired some really great people with good energy and attitudes.,The company was never fully funded and there were lots of lay offs.

Wonderful benefits and above par compensation for the area.,Transparency was lacking in many regards which led to many insecure employees and often lowered morale.

My supervisor had me write reasons why I wasn't succeeding, and most of it was the fact that they are not gonna be able to compete with comcast or other services, which suck lackluster features. We were forced to sell clear in the computer area of best buy, where not many people were walking around. When I tried to be pro-active and walk around the store like the comcast guys I was told I wasn't allowed by my supervisor and best buy manager. If you so as happen to finally get someone to come near your kiosk they might be super excited, but land in a area which isn't serviced. So how can they blame their reps all the time? Sometimes the numbers are a indication of the companies shortcomings not mine."

This was a poorly manged company that hire mostly former Sprint rejects and gave opportunities to young inexperienced people that obviously run this potential company into the ground. Poor management and widespread frivolous spending early in the years of Clear killed the big start up company.
87,Clearwire,Glad that they give me the opportunity.,2014-02-14,3.0,Staff Accountant,"Nice culture, and great co-workers",Don't have any at the moment.

The possibilities for growth and support of all types of personalities was second to none.",Truly the only down side that I can say about working at Clearwire was that the time had to end and the people go their separate ways. I would have been happy to stay there for many years and will always look back at my years there fondly
94,Clearwire,Great experience with many opportunities,2014-01-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Infinite opportunities for upward movement,Lot of late nights working and weekends spent attached to your laptop.

97,Clearwire,Great Experience,2013-11-25,5.0,Desktop Support Associate,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Clearwire. I was set up through a college recruiting program ran by Kylah Searing. The entire process was fun and interactive. It was a program meant to get college grads used to work life. Exactly what I was looking for. The company culture was awesome. It was a work hard play hard culture. People shot around dart guns, messed around, had fun, pulled pranks, Thirsty Thursdays, etc. The CEO (Erik Prusch) was always around the office and would acknowledge anyone and everyone. At one company event there was whip cream pie to the face challenges. Erik was the first to get on the ground and start cleaning the cream off the floor. Great demonstration of leadership. The company put an emphasis on this by having cubicles for everyone on the same floor. 
 
Towards the end of Clearwire Beth Taska took over as CHO. She ran a number of self development classes meant to educate and improve the live of employees inside and outside of work. She had a number of interactive exercises that I still use to day in my day to day routine when conversing with people. 

The college recruitment program involved a mentorship program. It was pretty amazing because all the kids recruited from college had mentors that helped them receive new jobs at other companies after we were all laid off. I can say that my mentor was incredibly patient and taught me more than I could have learned in any other support position. My GPA is not great, but my resume and job experience trumps my college transcripts.","Its really too bad that Sprint let go of so many people that made the culture at the company. It was crazy to see how the company culture disappear over night. People walking around with vibrant smiles no longer enjoyed their time at Clearwire. I actually feel bad for those still there (I was there 8 months). However, when a company merges, this is all part of the process. No need to be bitter here. No one means anyone harm, its just business and wherever there are lay offs, there are new companies recruiting and growing everyday."

100,Clearwire,"The Kia of Internet, but solid at times.",2013-10-29,3.0,General Manager,Young management and Senior Leadership allowed more flexibility and creative flows.,The company was expanding so fast during 2010 that a lot of non-experienced managers were thrown into positions of leadership they would have never landed in the real world. For example - some people not equipped to even be an Assistant Manager at a small town cellular store were running multiple markets. Thus - some were never truly in the position because of experience and it showed to their direct reports. Most of these weaker managers were in large markets that would produce for a corpse - and therefore the numbers were good due to do shear demographic and not skill. These managers skimmed by for years and now that Clearwire is no longer - the reality has set in and they are unemployed and will be.
101,Clearwire,"If you could stand the heat, it could occasionally be fun in the kitchen.",2013-10-25,3.0,E-commerce,"It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. Clearwire was under a lot of hardship - much of it their own creation. To get out of that situation, the company needed to take drastic measures. If you were in the right group, that situation could be really interesting. If you were in the wrong group, your time at the company could be short. Being under the gun, the company was willing to try new and different things. In some areas where senior management didn't have a ton of experience (ex. e-commerce) your ability to roam was pretty great. You didn't need to detail all the nitty-gritty...just share the results. As long as you delivered results, they left you alone to run the show.",Web technology infrastructure was archaic at best. No room to grow from a resume career standpoint once things started coming to an end. Golden handcuffs for a select few

I have never worked with such friendly and helpful colleagues. Everyone knows the company's goals and works towards them.
I also love the fact that the company works on technology that no other company in the US is working on. This is a great point of pride for me - our TD LTE network we are building.
Entrepreneurial spirit is another reason I have stayed at Clearwire. No one sticks to their job description here - there are always projects and cross functional exposure to be had.","I think our weakness is also what makes us so great.

126,Clearwire,Really enjoy working at ClearWire.,2013-01-30,4.0,Marketing Manager,"I really enjoy working at ClearWire. The culture, people, and fast-paced environment keep coming to work each day fun. We have our share of challenges, whether it's uncertainty about the pending acquisition or funding for a big project, but in my experience that's just the way the corporate sector is today.

Reading some of the other reviews I'm not quite sure what group these folks are in, but I've never noticed anything remotely close to a ""hostile"" or ""cut throat"" environment (quite the opposite, in fact). There will also always be uncertainty and change, no matter what company/industry you're in, especially Telecomm. I think some people confuse this with poor leadership, which isn't always the case.

Thirsty Thursday events are fun, leadership brings in some food and drink and everyone gets a chance to socialize with folks outside of your normal working circles. The yearly employee appreciation day is an aboslute blast, tons of fun.

I sort of mentioned it earlier, but I've found that the people at ClearWire are fantastic. Everyone is friendly, fun, and always willing to help out.","It can be tricky at times to get the funding/resources needed to drive some projects that would benefit the business, but it's just part of the deal. Pay is about average for the industry, benefits are OK (would love to see just a PTO bucket instead of having vacation/sick/floating holidays). There aren't many options around for lunch, but it's getting better with food trucks coming during the week (minor annoyance, but worth noting).

I mentioned above about the fast pace and frequent change in direction, but honestly it's not any different than anywhere else I've worked, especially in Telecomm."
127,Clearwire,Great Place to Work,2013-01-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Entrepreneurial, positive culture; strong senior management team; interesting work; dynamic industry that's everchanging (always something new); and, above all, a terrific group of employees who care about their work and each other.","There's some uncertainty, but most of the people who work here thrive in this type of environment.  If you are someone who is looking to make a contribution and further develop your skills and experiences than you'll be happy here.

-Ok pay (started me at 10.50/if You're a student perhaps like myself)","-The companies' main concern is you selling the product even if it involves not FULLY informing the customer (reminds me of the so called ""crazy car sales men"" tactics)
-The company snatches up anybody they can since their employees tend to drop like flies
-No kiosk, they expect you to hound down as many people as you can in whichever Best Buy location you are assigned to
-Befriending Bestbuy employees is assumed to ""new"" employees
-Inconsistency in scheduling/location (basically if you're expected to be compensated for your gas, you better make that daily 3 sales)
-It just all seemed unprofessional to me...if you are referred or offered by anybody I suggest you RUN, If ANYBODY is happy in this company it is because they are comfortable being pushy & have moved up  sporadically somehow (if that makes any sense?)
-Promotes growth, but that's only if you SELL SELL SELL 
-OH, your ""trainer"" usually isn't properly informed their ""trainee"" is coming
- I walked into Best Buy with the most utter confusion as to how I could find my trainer, Until I spotted her with a ""Clear"" shirt at the geek squad station, or should I say ""hanging off"" the side of the geek squad station.. sad

Also gaining knowledge of products that are new to the world of computers and  tech toys.","The location at which you work changes constantly. The hours, due to over hiring too many people, have dropped dramatically and makes that work/life balance very difficult to set budgets. And to add to the fact, if anyone is looking for any kind of  advancement any higher than the position that you are hired on at, I'd look elsewhere. This company isn't where it wants to be yet and shouldn't be giving its teams false hopes of moving up into a management or corporate position."
133,Clearwire,"Company was great, management was not",2012-12-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The company is interested in people of different backgrounds who can contribute fresh ideas to their sales/marketing teams.,Where do I begin?  The hours?  The crappy product?  The horrible management?  The sabotage?  Perhaps it was my area in the Carolinas.  Perhaps it was my awful manager.  Perhaps it was the feeling that nothing I did would help sales.  Perhaps it was the crowds of angry customers.  Perhaps it was the endless hours that I spent working when I should have been working a regular 40-50 hour week.  Perhaps it was the feeling that all of the blame for our failing market was being shifted over to me.  Perhaps it was all of these things.  But perhaps it was the lack of honesty that was utilized with the customers.  That might have been the biggest con that I had with Clearwire.
