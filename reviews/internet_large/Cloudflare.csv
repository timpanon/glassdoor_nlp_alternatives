Encourages writing about work you've done, support for standards work.","Compensation is below market after a few years and promotion is rare. Hiring comes from outside. HR makes promises about fixing this but doesn't follow through.

Heavy favoritism: some teams get allowed to make problems for others, other teams bear the costs and aren't recognized."

- Smart, impressive people everywhere
- Sales management understands sales org problems and is patient with new hire struggles
- Constant updates/investments for products
- United Healthcare paid for
- RSUs and ESPP should pay off in future
- Way happier here than last company","- Sales org is messed up generally (low standards of salesforce hygiene, many people lazy in terms of activity), probably more so to so much scaling/growth
- No territories today (you could work accounts in California or Vermont) and you have to find YOUR OWN accounts, start book from SCRATCH
- Lots of confusion/conflict with ROE due to lack of territories
- Constant struggle to find (even sometimes to keep) accounts
- Due to above, difficult first 12-18 months for new hires
- More of a product-led org than sales-led (CEO does not like sales people)
- BDR org has extremely low standards. No cold calling, they do not even CALL leads, they will just email. Don't qualify their own opps, they just get a reply and let AE qualify with prospect. They're not hungry to get opps or even close deals
- No 401k match
- OFFICE FIRST company (weird about remote) but that is changing finally"

The executive team is humble, passionate, and dedicated to making Cloudflare a great place to be.

It is growing a lot which attracts good talent to its teams. Good work/life balance and good compensations and benefits.,"After working more than a year in this team, I have realized that only loyal employees to the head of BDR are promoted. 
Not the most skilled, not the most experienced, or even those who met their sales goals for many Qs in a row. There is a great interest from the highest management of this team that the top performers remain without a promotion for as long as possible and this results obviously in a constant drop in motivation and escalations to HR. It is quite common for management to change the rules on how BDRs will be compensated and even the responsibilities already agreed by contract. This causes great insecurity in the team. 
The strategy seems to be simply to increase the number of BDRs without modifying processes that could help the organization obtain greater profitability and cost savings. Not many career Opportunities if you start on this team."

65,Cloudflare,Disappointing. Toxic and hostile culture.,2019-07-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"This did give me an opportunity to move up in my career. I don't regret taking on this job, but do regret putting so much into it.","The ""Helpful"" reviews here are already spot on. Be prepared to deal with pathological liars and folks who do favors outside of work to get what they want. There are also no performance review cycles, so good luck trying to fix any systemic issues at their core. Read: You can't. 

There are no actual career ladders and the one HR rolled out is a joke. Don't expect significant bumps or promotions after you negotiate your initial offer. Especially if you're a person with integrity and won't lie/do favors to advance. The equity isn't worth staying for as it is stingy for their size compared to other SF tech companies. 

The burnout is real.

Get what you need from here and move out."

Most of the 5 star reviews are from first-week employees encouraged to write a good review and tell how cool is this place. It is not.
It's pretty obvious what reviews are natural and realistic, as they're triggering the Head of people to respond and tell how they're looking into the issue. So much looking into the actual problems, that nothing has changed over the year (compare reviews from a few years ago versus newer ones and you'll see that people still complain about the exact same issues). And nothing would suggest things are getting any better. Responding to reviews with the same old BS, is only making it even worse.

A pretty good place to work overall, but a disappointing employer nevertheless."
68,Cloudflare,Awesome place to work and great company culture,2019-04-09,5.0,Security Manager,Cloudflare hires intelligent employees who are nice and enjoy their work. It's a great place to work because everyone is invested in the mission to help create a better internet and is willing to help out with problems across the company.,Would be nice to have a 401k match.
69,Cloudflare,"Fast paced, challenging and exciting",2019-04-02,5.0,Solutions Engineer,Lots of opportunities to make your own journey and a lot to learn.

Internet security & performance is also a very important and interesting topic.,The company is growing fast and not everything is perfect.
70,Cloudflare,Great Time to Join,2019-03-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you like being part of building things from scratch, taking ownership of projects yourself, helping build structure and sustainability for the long-term, this is a great place to work.
If you want to be challenged to learn about how the Internet really works, at one of the few places where everyone really needs to learn how the internet works, this is the place to be.
If you like working with people who really care, and are building an enduring company, but are not ruthless or arrogant, you will fit in here.","If you like a lot of structure and a defined focus, you will be made to feel uncomfortable. We are building out structure and accountability, policies and processes, etc., but we are not entirely there yet. We need people who want to help build those controls but don't need them."
71,Cloudflare,Delighted to be Here,2019-03-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"While going through the recruitment process, I was concerned by a few of the postings I read on Glassdoor, specifically about the CEO, and how he engages with employees. I reached out to a good friend who works at Cloudflare, and they took the time to go through the negative reviews and share their perspective with me. That conversation helped alleviate some concerns, still, I feared that after joining things might take a turn for the worse. 

My concerns went away my first week during orientation. Upon hearing the CEO speak to our onboarding cohort it became evident he's a passionate, intelligent, caring, and thoughtful leader. Throughout the week it also became clear that Cloudflare is full of equally passionate, intelligent, caring, and thoughtful individuals. 

Every day I come into the office, excited for the work I'm doing, and for the people I have the privilege of doing it with. I have regular experiences (daily) which validate my decision to work here. Cloudflare is AMAZING and the people who work here are genuinely good human beings — intelligent, capable, and inspiring — and a delight to work with. I couldn't be happier!","Like many fast growing companies we have our growing pains. I don't know that I've got enough information to diagnose what the biggest challenges are. Still, in the  conversations I've had it's clear that people are engaged, interested in understanding where we can improve, and will to expend the energy to make things even better (and they're already pretty awesome)."

75,Cloudflare,Engineer,2018-10-15,5.0,Full Stack Engineer,"Engineering is world class. I don't know how Cloudflare manages at under a 1k of employees to bring together so many brilliant, creative minds. 

There are a variety of teams that all have different pros and cons. You can be fluid in your role if you are a go-getter that likes making an impact. In every team, your job is what you make it and there is a ton of room to grow and reach out beyond the scope of your role or even your team.

Austin office is isolated in terms of freedom of creativity and informed risk-taking, yet integrated with the rest of the company in terms of engineering practices and company goals.","The company is at a stage where certain teams are being corporatized. Process in some teams takes up more effort than deliver value, which I believe is typical at this stage in a company.  Good news is, Austin office and product strategy particularly are protected from this trend."

Social good projects like Project Galileo and Athenian Project make me feel super proud to work here. 

We are growing and leadership always works to make sure folks have career opportunities and pathways.",As the company grows things change and change can be hard. I think they are approaching this growth in a super thoughtful and strategic way but there are always growing pains.

79,Cloudflare,Engineer,2018-07-18,1.0,Software Engineer,Nice facility and good location. Short walking distance from Caltrain.,Lots of incompetent people in upper management loves to belittle and overwork their employees. Lost respect for upper management. COO doesn’t do anything but complain about dirty dishes. Like seriously? Is that your only contribution? Thank god having real skills matter... just because you have an MBA doesn’t mean you know everything.
80,Cloudflare,"Brilliant engineers, worst leadership in the Bay Area",2018-07-18,1.0,Engineering Manager,"The brightest engineers, full stop.","The CEO is a petty narcissist, that freaks out whenever there is an incident, and shows zero trust in his team. It’s been a known problem for years. No one does anything about it, because they are afraid of him, which is strange, because he’s not a particularly charismatic or intimidating person.

Leadership openly asks managers to write positive Glassdoor reviews, and responds to negative reviews by suggesting employees take it up with their manager. Unfortunately, there is a culture of managers not listening to employees, so nothing changes.

CEO is obsessed with creating an “office culture”, but can’t seem to describe to anyone what that means. 

Leadership loves to toss around the “seat on the rocket ship” analogy, but blatantly ignores the fact that rocket ship level engineering requires rigor, deliberation, transparency, and often, moving slower to make sure the right engineering is being done. 

The company lurches from one incident to another, never really learning from mistakes, yet is obsessed with growing quickly.

Disaster in the making, and the best employees are leaving right and left."

83,Cloudflare,Engineering,2018-05-28,1.0,Engineering,"- Interesting product
- Unlimited PTO (whether you can take it is another matter)
- Close to Caltrain and Muni rail","Cloudflare does not have mission values or company culture that promote harmony among all employees. There is a very silo-ed and clique culture within the company and it seems that those who are early employees, hold higher level position or gained favor from the CEO, will have preferential treatments than the others.

The tone from the top seems to reflect this:
- The CEO berating engineers in the company wiki for every one to see. 
- A public tweet from the management publicly making fun of a company that tried to do business with Cloudflare 
- An offer was extended and rescinded without explanation (search Glassdoor for this review)

If you see search for past reviews, you will notice common theme on what many people think of the CEO (Hint: Arrogant).

People are leaving in droves and quickly replaced by other newcomers and the cycle continues, including high ranking employees.

If you go to LinkedIn, you can see how many people have left Cloudflare and begin to see the pattern.

The company may have a good product, but be aware of the ""culture""."
84,Cloudflare,Best and Most Exciting Job I've Ever Had,2018-04-13,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"I'm serious about the title.  First thing I like about Cloudflare is the people.  The founders have done a great job about creating a good, fun and diverse culture from the beginning.  The three core values we look for in employees are: Smart, Empathy, and Technical Curiosity.  From a product standpoint we are rocking it and our network scale and growth is awesome.  We our out-innovating all of our competitors and taking market share away from them as well as growing the market with new capabilities.  The sales team is fun, we're hitting our numbers, and growing.","No company is perfect, and we could always do better as well.  Management could do a better job of proactively working with its team members to discuss and support individual career growth plans.  We're trying to do so much so fast, that sometime we bight off more than we can chew each qtr.  More stock and more often would be better."
85,Cloudflare,Great Product and Company Culture,2018-04-13,5.0,Account Executive,Great product in a great space and the company is on a great trajectory. It's a fun place to work with great people.,Career Development and clearly defined path to grow within the company.  They preach about leaders coming from within  and how existing employees are leaders of the future but that isn't the reality.
86,Cloudflare,Incredible opportunity + great culture,2018-03-15,5.0,Customer Success,"- The future looks very bright - phenomenal growth and pace of innovation

- Smartest group of people you will ever work with
- ""Don't hire a**holes"" is the #1 guideline in recruiting here, and it shows
- Strong feeling of teamwork and collaboration across departments in working towards our mission of building a better internet
- Solid pay and benefits, plenty of opportunity to grow and move within the company","- All companies can be doing a better job with diversity in hiring and promotions. Cloudflare is certainly ahead of the pack but can always do better.
- Internal documentation + processes are a bit of a mess and need to grow up in alignment with the company's growth"
87,Cloudflare,Recent Product Manager Joiner,2018-02-22,5.0,Product Manager,"- Genuine partnership between engineering and product
- Working on important stuff - the INTERNET! No uber for cats here...
- Super technical. Ex-engineers will do well.
- No jerks
- Rocketship
- Visa sponsorship.
- Teams small enough to be start-uppy, but big enough to get stuff done.","- Rocketship... great opportunity, but also complexity and growth can be hard.
- No referral bonus"
88,Cloudflare,Account Executive,2018-02-08,5.0,Account Executive,Incredible place to work. My management is very supportive and has helped me grow. The company culture is excellent. I feel surrounded by impressive intelligent people.,I have a long commute
89,Cloudflare,The best company I've ever worked for,2018-02-08,5.0,Systems Engineer,"* Very technical co-workers
* Fantastic healthcare benefits
* Interesting internal presentations
* There are a lot of opportunities to be challenged (not just work projects, but technical reading groups, technical presentations, etc.)
* There's a lot of work to be done
* I'm never the smartest person in the room
* I have a lot of autonomy in how I work and what I work on",There are a few growing pains as Cloudflare figures out how to be a bigger company. There's a lack of cohesion in product design and development (but this is being addressed).
90,Cloudflare,"Great process, great people",2018-01-12,5.0,Senior Recruiter,"The interview process was great, and all of the meetings felt more like conversations, not interviews.   Meeting a broad range of people who were transparent, open, honest, and excited.",Office is located far from BART.
91,Cloudflare,Business Development Representative,2018-01-12,5.0,Business Development Representative,- The people are amazing and the training is very good. Is a company that it's growing and I've joined the company because I believe that they trust the potential of their employees and they want to invest in them.,- Long recruitment process and sometimes they don't email you or call you.
92,Cloudflare,People Team,2017-11-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Cloudflare has been hands-down one the best companies for my career thus far. The company's culture is strong and understands what work needs to be done and how it should be done. There's no subterfuge! I really enjoyed the extensive and deliberate interview process that I went through. It clearly showcases Cloudflare's commitment to quality and excellence.

The management team is always accessible and thoughtful about the company's growth and people strategy, which really sets us apart.",Nothing at the moment- Love this place!
93,Cloudflare,I am thrilled to be part of this company,2017-08-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people are amazing and the work/life culture is great. I came from a very hectic, cut throat culture. So it was nice to see not all tech companies existed like that.",Lots to still be built out and because of which sometimes it's a bit unorganized.
94,Cloudflare,"A perfect mix of Product, Market and People",2017-02-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Mission driven company with huge market potential and an excellent product. 
Visionary leadership who is great at finding large untapped market opportunities.
Nicest group of people. 
Fast paced and a fun place to work",Under investment in certain departments such as HR have lead to less structure when it comes to performance management and career progression. Company recently hired Head of People so company is taking the right steps to overcome these challenges.
95,Cloudflare,Poor Leadership Overshadows Strong Product,2017-01-12,2.0,Account Executive,"Lots of really smart people that are fun to work with. 
Cool office in SOMA near ballpark.
Good work/life balance. 
Strong product, especially in the mid-market vertical.","Past reviews are spot on: CEO is arrogant.
Sales Leadership is disconnected from the front lines + added an unnecessary layer of management that further removes senior leadership. 
Tension between sales and marketing.
Compensation and equity are well below market."
96,Cloudflare,Great place with great people,2017-01-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,People really care about the mission.  Feels like we're all pulling on the same rope.  Still a relatively flat structure with a lot of visibility.  Beautiful office in a convenient location.,Perks are good but don't blow you away.  If you need all your meals provided at work this isn't the place for you. Also no 401K match.
97,Cloudflare,People. Mission. Product.,2017-01-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Smart teams, great mission, great products. I genuinely like and admire my colleagues. They are interesting, kind, funny people who also happen to be highly technical. Project Galileo, Universal SSL, Free plans for anyone all make me proud to work here.","Cloudflare isn't for everyone. If you need a defined career path and are looking for robust management programs, you'll be disappointed. Lots to do, not a ton of scaffolding. Some people will love this and thrive. Others won't."
98,Cloudflare,Declining rapidly,2016-10-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"From a purely technical point of view, the work is interesting and engaging. Once upon a time it was evening meaningful. Now, most of the big problems have been solved and it's more about sustaining what has been built.","As previous reviews have stated, basically ""senior"" management. I use that with quotes because it should imply people with experience, but this group is completely juvenile. Again, agree with a previous poster, the legal team is just odd and they take to Twitter and Facebook constantly in a way that makes you think their bonus is tied to how cool they can make them appear to the CEO. It's particularly bad lately with the election coming up as some of the in-house team are posting obviously partisan articles in ways that give the impression that it's also the company's position. If anyone should understand the rules of social media you'd think it's the attorneys...but, definitely not in this case."
99,Cloudflare,"Great market, good product (always improving)",2016-04-21,4.0,Engineering,"CloudFlare is a small company (100 engineers, another 150 in other roles) which has a big and growing impact on the Internet -- for the good.  Rather than locking website operators into a single ""stack"" from Amazon, Microsoft, Google, or other hosting providers, CloudFlare lets websites choose how to host their site and then get top-quality network edge performance and security between their users and server infrastructure, for a price ranging from free (for millions of sites with less-demanding requirements) to about 10% of what incumbents charge for Enterprise customers.

The biggest reason to work at CloudFlare is to be a part of making the Internet a better place.  In contrast to a lot of other companies, CloudFlare has an extremely permissive terms of service, valuing free speech over everything else.  While there are a lot of sites on CloudFlare which people find objectionable (for varying reasons), on balance, having open access at the network layer makes the Internet a better place.

There are some big engineering problems to solve -- handling a huge volume of web requests means every other support system is also huge -- so it's a great place to get to work on hard challenges, the latest technology, and with some really smart people.

CloudFlare has both a high media profile and a large userbase, so if you tell someone you work at CloudFlare, you're likely to get a positive response.","The biggest problem with CloudFlare is a legacy of flat organizational structure.  For a long time, CloudFlare clung to a ""flat"" organization.  This was great back when the company had 25 or 50 employees, but broke down at 100-150.  CloudFlare now has a top-tier VP Engineering and some solid engineering managers, but is still implementing the kind of structure a company doing as much as CloudFlare does needs to have.

For a long time, CloudFlare had below-market office environment (a cramped, poorly maintained space), but after 18 months of delays, we finally moved into an amazing dedicated building a block away.  People visit and compare it favorably to any company in tech.  If you want to be in San Francisco, the location is hard to beat -- a block from Giants Stadium and 2 blocks from Caltrain.

CloudFlare cash compensation is essentially at-market.  Equity compensation is less than market, but the company is also on a solid financial footing and good growth trajectory (because people actually need, value, and pay for the product), so it's hard to directly compare to more ""bubble-based"" valuations at other companies.  Benefits are decent (free snacks, but only one free meal/week).  Good health insurance, no other perks."
