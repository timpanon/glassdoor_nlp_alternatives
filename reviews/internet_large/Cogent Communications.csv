1,Cogent Communications,"Extremely high turnover, no plans to improve conditions",2022-03-20,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Decent entry-level job if you’re fresh out of college and live with your parents.,"Extremely poor handling of pandemic response; the CEO laughed off the potential dangers before finally deciding that remote work was best, then brought everyone back to the office full-time before the omicron variant pushed us back home for three months.

Besides that there’s an extremely high turnover rate for both reps and operations. My team has had to replace five people in the last year, three for the same position. 

No room for advancement if you don’t work in sales. Cost of living adjustment not on pace with inflation (but the CEO has multiple cars in the garage). Work computers are outdated and poorly managed."

14,Cogent Communications,Pretty Bad Company,2022-02-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Base is low, but the bonus being paid out in the first 6 months made it livable wages I guess.

THE CEO wonders why everyone quits in the 8 month range because that's when all the bonus are done paying out LOL.","Where should I start?

*CEO/Manager wants you to go in to work when office has Covid outbreak wtf is this?

*If you worked under a year, you have to work in the office (new policy) because CEO doesn't trust new employees

*insurance pricing recently got reduced by half but it's still pricy, so you can tell how expensive it was before and even now!

*HR never replies to emails. They were slightly better in the beginning but once an employee leaves in the company, they don't hire more people, but just let them do more work probably. Sales is different though, they like to mass hire because they know sales are always quitting after leeching the bonus.

*The company claims that everything will be fixed ASAP but no one responds to IT/support tickets internally nor externally. CEO should really be on top of the IT team not the sales people.

*Forces you to take an hour lunch and make you stay in the office 8-5, so you are basically working 9 hours because if they see in the office, they assume you already took your lunch lol."

The quality of the network and customer support is great. I've worked for competitors and their product is great and the price is great.,"MICRO MANAGEMENT ACROSS THE BOARD!!! Your biggest competition is your fellow coworkers. they will fight tooth and nail for the same account. go behind your back and steal accounts. if you get a great logo the premier team will steal it. if it's corporate the National team will steal it. GAMs carry the largest quota yet sell the cheapest product. less than 10% or reps hit quota and that's for all positions. Manager's are clueless. Most of your time is spent challenging or defending current accounts or filling out reports that have bs data that reps make up. Other reps often will steal accounts behind your back or fabricate reasons they should have it. The CRM is basically full of fake notes reps input so that their accounts are not taken away or challenged. they will screw you out of your hard earned raises with salary caps wherever it's convenient for them. So you compete with other companies, your own coworkers, channel and brokers, and again with your own coworkers. VPs are quite shady and will steal accounts. Cogent doesn't fire reps that break rules of engagement. they often tell the rep that had a deal stolen to just move on. VPs are often as shady as the reps and some more than others...."

Please be advised many of the 5 star ratings are fraudulent and a result of Cogent's internal initiative to boost their lagging Glassdoor approval ratings. They have thier management minions post false claims of a postive environment. Typically, any 5.0 star rating is an example of this.","Cogent chooses not to value its employees, it is reflected in a terrible 401k match of 2%, high benefits cost (single pays up to $400 per month, family up to $1800), employee turnover rate (nearly 80% in the first 24 months), low payout ramp in months 0 to 6. The reputation of Cogent within the industry is awful, the reputation of the CEO, Dave is worst.

In fact, I reported it after the first incident and each time afterward. They do not care about their salespeople. Dave told us personally that he views the salesforce as a cost=output. At the yearly Sales Kick Off Dave asked those tenured less than one year please stand up. 95% of the room stood up. All the reps fight over, ""On-Net"" accounts within the Cogent CRM which are businesses located on the actual fiber network, giving the company an easier time selling bandwidth to. It's a complete show trying to find accounts, and then...other reps can challenge/steal those accounts if you haven't ""spoken"" to them in 30 days. I am not making this up. The real world views this company as a joke. Look at their stock price compared to earnings. Dave is just pumping it with dividend increases YoY without merit. Their p/e ratio is over 700 right now.

You start with an empty CRM and spend time Googling leads and hunting them though their database of which all are taken by some new rep. You are considered a good rep if you get to 20% of quota. When Covid forced everyone to work from home the CEO went on eBay and bought hundreds of 10 year old Dells and had them re-imaged for the sales force. They are mandating return to office 5 days a week and most offices are in downtown areas. No compassion from upper management. The only people upper management care about is the original investors in the company, but the worst part about this role and company is that you just simply cannot succeed or make any money due to their structure, network setup, old data centers that are capped, and race to the bottom with price for service. 

Constantly firing and hiring. CEO has no issue with calling his employees frauds. They pay reps a little money when they fire them not to post anything bad about them online. Proceed with caution"

But this is only because years of burning and churning sales reps caught up with them and UNLIKE most Telecom companies, they realized that it costs less to keep a rep for 2 years to let them ramp up versus the IDIOCY of most companies that fire sales reps after 6 months for not hitting quota.","They do WAY over hire - especially for the NAM position. What it comes down to is that there are not enough ""on-net"" buildings to support the number of NAM's they have. I did the math based on the number of tenants in ""LIT"" buildings. RAM's are far better off because there are far more tenants / prospects with one to two locations. Also, Dave Schaeffer sometimes arrogantly inserted his LEFTIST political views on conference calls hiding them behind ""social justice issues"" when they were clearly a back handed slap against then President Donald Trump.

Most companies that fall into a good fit for Cogent are already in the Salesforce database with contact information. The product portfolio is very simple...Its all data connectivity and co locations services. Price wins here for sure.","Very high sales turn over rate and sales managers. The contacts that are in the Salesforce database have been ""reached out to"" several times by different reps and they don't want to hear the same sales pitch. The company wants you to ""Challenge"" accounts that belong to another rep if its not being worked properly having your manager contact the other manager to move the account over to you to work.

A Director at Cogent is a high paid secretary; they don't do anything more than raising ICBs and throwing you under the bus if you don't sell.

It’s a sales job, so I understand that there will be consequences if you don’t hit your numbers, but to threaten people’s jobs within 2 weeks of working and then to continue that after training is a horrible way to manage people. 
During my time there, I was told “I always talk down to women clients, because women don’t know what they want until a man tells them.” Some racist comments were made and even after I said something they just continued. I tried to reach out to HR to address the issue, but they aren’t ever available.

There are no geographical territories, so anyone can sell anywhere. All the best accounts obviously belong to the reps with tenure, so you're fighting over scraps against 600 other desperate reps. Management's main message to reps is ""sell or you're fired""."

The main focus is on year one employees....after that they almost expect you to leave. Because they measure metrix daily it is almost necessary for micro management to happen. Be prepared for that.

219,Cogent Communications,"A Corporate Monument to Mediocrity, Cronyism, and Dysfunction",2019-05-01,1.0,Customer Account Manager,"I worked here for over 3 years. I wish I didn't have to struggle to find a positive thing to say about my time here. The ever present and potent toxicity of Cogent overshadows any upside to working for this organization. 

Literally the only positive is the products you will sale for the most part are solid. There is a demand for them. However, Cogent won't get out of it's own way long enough to truly become a player along the lines of Verizon, Comcast, ATT etc

I suppose there is a decent work-life balance too. That is not because Cogent cares about such things, it's just because of legal precedents brought on by past issues.","I'm not sure where to begin the attempt to walk across an ocean negatives. I suppose I will start by saying, that if there was a place that mediocre, C-student frat boys and high school peakers went to push the boundaries for underachieving, that place would definitely be Cogent.  There will be very little said in this write up that hasn't been said about Cogent ad nauseam on any review you'll find on Glassdoor. Helpful hint: it's all true. This place is a soul sucking toxic pit. I endured it for 3+ years. A rare feat based on the average lifespan of a Cogent sales rep. 

Throughout my 3 year tenure there, I've never encountered a more unprofessional and unaccountable work environment or colleagues. Not to mention down right dirty. And I'm not just talking about the culture. I'm talking all the way down to the filthy and antiquated office. I mean they've done virtually nothing with this place aesthetically since Bush II. 

Upon walking into the office you'll immediately see stains on the floor, on the walls,  and on the cubicles. You'll find dust virtually everywhere spewing out of the vents. You will pass by an unsanitary, cluttered break room where you will not want to touch anything - yet alone store your food there. You'll use bathrooms that will make you want to hurl on the spot. You'll pass by employees that do not wash their hands or flush. They lack even the most basic office etiquette. Not long after you will hear a racist, sexist, or homophobic conversation piece - probably from a manager. The office I am describing could be virtually any Cogent office through the U.S. if not the world. I am specifically talking about Herndon, VA office where I worked.

Cogent has the classical dog-eat-dog culture you'll find in a lot of telecom organizations. But at Cogent, that's encouraged and welcomed. I've never worked anywhere with so much dissension and infighting among colleagues. The only thing that comes close is a penitentiary's culture. This primarily comes from there just being too many Sales people chasing after the same nickel. Sales people will sell to your account with often very little to no consequence at all. They will undercut you directly and then 'challenge' (ie steal)  your account if they get any interest from your customer. Though Cogent will pretend otherwise, there are no Rules of Engagement when it comes to sales. Cogent operates on shades of gray and there are no lanes. As a result, you get internal chaos, noone respecting territory, and these week long ordeals known as 'The Challenge Process'. Noone stays in their swim lane, noone knows how to prospect, and as a result it creates chafed customers as well as employees.  

The morale at Cogent is so low it is palpable. It's not worth your time getting to know anyone until they've been there for at least a year or two. The revolving door at Cogent spins so fast and so often, I've seen the entire NAM/RAM/GAM sales floor completely turn over 5 or 6 times.  The turnover at Cogent has to be the highest in telecom...even for sales period. Every other day you will see new faces and wonder what happened to 'so and so'. I shudder to think how much Cogent drops on turnover each year. There is no stability. Job security, even for performing employees, is dicey at best. Especially if you don't fit in and play 'the game'. Cogent has a LBJ administration approach to sales – just keep throwing warm bodies at it. 

Management is bullyish and casually threatens employees jobs and plays games with people's lives. There are too many people in positions of power that should not be. This is a company where accountability means nothing. If you don't succeed at Cogent, then it's your fault. Not the toxic culture of uncertainty, instability and fear that you have to exist in. They have a turnover of nearly 100% of the course of a year. And they have taken no steps to change it. 

 It will one day be this company's downfall. You have to remember, that company culture comes from the top and not the bottom. This cutthroat, 'Wild West' approach is propagated and encouraged by management that prefers it that way. Rather than make your own pie, steal someone elses's – that is the mentality and integrity of a Cogent sales rep. This mentality stems from Cogent being rife with power crazed, shady middle to upper management. They're headed up by an even worse yet clueless ivory tower CEO that will rationalize and justify, if not downright trivialize, any issue raised by employees. Advancement is not a problem you will have at this company. Because that aren't any. There is no opportunity for advancement other than becoming a higher level Account rep. The managerial positions are mostly all occupied by an old boy's club member. Most reps will not even take manager positions because they don't want to hire, train, and fire an employee literally every month. Most reps will make more money... well... as reps. It's hard to manage when all you do is operate the revolving door.  

Am I selling you on how gratifying it is to work at Cogent yet? Moving onto non-sales/Account Management staff who you must interact with on a daily basis in order to get paid: Sales Engineers, Service Delivery, Support Engineers, Contracts People and other mostly non-revenue generating employees. There is an ongoing issue at Cogent where these employees do not feel that they have to talk to a customer by any means other than e-mail. I mean just basic customer service is something that is discouraged, and if you ever suggest they provide it, well... just don't. You'll never hear the end of it. I've never worked with employees whose jobs and paychecks, that primarily come from the work that you do and business that you bring in, go out their way to be adversarial roadblocks. There is so much choking bureaucracy in that organization that it is next to impossible to get even the simplest tasks accomplished. If there's any way they can make your life as a Salesperson even more difficult, they will. They will sabotage you and your customer thereby ruining the business relationship.

All telecom companies have their issues, but Cogent really is the 'Albino Crocodile' of them all. CEO does not believe in telework, advertising,  giving employees laptops, and will rarely permit any travel in order to conduct business with a contact. He also will not pay for certain company certifications to make customers that have security concerns take Cogent products seriously. To abbreviate, he's just cheap. I mean this guy from a business perspective is stuck in the 90s or maybe even the 70s trying to lead a company in the present day. It's just not working. One day hopefully he will wake up, realize it, and sell this company or better yet simply walk away. Cogent does not have what it takes to successfully compete in today's tech space. This is because Cogent is a company constantly at war with itself. It will chastise and run off anyone that wants to see it change for the better. It will conspire against and ultimately oust anyone that tries to hold their colleagues to a higher standard or accountable. Your only true responsibility at Cogent is to go along to get along...selling is actually second. Anyone who upsets the balance of complacency and the 'bare minimum' attitude will find themselves out the door. Just one more of Cogent's hundreds of thousands of ex-employees. 

This place will defeat you not just mentally but spiritually. It will take any motivation you have to excel and impale it. For the love of all that is good, righteous, intelligent, and just left on this Earth,  stay away from this toxic mire of an organization."

This has happened for over ten years of Sr. Management changing starting from shady business practices to utter confusion passed down to sales force.

The CEO will take every possible risk on the backs of the employees labor while creating impossible deadlines.  Standard conditions require regular heroics from the engineering staff for the normal operation of the network.

The CEO prefers to self-insure for health-care.  He watches for hits on the pool and correlates those to sick-time.  The CEO then forces managers to justify their sick employee's job or invents a new discipline issue.

This job is not worth your humanity.  If you have the talent to succeed here, you can win more elsewhere.

As soon as you get one on the phone your manager will pressure you to call them back 3 times a week and scare them off. 

Salesforce is full of garbage contacts, people are frustrated that they get 3 calls every day nonstop, you're given absolutely no leads, 'top reps' just feed off the turnover by taking accounts that have any traction when employees are pressured to leave. You're given an misleading quota and essentially there's a huge body count of employees that feed the more senior reps. No accountability. 

Office is stained, smelly, dusty, and feels like high school detention in the 90s. The sales floor is joyless and completely quiet aside from managers clipping their fingernails at their desks.

Challenge process - you can have your account TAKEN from you in the middle of working towards a sale for a variety of reasons. Their favorite is to claim an account is 'out of your swim lane' because they define any business that 'exists because of the internet' as a ""Global Account"".

Every single sales person here says that this is by far the worst company they have ever worked for. 

- The company is a revolving door and extremely unstable for sales people.  The market is not segmented,  sales people can "" build cases"" to take another sales person's account! Consequently,  there is a very hostile environment  that is deliberately created by management. 

- Horrible work/life balance. The directors/managers are cops who watch how long you've been at lunch. They will deduct from your pay/vacation balance if they think you haven't put the right amount of activities in the system. No working from home under any circumstance (although all the work can be remote). Employees have sued the company over bad work conditions and unfair work hours related to overtime, so the CEO takes the progressive and smart decision to ban working from home entirely!
 
- Dirty, dusty offices with no windows. 

- Over half the company's employees are sales people. Only 5% of all sales people actually hit targets (that tells you something). 

- Due to the hostile environment, sharing success stories, teamwork and collaboration is nonexistent. 

- Almost all sales people are put on plan at some point.
 
** an example of Cogent's quirkiness and unfair treatment: they are holding a sales acceleration summit in Vegas, but if you are on plan then you cannot attend! Very humiliating and unjust- especially since going on plan is just part of the employment cycle here.

It's ironic because during training in the first month, we have orientation twice and each time we are told to sell to every single business there is possible. Start up companies were included in this list. My boss thought I was an idiot for trying to sell to start ups and then told me to find something I was ""passionate"" about and try selling there. I found lawyers and doctors to try selling to, and then he said ""try again, those people won't budge worth your time"". Then I tried contractors and architects, he still said no. When I finally quit, I told the training manager why, and I told her it was because everything I learned from her during training was thrown out the window when I was in the office and it made no sense why.

First off I took the gig to see if this would be a good fit or not, in the end it wasn't for me and I left on my terms.

Dave Schaffer is the one leading the show, and apparently everything goes through him. And I mean everything. IMHO that’s too much power for someone that has the company traded on NASDAQ, but I digress. This is to give you some perspective on why you should or shouldn’t consider Cogent. They have four main sales roles: NAM, RAM, GAM and ISR.  National Account Manager, Regional Account Manager, Global Account Manager and Inside Sales Representative. I was a GAM, so you get to hear this from my perspective. The GAM is a high profile role with little upside unless you have been there about 3-4 years. As a GAM what does that title give you? no travel, no opportunity and more pressure to make 50-80 calls a day using sales force as a metric tool from a call center, work from home is not an option. Also you have to do your own prospecting, there is no Marketing support, so don’t expect a book of leads to come in your way. They call the mornings the golden time to prospect, they all start at 830 am eastern and end at 5pm eastern. Yes you are frowned upon if you leave early, get the picture?  You have to do your own research and Cogent does no national advertising. They only do data center tours as their largest  marketing push.  The call centers are converted old PSI net properties and it shows.  Generally warehouse buildings with call centers in front or data centers with low, low cubes, possibly sick buildings, and a frat house/ High School Click  mentality  with staff and management. Sounds like fun right? 
The people at my location in VA were nice that were there longer than 1 year in tenure for the most part, but don't expect to be there long, they have a very high churn rate. If you like living in the early days of telco (2000's) with a passion for a company that has no desire to sell more than 4 products and NOT sell to the federal government and lives by the motto “dumb pipe for smart people” and provides a backstabbing cliquish High School mentality then go ahead, knock yourself out. Financially realistically when talking with other folks and looking at my numbers you won't make more than 125k after your first 12-18 months on the job or in fact probably not much more than that year over year in your career in one of the 4  positions if at all.  There is a  low-ball base and a monthly target goal that is impossible by design to reach after your 4th month on ramp up,  unless you have been there 4-5 years( and if you are there  that long well then good for you) But please look elsewhere if you want to make more money with the amount of stress and misguided management  that runs the company.
There I have said my peace, you are old enough to make your own decision, I would say avoid them and try  your luck with other ISP's that treat  their employees with better pay  and products  that are relevant for the 21st century customer. Like a Verizon, AWS, GOOGLE or Level3 etc…that make smart pipe for smart customers and care about their employees.  Or if you still like your gig with Starbucks stay there, it's less hassle for your time. No one job is perfect, nor is one company, but I was very disappointed even for the low bar standards I set for myself with Cogent.  Good luck and happy Job hunting, hopefully this was helpful."

-Dress is relaxed, no need to wear suits or anything that nice, unless you schedule offsite meetings, as this job is almost completely inside sales/networking. 
-Cogent circuits install! You get decent commissions on your sales and unlike other telcos, you dont have to worry about orders being canceled and not getting paid for them!","Not really any leads at all to work with, you must find everything yourself!
-Most people we call dont really know Cogent because they dont spend on advertising!! Sometimes very difficult to compete with the big boys (Verizon and ATT etc) when everyone knows them and not us.

-Do not put a whole lot of stock into what sales training suggests. Their approaches will only work in the southern US or in canada or the western US where people actually have time to speak with you.
In major markets, especially NYC, people only want the services if they absolutely need it and you are concise, and able to make their lives easier.
-Most major markets are completely saturated because there are so many reps across the country who hoard accounts even if they are not getting anywhere with them. You need to scratch and claw to find interested accounts, and do everything right to nail down the sale.

Office is very basic, no room to eat lunch, no TV in the break room. No Summer Fridays where most ppl get to leave early (I dont think 3:30 on a Friday is too much to ask)

Compensation is nothing to smile at. Virtually no room to grow here and they do not give salary increases."

352,Cogent Communications,Mediocre Company Built Around a Great Network,2015-10-29,3.0,Account Manager,"The #1 pro about Cogent are the people, this place builds camaraderie quickly because you're ""in the trenches"" together and share all the same challenges.
If you're fresh out of college the pay is actually pretty good (especially the $4k ramp bonus), but to rise in income you'll need to move within the industry in most cases.  Since the telecom industry is incestuous, if you've been at Cogent longer than a year people will have a certain amount of respect for you.  
The training program in DC is good despite what other reviews might say; the product is so simple that if it takes you longer than 2 weeks to grasp it (DIA not COLO) then the problem might be with you, in my opinion.  There is also ongoing learning which can sometimes be pretty useful, especially if you're new to telecom.  Also, this isn't the case in some telecom companies apparently but if you have a question here about products or network you will very easily find the answer by asking around in the office.  
The other thing is that you can make money here if you learn how to survive and get the right accounts, even though commissions were lowered from last year and rumor is that they'll be going down again next year.  
ONNET opportunities are easy to win and have the best & quickest payout.  EVERYTHING here gets installed, literally I have never seen a service cancelled because we couldn't install it (although it happens).  Which leads me to the next point - the network.  The Cogent network is rock solid and if you go on downdetector.com and compare Cogent to other networks you'll get an idea.  
And if there is a problem, the customer service here is probably the best in the industry.  The response times are super fast and the customer will talk to a network engineer directly, no being passed around departments.","Now onto the cons....
First of all, you will be working in a call center.  There are no 2 ways about it unless you're hired as a remote employee.  
You'll be selling a product that's almost a commodity at this point for a higher price (offnet).  ONNET opportunities are absurdly saturated and there's always a chance they'll be taken from you by another rep who claims to have the relationship with the landlord or by the indirect channel.  Offnet has a higher quota relief but it's become increasingly hard to sell because of pricing issues that arise.  To combat this - Cogent has been raising offnet prices - yes you read that correctly.  Be prepared to answer ""why should I pay more for a company I've never heard of?""  
Additionally, since we don't offer voice, managed services, shared internet lines, or any security there is a limited ""niche"" market we can really serve well.  Everyone who's been here over a year figured it out so if you plan on being successful prepare to fight over that market with those reps.  Some reps will cross lines to steal a deal you thought was yours, so document everything in Salesforce VERY well.
You also aren't given a lot of tools.  You're given a computer and a phone.  There are no lists and leads are practically nonexistent.  Pure hunter role.
This of course leads to quite a bit of turnover; when I got here it was between 7-8% per month.  So after a year the sales team of 300 reps had 250 - 290 new people (most lasted only a few months).  That should give you an idea.
Recently though, even operations have become a hindrance.  Just be prepared to have contracts resigned for the most minor reasons.  ""everything looks good... except you have the name of their company as 'ABC Company' and in our internal systems it's 'ABC Inc' so go ahead and get the paperwork resigned... thanks"" 
""Their actual company name is 'ABC Company'? yeah doesn't matter""  
""Oh you have previous paperwork showing 'ABC Company' and a signed affidavit from their CEO confirming it? Ok we'll make a minor name change in our systems to reflect that""
Once you overcome all of that, you are paid several months after installation so an onnet deal can take up to 2.5 months, while an offnet deal can go into the 7 month territory.  Imagine selling something in March and getting paid in October.

Bonus*****
The data center situation here is pretty bad.  I once had a current customer never speak to me again after going on a data center tour.  Ask some seasoned reps about their best Cogent data center stories and you won't be disappointed."

Meaning they understand sales bring in the money and everything is in place to make it happen.","Tends to lean toward micromanaging, however I think it's understandable why. But there is a huge turn-over. It's not an easy gig and its prettt cut-throat. Sales staff pass leads to buddies. I think bc of the high turn-over its very ""cliquey""..you tend to buddy with people you go through training with. Not a bad thing bc I am still friends with people from all over the country who I met at Cogent.  But, basically by the end of the first year if you haven't hit your stride, you're out. So, those who stay make a lot of money and are given extra ""considerations"".

Training is good. People on my team were nice enough (SM not included). Hours are fair.,"Overall there is a huge lack of regard for the 300+ sales reps. Especially the new hires coming in.  Getting any fresh ideas, focused  strategies and implementation, really depends on who your Sales manager and Director are. In my case one of the unlucky ones.  Also they play favorites, every policy way possible for the 100+ seasoned (national & Global account managers), all looking to take piece of your action, which more than likely is already taken by them. New business has been hard to find because of this, so they have been trying to focus on off-net deals which are harder to come by due to pricing and lack of relationships or they are with a whole seller we do business with that we cannot go after as not to get them angry for going after business they a selling  form a another provider. Sales cannibalism are this company's strengths. Which sucks for anyone looking to start off here but great for the higher ups who  can just replace them with a fresh set of reps at its whimsy. If you are new to telecomm or against a telesales environment, then I would recommend not working for this company."

Co.] within the CRM database."
399,Cogent Communications,You get what you pay for,2014-06-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The CEO is very business savvy. Unlike similar companies in the same market space, Cogent's business is stable (largely due to focusing on core competencies and product) and so are their positions (which they've slowed added in recent years). Low to mid-level upward mobility in tech side. Good benefits and place to ""learn the ropes"" if you are just starting out in the industry.","The CEO is very frugal and all but controls most aspects of the business. Because of that, if he were hit by a bus (not suggesting, just being hypothetical) I do not know how long the company could keep running. I akin this to being the ""Superman"" from Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Also IMHO, it is being run like it is still small, which I feel is now holding the company back in various ways.

Despite what the CEO kept claiming, salaries that I have seen were below the market and was reflected in the turn-over rates. On the tech side, no company provided training is available. The technology/product is just a means to an end to make the stock holders money, I saw little evidence for any care or passion for supporting it. All of this makes Cogent an atypical, ""you get what you pay for"" place to work."

Free lunches if your teams hits monthly goals and you get free lunch the end of every month","I have no major company wide complaints. It really depends on the office you're in and the type of manager and director you have. There is too much in market competition with other sales teams. There are no protected local territories, it is like the wild west. You have 30 days to crack the egg on a lead. If you can not and it is not documented, you lose the account: So if you've had a lead for 20 days and you finally get a hold of a decision maker on the 21st day, but they want you to call back in three weeks. If your manager does not feel its viable and you lose the account, someone else can pick it up where you left off.

Internally, there is a battle between the local sales leadership and upper sales management about the plan to attack the market.  Upper sales management believes this to be an inside sales job while the sales managers want it to be an outside sales job.  Sales reps are very confused about how to attack the market because the directives from local sales leadership and corporate are in conflict.  Turnover rate at least in the my market is VERY HIGH and has been for several years.  The base salary is also quite low and more in line with an entry level sales position."

The upper management is readily available to assist the reps in anyway they can. I can literally dial Dave's (CEO) VoIP extension, if he'll pick it up. While the base salary is modest, the commission and bonus structure is fantastic for people who are willing to work hard. 99% of people that complain about how terrible a sales role in a company is happens to be that lazy person making 10-15 calls a day complaining about closing 1 deal every 2 months, instead of making 50-100 calls a day and closing 5-6 deals a month.

Free beverages
Free lunch on the last day of the month
Great commission rate
Very good training at the beginning","Can be extremely hard to complete sales, especially to new customers
Can be up to 6-8 months to receive pay after closing sale, minumum is 1 1/2 months.
Sales cycle can last beyond 6 months
Turnover rate is too high.  Just 3 of the 12 people I trained with are still with the company 1 year later, and my office has 100% turnover rate in under 2 years.
On-going training is weak, depending almost entirely on the office manager."
440,Cogent Communications,"A mid-sized company, that is nimble to changing to market needs.",2012-10-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company is large enough for stability, but small enough that employees at any level can affect change. The company is technology focused. I always had a sense of excitement of the network we built and supported and at the point in my career I worked for Cogent, it was my dream job.","Focus on the bottom dollar can sometimes result in losing sight of the human element of employees. At times, employees can be spread at a bit thin."
441,Cogent Communications,Great place to start your sales experiences for the first time.,2012-09-10,5.0,Regional Account Manager,The management helps guide you in the right direction but doesn't hold your hand once you are on your feet.,"Cold calling all day, finding prospects on your own."

Polite and Knowledgable Managers","Poor Pay
Lack of products to sell.
Legacy account manager have all onnet accounts. Meaning you are left selling un-competitive offnet products."
443,Cogent Communications,IF THEY CALL YOU FOR AN INTERVIEW- RUN,2012-08-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Sign on bonus. Free sodas.,"Management, Management, Management. All they do is babysit reps all day and micromanage them to the point you feel like you're handcuffed to the chair and just make dials liek you're a call center. You're hired as an ""account manager"" but it might as well be a preschool. You can sell a lot of units helping the manager's hit their numbers and they still treat you like crap. Turn over rate is probably 90%. Never seen so many people get fired, quitting, hired at any job. Management makes everyone miserable which makes people not want to sell anything for them. They don't tell you about the minimum number you have to hit in your first year. If you don't hit it you get canned. They have a strike system after your first year which they don't tell you either for a long long time."

full benifits","heavy politics 
pretty heavy micromanegement"
445,Cogent Communications,Poor employer,2012-07-26,1.0,RAM,Product was fun to sell,Sweat shop model. No employer loyalty to employees.

447,Cogent Communications,"Account Manager (RAM) - Los Angeles, CA",2012-07-08,2.0,Regional Account Manager,"* Good job for someone right out of college
* Okay base with 4 month ramp up commission (not a draw)
* Everyone is friendly for the most part
* if you get a good manager you can make some good money.  If you don't you better start looking for another job. 
* Good spot to hold you over until you find something better.","* A lot of cold calling
* Manager was more of a school teacher disciplining the team, than helping them closer deals.   
* Not a job for a true sales person (closer) 
* Direct manager did not have strong sales skills to help close business
* If you do not sell something in your first 6 months you're fired
* High turnover rate - I was there for less than a year and saw nothing but non-stop change 
* stuck at a desk 40 hours a week
* They trace your calls to the second and review it every day - I would have rather been judged by the quality of opportunities I created and not how many calls I was making. You end up making calls just to meet your daily numbers.
* No matter how long you may stay there, you are just a name on a list.  They will get rid of you in a second."
448,Cogent Communications,Cogent is a call center,2012-06-27,2.0,Regional Account Manager,"Decent pay out of college, the way you are ramped up to your quota serves as a signing bonus which is nice","You are selling the internet making 60-80 cold calls a day. They monitor your talk time, call numbers, and the micromanaging is out of control."
449,Cogent Communications,Get in what you put in,2012-06-13,4.0,Regional Account Manager,"Commission is really great
Good entry-level sales job
Very easy to learn and understand products
Don't need to work with support, provisioning, etc
Ramp bonus is nice to get ready for commission","Management is more into activity count than actual sales qualities which can lead to wasted effort
No real room for negotiation"
450,Cogent Communications,Love it!,2012-05-10,5.0,Regional Account Manager,"It has a Good base, an awesome commission structure, and the manager is extremely supportive and understands how to keep a work life balance for his employees","Can't say that I have a whole lot of negative things to say about working here, others than having to sit at a desk for the majority of the day"
451,Cogent Communications,My experience was very bad,2012-04-10,1.0,RAM,They pay a relatively high base salary.,"Extreme micromanagement. Abusive and unprofessional sales management. The business model was completely unworkable. All sales people were fighting each other for sales in the same lit buildings. The sales force was constantly being threatened with being fired by the managers. Anyone who complained about all the abuse to HR was  labeled a ""disgruntled employee"" and fired immediately. They use a software system called Seibel to track every phone call and e-mail you send out. People were constantly leaving because of all the micromanagement and abuse. There was a 150% turnover rate! About 50% quit and the other 50% were fired. No one stays there longer than 6 months. The high salary is only used to lure you into the company. You won';t last there a year to collect it. The company was too cheap to pay for electronic access control on the doors. One employee who was fired came back drunk and got into a brawl in the middle of the office with six other employees and managers. This company has developed such a reputation for bad management that managers at Cogent can't get management jobs with other telecom companies. This company could best be described as having a dysfunctional ""psycotic company culture"". Stay away from this company, everyone i know who worked for Cogent has such a low opinion of this company that they don't want to put it on their resume."
452,Cogent Communications,Good place to start your career.....,2012-03-19,2.0,,"Good product, price points, small enough where they can make quick decisions and changes.","Again almost too quick to make decisions, change the products/pay plans on the reps almost every few months.  Not sure of who will be there at the beginning of each month, as there will be terminations every 1st of the month without fail.  Lots of favoritism, similar to a high school and who your ""friends"" with."
453,Cogent Communications,"No Support, No Movement",2012-03-18,2.0,Regional Account Manager,"Th competitive pay and benefits; comes with a signing bonus while you get your feet wet, company match kicks in right away on 401k, medical and dental very good. co-worker support and cohesion,","They bring you in to use you up then kick you out.  There was only one employee on the sales team that was there longer than a year and she had bounced around in the company.  It seems set up to be dead end within a year, give you quota targets that in such a competitive industry your bound to fizzle out, managerial support is non existent."
454,Cogent Communications,Opportunity to make some nice money,2012-03-01,5.0,Regional Account Manager,You get what you put in. Work hard. Get rewarded hard. Luckily for me that's my attitude. It's a hunter position so as long as you're willing to put in the effort the rewards are well worth it. Longevity in the company really pays off.,"Just like any sales organization, you have your off days/weeks/months but that's standard for the industry. Sometimes it can be grueling staring at a computer screen for 8+ hours a day."
455,Cogent Communications,"Ok for a starting job, but don't expect it to last",2012-03-01,2.0,Regional Account Manager,"It's a nice way to get into telecom, as there aren't many products
Managers were nice, and triied to help me a lot
Free beverages was a nice perk","Too many people selling into too few buildings
Off-net pricing isn't as competitive as it could be, so it was at a disadvantage
Gave my 2-weeks notice, was walked the same day, and FYI, they don't pay you for the two weeks, as other telecom companies do...
Only a select few can actually make quota each month - don't expect to do it much, if at all your first year.
Office was sub-par at best, not a healthy work environment to be working in."
456,Cogent Communications,Regional Account Manager,2012-01-28,2.0,,"Nice Staff, good atmosphere, family friendly.  Manager in the office is motivating and wants you to succeed.","pricing is too high, 0 leads, build your pipeline from scratch.  Upper managers talk negatively about the sales team nation wide.  They thrive on throwing you under the buss to make themselves look good."
457,Cogent Communications,The depths of hell,2011-12-28,1.0,SENIOR NOC,"If you can stand the horrible working conditions, you may be able to learn a bit.  Other than that, you can learn everything there from a book.",The teams work horribly together.  You are treated like crap.  The knowledge is kept within a close circle and is not released unless you show initiative.  Management is a joke from the low level to the top.  EVERYONE smokes weed while at work on work premises.  The facilities have boogers on the wall.  The facilities are gross and were broken for sometime before it was even fixed.  People get yelled at in front of everyone.  The pay is equivalent with a sweat shop.
