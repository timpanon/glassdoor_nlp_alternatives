7,Coinbase,Toxic leadership - employees are disposable,2022-03-31,2.0,Marketing,The independent contributors are the people that keep me around. Somehow Coinbase has attracted some very talented and hard working people.,The core value “act like an owner” means nothing. Leadership stifles all creativity and conversations that are not aligned with their personal opinions. There is very little room for growth and beware - the teams are being layered heavily with web2 “leaders” who barely contribute. This company will end up imploding. Everyone is overworked and under compensated.

Maybe things were different pre-IPO? Regardless, this is not a job for someone who needs constant guidance fed to them at each turn in the road.

When you are in nesting taking calls, they say you can ask for help and you will be helped. No-one barely got helped by any supervisors or sme’s. You are literally left to help yourself and figure things out when you know nothing! This is the first call center Coinbase has started and IT IS THE WORST!

The company offers a generous compensation package, above industry standard benefits (my opinion!), generous amount of stipend/month, and not to mention we are a remote first company!

Even though we've had a hiring spree - the leadership and hiring managers have a real talent for putting the right people together. We fit because we all have a similar vision, personality type and velocity. You can truly get things done and It's a pleasure to work amongst my kind. I've progressed lightyears in a short time and was given trust and space to grow. It's synergy and cutting edge work culture without the mental pitfalls of silicon valley. I'm truly honoured to be part of the team and am confident in my leadership ( and I don't trust any leadership).

Monthly stipends. Udemy if you have the time to utilize it.","Worst manager ever. Worse than devil wears Prada. Toxic, unprofessional and embarrassing to witness grown women behave. 100% sure the executives have been told of the toxic behaviors and the turnover. I’m sure they see nothing wrong with the environment or management style as that is how they must lead too. To allow this environment and let it grow unaltered I’m surprised they have not been sued yet. (YET) I’m guessing executives let this behavior to continue because that is how they operate also. 
Seems their philosophy is work them to death, cause there will be more to replace them with cause people are lining up to work for them and be apart of the torture. Turnover comes at a cost to current and future employees but that will be future employees problems to deal with and clean up.
Belittling, yelling, in public and in private meetings. 15-18 hour days plus weekends. Hours worked and the toxic culture and environment makes the pay not worth it."

nice to work in a cutting edge sector.
lots of growth.
nice benefits!","What you get in the interview and what you get when you start are like 2 different companies.

1. they tell you that everyone works hard but the company respects work-life balance.
2. your manager paints a great picture of the support and engagement you will get.

after starting, it became clear that the message is ""get stuff done, nobody cares what the challenges are."" that apparently that includes whether or not you got any direction or guidance, or even were told what was needed. in most meetings, people are clearly tired, frustrated and negative. 

My manager knew who was I was before I joined, but after - I'm not sure they could pick me out of a lineup. I see my manager every 6 weeks. This is the most disengagement I've experienced and i have to say it's really difficult - psychologically this is a very unhealthy environment. There's no support, a lot of politics, HR is nowhere to be seen. 

On paper this all seemed like it was going to be an awesome experience - growth, learning. It feels like it was a mirage."

Fully remote if that's your thing.

Recharge days/weeks are nice, all things considered.

Modern tech stack.

Lots of social and networking events. People here are pretty passionate about Crypto and it shows.","Insane expectations around worklife balance. 55+ hours seems to be somewhat expected. I've had 2 week sprints with over 100 hours of work scoped out (on top of any meetings/last minute requests from upper management, etc). I told my manager I was overloaded once and their reply was ""I thought you wanted to be the man?"" 

Burnout here is crazy. I've done multiple all nighters here over the last year and I'll see most of my team on at 1 or 2 AM. I've been in meetings where people casually mention not having a life since joining Coinbase and phrase it like a joke, but it's so obvious from the looks on their face.

Instead of solving root issues, Coinbase instead decides to throw bodies at it and hope for the best. We have way too many cooks in the kitchen.

Throw meritocracy out of the window. I was called a bar raiser for my line of work and have been told I was ""performing at a higher level"" but was passed on a promotion with the primary reason being that I wasn't in my role for long enough (this was explicitly mentioned multiple times during my official review).

I wish they had been more up front about the company mentality of ""we don't guarantee 40 hour work weeks"" and that the organizational work life balance was more clearly communicated during the interview process. After joining I was told that it was my responsibility to ensure I wasn't burning out but I think that alongside me taking my own measures there needed to be additional cultural change in the organization and support so that it didn't feel like employees and managers were on their own to figure it out and hopefully not let their team down in the process 
Recharge weeks were nice but they only happen every 6 months and taking PTO felt bad because you were leaving your already stressed team to handle your work too."

104,Coinbase,Sociopathic Management Ruining Foolproof Cash Cow Company,2021-09-23,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Full disclosure: I made a few million here just by being in at the right place and time where my option strike price was basically nothing. Which is awesome, life changing for those of us who lucked into that. I can't, in good faith, recommend anyone new to work here though.

- Above average pay + equity comp (though stock only goes down)
- Remote work is nice
- Used to have really great perks, may one day again
- Modern dev practices
- Good diversity if you care about that
- Sounds sexy on your resume I guess?","Company has pretty much been in a downhill spiral since about 4 months before it went public. This has nothing to do with the decisions about ""no politics at work"" and everything to do with outwardly hostile, sociopathic senior management that was all hired about this time.

As an engineer you will spend 2-10 hours of your week interviewing new candidates (apparently the 'hiring' team is just a passthrough), more time learning new interviews (we all have to learn 20 new ones by the end of the year!) and if you're anything past a junior engineer about 20 more hours a week will be interviews. Oh and if you're in charge of bootcamp mentoring or on call another 10-20 hours is gone from your day. So you then have to work evenings and weekends or your work just won't get done. And don't think they won't notice if you skip a Saturday, they will.

Don't expect your manager to help either because they're required by the new rules to spend 50% of their time on new hire headhunting and interviews and if you ever see your manager's schedule it's meetings 9-5 anyway. They'll message you at 8 PM asking you to do something, have a weekly sync with you where they tell you you're off track and need to work harder or you're fired in 60 days (New 'on track pulses' every quarter to keep you motivated by fear) and throw new work at you and say 'figure it out'.

Upper management sits around spewing nonsense about NFTs and how we're totally going to be saving starving African farmers with crypto any second now. Self-righteous lip service while they basically hold employees hostage to 80 hour work weeks with their stock option vesting schedule. You're here making the execs (and if you're lucky yourselves) and Chinese speculators richer, don't kid yourselves.

Oh and there's no QA or testing. Nope, zero. Don't believe in it. Instead we sneakily try to fix things in production by constantly firefighting with 'incidents'. I can't tell you all the shady borderline illegal things I've been asked to do to cover this up either. Couldn't actually test things, better put that on the engineers too. 


If this all doesn't put you off though I will admit, great place to make money. If the stress doesn't kill you by 40 you can retire."

- Since crypto is a very fast paced field, you will often have multiple projects on the go at the same time so work-life balance is usually relatively bad, although the company does offer re-charge days (and weeks) so that we can all take time off.
- This is the biggest con: you get assessed if you're ""on-track"" or ""off-track"" every quarter, if you're ""off-track"", you have 60 days to fix it. Quite an aggressive stance, similar to Amazon's PIP program which is notoriously toxic."

-Comp structure updates / equity grants are actually worth something","-Lack of formal mentorship. The only person who is really 'in my corner' is my manager. But if you're like me and have a manager who is a first-time people manager, that's not that helpful.
-Growth is so rapid that it can be hard to find your footing/understand how your work and your role fits into the org
-As much as we're growing, the team is still lean. You need to prioritize and shield your time, otherwise people will pull you in 100 directions and it's hard to say no when you're still new
-Not enough feedback. I have only gotten feedback when I specifically solicit it. I would like to see people using forums like Lattice more to shout out great work.
-The way internal comms are handled is sometimes distasteful. For instance, when we had articles in NYT that claimed we were not treating certain POC employees fairly, the comms we received from Paul/Kim were basically ""that's factually incorrect. There is evidence to the contrary."" I understand we need to be careful about what we say, but it came off as truly disrespectful to people who have experienced mentally difficult work situations without acknowledging that what they experienced could be real (and also may have been handled in a way that was appropriate at the time by Coinbase). It's really easy to make POC feel like racism is in their head, and I was horrified that Coinbase took that path in dealing with the situation. That was a low moment for me at the company."

There wasn't anything kind or passionate or experienced about the one-dimensional leadership team scraped together from successful non-leadership roles in FAANG offices.

The mantra was to keep the business in growth mode while protecting runway funds. People, customers, ethics... none of that was a concern as long as expenses were down and customer numbers were up.

The company offers good benefits and has transitioned well to a remote-first culture during COVID. Despite leadership problems, the company is doing well due to it's strong market position.","Coinbase suffers from a lack of competent leadership. The most notable example of this is Brian Armstrong's recent actions in response to an employee walkout because he refused to make a simple statement supporting black lives (like most other companies were doing at the time). Instead of learning from the situation and listening to employees, he publicly asked those who disagreed to leave and banned open discussion from the company slack and AMAs. This was an extreme and unnecessary step that caused high stress and conflict within the company in the midst of a pandemic. Worse, it alienated minority employees and actively undermined belonging and inclusion work being done. This was the largest unforced error by leadership, but not the first (see also the Chicago office and Neutrino acquisition).

Coinbase also has an unhealthy self-described ""intense"" work culture. Work-life balance is poor and burnout is common.

I have been in the same position for almost two years and I am told that there is always room for career growth. However, any time reviews come around, there is absolutely no room for development. The only way you grow in your role is if they decide they want to hire someone for that role, not because we work our butts off and we deserve it. 

Recently, Quality was rolled out onto all analysts, and even though one might go above and beyond in their role, a score of 85-90% is not ""good enough"" to develop in career. The entire team of peers might view you as a leader, in fact your manager might even depend on you to do their job, but even then you are only thought to be _meeting expectation_. 

Which bring me to my next point, what are my expectations in my role? I don't even know what they are or what the role above me is. 

These roles are run by managers who don't even work in the same office as you, who cant see any of the hard work you put in, who refuse to make a form of metrics that are show all the work a person puts in. 

Oh and feedback, its all negative reinforcement. 

The thing that really bums me out is I LOVED this job, I easily said it was the best job I've ever had, but management is going down the drain. I have never felt so discouraged and unappreciated in a job as I do here. My mental health is being deeply affected by this bizarre place."

If you’re an intern or someone with no family to go home to, this might be a good place to have fun and bond with others from similar backgrounds. There are many social events to keep you busy after work hours.","Leadership does not lead. They just spend a lot of time trying to make everyone feel good. There seems to be a lot of smoke and mirrors. No decisions seem to stick. There are no adults in the room that actually understand execution, as opposed to touring the talk or conference circuit. Doing it quick and dirty is often mistaken for “efficient execution”, as opposed to actually doing it right and not leaving others, usually the Customer Service folks and ultimately our customers, in a lot of pain. Cross-team work is wrought with friction because the teams are very disjointed. We do not have enough technical leaders who want to fix cross-team coordination, probably because there is no respect for that type of work. Experienced leaders have been recruited recently from other industries, like financial services, etc, and then are being set up to fail. People are being forced into the wrong roles. There is no empathy. If you are not from The Big 5 (Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, or Twitter) then you’ll likely be treated like an imposter because pedigree is everything. Scaling is but one problem to be solved in the world, and the fact that you may have solved problems 1000x more complex than blasting tweets will mean very little to them.

If you are a diversity hire, you may be treated like a quota, as opposed to someone who actually deserves to be there. This is because like most other tech companies, it is treated as a funnel issue, as opposed to a retention and culture issue. There is a sad lack of diversity in our product and engineering leadership, and consequently, strategic product initiatives. The folks who are there don’t seem to be very “included”. Our diversity and inclusion initiatives are being run by people, save for one, who probably have never experienced what it is like to be an underrepresented minority in tech and been one of the unlucky ones to experience discrimination first-hand. How do you actually fix the problem if you don’t know what it’s like?  The condescension is real. You’ll spend a lot of time nodding and smiling because if you get upset and speak up, it probably won’t reflect well on you. Save yourself the heartache.

What’s sad is that diversity and inclusion initiatives are so in your face that the overrepresented folks are beginning to feel excluded too. The problem is probably because there are senior leaders who don’t take it that seriously."

Lots of fun, optional social events and interesting discussions/talks. 
And did I say catered lunch and dinner everyday.","Not enough people. There is a lot to do, and not enough people to do it. So some people are spread thin.
Lots of new initiatives, so efforts can feel a bit diluted.
Given the domain we work in, it means things change fast, and sometime it feels things are moving too fast. It could get hard to focus."

Combines the fast paced craziness of a startup with the discipline of a mature company that recognizes there is no replacement for wisdom and experience when you are preparing for long term success.

Competitive benefits and typical generous perks you see at other major tech companies.

Very intentional effort to create a sense of community and belonging.","This is a fast moving startup, so we work hard.  But we're invested in the future of the company and the upside can be enormous.

Good food and snacks",Like another reviewer mentioned it is a company goal to push Glassdoor ratings higher. Notice how many of the positive reviews are same day? This is a good example of how Coinbase runs. Pick the easy fix for appearances but do not fix the problem. The company chooses to highlight transparency when communication and honesty are the biggest issues. There is no culture or trust in the company even in the same teams. It is a political environment poised to get worse. Employees are fired constantly with no acknowledgement. Teams often have managers lacking the experience and leadership they need. As the other reviewer mentioned leadership would be doing everyone a service by being honest about their intentions. This is not the company to join if you care about culture or diversity.

Crypto industry is growing. Exciting and fast paced
Coinbase is most successful company in crypto space. Good for your resume
Stereotypical SF startup luxuries (catered meals, etc)","Went from startup to big corporation, with all the bad things that implies. Moved all decision making behind layers of middle management, restructured to remove benefits and flexibility from employees, and outsourced labor so they could fire long time employees.

- Comp far lower than average for SF, while workload is higher
- New hires don't get much equity anymore
- Employees frequently disappear overnight and nothing is spoken about them being fired, even to their own teams
- Promises of ""progress, improvement"" that stretch on for multiple quarters without any changes
- Low capacity for constructive feedback. Retaliatory atmosphere"
230,Coinbase,Horrible place,2018-11-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I would say there are none, other than a crypto education","What is somewhat hilarious about Coinbase's Glassdoor rating is that there is an actual company OKR to make Coinbase the ""best rated crypto company on Glassdoor"". Rather than focus on actually developing the company culture, the leadership team is intent on making it appear as though there is a great culture.  However, the culture is one in which jerks are rewarded and those that disagree with said  jerks are either threatened about their future after Coinbase (especially in the engineering space) or those employees become too afraid to take risks. 

The other reality of Coinbase is this - the mission to ""create an open financial system for the world"" is not the goal. The actual goal is to make as much money as possible. Leadership would do all of us a great service by just being honest about their intentions. 

Finally, be honest about the fact that it's okay to treat people terribly internally. If it benefits the company's bottom line to keep someone in their role, that person is kept in that role regardless of how they treat others. There are people out there that are okay with that kind of experience. I'm not one of them."

237,Coinbase,Best Place to Work,2018-10-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"We're all aligned around our mission to create an open financial system for the world.  It's a super-inspiring mission, and if we are successful, we will help lift billions of people out of poverty, while accelerating the pace of innovation around the world. 

One of the most exciting things about cryptocurrency is that it has the potential to create a more open and inclusive financial system — one where people are able to verify their identity through the blockchain using only information that is relevant. Parts of your identity that may lead to explicit or implicit bias are not relevant (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.).  

We are absolutely not a run fast and break things culture — that does not work when it comes to people’s money.

Our leadership team is dedicated to creating a culture that is diverse and inclusive -- many members of our leadership team are female, one of the highest percentages in the tech industry. 

People come to Coinbase to earn their ""Masters in Crypto"" or start their crypto career — the ""Coinbase mafia"" is already one of the most impressive group of technologists, investors and entrepreneurs working in tech today. We're building products that help people own, trade, earn, and use cryptocurrency. We're not just building a company, but an entire new industry. 

Coinbase has paying customers from every walk of life, and we have to listen to their feedback at all times to keep their business. That means, we cannot just build products and services for one type of customer — we are totally motivated to represent an incredibly broad community, and if crypto is going to be as successful as people think it should be, it has to be global. That's awesome.

Lots of communications internally, so you know you're on the right track / same page as your colleagues. We have Friday morning AMAs with leadership, and we have an incredible Speaker Series, welcoming guests from across Silicon Valley to come in and share their experiences with us.  

Overall office environment is positive -- great breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks provided!","Tech / finance are historically not diverse industries. Don't repeat the same mistakes of the past, where women and minorities are left behind or don't advance at the same pace.

Would be nice for Coinbase to match 401K contributions and cover cell phone bills completely (versus a small monthly stipend)."

The culture is amazing, after working for other SF based organisations who preach about their culture but the reality is very different, here the culture is exactly how you'd hope.  Team work, supporting each other,  a passion for our mission and how we can impact the world, a focus on employees careers and development both personal and professional and a belief that everyone is a grown up and is working hard and doesn't need to be micromanaged. 
Inclusivity, there is a built in passion for creating a diverse and inclusive workforce globally. There are so many inspirational females in leadership roles and an inclusive workforce it is clear this is at the forefront of their minds when scaling the business.
Flexibility - they allow flexible working which is great when you have meetings with international offices later/ earlier and need to be flexible with timings of your day.","There are still some areas that need to be built out, such as international onboarding and employement checks however they are working hard to iron these and out and use all the feedback to improve the process.

277,Coinbase,"Coinbase isn't perfect, but it's pretty great",2017-03-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I am a woman at Coinbase and I personally have experienced quite a bit of growth opportunity and ownership during my time at Coinbase. The people here are highly intelligent and considerate. We have a high bar for integrity, and in my experience, the leadership is humble, open to feedback and wants to improve. We've recognized that there is a need for more experienced leadership (any startup I've worked with has gone through this phase) and have been working to address that by hiring a Chief Legal and Risk officer, as well as an experienced Engineering Manager. We're also continuing to hire for experienced leaders across the organization and training existing managers. 

As a woman in technology, I've experience the frustration of being interrupted when speaking, having a man parrot my comment in a meeting then get credit for the idea, having to justify everything I do with metrics. I've experienced this at every single company I've worked for. Not just Coinbase. In fact, in my experience the CEO, leadership and employees at Coinbase care more about changing this and improving the environment than any other place I've worked.","We're going through some growing pains of being resource-constrained with a ton of work to do. Because we're growing so quickly, sometimes communication wires can get crossed which can result in misunderstandings."

Your coworkers can easily become your best friends, and you can constantly learn new and interesting things from your peers inside or out of the office.","The unconscious pro-male bias is out of control. If you're a woman, here are things that do not matter to Coinbase: related career experience, time with the company, being the best at what you do despite being challenged and undermined by others with more ""seniority"", or doing work that directly brings the company huge cost savings. You'll get paid less than your male colleagues, passed over for promotions, feedback that amounts to ""you should just be nicer"", and eventually, after learning HR's involvement only makes your situation worse, you'll leave."

Individually, most employees are good people with interesting backgrounds.","Management is really insecure and inexperienced.  Disagreement is not allowed.

Talented engineers
Frat bro culture","Weak business co-founder/business leadership drags down rest of team
Can't retain executive hires - anyone director level and above is fired or quits within months, usually due to same business founder and stalling company growth. Chief compliance officer, director of security, VP of biz dev...they're all gone. 
Bro culture
Immature founders - don't work here if you have a family/kids, or any chance of getting sick - they won't care or understand. You're just a cog in the machine....
Zero room for career growth. Bring your A-game and execute! Don't expect to learn new things (it will delay ship date) 
Startup = growth but this company's declining. Lots of runway so opportunity to pivot but make no mistake, this is NOT a rocketship or high-growth environment, at least not now."
