10,Coldwell Banker,In-depth Honest Review,2022-03-21,3.0,Marketing,"Pros if you are an agent - There is nowhere better than CB. 
They have the best combo of trainers, tools, and splits you will find. Amazing staff that will go above a beyond. Though each office has its own unique culture all try to be inclusive to all types of agents whether you just want to do one deal a year or want to do a hundred. 

Pros if you are staff - 
+Lots of opportunities to try out new skills. 
+No higher education is required (formal degree). 
+Challenging work but nothing extremely difficult if you are good enough with computers. 
+You are paid overtime if you go over 40hrs at your usual rate (though working OT is frowned upon). 
+Lots of paid holidays off plus 2weeks vacation after first few months, 401K matching, health benefits are... passable. 
+There are almost always snacks and drinks of all kinds in the office.
+Most managers (in our area) are flexible if you need time off or just to leave early for an emergency/life. 
+You'll work with passionate people who will bring out the best in you.","Cons if you are an agent - literally none. Seriously the best place for agents.

Cons if you are staff - TLDR: You will be underpaid and over-relied upon. 

-The staff who last at CB are the ones who truly care about their agents and the company - and both parties take advantage of that mindset. Agents have no boundaries for your personal life or time and will demand a 2-day project to be done in an hour.
-There is no formal training. If you are not a ""self-starter"" to an extremely high-degree these jobs will seem impossible.
-Recognition is not bad but it will never come in the form of a significant raise but rather in shout-outs and maybe gift cards. You can hit every metric and be the best employee but you'll likely still see the same 1-2% ""raise"" as the one who did the minimum. 
-If you work in an office, leadership will always side with the agents even when it's a written rule."

119,Coldwell Banker,No Leadership - Poor Management,2021-10-24,1.0,Realtor,"I can't recall anything positive about the office in Los Gatos, CA.","The office is managed poorly since the manager is too busy trying to act he is best friends with the admin team and tech guys. Only two people from the front desk admin team actually perform their job and have a good attitude. The rest have an attitude and refuse to do their job and reporting them to management will accomplish nothing. When a manager does nothing about people having attitude and nothing doing their job, it is no different than condoning bad behavior. Initially, anything I needed help with at the office, the manager referred me to the front desk admin team. The agent website is not user friendly and only one admin person knows how to get your website up and running but she refuses to help you regardless of how nicely you ask her to do her job. She and the manager will tell you to wait for the company training. Their tech support guy has an attitude and refuses to answer your questions. It was very challenging to schedule one of the tech guys to do his job and come to the office to set up my laptop to the company network. The tech guy was extremely rude and unprofessional towards me even in front of the manager but the manager wasn't surprised and did not care. You really cannot get any work done until you go to the training but you have to wait until the training is available at a location near your office as they only have one trainer to show you how to use their technology. You may have to wait months for this training to be in your area and you must pay for the training but they fail to tell you this when you are considering to join this company. When you finally go to the training, they will tell the realtors to obtain some tech information from the designated office admin in your office to set you to additional resources you need to use technology and setup your computer to contract software. The admin in my office lied and had done what the training instructor requested to set up my technology for the class. As a result, I could get training that day since I could not follow the class because my office admin refused to do her job. All this was reported but the office admin who refuses to do her job is still employed by the company. Imagine getting paid for having an attitude and refusing to do your job; yet, the office manager does nothing about it even when several people having reported the same issues with the same people refusing to do their job."

The pay is horrible, especially for the area. If you are not a real estate agent you get worked like a slave. The workload is actually impossible especially since we are not allowed overtime. The turnover rate is crazy, no one last more than 6 months. 

All that being said, it gets worse management makes the place a living hell. This is the only job where I have gotten yelled at and purposely excluded from events and activities. You are expected to know everything without being properly trained. When you voice concerns management reflects the problem back to you. No accountability taken by upper management."

283,Coldwell Banker,Stay Away,2021-03-30,2.0,Sales Support Administrator,Not the most high pressure job ever. You can usually leave work at work.,"Antiquated management style, low pay, low appreciation. Management often takes the opinions and needs of staff for granted. COVID has proved that they’re willing to put staff in harm’s way to stroke an agent’s ego. Despite that nearly all staff can do all work 90% remotely, we’ve been called back in to work full time because agents “like it” and no other reason. They’ve demonstrated that they care neither about the moral nor safety for their staff. Frankly, we’re not paid enough, given enough growth opportunities, or have good enough benefits to care this much."
284,Coldwell Banker,Harassed daily,2021-03-29,1.0,Marketing Coordinator,None ever. Sometimes there were nice agents but the fact that my pto were some kind people because of the toxicity is sad,My manager would harass me and a few other women in the office physically and verbally. I was the only one comfortable enough to say no please stop that. Other male agents in the office would harass me and one time one try to kiss me on the head and I said please don’t do that and the office manager said he had a daughter so it’s not creepy and I shouldn’t get so angry. Verbal abuse was daily and it drained me or I would just become so upset and sad that it seemed to be normal. No one was ever truly happy there except the people making the big bucks and they don’t respect the staff at all. Coldwell Banker is a giant corporation that’s been around for over 100 years and their focus is to make money like most corporations. The fact that I would have to call corporate and tell them of my concerns almost weekly or monthly is concerning and I wasn’t the only one. When I eventually quit it was myself and the two other female staff members that left because we couldn’t take it anymore. Do you feel trapped. And nobody respects you. My manager at the time even though she was very great told me well this is what you do when you’re a people pleaser. I’m not a people pleaser but if you are and you enjoy serving others while they beat you down and then I guess you can work here but life‘s too short

489,Coldwell Banker,Be a Broker and Eat Your Own For Dinner (or Go Broke),2020-04-08,4.0,Real Estate Agent,"Oldest name and reputation in biz. The most offices and office agents. Fairly recent generation tech and systems however playing much needed catch up with others as far as concept and usability, to which there is often a glaring disconnect.","2019-2020 re-branding was really a refresh like an 80's K-car.  Affiliated agents are the 2nd biggest revenue stream, paying through the teeth for redundant and abhorrent per year/month/deal mandatory legal fees, office fees, broker splits, transaction fees and client fees. Its all the same disguised as a different fee.  And they all are charged. Plus they roll out training on new and updated tech and tools and you find that agents will now pay for these services which were previously free under the old tech.  And then even the new pay for tech and features is a gen or two behind the curve.  Forget this. The most important thing is the Brokers actually cannibalize and compete with their own agents through every conceivable way possible. Any newer school agents making waves by default just doing what they do well, showing a lick of momentum and a following, real talent for selling in these modern days and higher use of the largely underutilized systems are undermined and sold out from under in very systematic fashion. They are very upfront about it and make no real attempt to hide this fact. Their power is wielded and known. And this gratuitous profiteering is further measurably compounded by the fact there is no limit to how many agents work in one office no matter the geography and available inventory for sale. Hence they will collect aforementioned fees from everyone, one after another, as long as those agents choose to be affiliated. There can be hundreds in an office. 20% have sales. The rest peril at their own Broker's behest. Hence agents are not independent contractors. They are paying customers. The newest is that agents are coerced to join teams, so that there are whole teams paying fees and by default sharing inventory to make it seem like it works. All this to support an extraordinarily TOP heavy executive to middle management structure that remains in its own way."

638,Coldwell Banker,Sales Manager Metro West Brookfield,2019-03-01,5.0,WISCONSIN,"Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage  has developed the most advanced tools available to prospect for buyers and sellers. The transaction tools are top notched as well.  The company employs Full time support staff  for marketing, training, and  administrative support.  The agents in our organization have top tools and talented support staffs.","The  Brookfield office needs to add more experienced  agents from other brokers and home grow new agents with the  aptitude for our business.  
We have not added much to our mix of talent in the last two years."
639,Coldwell Banker,Seemingly Great for Agents - Horrifically Toxic for Staff,2019-03-01,1.0,Marketing Strategist,"There are some good people in the offices that do great things and understand a harmonic balance. There is always activity in the office(s) that can keep you busy which, if you're like me, is fantastic. Yes, it can get a little overwhelming, but I argue that's a sign of a good market!","As with all jobs, there's some good and some bad. Unfortunately, the bad is overwhelming and comes from so many directions that I can't give a clear answer on what needs to be done to fix it.

For starters, the company is so fixated on recruiting, recruiting, recruiting  that it does not consider its current people. There's an ""employee appreciation day"" annually that feels narcissistic in nature, like the company is patting its own back while not actually showing true appreciation for the staff. Adding even an ounce of workplace flexibility would be a HUGE improvement.

Coupled with the recruiting issue is that the company makes all efforts to make agent lives as easy as possible, even when that means that they do literally nothing. The staff routinely prints things, sends emails, and does little things that they either cannot do or refuse to do.

The benefits and compensation fall well below competitors and are pathetic at best. Without going into specifics, I can say that everything that is preached by the managers and HR is not remotely true.

There is no organization or communication between offices or corporate. Things are often sprung on us with no prior knowledge and we find out after the agents do, which leads to us not being able to answer questions where we were indicated as being the ""point person"" for. When we go to look for an answer, we don't find one - we find ten, all of which conflict. The same applies for company systems and tools. Granted, the company is attempting to reign in this weakness right now but, from my experiences working on it, it's just going to cause confusion and proliferate the situation.

Probably the most significant problem here is the workplace toxicity and blatant abuse of power. Many branch managers are fantastic sales agents but simply do not know what it is or how to manage people. They are micromanaging, condescending, and operate with a general attitude of ""do what I say because I'm the boss,"" even when that means breaking laws or DRE regulations. Whenever a line is crossed, your first thought is to have a conversation with them that falls on closed ears. When that fails, you reach out to HR, who does nothing except ""coaching sessions"" which result in backlash and a significant regression in workplace morale. 

The workplace toxicity, obviously, leads to a high turnover rate (which isn't often disclosed). I've been with the company for a year and a half or so. During that time, I've seen 3 OAs, 4 receptionists, 3 TCs, come and go. During a slightly wider window, I learned that I was the 3rd person to hold my position in less than a year. The general opinion of many of the staff I've interacted with is ""I hate this place. It's soul crushing. I'm only going to be here until my one year mark."" and other comments of the like. Something I find extremely ironic, considering that the company is so proud of its ""Most Ethical"" title - quite the opposite. When an employee leaves the company, they're badmouthed and insulted behind their back (rather maliciously), especially when they're leaving for a competing company.

EVERYTHING comes from the top down - meaning executive management. My experience interacting with them is that ALL of the issues I outline above aren't only being allowed, they're being encouraged. It is frustrating and, frankly, extremely depressing."

She has no warmth or compassion, you feel like you're working for a robot. She desperately needs management training. Terrible company culture, everyone is trying to cover themselves even if it means throwing others under the bus. You will not make friends here.  The CEO has no idea what's going at the department level. I've been here over two years, he doesn't even know my name.  Management in this department is very secretive. They instituted monthly meetings - supposedly to get input and let people know what was going on but the fact that the meetings are constantly cancelled tells you they don't care what you think and they're fine with you being in the dark. It's a terrible place to work. All but two people are actively looking for other jobs. They give you a huge workload and then refuse to pay overtime. So, you either wind up working for free or they tell you you're doing a bad job even when you express the workload is too heavy for 40 hours.  If you're looking for a job where they will underpay, undervalue and overwork you, this is the right place. Otherwise, keep looking. In such a small department, there shouldn't be a 20 person turnover in two years."

Sometimes you are doing the work of a co-listing agent, without receiving any of the commission that a co-listing agent would get.

An experience I wouldn't wish upon anyone—but you truly have to see to believe. Jenny Ames is over-stressed and under-considerate, making unreasonable last-minute demands on her agents and office staff. She changes her mind frequently without ""owning it,"" and prefers to blame instead of admit. Always, always, always behind on deadlines.

Verbal attacks are common, which creates a shaky and emotionally unsafe workplace. I overheard her several times suggesting agents who couldn't bend to her ""standards"" should look for work somewhere else. Jenny preaches ""togetherness"" and ""fun"" but practices blatant ""me and my priorities first"" attitude. The day's schedule is subject to her current ""crisis,"" which in reality is rarely a crisis. 

For being the face of the company, she does very little service and selling. (And does an awful lot of criticizing, analyzing, and butt-riding.) I did not feel safe, welcome, or appreciated in her presence."
931,Coldwell Banker,Avoid At All Costs - Hostile Work Enviornment,2017-04-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,One of the top agents in Chicago,"There's one giant con, biggest con I've ever met in my life, Jennifer Ames. I've never met someone so horrible, so condescending, so rude and so self-centered. She will ridicule you in front of others, she'll make you feel like the stupidest person, she'll bring you to tears and a day later she'll try to be your best friend. After she shows you her true colors, you'll never believe her act again. 

This woman should not be in business. I've always heard stories of hostile work environments, but this place takes the cake. I rather be unemployed than work for someone so vile. 

Before you consider a role here, take five minutes, go on LinkedIn and contact the MANY people who have worked here in the past and ask them their experience. You'll hear horror stories. Ask Jenny how many people have left the team in the last 12 months, that will be telling."

One manager told me repeatedly they did not trust the majority of those that reported to her/him. On a side note, I later was told by a co-worker that this same manager said they ""hated"" a specific employee they supervised. This same manager desperately needs to pick up people skills. Including how to: 1) TRUST!, 2) address issues/problems correctly and 3) not humiliate people in public (this makes everyone uncomfortable, even those not involved).

If you work overtime, make sure you get approvals from your manager and HR otherwise you will stay after hours on your own free will just to catch up; or go home at the designated time but feel overwhelmed everyday.

Now see cons - warning, brace yourself.","Working for this company will get you good work life balance - which is good. The bad is that you'll be wanting to use that time to find a new job or work a second part time job just to meet your basic needs. You aren't paid anything near sustainable for a primary source of income in a household. It's an absolute farce and joke. I would never, ever, recommend to anyone to work here. Worst of all? They feel pleased with their annual 2% 'raises' they give out 'occasionally'. That barely meets cost of inflation. I'm actually making less now than when I started in terms of monetary value. 

Worst thing I found out? Even if you are promoted, or get a new position, your salary will always be at most 10% more than what it was previously. Meaning if you go from a Marketing coordinator role - someone working in offices with agents - to a regional marketing manager or trainer - someone who oversees many offices and marketing coordinators - you might get a 10% raise. Maybe. A previous RMM here came from an MC roll and went from a 35k position to barely 50k. When that person quit, and they did, they were replaced by someone who came in outside the company - and at a starting salary over 70k! 

This company prides itself on being one of 'the most ethical companies in the world' too bad they lack any integrity and morality to pay people.

Senior management is full of 'good ol boys'. Presidents of regions who are complete jokes. I mean absolutely lacking in all capacity of actual leadership. I think they are purposefully picked to just be figureheads. Yet they still get final say on a lot of things, which ends up pushing this company in the wrong direction."

And the company has a national reputation.","As ADMIN, If you enjoy admin work and intend to stay in the admin genre -- Coldwell Banker Select Real Estate, Carson City is not a place to hang your hat, especially if you are a highly motivated, hard-worker, with superior office/marketing skills.  There is no follow through on promises made by staff, and if you push for education or training that was promised in negotiations, you will be considered a nuisance and ignored.  Morale takes a hit because the new staff has many bosses every day in both local office and headquarters to answer to, and the rules/expectations for the new staff change on whim or mood of other staff.  Every separate office has different procedures in play.  There is no unifying written policy on procedures for staff, which is why there is procedural dysfunction that has negative consequences for realtors.  When this is brought up to headquarters, they say they agree that it is wrong, but then they allow it so as not to cause friction.  Finally, the new staff person is not part of a team.   Further, the company retains staff who come in late, and who show a poor work ethic.   Side note:  New marketing ideas coming from new staff  were met with negativity or ignored."

1333,Coldwell Banker,Sales Associate,2015-01-06,1.0,Realtor,The only pro is the nationally recognized name.,"High desk fees, high yearly attorneys fees - both mandatory at CB, legitimate leads only go to the highest producers. The only face to face leads you receive are sitting floor time (means you sit at the front desk and answer phones and take messages for the rental department) and open houses. Terrible commission split for new agents. Training is old fashioned, they tell you to cold call FSBO's for clients. If you don't have 2 years of healthy savings and can afford to advertise $400-$500 per month, don't waste your time here. You will be told you need 6 months of savings, not true, 2 years minimum. This is big business and sales associates are a major source of income for CB. It is difficult  competing with associates who have been in the business 20 years. Very few Real Estate Associates last a year, if you leave for a better commission split elsewhere be sure to do it by 30 JUN otherwise you will be charged another $450 in attorney's fees even though you will no longer be affiliated with the company."

Enjoyed some of my time there.,"Lately the company seems to be going in the wrong direction. Lots of extra work for Realtors to do with paperwork. Splits are bad. After two or three years it is counter productive to stay. VERY CORPORATE. High referral fees for deals not facilitated by them. Another Realtor and myself discussed we were not getting leads off our listings. The other Realtor found out many of the leads were given away to another agent, and that agent and myself were able to take our leads. Now if this other agent sells that person something they have to pay an extra 35%. I was not getting many of my own leads, and only got low quality leads I had to pay 35% on in return. My own leads would have been my regular split. (Not my spilt and an extra 35%.) Have a seniority date in the middle of the year and watch out. You can have a great Jan- to Dec, but If your seniority date is say July or August your split can be dropped down a lot. They also seem to be letting too many newbies in, and focus on them more than seasoned agents. It was just time to go."

I started out at a small company and the Broker there was a ""competing broker"", (as 99% of real estate brokerages are structured), so I received ZERO training and not a lot of support because they were too busy; also I always felt that I was competing with them and with all of the other agents.  I would run up to the copier to grab the copies that I had printed off (that I had to pay for), so noone would see anything I was doing, because it was Every Man For Himself.  At Coldwell Banker, we have Managing Brokers that do not compete, so they are working Right Along Side Of You ALWAYS.  I never feel like I have to face any challenges alone.  I don't have to pay for copies and I have left documents on the copier for hours because NOONE here would ever step on the toes of another agent.  Their number one priority is HELPING AGENTS and TRAINING.  I have been at this for over a decade and it wasn't until I joined Coldwell Banker that I really knew HOW TO BE AN AGENT!  I was blowing in the wind and didn't even know it.  I owe at least Half of my Success and Income to Coldwell Banker.  I would not be where I was financially if it wasn't for their amazing Training, Support and Opportunities.  I am also blown away by my broker.  She is one of the smartest women that I have ever met, she is kind, patient and sets a high standard when it comes to Ethics and Integrity.  I could go on and on, but I won't bore you with the Company Picnics, Awards Gala, and Charity Events that support our local communities, because they all deserve more than I have time to write.  If given a choice between Coldwell Banker and ANY OTHER Company in the Nation, I would pick Coldwell Banker, EVERY TIME!","None, I am VERY VERY Happy here.  I will work another 20 years and never leave, because I have been at other companies, and frankly coming here was like finally exhaling after so many years or struggling and wondering why I was not selling more.  I now feel secure about my future."

Both the formal and informal training opportunities are free and agents can get enough continuing education credits through the company so that they never have to pay outside sources to meet the state requirements.

Nothing provided for your success beyond long classroom setting training.

Much of the initial training is elementary.  Many of us in those classes noted the same, as if they were teaching people the basics of what most would consider common sense.  Beyond that, many of us were turned off by the inauthentic ways of dealing with people, akin to neuro-linguistic programming others.

Percentage to agents on sales no comparison to smaller brokerages.

Broker receives a salary ... CB corporation receives the commission.  Broker has little incentive but to make headcount for his/her office with sights set on corporate promotion out of the brokerage and a raise in salary.

Charging the agents for nearly everything, except their first name tag and pack of business cards.  Again, no incentive if the agents are already paying for everything that they could purchase on their own."

They have no interest in developing or even acknowleging your skills. Some of the managers are so unprofessional they show blatent favoritism between employees. Decisions are made about your role and/or future with the company without you even being invited to be part of the conversation. If you attempt to voice your concerns about any mistreatment, their no retailiation policy will be through out the window. You can be sure your boat will sink thereafter!
