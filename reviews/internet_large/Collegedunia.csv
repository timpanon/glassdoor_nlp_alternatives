If you are a human being with even little self esteem, then you won't join this company.","The whole company is full of cons. You will lose your mental health, you'll get stress and what not.I have worked in seven companies and many startups and there are some bad companies too, but i have not seen such a worst company in my life. They won't tell anything before you join, they honey trap you literally. They will ask you to make million calls and they have the worst training system i have ever seen in a company. The managers will act amateurish, rude and with lots of ego. Not fit to manage. I have worked under more than 15 managers and managed multiple teams and never have i ever seen such a horrible set of managers in my life. If you get an offer from this company, and you are reading this and looking whether to join this company, am writing this for you so that others are saved. They won't pay salary properly and threaten employees to write favorable reviews. They think they are very smart, they will shut down the company very soon. Because they don't know what is going to hit them , the industry is changing and digital marketing and getting information from students and selling that without their permission, more data security rules are going to come and they will suffer and fold. This company has spoiled the career of so many employees. I only feel pity for them. Don't ever consider this company. I wish someone wrote such a honest review, it could have helped me."

The only pro of this company is that it will offer you a handsome salary to attract you to work in this pathetic company. This is the tactic used by the company to hire and waste talent.

The notice period here is 24 hrs only. They will straightforward ask you don't need to come from tomorrow. 
2. The work culture in this company is very bad, you will be asked to follow an irrelevant and baseless process that will not make any sense or add any value.
3. There is a designated team/department in this company whose sole responsibility is to monitor the employees and find out mistakes so that they can easily fire them.

4) CEO knows what he is doing.
5) Company policies are improving everyday. 32 leaves per year, Three 2 hour breaks every month. No need to ask before taking leave in tech team. Just coordinate with your team. No calls on weekend if there is no emergency.","1) HR team needs to think more for employees. They are not concerned with employee's issue. They don't even try once. Employee in this case will feel disconnected.
2) Accounts team should introduce more tax saving options.
3) Policies are not clear to employees. Policies should be documented in detail and should be shared with every employee."

When all the companies were having work from this company was asking to join offices, they didnt even allow the 2 weeks training to be online. You can be fired anyday and if not you'll be working alternative saturdays or work overtime if u arent able to meet targets.

2. They can assign any random work irrespective of the JD, can make you work for their sister companies.
3. The CEO doesn't know how to talk to people (extremely rude, demotivating, and demeaning)
4. A clause of their contract says that they can terminate people in 24Hrs to 30Days so there is no job security too.
In my short tenure with them, I can say that the experience was tormenting. The HRs (in the best way possible) try to defend the work culture by saying that even other companies work like this. 
The attrition rate of the company is high and if you check their portals they are always in hiring mode. (Employees keep on coming and leaving)

In short, I would not recommend anyone to join the organization unless the company is willing to turn around its work culture.

It's better to sit and look for more jobs than joining this organization."

The Hr on the very first day will ask you write a good review regarding the company on glassdoor and google so dont buy the other reviews.

This is no place for freshers. Please dont join if you are freshers both the TL from old and new team were absolutely irresponsible cared only about their achievements and targets.

The experience while getting on the board with this organization was very affable and efficient.

218,Collegedunia,No long term vision,2021-05-03,1.0,Software Developer,Can get some freedom to do stuff your own way and get responsibility quickly.,"From a technical standpoint, the company has no long term vision for technology and how it fits into business plans, currently it's a hotchpotch of different tech being used in the name of freedom. The only thing they care about is how quickly can it be done.

Tech is just a means to an end for the company, and is treated as such. This shows in the resources available to the team, the ""premium Macbooks"" are old Air ones, free tier of various 3rd party services are being used, self hosting everything, no dedicated infrastructure team, no investments in automation. Any self initiatives to improve anything by the teams are crushed under feature deadlines, changing requirements, and lack of time and resources.

Freshers are given no mentor ship and guidance, there is not much documentation in place or if there is then it is old. Everyone only cares about their projects, which leads to lots of reinventing the wheel and repeating old mistakes by different teams.

Other things:
Lack of communication from management, no regular feedback or followups.
To get somethings done, one has to figure out how the whole organization works, there is no clear structure or process. Decisions are taken on a whim and changed on whims."

4) There are constant indirect threats about the firing.
5) The company always makes up an excuse regarding the financial loss in order to deflect any conversation about compensation, although they are always hiring new candidates.
6) The seniors pretend to appreciate discussions but in reality, their idea of a discussion usually comprises raising their voice and mocking their employees.
7) Promotion is not based on merit/performance. They are many people who are underqualified and yet remain in a powerful position.
8) Employees are often forced to work on the weekends. Complaining about the same leads to warning."

- ""Half filled pots splashes more"" - real examples can be seen here. Since, most of the employee are new, due to lack of product knowledge meetings turn out to be wastage of time. No appropriate development scenarios.

- Your communication with HR would be the futility of an attempt to impart wisdom who is  not ready to receive it.

- Finance team will come with unnecessary cuts in the salary saying it to be policy.","- Incompetent high level management. ( Content, Tech, Sales )

- If you plan for any interview during weekends, you will surely  meet your team leads there at the venue. Even, they are looking for a job change.
But when you come to office next Monday, they will fire you without notice, reason as Incompetent enough to handle project.

- They hire 5 people every month, fire 3 of them if 3 resignation doesn't come to them. 5 Hiring per month is inclusive of presumption only 3 will join.

- You won't be able to survive in the company more than 1 year. If you think, the other senior employees are since 2-3 years, it's because of the legal bond signature during their appraisals.
