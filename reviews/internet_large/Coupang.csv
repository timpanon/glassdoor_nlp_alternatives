2. Surrounded by enthusiastic employees who want to grow and make a success;
 
3. Flexible working time and work from home policy is super welcomed under Covid situation;

4. Stock compensation is rewarding if you join this company early enough and still stay or exercised your stock options after quitting; 

5. A lot of potentials to grow in long-term (if the business globalization strategy works), which in turn means more job opportunities globally to open for current employees who seek for a different culture and geography to transfer.

6. Never lack of problems to solve, only lacking of time to solve them all at once, hence requiring a good sense of ruthless prioritization;","1. Common sense is a rare thing in this company, followers are way more than creators and builders; 

2. Attrition of matured and tenured employees are a big concern at least in my area of work, hiring bar of new joiners is not as always high especially when the hiring manager is a new joiner his/herself;

3. Lack of attention on employees' career development almost at all levels from packers inside fulfillment center to vice president level, the company is expecting more for new hires to deliver results than coaching and developing employees' long-term skillsets; 

4. Rating of people related function is from the range of below average to non-existence in aspects of hiring and recruiting, performance evaluation, coach and development, as hire manager it is difficult to get adequate number of qualified candidates, some organization manager may arbitrarily decide all levels' employees performance without consulting other managers' opinion, training is very limited to compliance related but very few relevant to what you need to perform your tasks better."

Managers are not much experienced, often political, mostly guided by self protection on job leaving no room for newcomers from innovation. Talent wise, some very talented engineers are there and some are not. It is a mix kind of work culture depends on which group or manager one gets to work with. Unfortunately, I had to deal with a manager of negative category resulting half of the team left from him."

51,Coupang,Worst Tech Job in 2021,2021-12-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Being forced to use MSOffice will help you appreciate Google Apps at next job.,"It probably sounds crazy but I think Coupang is the worst tech job in USA in 2021, compared to market performance. I am writing to prevent someone making mistake I made.

- Work/life balance is terrible. If you work at Coupang, you must work Seoul hours. The recruiter or hiring manager might lie to you and say ""we are heading in direction of building leadership in the US and being autonomous"" but that is a lie. All decisions, strategy, everything happens on Seoul time and you will need to spend your evenings and late nights working. It is exhausting.

- The stock price is 50% down from IPO, it is the biggest loser of the ""covid era"". I am not aware of any unicorn+ tech which lost more. For reference, WeWork is down 18% in same time. And it's not clear when the bottom comes. There are still some good fundamentals about Coupang's business and there is a positive argument to be made for recovery, but that's a long way And there are tons of insiders waiting to sell out if recovery happens (You can see them all saying this if you check Blind). Even if the stock does recover some day (and I honestly think it will be ok eventually), I don't think you can believe it's better than tech industry average at this point. There's definitely no reason to justify the work/life balance and other issues.

- Many of the pre-IPO fully vested folks just bailed. Entire leadership groups disappeared. There is a leadership crisis happening. Many more pre-IPO folks are resting and vesting and mostly interested in hiding from risky politics. Many ppl's top priority is not drawing attention to themselves.

- All decisions are made by a small group of people in Seoul. They don't say ""here is a problem, go understand it and figure out the best solution"", instead they say ""Do exactly X, because we already decided it's the right solution"". You are not involved in deciding X, and btw if X doesn't work that is your fault, not theirs. If they get bored or move on to the next problem, they just stop showing up to meetings or responding to emails. This is not a bottom up Silicon Valley company, it's extremely Top Down, you're just low level pawn.. Most of my time has been working on pointless strategies decided by ppl in Seoul.

I don't feel any upside to my work, and I don't feel I can work on any real problems, just politics. I feel exhausted and humiliated that I destroyed my earning potential during biggest tech market growth ever."

-US office does use budget for its' employees like hosting annual company day at resort and providing christmas gifts. Office managers also try to celebrate personal events as well.  

-Though it's a Korean start-up, there are no more than 10 Koreans in the US office and we have interpreters to support every meeting with HQ. 

-The US office might not be diverse enough, however, I don't think it's fair to say some people are not sociable because of their race. Overall, people are nice and we have a collaborative engineering culture. 

-We don't work under restrictive environment. We have a ping-pong table at the center of the office and I'm not sure how someone can think you have to be quiet. Teams are holding stand-ups and discussing issues simultaneously. 

-I haven't seen people quitting recently because we'd have farewell lunch if there are. I heard a case or two where people got fired due to performance issues. 

-US office is still pretty small and you'll have autonomy here.","Management can be better by having more empathy towards employees and having more frequent 1:1s. As said, we're still figuring out and improving on different ways to structure the team."

- smaller office ( >50 people)","- management does not communicate or give clarity, gossips with other employees while excluding others
- no big budget for employees' well-being and growth (aka tries to be as cheap as possible, which is unusual for Silicon Valley culture)
- language barrier (you will feel more included if you are a Korean that sucks up to the bosses)
- no diversity (mostly older Chinese/Indian engineers that don't like to socialize)
- restrictive environment-- you will hear ""SHHH!!"" if you try to talk to your fellow employees so you are not encouraged to make friends. I was told that the Recruiting team had a ""bad rep"" for talking too loud, even though it's clearly part of their job to talk about potential hires
- MANY people quit or are fired-- there's no advance notice if you are being replaced, you could walk in one day and just be fired (part of the Senior HR Management's lack of honesty and tendency to manipulate the environment). Many others have quit because they cannot handle the toxic environment
- Not enough checks & balances-- there's no manager training or groups of managers working together, so one holds too much reign"

Managers in middle tier are not good. CEO suggested right vision and led company right direction, but these days he seems he don't care about services, products, people any more.

Company is no longer start-up. It already is large company. Project Owner doesn't create new businesses, they don't focus on developing service but personal connection politically. 

Team organizations are changing like bad large company. A small full stack agile team is changing to a functional large team. Platforms for s/w engineer are horrible. Some platform teams force other teams to use their systems that have very low-quality than aws systems, although company use aws now and there are already similar systems in aws."

Even the company values are almost a word for word copy of another large e-commerce company.   Quality of korea based tech staff is below average.  You get a sense that you were hired to provide korean counterparts on how your former company does things.  That's it."
259,Coupang,Amazing place with huge potentials,2016-08-28,5.0,Data Scientist,"Coupang is rated as one of the “50 Smartest Companies 2016” by MIT, the only South Korean company on the list. It's viewed as the Amazon of Korea, but it's more than just Amazon. Coupang owns its entire end-to-end supply chain, which means that it's able to provide last-mile service to each of the customers in South Korea, whereas Amazon does not. (Also delivery drivers are well treated by Coupang, which is always a bonus knowing your company cares about all the employees.) Then you can imagine all the things that we can design and optimize over to produce the best customer experience. 

Palo Alto and Seattle offices are very much team oriented. Each team primarily consists of product owner, data engineers and data scientists.

# Nice and smart people.

# Lots of interesting problems to work on, and you have the power to initiate projects within the team.

# Manager is very capable and dedicated, making an effort in connecting with each team and providing helpful feedbacks.

# Very flexible working hours. 

# Premium coffees! Twice a week lunch catering, and once a week afternoon happy hours (with beer and fun activities). Tons of fruits and snacks.

# Ping pong table! It is one of the most popular activities among folks in Palo Alto.

# Palo Alto office is located next to Bay trails, making it pleasant to take lunch-time walks/jogs and Pokemon adventures.

Overall, I cannot think of one day that I didn't have fun at the office.","# Time difference sometimes requires you to work at nights, but the Korean teams are very friendly and helpful. With that said, managing your time well and taking a conscious effort to make sure communications can go as smoothly as possible definitely can help everyone out.

# As a remote office, it can be difficult to experience the excitement going on in South Korea regarding the business growth, but CEO's visits from time to time certainly help."

263,Coupang,Disappointing due to toxic upper management,2016-07-06,2.0,Product Owner,"As many other reviews noted, the company has potential and there are great people sprinkled throughout (although they are leaving quickly). There are opportunities to take on responsibility because of some of the chaos. Coupang is probably the best ecommerce app in Korea (Gmarket is the number one site and it is not even close) so there is a lot of pride in maintaining that.","Upper management is nasty. The CEO has a small circle of trust that blindly try to duplicate what they did at Amazon but they are too arrogant to see that Korea is a different market. 

There is a fake data driven culture: when a subordinate tries to make a case, it is only heard if it aligns with what management wants to hear. Even if it isn't what they want to hear, you quickly see what happens to people who rock the boat: insults, humiliation, and ostracisation 

The fake data driven culture undermines the principles of Agile development and so ""value"" creation becomes about keeping your boss or your team in upper management's good graces

Good people are leaving, and FAST. The kind of coworkers you don't mind working hard for and late with because you are achieving amazing things are leaving for places where they can grow and be empowered. Many of those that are choosing to stay are political people who try to get in good with the right crowd.

NO stock, and only stock options for senior employees. 

Terrible work life balance

Terrible amenities. There are no sinks. There are disgusting buckets placed next to the water coolers that become full of milk, water, and coffee by noon and stink. Bathrooms are not air conditioned so they just become steam rooms during the summer."

But the bottom line is that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. 

Benefits not up to standard.  You will be put on the korean national health insurance. And your retirement plan is the Korean pension system.  Both of these are below standards of other tech companies."

# constant reworks that add no value. every company has to iterate towards solutions, but it’s beyond reasonable at coupang
# little freedom to do your job
# big risk associated with relocating and up-rooting family to an alien culture where foreigners are treated like an invasive species
# negative word of mouth is getting out and is creating negative impact of having the company on resume. as an example - have heard that some have recorded examples of the above and have intensions to use the recordings.  who knows if true, but the sentiment is definitely getting around"
269,Coupang,Good culture,2016-02-12,4.0,Developer,"I've worked at Coupang as developer and I want to tell you it's recommendable company.
Especially, if you are developer(or s/w engineer or data scientist), you can focus on your own development work and also experience diverse domain because you can move team easily in company I think. Also you can work at home or working earlier or later little bit.",Launch is not free and I think profit is not stable yet.
