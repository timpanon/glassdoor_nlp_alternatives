0,Course Hero,Such a positive culture,2022-04-04,5.0,Director of Technical Accounting,"I have been really impressed by the positive attitudes and culture of all the people I've met across the Course Hero team. Also, many nice perks that are targeted at creating a great experience for those that work here.","So far, not really any."
1,Course Hero,Great benefits & work life balance,2022-03-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Course Hero offers great flexibility and work life balance,No cons at this time

- Great benefits",Honestly nothing that I can think of
3,Course Hero,Easy job but pay not competitive with bleak IPO prospects,2022-03-17,2.0,Software Engineer,"Nice people.
Laid back culture.
Decent perks.
Empathetic colleagues most times.","Very slim chances of IPO. No talk of the same by execs. Whenever question of IPO comes up, it's shooed away. So you just have base pay to survive on, which is getting incredibly difficult in these inflationary times.

I don't know if it's a push from the top down or just too much emphasis on DEI, folks who are sweet talkers are promoted. With all kinds of metrics available, it's so easy these days for higher ups to see who's actually working and who's faking it. It's a bad sign when people who talk too much without bringing anything to the table are promoted. This isn't Google who can afford those kind of folks.

Too much attrition in Product org and too many weak PMs :(

Hiring too many people too fast. There's not enough work for engineers due to a weak Product org and lack of initiatives. Company can't afford top tier talent yet managers want to hire more engineers so they can show ""growth"" and be promoted.

Finally the product itself. UI/UX sucks big time. Majority of the students are complaining about the site being a scam. They lure students into a monthly subscription plan and then charge the whole year amount upfront. In spite of a large number of complaints, they continue this practice which gives a bad name to the company. In spite of investing heavily into branding, there's no results to show for it."

32,Course Hero,"Great Place, Great people overall!",2021-01-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great people overall!, Second Level and Higher Manager Excellent.","Immediate Manager, may have had some good qualities, but I must have missed them!"
33,Course Hero,Ethically minded company with good benefits and fantastic CEO,2021-01-21,5.0,Program Manager,"I worked at Course Hero for 2 years. I was continually impressed by Course Hero's sincere desire to look out for its employees, its customers (students), and the greater education world. They accomplish this in many ways--volunteer hours benefit; massive donations to charitable causes; frequent symposiums for students and educators; and of course, great benefits and flexible schedules. 

Also, a special shout out to Andrew Grauer, the CEO. He is the most available CEO I've ever worked with. He isn't some mysterious and far away presence employees rarely, if ever, see. He is part of everyday life, knows all the employees, and participates passionately in their projects.","The company can be somewhat siloed when it comes to departments. It reminds me of being in high school and each subject is categorized and isolated, even though there is tremendous overlap. What ends up happening is that departments have less incentive than they should to work together to achieve goals. If your project is not in their budget, why should they allocate their limited resources to working on it. 

A solution to this would be to have more cross-functional departments that are tasked with supporting everyone. And that really does mean everyone. Every department needs engineering, yet it often feels like an entirely separate part of the company. Same goes for marketing, growth, and others. 

Also, the company should build cross collaboration into programs and job roles, not just assume it will happen. It sometimes felt like there was constant competition for limited resources, so less prioritized programs would have a higher change to fail, not because they weren't good ideas but because no one had made them a priority among shared services. If the company is going to create programs, it needs to commit to supporting them. Otherwise, it is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.

All that said, these are issues most companies face, and Course Hero has shown a desire to improve."

I had a chance to join two major Bay Area tech companies but went with my gut and chose Course Hero because of the vibe and people. And I'm so, so glad I did that. Been working remotely the whole time since COVID but it's been great even so. After being here for a little bit I've noticed there are some real veterans - people who've been here 7+ years. Now I see why - it's pretty fantastic, like a best-kept secret company to work for.",• I legit can't think of anything. Not a single thing.

It is a very inviting environment and everyone is willing to help if you need help, have questions, etc. There are great benefits. During Covid, the team still finds way to make their employees feel cared for - they send us care packages, they have virtual meditation/yoga/game nights, they create opportunities for virtual volunteering. These things matter - especially during such tough times.",None that I can think of.
41,Course Hero,Great business opportunity & culture,2020-05-21,5.0,Director of Growth and Campus Operations,"- Plenty of business opportunity and potential for further growth
- Passionate co-workers who are motivated by the mission

- The employees and managers all proactively engage, encourage, and live by these values
- Everyone is super supportive and kind and constantly edifying each other, but not as empty praise
- Very sharp, brilliant people here, all doing what they love
- Fantastic and well-presented onboarding content (company-general, with deep dives into each area of the business for full coverage)
- Small company size means big impact for every employee","I can't think of any cons, but I can see areas for improvement in the CM process, though I come from a more stringent background, and with fewer cooks in the kitchen, it's possible to stay relatively stable with less stringent CM/release practices. But, as the company scales, potentially this will need to improve, and I'm sure it will. People here are forward-thinking and planning for the future, from what I have seen already."
44,Course Hero,All a facade,2020-05-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Well crafted communications by leadership
- Incredibly well paid
- Excessive benefits
- Flexibility, few hours of work/day
- Relaxed environment","If you're looking for somewhere happy, easy, and well-paid to work, Course Hero is excellent. However, all of these positives are there to create an incredibly well-crafted facade of paid ""best places to work"". 

When Course Hero has to make difficult decisions, such as creating real work challenges, holding everyone accountable to performance, or protecting against harassment and sexual assault, Course Hero will always take the easy, most favorable route for themselves vs. being good people. This is hardly surprising of a business but is surprising of a company who boasts a culture of the complete opposite. Beneath the surface, they go directly against the culture they try to promote. They have some ugly secrets but most won't have to get to the point to see them anyway."
45,Course Hero,"Challenging in a good way, lots to learn, fast pace, great benefits, and a company with a wonderful culture and values.",2020-05-11,5.0,Senior Data Analyst,"Lots to learn, fast pace, challenging in a good way, plenty of ways to grow in your career, wonderful culture, great benefits, and a company that values their employees well being and happiness.","Well, I don't have any cons so far. Right now I see the company in between a stage of a startup type of environment to the very early stages of a mid-size company environment.  I'm optimistic we can learn how to adopt and take the best hybrid of both worlds. The company has done a fantastic job of taking care of their employees safety and well being during these strange times."
46,Course Hero,A refreshing change from the typical Silicon Valley company,2020-05-04,5.0,Machine Learning,"I just joined not long ago but even through virtual meetings you can already see that this company has very clear communications and lays out all its difficulties in plain sight so everyone can try to help work on it. 

The executive team is considerate and empathetic. You can really see the difference this makes as it trickles down to the management and ICs like myself. Management here often hold weekly one-on-one meetings to help employees achieve their best.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, the company took good care of its employees and finds all sorts of ways to keep people happy including extra holidays and work from home perks. Weekly fireside chats with CEO etc to understand the business and Q&A sessions. 

The business is growing quickly and so is everyone's careers who work here (employees are considered for promotions every 6 months).",The company is not the largest player in the industry and has plenty of places for a new hire to add value including fixing previous tech debt. I don't think there is anything out of the ordinary I have found yet.

Engineering-wise, the company is undergoing pretty amazing growth and there is lots of work to be done (which is an exciting thing).",The campus is nice but kind of out on an island where there isn't much else. It can sometimes be a very difficult commute just on account of the 101 traffic.
54,Course Hero,This place is amazing.,2019-09-09,5.0,Senior Site Reliability Engineer,"Collaborative, mutually supportive community. Focused on getting things done, solving issues, and helping each other.","Feels almost to good to be true? Might be new hire shininess, might be a secret cult in the basement? That being said, I think a lot of the joy for me is the culture fit. I want a team based, work together, help each other up when you fall, everyone shares credit when you succeed workplace, with a focus on making real, traceable improvements based on metrics and high transparency. That is Course Hero down to the ground."

Awesome perks, great atmosphere.","My out of pocket health care monthly contributions were about twice my prior job (at a similar sized startup). 
The company is starting to scale, and thus has fairly typical growing pains that you might expect (engineering agility, program management, out-growing facilities)"
56,Course Hero,Great People Company at a Critical Juncture,2019-07-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Ask any Course Hero employee what they like most about working there and the answer will likely be, ""The people."" And it's true. Course Hero is filled with smart, respectful, and collaborative people who want to make a positive difference in the lives of students and educators.

This is due in large part to Course Hero being a people-first company, and they genuinely strive to make their employees happy with generous health benefits, matching 401K, professional development opportunities, catered lunches, 360 reviews, a gym membership, and work-from-home flexibility.

There are a lot of perks, which, at a superficial level, makes Course Hero a great place to work. In fact, most employee satisfaction surveys have shown people are generally happy with Course Hero’s culture, their role, and their compensation.

People are also recognized for their contributions and successes, and, in my experience, team members will do whatever they can to mentor and support one another. There is no “sink or swim” mentality here; people want to see you succeed and thrive.

With all of this said—while Course Hero is a fantastic people company on the inside, it falls short in areas concerning the actual business itself, which will ultimately be detrimental to the company’s long-term health. As one other reviewer noted, “Everyone is very ambitious about where the company can go, so they sometimes downplay the problems that are present now.” It’s these persistent problems, though—a website with a frustrating UI, questionable tutors, virtually no QA oversight for the documents (CH’s primary selling point)—that negate the company’s mission of helping students and effectively erode the trust of people who sign up for the service. Once that trust is gone, any new products or features in the pipeline will be too little too late.","In my pros, I mentioned how employees are generally happy with the perks and the pay. But—in the very same survey—when asked about their overall outlook about the company and its mission, that’s where scores suffer. 

Part of it could be the company’s vision (“To see every student graduate confident and prepared”), which is reminiscent of a beauty pageant contestant wishing for world peace. It is noble but not super compelling, especially at a time when college is more expensive than ever. Most people at Course Hero want to change the landscape of education by making it more accessible, not cost-prohibitive.

But I think the larger issue is that the company is trying to be something for everyone. To be valuable for every student and for every educator. So rather than focusing on building a platform and being the best at serving a particular subset of that audience or capitalizing on a specialized service (à la Chegg’s textbook rentals), Course Hero is trying to be the best at serving everyone in every subject—which is a really vague directive for engineering and product teams to be working under. This lack of clarity results in countless hours of meetings and brainstorming sessions that lack any real focus, objective, or follow-up.

Additionally, there is a disconnect between the internal Course Hero “bubble” and our real-world customers, which has resulted in seemingly half-baked executive decisions and a perpetual string of MVP launches that fail to address actual customer needs. What’s unfortunate is that these MVPs are rarely, if ever, improved upon or optimized based on user feedback, so they are quickly swept under the rug. Then priorities shift, managers change, and it’s back to square one.

As it stands, there seems to be more emphasis on crafting the image we want people to have of Course Hero versus making tangible improvements that would benefit students' lives and ultimately improve a user’s experience.

In the end, employees who joined Course Hero thinking they were going to work on something meaningful or exciting for students end up getting bored or disillusioned and ultimately leave.

The rest stick around because, well, it’s a great people company with great perks and a nice paycheck. Unfortunately, being a great people company without a great product has created a culture of complacency. And without more focused leadership making more difficult and smarter decisions based on actual customer data and feedback, Course Hero will continue launching half-baked, watered-down features based on groupthink that fail to satisfy customer needs.

TL;DR:

If you are applying or interviewing for Course Hero, you’ve picked a great people company. Leadership, though, is still relatively new, and they're trying to find Course Hero's product-market fit, so be prepared to evolve on a quarterly basis with the company’s needs. The company is at a critical juncture as they invest more in machine learning, and the next couple of years are going to be quite telling of the company's long-term outlook."

59,Course Hero,"Mission Driven, High Growth, and Collaborative Workplace",2019-03-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company makes a huge effort to be customer focused both externally and internally. There is a focus on really listening to students and educators in order to build a product that will promote deeper learning and one that will support educators in what they do in the classroom. It's also deeply motivating to be in a company that invests so much in employee engagement and retention. We have great benefits and are constantly upgrading them based on internal engagement surveys. They are also really competitive against other companies of our size. For example, we have 16 weeks parental leave, great 401k matching, and even a local move program where the company gives employees a stipend for moving within 10 miles of the office.","As we scale and plan for major growth milestones, leadership and teams are constantly planning which can often lead to a lot of meetings throughout the week. It's an area of improvement that I can see changing as we build out more teams and managers to execute these plans."

The company is also very mission-driven, and you can feel how passionate people are about education and tech.","There are definitely growing pains that most of us feel. The company's goals are very ambitious, which is great, and figuring out how to accomplish those while scaling can be difficult.

65,Course Hero,A company with a mission and a plan,2018-09-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Improving the world of higher education is a goal that's easy to love. The company has the benefit of a strong revenue channel and customers who do not need to be convinced further of the value of the offering. Coworkers are friendly and optimistic. Hours are flexible and reasonable. The office is spacious with perks of a gym, snacks, onsite cafeteria, and one weekly catered lunch. No doubt due to the aforementioned, retention is high. There is plenty of product still to be built, and it is possible to make a big impact.","The location is far from convenient mass transit and restaurants.

- Transparent management: easy to be involved in as well as well-informed of the company-wise decision making processing.
- Flexible and efficient work policies: employees are allowed to be WFH twice every week, while the company offers a lot of efficient ways - ZOOM, BEAM, Slack calls - to ensure people who is WFH could be well-participated in every meeting/process.
- Great opportunities: fast growth brings a lot of opportunities for everyone to work with/learn from, in the meantime, you're also encouraged to work on something you're really interested in.",Need more senior engineers to give more higher-level inputs (I know it's being well-executed now).

The company genuinely cares about their employees and shows it: very flexible work schedule and a demonstrated effort to build a community for coworkers through lunches and company events.",The office is sometimes low energy because of the flexible work schedule
72,Course Hero,"A Lot To Love, And Even More Potential",2018-02-19,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Team members are amazing. The people you work daily with are funny, passionate, and supportive. There is a lot of intelligence across the company.

- The pay, benefits, and perks are hard to find anywhere else. The new office is beautiful. They take really great care of their employees. 

- The company has ambitious goals and an aggressive growth strategy. They want very badly to succeed, and they are willing to supply the resources to make success a reality. 

- The work can be really interesting. You're typically busy without being swamped, and projects are generally very worth your time. It feels fulfilling.","- Management is this company's greatest weakness. The staff across the board is relatively young,  and many of the managers just do not know how to be good managers. They're very insular and communicate often with EACH OTHER, but it's difficult to get support from other teams' managers when it's needed because, well, you aren't on their level. Everything from not making eye contact/saying hello in the hallway to not responding to questions that are necessary to do your job. They're smart people, but not great at creating a positive culture for everyone and not great communicators. Managers should spend more time listening to team members and clearing the path for their success in their roles rather than demanding delivery on goals that are sometimes created without potential impediments in mind."

74,Course Hero,"Please, don't waste your time here!",2018-01-17,1.0,Senior Customer Support Representative,"The benefits package was one of the best I have ever seen, however, there are a lot of technicalities to each benefit, and participation varies by department. 

The campus this office is on is extremely pleasant","Where to start? Onboarding for CS was a terrible joke. Being handed 500 pages of google docs hardly constitutes as training someone. Very little of the training was dialogue based or hands on. 

The CS team was pretty much cold as ice, it was not very apparent to me that they were happy to be welcoming someone new onto the team. The other departments seem to have more fun, but very little to no collaboration exists between departments. 

The role itself is a total energy suck--even as a Senior Rep I was consistently told that I needed to spend 75-80% of my time dealing with Tier 1 phone calls. 9/10 of these calls were simply issuing refunds. I had no control over my own schedule, and management often times felt manupulative. 

The sense of ownership and strategy is sorely lacking in this role, and sorely needed for this company. Trying to get any positive movement within this organization was like pulling teeth, please spare yourself the misery and skip this all together."
75,Course Hero,"Great People, Innovative Product, Inspiring Vision",2018-01-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been at Course Hero for ~4 years and it is by far the best Company I have worked for.  Being a part of a talented team that has grown from 30 to 140 has been wild and fun ride.  The team here is made of passionate, hardworking and collaborative folks that creates an environment where I'm often and find myself walking across the office to ask a question rather sending a slack message.  There is no question that creating a platform that is helping to be a build a world where students graduate, confident and prepared is what gets me excited when I wake up every morning. 

Also just moved to new office space and benefits are fantastic!",The last office space was a little tight for the number of individuals in the company (e.g. challenging to book conference rooms) - however the new office is almost double the space with plenty of room for growth.

Also, monthly gas card!","We used to have more free lunches, but since there was a lot of waste from a lot of people choosing to work from home, the number of days was reduced"
77,Course Hero,Amazing culture; tremendous potential,2017-11-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Course Hero has an amazing culture; it is truly a delight to work here. Teams are highly collaborative and there is a sense of belonging that is often missing in Silicon Valley companies.

Furthermore, the company has tremendous potential. Despite enormous success, they have an even bigger opportunity ahead of them. It's exciting to be at Course Here in this phase.","The ""niceness"" of the company/people can sometimes get in the way of difficult decisions.

81,Course Hero,"Wonderful People, Super Interesting Workplace, Mixed Feelings",2017-08-07,4.0,Software Engineer,"- The people here are, for the most part, absolutely wonderful. I loved my immediate team, and some of the nicest, most helpful people I've met in my career so far have been at Course Hero. This is Course Hero's strongest asset *by far*; the people here simply take care of one another. The culture here is extremely collaborative, and you will never feel isolated here.

- A very relaxed place with *no hard deadlines*. Despite being a startup, Course Hero is quite stable and profitable, so the company doesn't push people to the brink to get work done by a certain date. If you're looking for a place with work/life balance, Course Hero has it in spades. Your job here never feels at risk; there is no such thing as layoff given how well the company is doing.

- Solid compensation/perks package. Pay is respectable, the gas card/other transportation benefits are neat, and the on-campus gym is awesome. And yeah, free food 3 days a week with lots of leftovers because people WFH so much, haha.

- Lots of freedom as an engineer. The management here is purposefully very hands-off, and at least for me, the product managers and the designers make sure that you have a say in their pillars of the team and don't micromanage what you're doing. Like I said before, the culture here is very collaborative and this is a good place to become well-rounded as an engineer since you have the opportunity to work regularly with non-engineering fields.

- Flexible work hours.

- Board game nights.

- Video game setups.","- High-level learning opportunities are few and far between from a hard skills standpoint. I was able to do a lot of self-driven learning at Course Hero due to the freedom there, so I'm happy that I learned to do a lot of things but unhappy that I didn't really learn how to do things right. This is because the company's software engineering workforce is VERY junior (the median age of a SWE at Course Hero is like 23), and it has had an incredibly hard time hiring senior engineers, especially those from top companies. There is simply nobody there to teach you how to build things responsibly and to scale. To this day, Course Hero hasn't made a single engineering hire from Facebook, Google, or a top-top startup like Airbnb/Pinterest; pretty much all the good senior talent there has been raised internally, which is awesome but not sustainable in my opinion for the long term.

- Because of the junior workforce mentioned above, the codebase and overall development environment is very, very messy and unstable. Architecture isn't really a thing at Course Hero, and there's hacks everywhere. People will resolve a merge conflict by commenting out all the conflicting code. Everyone merges directly into 1 dev branch. Code review and QA are treated as afterthoughts for a lot of the company, which you can quickly and easily see by making the website bug out after slightly stepping outside of a happy flow. 3rd party libraries are used like crazy for expediency instead of taking the time to build stable, internal infrastructure. Even the wifi goes down for half the day to an entire day sometimes.

- The product roadmap is surprisingly conservative and unfocused for a startup. None of the roadmap features in my opinion were particularly ambitious with some of them being carbon copies of existing products like Sparknotes. And there are a LOT of product initiatives that the company is trying to add alongside its flagship documents product which accounts for like 90%+ of traffic and revenue.

- I loved how relaxed and pressure-free Course Hero, but in my later days there, I definitely felt like it got too extreme. Some people were getting away with doing incredibly little there, which was very bad because a few of these people were at a senior level and setting a terrible example for the rest of the company. An official policy of 2 WFH days a week is too aggressive. The office was 50%+ empty every day during my last months there and felt like a ghost town.

- The org went from super flat from when I started to a middle management bloat nightmare. There's too many levels now, and as a result, change from a managerial perspective is slow and confusing. In my later time there, I had no idea what the upper management was planning for the company, and there were random new processes being dropped left and right for seemingly no reason. Like the upper management, I wanted the company's engineering workflow to be more clean and stable, but this wasn't the right way of going about it."

The senior management is very present and they make an effort to connect with each employee, regardless of position. The engineering projects are productive and impactful, and they give you the opportunity to work all over the stack and really understand the code base.

That is in addition to the standard pros that other top startups boast about such as great benefits, fully stocked up kitchen, 401K matching, free food etc.. You can find all those in other top startups but you cannot find the same environment almost anywhere - that is a big part of why I like working at Course Hero and why I have been with Course Hero so long.",You have to be ok with getting things done rather than getting things done perfectly.

103,Course Hero,Awful management,2015-10-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"good company culture for the most part, good benefits, good coworkers","Course Hero claims to be transparent, but their management system is anything but. I can only speak for the engineering team. Decisions are often made without consulting the people it involves. They do a good job of pretending to listen to people, but do nothing to act upon it. This is the main reason why so many have left the company. There has also been several incidents over the past few years across different teams where people have been let go with zero warnings because management didn't like them, with the excuse that the person being let go had had several warnings.

This is only a good place to apply if it's your first job out of college and you need working experience. You'll get the working experience you need, but you'll want to move onto a better place. Once you've been there for a year or so, you'll start to see why it's such a bad place to work when you have to deal with management.

Take a look at the employees- Course Hero is now in the 50-100 employee range, but only a small handful of that number have worked at Course Hero for more than 1-2 years despite the company being around since 2006. It is a place to step off your career, but not a place where you can develop and grow."

- They're not stingy... (24/7 free snacks and drinks and catered lunches on fridays + commuting allowance)
- A lot of room for growth considering the size of the company.
- With the current business model, room for growth is immense
- Good ideas in the pipeline (going global etc.)","- The inexperience of a lot of employees is pretty obvious.
- The view of the big picture is often lost and while working on projects, lots of tunnel vision
- Projects are usually not well scoped out. A lot of stuff is figured out on the fly, resulting is wasted time"
112,Course Hero,Good people and culture of always improving.,2013-12-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"One of the biggest pros to working at Course Hero is the opportunity to grow, own projects and learn new things.  This job has taught me how to be self-sufficient and the challenges that I encounter everyday have helped me become better at problem solving too.  Management always encourages us to ask questions and seek help when we need it.  Another pro is the people.  Everyone helps everyone which creates a very supportive work environment.  My colleagues are smart, hard-working and fun to be around.","Very fast-paced, projects are always changing or put on the back burner so it's hard to prioritize sometimes."
113,Course Hero,A Great Place to Work!,2013-12-04,5.0,,"The team at Course Hero is fantastic. The culture is open. Management encourages collaboration, and more importantly urges employees - regardless of position - to innovate and shape the company. 

The engineering team is fantastic. These guys are hard workers and really know what they are doing. The most approachable and sociable ;) group on engineers you will ever come across. This team represents the bedrock, the foundation upon which Course Hero thrives. The best analogy to describe this team is a family. Also, the designers are ""soooo dope!"" Aesthetic geniuses! They are shaping Course Hero into one of the 7-wonders-of-the-world. A site for sore eyes. They've got edge and style. They are pretty friendly too. 

The customer service team is also top notch. These guys are workhorses; Often working long hours, and even putting in time on the weekends! Can't think of a more organized, friendly and down-to-earth group of folks. They truly do put the customer first (Something that all CS teams should strive to do). These guys are straight ""ballers!"" The marketing team is pretty sweet. These guys know how to craft a dynamite email and construct some very compelling on-site copy. Literary masterminds! Wordsmiths!

The hardest working team in Course Hero is 100% Campus Operations. Essentially the driving force behind Course Hero's ongoing success. They are a well-oiled machine! An efficient, lively and vivacious group of people. Never a dull moment with this team! The best group of managers I've ever seen. This would be a really fun team to work on. Good stuff! 

The management team is pretty cool too. Always open to chat. Love talking strategy and are ping-pong prodigies! Definitely think the CEO Andrew Grauer is piloting this company in the right direction. And a lot of great things can be said about his right-hand-man Brian Madigan; This guys know's what he's doing. 

And whoever else I left off is pretty cool too. I have no complaints. I feel fortunate to work with such motivated & great people. 

In summary, Course Hero is cool. The people are cool. The management is cool (Friendly, approachable, encouraging and a laundry list of other positive adjectives). Anyone who thinks differently is probably just a curmudgeon/troll or some other creepy-crawler that thrives on spewing negativity or whatever. I guess what I'm saying is there is really no reason not to like this company. If you are seeking career growth, there is plenty of opportunity to foster your development here. Reach out and seize your opportunities. There are no hand-outs! Just do it!!!","We are bursting at the seams with talent and potential! We have so many lucrative projects at the ready, we just need to move faster. We definitely need to hire engineers! If you are an engineer, you should probably maybe think about working here! Course Hero needs you. Did I mention that this company treats engineers like rock-stars. I digress. Course Hero is great, the company just needs to move faster."
114,Course Hero,Mid-size startup overcoming some growing pains,2013-11-23,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great work-life balance, most people maintain a 40 hour work week.  Andrew, the CEO, tries to be very accessible and encourages employees to approach him with questions and feedback.  Everyone is fun, friendly, and social with each other.  Great perks, such as a huge gym and pool, Friday lunches, holiday parties and events, and ping-pong and other games in the office. Many coworkers are friends and hang out outside of work, going to movies or playing board games or poker night.","Course Hero is undergoing its ""awkward teenage years"".  The senior management recently threw out its formerly ""flat"" organization, and created a management structure, pulling people into management roles who are not necessarily prepared to be managers.  They created a forced hierarchical structure without explaining any clear reward or promotion system, and without training the people in leadership roles or empowering them to make real, impactful business decisions.  Thus, the team leads are in name only and the new structure pissed off a lot of people who didn't understand or benefit from the change.  So you have leaders who aren't prepared to be leaders, don't have real authority to influence the business, and a lot of disgruntled lesser employees - not a great combination.  The senior management seems to be distracted with recruiting new engineers and managing the engineers, and a lot of non-engineering people feel abandoned or left without direction in the meantime.  Employees are not encouraged to innovate or move the business forward, because they either don't understand their new role or have been told that the big decisions should be left to the people at the top of the new ""top-down"" structure.  Communication is limited or non-existent between senior management and the lower tiers of the organization.  So, decisions are not communicated and employees don't feel involved or utilized as much as they could be."
115,Course Hero,An easy-going and hardworking team,2013-10-11,5.0,UI Designer,"I have had great experiences working with this versatile and friendly team. As a recent grad,  I was well mentored by our team lead when I first joined, and I feel as though all of my contributions are put to good use. I appreciate how much of the success of certain page designs are based on testing and real data. In all, I would say that this job has helped me to exercise and grow my skill set, and I feel like there is a lot of room to have my opinions heard  and flex my creative muscles. Also, the developer community revolves a lot around gaming and weekly fun activities, which is a huge plus and makes for a really good working and social environment.","I can't really think of any. This is the best place I have worked as a UI designer so far. Some of the other struggles that I have experienced at other companies have not popped up here, and our brand and online presence are constantly improving."
116,Course Hero,Learning while Helping Students Learn,2013-10-08,5.0,Software Engineer,"The team I work with is exceptionally talented, smart, and easy to get along with.  The company goes out of their way to find people that really match the company culture, while also being the best candidates in their particular fields.  There are numerous opportunities to learn from colleagues with diverse sets of skills.  We are also constantly improving our platform to help our customers access learning materials and services specific to their needs.  This means that many of us also learn a lot of new technologies and techniques along the way.  The lessons I've taken from working at CH I've been able to apply to other facets of my life, which is always great, and emphasizes the broad range of experiences to be gained.","This is still a small scale start up.  It has a good foothold in its market, but it is still trying to branch out and expand in many ways.  In the past few years, a number of features and projects have been worked that were eventually dropped.  All with good reason, and all are viewed as a learning experience.  However, this still means that a team of people spent several hours to days working on a project that was a failure.  This has never been a reflection of the team, but still can be tough to deal with."
117,Course Hero,Great for Growth,2013-09-24,5.0,Campus Manager,"Course Hero has been excellent for my professional growth, and I truly can say that I am passionate about and interested in what I do everyday. As a very successful start-up,  CH is constantly looking for new and better ways to perform our service, which allows employees to propose projects, solutions, and constantly evaluate our processes. When suggestions are well-thought out and planned, they are supported by upper management. When they plans are poorly planned or not consistent with the company's current focus, they are not pursued but are followed with constructive feedback and the encouragement to share new ideas. As an employee, this has meant receiving encouragement for doing the job I was hired to do, as well as encouragement for improving and expanding my position and service. CH is excellent if you are passionate about your field, willing to work hard, and interested in innovating and helping the company with its rapid growth.","As a start-up, our structure is constantly being re-defined as the majority of employees really are learning as we go. This is great for employee's professional growth, as you are constantly learning and adapting on the job. However, an ever-changing structure and undefined protocols can make some projects/interactions more stressful than necessary. Everyone, including upper management, truly is well-intentioned and cares about the company and each employee. However, we are constantly adding new people and evaluating our product, which makes a consistent and smooth structure hard to define and implement. On the day-to-day this means meetings can start/run late, and that individuals have to take the initiative to follow-up with questions/work they need answered/done from others."
118,Course Hero,You Drive Us,2013-09-24,5.0,Senior Manager,"It is truly a remarkable experience to be apart of a company that values your hard work as much as your opinion. I have been working at Course Hero for a little over a year and I feel like I have been able to experience and influence a lot of our recent innovations. For still being a semi-recent grad, I can't imagine myself gaining more opportunities and growth at any other company as I have here at Course Hero. Our “fun” management approach and clear communication between separate departments makes it easy to approach any employee which helps gain better insight for any work project I am apart of. Being part of a company that is also driven to assist other's is enlightening as well. Through our partnership with Books for Africa, I feel like I get to make a difference at my job every single day.",With how close nit we are as a company it be great to have more employees involved with future hiring decisions.
119,Course Hero,Truly a great place to work,2013-09-23,5.0,Campus Manager,"Course Hero has been an amazing experience.  It is the epitome of what every new college grad working in tech should experience.  A vibrant work environment, management who cares about your success, as well as an amazing work/life balance.  I feel very comfortable approaching managers, and even Andrew (CEO) about any questions or concerns that I have.  Everyone, no matter what team they are on, is more than willing to teach you about the ins and outs of what they do on a day to day basis.  Plus, there is always constant feedback, which is huge!",Performance reviews and compensation structure could be a little more clearly defined.  Possibly specific competencies to be rated on.
