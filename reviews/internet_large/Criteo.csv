19,Criteo,Great company to work for,2022-02-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Criteo has developed a genuine company culture, it's a people-first company. 
There are many ways to have a positive impact aside from your job, you can join communities, charities... 

Criteo offers career development opportunities, in 3 years time, I have had the opportunity to work for several offices in EMEA 

It's a fast-paced and competitive industry, with a lot of smart people.","Being within a fast-paced industry, employees need to be comfortable with constant change (new industry standards, advertising rules, product roadmap...)"
20,Criteo,One of the better companies,2022-02-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great company wide growth, position autonomy, and a solid vision. Love the CEO/leaders and the initiatives.","I joined more than a year ago and have yet to meet anyone in the company.

Really poor amount of PTO (I was surprised at how few days were given). 

Unless you’re fairly high management level, no stock options. 

Too many politics stunting growth.

Individual countries take their own route and don’t reflect the global culture / initiatives."
21,Criteo,Lack of growth,2022-02-16,4.0,Account Strategist,"Great work/life balance and learning experience, solid product that actually performs. CEO was great too",Lack of growth opportunities after a couple years
22,Criteo,A big company,2022-02-16,4.0,Software Engineer,"- all advantages of a big company (healthcare, stability, interesting projects)
- industry leader and innovative
- big data structure","- it depends on people you end up working with (some teams are more remote, others are more always thinking of work up and you may get notifications at 3am, others are more chill and so on). You have to ask with which team you'll end up working and meet them.
- some projects may be vowed to failure but as upper management is pushing you have to do it even if you don't believe in it
- close to impossible to negotiate the pay outside the evaluation process ; personally I am below what I could get on the market (but I stay for personal reasons)
- the matrix and the 360 evaluation system is actually a trap for people that don't especially make friends in the office. You think it helps your progress but for people that have a life after work you don't know a lot of people from work (because work is as you guess it only work) and then during the evaluation process people that make lots of connections have better evaluations
- the big data part is kind of a protected kingdom and it is very difficult to enter in it. The idea is that big data is the source of income of Criteo and so the closer you get to that the greater is your power in the company but this is less and less true and other people should be valued as such because at the moment people working in non-big data areas are not valued as much."
23,Criteo,Beats unemployment for sure,2022-02-14,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Criteo is tech focused and the engineers are the stars here.

* The management is somewhat open to change
* Company values diversity
* OK compensation
* Very good work life balance
* Paid overtime
* Varied tech stack (c#, java, scala, kotlin, python, ruby) so you'll find a match
* OK place to start your career","Coming from a FAANG company due to family reasons, I was shocked at the diversity of engineer skills here. You can see one skilled and enthusiastic engineer, and a staff/senior engineer that shouldn't even be hired as an intern. Though rarely, I've also encountered people in high tech positions that don't speak English very well. It's a mixed bag.

The company is very bureaucratic and slow; even small projects require several meetings in which some people's opinions matter more than others. The kickoff meetings are a joke, people just want to state things to sound smart and they block you in the process.

The codebase is very low quality, there's no coding standard, and the high number of supported languages doesn't help. When a feature is replaced, the old code doesn't get deleted, the migrations don't get done to completion, and the code grows and grows over time, becoming more fragile at each iteration. Then you find yourself reading code that's not even used anymore, because it turns out that the code you're reading was there just to support one project that prevented some migration from going complete in 2018 and it was decommissioned in 2020, but no one bothered to clean it up.

If you're coming from FAANG, don't make same the mistake I've made. Your skills won't be appreciated here and you'll struggle trying to be productive."

- Very dynamic organization and product portfolio that go through frequent iterations/evolutions which surfaces internal movement opportunities
- An overarching company mission that resonates well (the company likes to call itself the savior of the open internet)
- Your voice is always heard as an employee","- Poor track record of executing on the company vision
- There's not enough commitment on the management side to remove the blockers that thwart execution
- Not a clear correlation between performance and compensation (does not seem to be much of a difference between being a slacker and being a difference-maker)
- Lack of teams/people that own a product or an initiative in an end-to-end fashion (this could lead to a lot of you've got to speak to this team for this and then, this team directs you to another one). This also leads to managers/execs not focusing on their impact but being worried about their title prospects.
- Team structure is not consistent across different regions
- Its compensation level in comparison to market is not consistent across the countries where Criteo has a presence. Particularly, its compensation scheme does not work properly in high-inflation markets."

67,Criteo,"Once great, trying to rebound",2021-11-08,2.0,Marketing,"Best-in-Class Core Product: retargeting performance marketing solution is still the best in the business

Global Culture: opportunity to work with, and learn from, smart people representing different regions, countries and cultures

Strong Benefits: wide variety of benefits beyond the standard ones, including employee reward program, learning and professional development, volunteering, and more

Office Destinations: unique and inviting office spaces throughout the world, particularly in Barcelona, Boston, New York, Paris, Tokyo, and Brazil

People: most employees are very kind, smart, driven, hard working, and exude an entrepreneurial spirit","Lack of Leadership Experience: many of the newer leadership members do not have actual industry experience, and in some cases like Marketing, don't even have experience in Marketing. In addition, many do not seem to have the experience or leadership qualities to guide teams through large transformations. As evidenced by Marketing senior leaders’ lack of empathy, poor handling, and dismissal of loyal, high-performing Marketing employees who were impacted by layoffs and other organizational changes. In addition, Marketing senior leaders, particularly CMO, can act unprofessional and immature at times, with a tendency to play favorites.

Solution Divide: internal friction between teams focused on core Criteo retargeting and retail media solutions, causing teams (i.e. Sales, Marketing, Product) to essentially compete against each other rather than work together for the greater good. This starts with the leaders of those commercial teams, who, up to this point, have demonstrated that they cannot, and will not, work well together.

Ever-changing Priorities: CMO, VP and commercial leaders seem to shift priorities constantly and put more value on lavish customer events and programs rather than strategies that actually impact the business. This causes a lot of stress on the teams who are delivering on plans and are already experiencing burnout.

Feedback Backlash: employees are constantly asked for feedback through a number of surveys, but it rarely translates into any action from the company. This is particularly true in Marketing where the CMO and VP request feedback from Marketing only to chastise and dismiss those who shared anything that was less than positive, creating a toxic team environment where most are now reluctant to ever share honest feedback again.

Career Growth: inconsistent policies across the organization on job titles, positions, spans, levels and pay. This results in favoritism and roadblocks on career progression."

-Politics

Some managers in Barcelona are in the management because they are previous managers' friends (they worked previously together in Linkedin corporation). That created a management in BCN Sales team that is very toxic and block opportunities for employees. In Sales team no women at all in management positions.

Also in Account Strategy Team there are several cases of managers very incompetent, very limited and not strategic at all, they quickly block you to develop profesionnally. The 1to1 are very very ""childish"", those managers are managing their team as if you were at school. It's very frustrating for talented people who feel they loose their time during those meetings. Other managers were great but as they were not personal friends of the top manager, no possibility for them to grow or to shine.

Both teams are great if you are a junior, you would learn a lot in any case.

The best is to work in Paris or under another team, I would avoid AS or Sales in BCN if you want to grow as a professional."

 There is an overwhelming sense of arrogance with internal leaders that Criteo knows best and has been slow or even unwilling to adapt quick enough to the competitive/market dynamics. There is also a significant lack of accountability across teams that creates a frustrating internal and external experience when troubleshooting for clients is needed. Rewarding mediocrity is also the norm which causes further frustration .

Very limited senior support for large and meaningful new business engagement (no top to top engagement to acquire large scale clients). After losing a number of deals there appears to be a slight wake up on this point though. Some leaders do not have a strong understanding of the needs of a global business and approach clients with antiquated and non scalable methods that are leaving clients unhappy. 

There has been high attrition over the past few months which will continue as there has been no desire to address the causes. Some junior people are moving into senior roles quickly on account of this and management has a tendency to nickel and dime on promotions from a salary perspective."

- Turmoil in the industry/world has made the past ~2 years really turbulent. There is constant change and uncertainty about the future of the company. It's hard to get a clear answer from senior leadership on the vision and direction and how that translates to the functioning of individual teams.
- Outside of the CEO, there are many senior leaders (Marketing included) who lack the expertise and skill set to successfully navigate teams through the ongoing transformation. Employees continually give detailed, actionable feedback on how to improve retention, but leadership seems to not really internalize or ""get it."" No quantifiable action has been taken and each time another employee quits, they act surprised. 
- Lack of focus in Marketing from the CMO down. There is a constant ""everything is a priority"" mindset/expectation, which just isn't realistic. It prevents teams for doing work that has an actual impact on the business.  
- Senior Marketing leadership lacks relevant marketing experience. This means that the team is asked to prioritize purely on what they know will make them look good to non-marketers as opposed to what will drive actual marketing success. 
- There is a lot of in-fighting within Marketing. Leadership makes up their minds on who they like or don't like in any given period of time based on their mood. They treat their employees poorly on their way out."

They have little to no knowledge of the teams underneath them, and quite frankly it is a bit embarrassing. Senior Management members never actually leave, they just move to different departments and spread the toxicity.
- If you want to work here, avoid anything OPS related
- While in a meeting in 2019, got laughed at by a senior management member when asked about career paths for Operations teams (FYI, there is none). Turns out they actually own their own french village (shocking).
- Middle management on commercial teams is very cliquey, unprofessional, and make it very clear that they were promoted due to favoritism.
- Salary/ compensation is incredibly noncompetitive for engineering positions, you can find better. 
- You can expect employees to post to their Instagram story wheel all day while you are slaving away in the endless ocean of Jira tickets.
- Plan to work with employees who clearly do not know what they are doing, i.e. something as simple as sending files as attachments.
- HR is borderline non-existent it takes 3 weeks for them to answer any of your issues. 3 WEEKS. They hire ""contractors"" to answer and triage your problem, you dont even get a real HR employee.
- Still does not know how to retain employees, even though they have ""been working on it"". Its been 3 years since you started ""working on it"". A SR Hr representative in 2019 mentioned they dont look to retain employees for more than 3 years. ""We cant make them stay"" was the direct quote. If  an employee leaves within 6-12 months, then they will start looking into why recruiting is failing....What. This is baffling."

When I brought up these concerns to my team’s management, they didn’t take them seriously. I also brought up these concerns in the employee engagement surveys which the People team didn’t seem to take seriously either since nothing ever changed.

- annual leaves are on par with tech industry 
- pretty good medical coverage that covers your family too","Gone are Criteo's glorious days where business in APAC is thriving and quarterly kpi consistently exceeds 100%.

Now, there is only poor leadership and Senior Management are there to tell wonderful stories about their past and achievement but make no to little impact on the revenue or business of Criteo.

Most senior managers are transferred from the headquarters or other EU countries and have no local context in dealing with local client issues, build relationships with clients and neither are they able to provide good directions on how to tackle challenging problems.

The business here has been severely declining over the last 3-4 years (and even more so since covid) with revenue being heavily concentrated in a couple of key clients. Even if new clients are onboarded they are not well-managed leading to high churn rate and extremely slow growth which is worrying.

Rounds of reorg and retrenchment is still happening now from what i heard from the existing colleagues who are still around- you'd never know when the next one is coming!

If you considering a role in operations, career growth is also stunted due to company's core focus to reduce operating expenses so plans are underway to expand the operation hubs in india so the teams there can service the requests coming from apac offices instead. Leavers from ops tend not to be replaced and filled from india instead.

Highly not recommended if you are looking for something stable and have family commitments even though the medical coverage is good.

But still a good place to be in if you are jobless..."

Politics is everything here, unfortunately it´s led to an extremely toxic culture of empty words, broken promises and needlessly cold hearted decisions.
Company has tried to pivot away from relying on cookies by building a succession of products that don´t really meet market need over the last 3-4 years whilst the browser and app privacy changes mean the core product delivers less performance than in the past.

Even if 3 employees from the team of 4 people, are in a sick leave (burn out), HR does NOTHING. The only thing People Partner can say, if you don't like, you are free to leave, your manager will not change. This is how Criteo respects employees rights and helps to solve problems.

- The stock price (at less than 20$, there's no way to retain anyone with RSUs).

273,Criteo,"Great company, energy, and perks",2020-10-01,5.0,Account Strategist,"- There are a lot of very driven, intelligent people that work in every team in the office, and internationally. Many have specialized knowledge, which allows you to seek out individuals for collaboration, and makes getting to know people that much easier. Your individual teams are generally small, so you will really get to know these people and form a tight knit community among the strategy team.

- There is a very positive attitude created by the people you work with. It is likely from a combination of bright, intelligent team members, and a product/platform that is top-notch.

- Frequent opportunity to collaborate with analytics, sales, and products teams. While most are very busy, there's always someone willing to assist you.

- There seems to be a range of management styles at Criteo, which, depending on your working style, is a good thing. Managers push you to do your best, are very experienced themselves, and do a great job at staying connected and in-tune with your daily work (down to very minute details), even in the WFH environment during COVID. There's nothing worse than having a direct manager with little to no hands-on experience in your role. All of them at Criteo are true experts, and bring personal strengths to their relationship with AS's and helping you to develop client strategy.

- The work itself varies based on your team/clients, but the platform, data, and analytics team assistance allows you to get very granular when it comes to uncovering ways to help your clients grow. The role allows you to grow your interpersonal skills as well as in-depth data articulation.

- While it carries less weight in light of COVID, the office is beautiful. near 360 degree views in the heart of downtown Boston. Plenty of snacks and beverages. Plenty of corners to work quietly, or room to collaborate with team members.

- From what I know of the ad-tech/advertising scene in the Northeast, pay is very competitive.","- True to the semi-""startup"" feel of the business, many teams are often very busy. It's challenging (but not impossible) to collaborate with some teams who you'll often rely on. In light of this, most management is aware and working to make this better. In light of COVID, they're actually doing a great job maintaining efficiency in this area as we're all remote.

- The industry in general is entering some uncertain times in regards to data-privacy, and major players control the future of retargeting. There is certainly inherent risk as companies like Criteo are impacted the most if these sweeping changes are carried out."

279,Criteo,Nice company with some structural inefficiencies,2020-09-25,4.0,Machine Learning Engineer,"Criteo is a fine place to work, I'm fairly confident it is the best tech company to work for in France. Criteo's culture is very performance driven, and engineers apply all the best practices in the field. Criteo also has a lot data to work with, which is a data scientist and machine learning practitioner's dream. Technologies used are fairly top notch, Criteo has its own data centers, its own SRE and Infra departments, and many tools to ease the development and deployment processes that rival those of cloud platforms.","The company is somewhat stuck in a limbo between a small startup and a big tech company. It's engineering department is concentrated in France (since it's SF branch has closed), which makes it rather close-minded and less open to the adoption of new and state-of-the-art technologies. The development processes are fairly slow moving, which have made the company fail to diversify its product portfolio in recent years (although it's going a bit better lately). There are several structural inefficiencies, starting from a very big pile of technical debt, that you need to circumvent and adapt to in order to make new products and produce value (it takes effort but it's possible)."

As the business grew, they didn’t invest in supporting departments which left FP&A or SalesOps working night/weekends frequently without relief. You’ll work at 120% capacity your entire time there.

Good Covid-19 support in terms of home equipment, mental support. Though it would have been better to just get a stipend to buy the equipment instead of submitting receipts+get compensation for other expenses.","Disconnected top leadership, many internal blockers for execution, the job involves more moving the needle inside of the company rather than selling the product outside. The leadership likes to have many feedback sessions, where no comments are written by them, no actionable resolution is offered, no accountability or ownership of a problem/solution. 

The worse part - over-achievement is penalized in the long run, higher targets, and less desire of the management to promote top performers. Instead, mediocre employees that provide bad level of service and underachieve are promoted and/or get lower targets."

It makes me wonder if this is something taken seriously...

- They expect you to overachieve with less capacity over the years. The new motto seems to be: do more with less. When you have a large client portfolio, and one thing goes wrong, Team Leads don't understand you don't deliver the same Top Service they deliver in Large Customers when having 10x more clients. Unless you work 10x times more, it's technically impossible. Expectations from Account Strategists should be clearer and risks should be evaluated by managers before reducing resources, thus before blaiming commercial teams.

360,Criteo,"Pretty on the outside, toxic on the inside",2019-08-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Criteo’s compensation is amongst some of the highest in the industry. Benefits are great. Workplace team tries hard to keep us all afloat with events every so often.,"The people are toxic (especially those who’ve been at the company for a few years). They’re put into management positions with NO experience outside of Criteo. Needless to say, these individuals make terrible manager because they don’t take the time to teach you anything because in their minds you should already know everything they know. 
Stress levels are through the roof across all sides of the business. There is so much pressure to rake in revenue. Constant reorgs and the company’s products don’t align with one another as some are in fact competing with one another. Criteo is severely understaffed and many people have left the company in the past few months due to this issue which is leaving Criteo even more understaffed. With holidays right around the corner, I’m not sure what to expect."

- Many opportunities for growth,  in a fast-paced environment where the only constant is change, I can observe hard-working employees who listen to feedback and work through it, getting changes to accomplish their career ambitions.","- Criteo has very ambitious business goals that translate into certain times when the level of pressure is high and it's felt on the employees and the atmosphere.

Whoever is practising compassionate leadership has hired people in the top leadership roles in the name of restructuring and disruption which are far away from knowing what compassion is, which makes one wonder if the compassionate leadership that is being harped is a facade? 1-2-1 meetings with so called top leaders are a torture chamber experience where the real colour of the leader comes out. There is emotional abuse, intimidation, threatening, and ultimatums about your ability to contribute to their bonus. It is hard to see these so called leaders care about people than their own pockets. 

Many people who have been at Criteo for many years have been pushed out in less 
than compassionate ways. People are being fired without ethics. 
People experience (Human Resource) is a joke. 
In the markets where economic crisis is looming, customers are pausing campaigns after three months as Criteo is not able to deliver promised results."

Hackathons, which are supposed to open the mindset, at the end dont really bring innovation in processes, which seems still too waterfall in the daily life.
The mastery of standards is very low, and being based on the status quo (technology and reputation) is limiting the creativity.

- Company leadership is not afraid of trying new things or taking calculated risks to innovate

- Breakfast  stops at 9.15 am. Not cool and we feel that the teams feel like they are going to school and are infantilized. Wrong approach even though it is the best intention, in my humble opinion. There should be cereal available all day long. I know it feels like it is a small thing, but it is not. Many people are really frustrated that have to come early to have breakfast. Different people have breakfast at different times depending on their energy level and habits. Just change breakfast from 7.30 to 10.30 am or even 8 to 10 and stop telling people not to take breakfast for their friends or to their desks. It is really not cool!"

My manager asked me what I needed to better do my job - whether is was more resources, access to a platform, or a day OFF. I was very very lucky to have such an amazing manager. Under this sort of management, I turned nothing into a LOT. Millions in incremental revenue....and all the praise and recognition that one could hope for.

I had an amazing experience here. I worked my a global role and could not have asked for a better group of people to work with...and from all over the world. This was truly my favorite aspect. That I built long last relationships in places like India, South Korea and Spain.","Not everyone was as lucky as me, though. I know a ton of really talented people who left because their managers were terrible. I wish HR was more in-tune and responsive to this...I’m not trying to be critical but if HR paid attention to this, there are certain leaders that would have be ousted a lot sooner.

	People, atmosphere, internationality, chances to learn and develop. Good work-life balance. You'll learn loads and have the time of your life while living in a great climate in a great city. Highly recommended.
	
	Development: 
	Lots of training. 2 weeks of training for all new hires with plenty of follow up trainings and quarterly training 'menu'. Very impressed with the training managers. 
	Chance for lots of feedback and improvement in working style. DISC training etc helps you get to know yourself and others much better and adapt your working style to be most effective with different personality types. Eye-opening for many people!
	
	Managers:
	Generally, very good managers who don't micro-manage and care about the individuals in their teams. 
	The sun shines out of my direct managers and I feel trusted, challenged and valued.
	
	Many people here who have done Erasmus programs before will tell you it feels the same. Very international, meeting so many people from a wide range of backgrounds and countries. Amazing for getting to know a large network of people who are truly more friends than colleagues.","As the company is still growing and evolving very fast, sometimes things slip through the cracks. 
This could be in the form of targets that don't seem to fit the market, wide differences between teams, non-sustainable workloads for some, who have to pick up the slack when people leave, or ambitious growth goals haven't been properly planned for."

I would say the biggest and most important pro would be the Criteo team and Culture. There is a real culture of getting things done. If you have an idea you normally get the freedom to actually try this out, or set this up.

The Barcelona office consist of a lot of young, highly motivated people. This brings an incredible energy with it and makes it a lot of fun to go to work every day. The teams are also quite close, so there are yoga sessions in the summer, beach volleyball evenings and amazing Friday afternoon drinks. 

The other Pros are related to the work itself. It is often quite challenging and I have learned a lot during the 1 ½ years of working here. Even though the work is challenging, we do get the tools to get the best out of it. We have an amazing training team who supply us with work and non-work related skills.","As you can read in the Pros section, there is a go-get attitude across all levels of the company. So, this has the consequence that Criteo is unstructured in its processes’. Couple this with a fast paced market and quickly adapting company; it results in a lack of structure (and a bit of a start-up vibe). This could be a challenge if you are used to working in a more traditional market or company."

I recently got to speak at our Global conference, on a subject not related to my day to day work but that I am passionate about and which is relevant, in a broader sense, to everyone, and I've been with the company a mere 7 months.

We can also work remotely from any other Criteo office if we want to do a bit of travelling. Which I think is such a simple yet effective perk!

Management are very reasonable and recognise that life outside of work is incredibly important and that happy staff = a successful business.","As with all other jobs I've ever had in the media industry. Definitely not for the fainthearted, its a fast paced environment and the work seemingly never stops. 

We are rewarded really well from a financial perspective (in my opinion) so it makes it worthwhile.  But it can be stressful at times and there are many plates to spin. 

That said, as described in 'pros', Criteo actually helps us learn and adopt the tools necessary to thrive in such an environment, for example: mindfulness and nutrition talks, meditation classes, massages on Fridays, the option to WFH ad hoc.

The structure is quite flat, I don't know where I would go from here in another year or so. Though again, this is not exclusive to Criteo, this has always been the case for the Media roles and companies I've worked in, ."

Want a promotion? you better be best friends with the manager, oh and make sure you start a bunch of meaningless projects so that upper management sees you. 

Want a senior position? Got a french passport?

Yes we can improve things, but seriously for such a recent and fast growing company I'm quite amazed about what we're able to achieve. Criteo cares about people.

Reading some comments make me feel uncomfortable, specially people say being French is a requirement to be promoted. The fact is ; your nationality doesn't matter. Yes, you can be French and lead another market, exactly as you can be Dutch and lead UK. Or Italian and lead Spain....  We have so many examples ! Criteo is a French company, so it used to be almost 100% French some years ago.  The French employees who started 5 years ago and helped structure the huge growth are naturally in managerial positions now. I don't think there's any French conspiracy here  :-)

Focus on your skills, focus on what you can improve around you. You'll be rewarded.","Criteo is a Public company so yes numbers matters a lot and can create some level of pressure, specially on Sales people.

Well, when you build a company based on the french management cover by some American startup management there will be a problem one day.

Here we are.

The middle management have to be fulfilled by competent people, not the people that have been here since the beginning and have created a kind of untouchable bubble. The fact is that if you want to manage sales team, prove yourself first instead of being promoted because you joined the company at the right time. 

This is where the problems start. 

Then when you hire people with skills, do not manage them like kids and do not expect that they are going to follow every single sales advice you give.
You have to learn as well from everyone.

You are not better because you're manager and you don't know everything about sales (please listen to people).

With this (French) management bubble,  people gravitate to being on their side, you can feel a real hypocrisy atmosphere.

IN CRITEO BE CAREFUL OF WHAT YOU SAY, the walls have ears and to be promoted, apparently is good to be a wall ;)

So there is a problem with a company that run a french management covered by an American management expectation."

438,Criteo,Not a good place at any point in your career,2018-12-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Boy oh boy, have I been waiting to write this review. I have been at Criteo for a sufficient amount of time to see the company go from a small BCN office where everyone was each others friend to the giant mess it became today. Only now I realise how many snakes there were (and still are) in the management, how necessary a French passport is to be promoted and how little I should have expected from this company at all.
Let me kick this off with a few positive points:
- You get well paid. Barcelona is a relatively cheap city (though getting more expensive), which Criteo knows very well. They pay you well so you don't complain, sit quiet and do your job without providing any sort of criticism.  Be careful - if you get relocated as a new employee and get fired within the first 6 months you have to pay back the relocation bonus. Happened to many times.
- Office is amazing. Great views, you get free breakfast (as you do in all Criteo offices), there is ticket restaurant (free lunch), by the beach.
- Some employees you can actually learn a lot from and become friends with. Enjoy while they're there - high probability that they will be leaving soon!","After working for a long time for a company you would expect to be the go to point in case of issues, be acknowledged and be promoted. Not at Criteo Barcelona, here you simply get ignored, nobody cares about your opinion if you are not in a management position (where you only get to if you are French of have French friends). If you intend to get promoted expect to be spending your after works at Barnabier on the ""management table"", the one where all the managers gather and only people who want to be promoted try to glue themselves on. If you  try to get promoted like in any normal company (working hard and being there for your colleagues), you get forgotten - they will do their best to make you get pissed off so that you leave yourself and they don't have to pay the golden handshake fee. 
To the juniors out there - stay home in your cold countries, do not be deceived by Criteo HR promising your amazing views and spamming their Linkedin profiles with it. It's all a nice cover for the mess that's actually happening inside and you will find out very soon after joining."
439,Criteo,Keep quiet and get your salary,2018-12-03,2.0,Barcelona,"Good salary and benefits

If you don't have to be treated fairly and just get your paycheck, it might be the company for you.","-management is lacking professionalism in basic skills (although I do not blame them, as they never needed them)
- code of conduct does not exist in some teams
- team leads are given responsibilities but cannot make any decisions and yet still behave as managers and remind you about hierchy 
- no career path and no clear goals in most of the teams
- senior employees are leaving or are unmotivated to help other team members and care only about their jobs and targets
- lack of confidentiality in HR team, they are just gathering information for the managers (none of the meetings are confidential, if you are working in Criteo now, please remember this)
- lack of cooperation between teams
- employees are treated like children instead of professional advice and support
- feedback is not welcomed, specially if given to French employees and ignored in many cases
- employees who are the manager's friends are receiving special treatments everyday and nobody is reacting, because it is a closed circle of self-supporting and covering tracks (very visible recently - did you think we don't notice?)
- junior profiles are hired because it is cheaper and easier to control, people come to have fun in Barcelona and do not complain, after a while they leave
- specific people only are ""asked"" by the managers to add a positive review of the company (October)


Criteo is creating an illusion and a bigger lie every month. All employees are playing along and clapping as we all want to keep our jobs. Things are getting worse with each quarter, targets are unrealistic and there is no support from management.
People skills are missed, because what is important is ""projects"".

People are fired as if they did not mean anything. Meanwhile some managers can spend budgets on their friends and their needs or take sick days whenever they want without documentation."

Still a good mix of startup spirit and big company: 'No fear' approach on the one hand and all needed resources to try on the other (talents, infrastructure). If a project failed/late/killed - happens, keep moving (no blame/punishment).

Proactivity is encouraged and expected: no matter how junior you are, new ideas are welcomed (of course there is a challenge to get them planned). I.e. there is a Hackathon every year which gives the winners an opportunity to work on their projects.

Internal mobility: managers try to take into account engineers preferences and help to change the scope if a guy doesn't want to work on the topiс anymore (unfortunately not always possible, but the effort is away bigger than in my previous companies). Also, there is a cross-offices Voyager program: any engineer can join another R&D team for a few weeks to learn new stuff. 

Diverse environment: >10 nationalities for appx 100 people in the office. 
Work-life balance: no work during the weekends or late in the evening, flexible working hours (people can shift a bit their schedule when needed, can WFH occasionally; no official WFH policy though).

Reasonable management: most managers have regular 1-1s with their direct reports + occasional ones with the rest (i.e. anybody can request a 1-1 with any Director or VP); top management is open for discussions on any topic (even negative anonymous reviews are being discussed in a positive manner: 'lets brainstorm together what we can do better')","Working with HQ in Paris is challenging due to 9 hours difference + lots of technical dependencies (management tries to mitigate it by having isolated projects when possible, but it's still hard).
Less variety of projects than in Paris (natural for any non-HQ office and difficult to change).

*POLITICS vs. CAPABILITIES - the better you're at politics, the higher you will get. Do not challenge the wrong person, or you will be left out. 

*RECRUITMENT is a SALES DEPARTMENT - 100000 of promises to attract people from many countries, cash in hand to make it more attractive to end up getting dismissed most of them for not selling. They don't care if you've just relocated from another country, or you're sick, they care if you sell, and this is why the recruitment team doesn't evaluate if you're suitable for the role, they sell you the role so that you can come and make sure they get their bonus. 

*PEOPLE MANAGEMENT? - WHATS IS THAT? - Top Management Team build all by promotions of (again) french nationalities, with very poor skills. They want to become Managers so that they stop having targets that put you on an Improvement Plan almost every 2 Quarters. The Middle Management Team is more human, but unfortunately, the culture and the Top Management won't support them. 

*DISMISSALS EVERY DAY - I've seen more dismissals in 1 year than anywhere else in my whole working experience (more than 10 years on the same sector). Specially if you join as Sales Manager, other positions are more lucky on that. Very high attrition.

Office view","Criteo is being sold by its recruiters as a great opportunity to progress your career and work in a an interesting, stimulating environment that will enable you to learn a lot. This is why having a couple of years of professional experience I decided to take on another challenge there.  

Unfortunately the story sold is not the reality.

Major part of the company middle management comes from internal promotion and for a big part of them, Criteo was one of the first jobs in their career. Because of that, they often lack the skills, experience and empathy needed to manage their team in an efficient way.

The upper management on the other hand does not understand the differences between markets and is absolutely not willing to listen. Constructive, honest and open feedback is not well perceived in the company, and instead it is expected of the employees to pretend that they are happy with the terrible decisions made.

Most importantly, the product sold lacks innovation and a competitive edge, and there is no vision of improving that in the company. That is clearly reflected in the stock price, which lost almost half of its value in the last 12 months.

All the factors added added up result in massive attrition rate and frustration among the employees.

It is even more disappointing when you know that Criteo is doing a great job finding and attracting smart, talented, fun people, many of which become great friends with their colleagues. It is sad to see these great people get frustrated, overworked and disappointed as a matter of weeks."
467,Criteo,Poor Management!,2018-08-05,2.0,Account Manager,"Similar to many European companies, there are many good perks such as 5 weeks of annual leave, good insurance, free snacks...etc. Employees are generally smart.","Poor management team who rarely listens to their employees.

That makes team's topics more and more specific: it is a good way to become an expert but can become boring when you expect to discover many different things.

Management needs to improve. It is mainly engineers that got ""promoted"" without any management or leadership background. The trainings are quite poor (a few days without follow up). It leads to some violent management situations, sometimes with moral harassment.

Information is very often on a ""need to know"" basis. If you know the right people (and if they like you), you have the information. If not, you may miss it (and it may impact your work).

- lack of transparency (promotion rules, strategy)
- recruitment process (you won't get what you've been promised. HR representatives sell the company simply giving the lies, like for example that no one had been fired because of not meeting the target)

- the company leaves a lot of independence to people to be responsible of their own career and projects out of their own scope
- people are so much fun and inclusive

- top level training programs are being delivered, which gives everyone the opportunity to step up and develop knowledge and soft skills they can carry their whole career
- you are looking at a top class company in terms of intellectual level, technology orientation and growth !","If you look for a company where you just have to come, sit and do your job, you are definitely not looking at the right company ;)

Hiring more junior roles (great level of energy and fun) can hold some downsides during the transition :
- at times you can find some immature attitudes towards organisational decisions that could be tackled with more time spent taking the time to explain more in depth the bigger picture (recent initiatives are going in the very right direction)
- the lack of people's experience in previous companies leave junior profiles without anything to compare Criteo with, which can sometimes generate impatience in what ""fast"" really means in terms of promotion cycle.

- stress management is still a topic being worked on as I am very confident it will keep helping more our most junior profiles balance their high implication at work through more psychological height and distance"

Teams work in silo and armwrestling constantly with each other.

Unexperienced direct management, very operational, not people-oriented, not motivational nor aspirational.

Lack of vision, direction and purpose enablement.

Long hours, top down approach, ticketing system, very much a high-volume customer service kind of job, no corporate mobile phone nor monthly telecom subscription included, no reimbursement of broadband at home. 

No consulting missions, nearly no client-facing time, very limited knowledge of client overall objectives or KPIs by salesreps. Very much a one-size fits all approach to everything.

Glitchy HR process with too many steps, tests not reflecting the actual job, which mean they lose a lot of excellent candidates along the process.

High attrition rates, focus on hiring junior workforce across the organisation.

In need of some topping up of employees yearly stock plans due to huge drop in stock value, which is also impacting yearly events."
493,Criteo,My honest review : SOS Call to the top Management,2018-03-29,1.0,Sales Manager,"- Excellent at recruiting your colleagues, we all go well together and that is very pleasant

- You will learn a lot on ""Do it yourself""

- You will know what you don't want in your next job

- The view ( yes, their key communication for recruiting)

- The office (Google like with a good atmosphere)","Disclaimer : I'm not happy to write this review because I know the potential of this company but it has to be done so maybe Top management will start taking actions against what's ruining this company.

The sentence ""You're not leaving the company, you're leaving your manager"" has never been so true than with Criteo.

Low level managers in general in Barcelona are very unqualified (No experience, no training except internal, they are lost at managing people)

- Lifetime in Criteo is basically very short, so it is good as a first job but not if you plan to stay. Indeed, many people leaving the company, by themselves or not  (10 people left in 8 months in my team of ..... 12 people).

- Company really into numbers and not into humans even though all the fancies playstation and stuffs.

- Very hierarchical, you can't exchange with someone without being pushed out if you're not at the same level 

- MicroManagement all day long, like you're back to highschool and your teamleaders/managers are just school teachers, despite being your age. 

You're not being listened to and if the figures are good, why do you complain ? 

- No yearly raised, so be sure to negotiate your salary

- No real carrer path even though there is one. You have to know that even though before you could go from Sales Manager to TeamLeader in 12 months and without specific requirements, it takes now up to 3 years !
- Sales Manager Junior (8 to 12 months) -> Sales Manager Intermediate (same job with higher target and a small raise) (8 to 12 months) -> Teamleader or Sales Senior.  In average : 1 to 2 person is getting promoted among a team of 15, 2 times a year.

Criteo has the potential to be a really strong company because the values its build on are good, but unfortunately  atmosphere is getting completely destroyed by low level managers and teamleaders."

The engineering culture is largely bottom-up: as individual contributor you can really push ideas or technologies through, you  are encouraged (and reasonably well empowered) to take ownership of anything relevant.

The culture is pretty international and taps into an interesting mix of ""typical"" US and French cultures, especially combining lightweight hierarchy with large autonomy in our missions.","Criteo is a bit ""in-between"" and this fuzzyness can be unsettling: not yet a giant of tech but not a startup any longer ; you are encouraged to challenges the rules but within established processes ; you are empowered also mean you can not expect precise scopes and objectives in some respect.

They like initiative and encourage engineers to think about big picture and come up with what to do.

And the last point is cool cultural mix. The company was born in France but french are minority  in this office so don't be afraid of being overwhelmed. 

As for work and life balance. I keep hearing that so much from my friends working in Sillicon Valley. I think Criteo is unique in SV.

Lots of smart and talented people. Some of them are super nice too. :)
Top notch pay and benefits (has to be deserved, obviously).
Flat structure. This implies that employees are treated as adults and expected to behave like adults.
Open and honest communication from the top (very little BS or propaganda)
Truly diverse with all ages, origins, accents, genders, and orientations treated with respect. Everybody is encouraged to be themselves and treat each other with respect.
Voyager program designed for those who want to work for a month in other parts of the world. (The travel policy though is not very friendly to those with families and kids.)
After you have earned some karma, you'll have freedom to do what you think is important (which sometimes can run into some political barriers)
It is a midsize company which means that there are enough resources to support you and that you can still have a meaningful impact on company's bottom line
A lot of focus on hiring the right people. I think it is super important.
Lots of challenges and opportunities","A bit slow to deal with people who don't fit well. (though there is a delicate balance)
""One size fits all"" travel policy is too restrictive for employees with families.
ESPP is missing to make the perks package complete

Criteo is an industry leader and it shows. The company does well every year and you can feel the market power in every position in the company. It makes you feel proud and invested in work to know you're on the cutting edge and setting the industry standard.
Criteo really feels like a family. People are invested in you beyond immediate work responsibilities. Easy to get along with co-workers through the many social events and opportunities to interact. The atmosphere makes coming to work everyday a pleasure.","-Confusing career progression outside of R&D

Criteo highly prioritizes R&D and it shows. R&D has very straight forward career any salary progression. As R&D is the life blood of innovation, it makes sense. However, most other positions are left on the outside looking in, and faced with a confusing/muddy view of how they can progress in there career. Furthermore, internal promotion into senior management positions almost never happens. With little to know career paths planned out, and external hiring, it can feel like you are spinning your wheels. After a certain number of raises, it can quickly feel like you've reached your cap and you'll need to go elsewhere to get a high salary/responsibility level. However, even if that is the route you go, Criteo is still a great stop on your career progression and to have on your resume."

1. Promotions have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with skills or expertise. You can be the best performer in your team, popular among your team members and clients, extremely motivated - all doesn’t matter. If the manager doesn’t want to promote you then it’s not going to happen. If they see you as a threat then you’re out. Rules for promotions formally exist but can be bent according to the manager’s wishes.
2. Nationalism - There is one nationality which is preferred. Period. This is not limited to any specific department but a company-wide phenomenon and is well-known. This leads to extreme frustration and low morals among staff members. 
3. Managers are not held responsible for the performance of their team/market. This is probably the worst. I have seen managers repeatedly not hitting their targets. It was perfectly acceptable to having multiple team members being fired in the course of only one quarter instead of asking whether the manager was suitable for the job."

They also show respect and importance to offices in all regions. In the Palo Alto office, people work hard but are genuinely nice and helpful. You cohort with people cross-department. There is good food and a clean sink in the kitchen. People eat lunch together. Poker night, and of course in start-up culture fashion, there can be some alcohol in the fridge. That one fact is proof that adults are treated as adults. The location in Palo Alto is perfect (way better than the SF location). In Palo Alto, there is decent parking, te ability to get a parking permit for a garages and great places to eat at the end of the block.","Random shake-ups in management. In hindsight more visibility into why the changes happen - not just standard back-story during the announcement itself, would be helpful.

682,Criteo,Sales Manager,2016-10-21,5.0,Sales Manager,"6 month in, and I think it's time to make a review of Criteo. 

Criteo is overall a very good company. I work as a Sales Manager, in our wonderful Barcelona office. Probably the most amazing view from any office I've ever seen (and I've seen a few). 

What I really enjoy about Criteo is how well the product actually works. As a Sales Manager, this makes my day-to-day life soo much easier and helps me perform. In previous jobs, it was much more about selling the vision, while here with our super transparent setup, you can't really go wrong.  

In previous jobs, there has always been some distance between senior manage and the people below. This is definitely not the case here. Super friendly people, who have mostly all started their careers in Criteo, which says a bit about the career opportunities in this company.
 
Besides very friendly people, from all over the world, they company really tries to be creative in their social approach. We're not just talking summer and Christmas parties. Almost every week, there is a social event; that being team activities on the beach, cinema evenings or renting a boat and sail on the ocean.  

As mentioned previous, the Criteo product is really standing out within re-marketing, which makes it a joy to sell. But Criteo is opening up to new trends and products, that will for sure have an impact in the advertising space for the future. 

They really make sure to hire quality people, which makes the company really stand out, compared to my previous experiences. It's all about the people, and I think they got this right. 

The company is growing A LOT, which makes sense, as the product work. I had more inbound my first 14 days, that I had for a whole year in my previous role.     

So top remarks 6 months in. Hopefully this will only get better.","Obviously no company is picture perfect, but I do think Criteo is doing something right."

The yearly summit where everyone from around the world gather in France (HQ) is a unique part of Criteo's culture and a great prop/motivation for employees. It's 2~3 days of drinking and partying (but no food, nothing informative from the C-level, JUST parties).","Too many young and unseasoned people who aren't quite ready to ""be empowered""- there's a great lack of responsibility and ownership.

700,Criteo,"Nice people but bad organization, centralized management",2016-05-11,3.0,N/A,Very good work & life balance. Global environment and diversity. Highly independent work style but on the other hand you don't know what some people are doing here.,Lack of transparency and career development. The best place for people who only wants to have a stable job but not for those ambitious ones. Politics happened everywhere and extremely centralize management.  French nationality or French speakers domain.
701,Criteo,Amazing place to work. Only the Sales Managers shouldn´t get too attached,2016-05-08,3.0,Sales Manager,"Lots pros. 
In Barcelona one of the best paying companies. Beautiful office with the best view of the city (Located in city center at the beach, 25th floor 360º view of all of Barcelona. Cant get better than that). 
International team to work with. Exposure to a lot of aspects of the industry.  Strong and continuously growing product.  Fantastic company parties. Good private insurance included in package. Breakfast included. Playstation, Ping pong table and foolsball table in office when you need a break. 
My recruitment process went very well as well. Smooth, clear, organized. 
Very good relocation package included. Senior management tries to be as transparent and social as possible. Tim Frankcom (Executive Vice president mid market) is one of the most exciting, motivating, intelligent, energized people you´ll ever meet.","In Barcelona at least, they seem to discriminate against age. Only hiring juniors, preferably fresh out of school. Preferably under 35.

The below feedback applies only to sales manager position. 
If you are hired as a SM, don´t get attached to your job. Chances are you wont make it to 2 years even if you are good at what you do.
Criteo Barcelona often hires people that dont have strong experience in cold calling, telesales and even often digital marketing. Instead they like to look further into other skills that could contribute like experience in other fields, a strong network etc. I think thats great and smart. 
Unfortunately they fail to provide you with proper training and you're left learning from people that started just weeks or months before you. Cold calling (for example) becomes a fearful experience without proper knowledge of the product and no proper training in cold calling. 
So point 1 - lack of training. 
The above can be fixed though if you train yourself as much as possible and when I left, management had started preparations to offer more training. It wasnt even close to what it should be though. But on their way.

Point 2  
Sales Managers get a fixed contract with a 6 month probation period. First quarter you get a low target to hit as you're still learning. Fair and great. 
Second quarter your target increases up to 8 times higher though. Management assumes you are fully ramped up even though they dont necessarily offer proper support. 
I have seen several people leave because they didnt hit that 2nd target because of this. 
Advice> If you are hired as a SM, be sure to train yourself as much as possible within the first 3 months or youre out. To hit your target in your 2nd quarter, you need to start selling and launching in the 1st quarter (even though your still not properly trained in that 1st quarter) 

Con 3. If/When you make it passed your probation, dont get comfortable. Demands and pressure is high at Criteo. If you dont hit your target in a quarter, you are put on a plan in the next. If you dont hit the demands in that next quarter, you're out. Regardless of how well you did in the past or how long youve been there. Stability is in-existent 
The turn around on sales managers is extremely high obviously. 

This all being said. I do believe that this is normal fora sales job in the corporate world. You are hired to sell. If you dont sell as much as your company wants you to sell, what are you doing there. Fair enough. 
Just be prepared for it. You are not a valued person that Criteo will believe in. Everything is based on the numbers, not on your potential. You are there to be a sales machine or youre out. 
If you are looking for a long term career, look into changing to account strategist or any other position within the company once youre there.  They are very open to that. Lots of career opportunities."
702,Criteo,Best learning experience ever,2016-04-27,5.0,Anonymous,"- very challenging environment

- you learn a lot in a very short amount of time
- great people mentality
- incredible career opportunities
- right mix between tough enough to make you grow out of your comfort zone and human to support you when in need
- competitive compensation
- international vibe
- Management let you be yourself and in charge

Pros if you're ambitious, hard worker and like to be challenged.","- high amount of work can affect hours & stress (adapted to ""work priority"" period of life/people)
- be prepared to either make it or risk your job (you need to embrace challenge to be happy)
- a lot of basic structural improvements in process (leaves room to handle projects/have an impact)

People that during your job interview say something and after when you start do and say exactly the opposite, just be truth will help you to really grow otherwise you will not go so far away.
The product is good and it works well, but not possible that it takes so long to set up it, specially because it depends from the client and not by you, but in the meantime despite that your target keep running and the company doesn't really think about it, they just put pressure on you that you have a target to respect and if you don't do that you are out.
Company generally disorganized at least in Barcelona, there is no a proper training, thing really important, specially in Sales, because you cannot start to call prospects immediately, at your third day,without being trained properly, before you should know well the product and your competitors on the market, we shouldn't be a call center but inside sales.
This is not the right position if you like 9-17/18 working hours. people leave also around 8, working/life balance there isn't."
722,Criteo,Frustrated Sales Manager,2016-03-01,1.0,Sales Manager,People are great to work with and that's it,"No leadership at all whatsoever, no direction or advice from superiors. Product works well but is very difficult to sell due to the fact that it can take up to a month (an longer) to integrate tags and working procedures. Very high pressure so if Sales goals are not met then you are out. No matter how good you are at selling your job depends entirely on how fast the client can setup procedures on their end and not yourself. As it is a very detailed system for re-targeting it is sometimes very complex to setup on the clients end, competitors such has Adroll have a huge advantage here. After getting the client to sign an IO it is still a long road to actually get them to start generating revenue and counting towards your sales target. This again means that you have no control on your sales targets. For example you could sign a client in Q1 and they might not even be up and running and generating gross until way into the next Q sometimes longer. 

Looks like a great job on the package and how the office looks with the pool tables, PS4s, Nespresso coffee machines and medical card benefits. However none of this bright packing can take anything away from the fact that deep down everyone who works there is feeling the huge amount of pressure due to the do or die approach of management and the immense pressure they  pour on you.

My advice to anyone who is starting there would be to think of your targets in 2 or 3 sales quarters in advance that is the only way you will succeed."

753,Criteo,Most ungrateful company I've ever worked for,2015-09-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fantastic technology and constant innovation which helps the company to deliver phenomenal growth year on year.
Smart colleagues and smart senior leadership.
Once a year a Global company event in France where all the company's employees meet and have fun - very few companies can afford it.","Company is obsessed with making money but forgot that it's not the algorithm that brings the money but the people who work for the company, whether its developers, sales, account strategists or marketing. Salaries are below market just because many want to work in the company. Because of the low salaries the retention rate is low.

Poor middle-management - you can be the best employee consistently but the moment you make one small mistake, you are crucified by the managers. Positive feedbacks from managers are non-existent and there is a culture of bullying and intimidation which originates in the fact that many of the managers have no management experience or skills. Any constructive feedbacks and ideas that employees try to give are immediately interpreted as: 1. a challenge on manager's authority or as: 2. criticism of company.

Promotions: internal promotions can be great only when the right candidates are chosen. Too often, someone gets promoted just because he has been certain time at the company although it's clear that person isn't suitable for managerial position (company compromises on quality of management because of its rapid growth) or sometimes there is no structural need for additional managerial role. You can be the best employee in your team but if your manager don't like you personally, you can forget about promotion.

There are rules in terms of internal mobility however they are not applied consistently (if senior management likes you, these rules will be bent).

Workload: Sales managers have to be involved from signing an advertiser through integration process and launch (they spend more time on non-sales activities). Account strategists have a huge portfolio of accounts which they can't manage so they tend to really focus on bigger accounts and ignore the rest. Technical engineers have too many integrations to look after and have the worst work-life balance in the company.

Micro-management: there is clearly no trust between managers and teams, as the amount of reporting you need to do is ridiculous and is done over multiple systems which creates confusion and duplicity. Too much red tape and too much time is spent on meetings and trainings (on a regular week you will waste 8 hours on such meetings)."

-Thought Leader: Everyone that I have met is very passionate about the company and the products. Criteo is not just another retargeter, there is a lot of data and science behind what we do. R&D investment is very important and Criteo is constantly looking at ways to refine, build and grow.
-Culture: Criteo has really invested in office managers to ensure they bring the Criteo culture to every office. The annual summit in Paris is amazing. It makes you feel like you are part of something BIG.","-Processes and Tools: Criteo has been a bit behind on providing employees with efficient tools to help them streamline processes. This has definitely improved since I joined and I can see it is headed in the right direction. 
Training: Again this is getting better, however training has definitely been a challenge for newer teams. Training should not only span the engine and products, but also job roles (AS, TS, BI).
Collaboration and Communication: depends on the team/business line. For newer teams, there has been more disconnect. There needs to be a bigger push to integrate all teams and knowledge share across teams."

We are working on cool and proven technologies, and dealing with highly scalable applications, in real time, on Hadoop.
The management is recognizing the work of each individual and is striving to have their employees grow and evolve where they want to.
There is an excellent team spirit within the company where all employees are very helpful and providing the right support, both inside or outside the direct team.","At times, we have to raise our voice to make some technical decisions and make sure we are moving as fast as we would like.

- Culture: I've encountered very few people that aren't good natured, always happy to help, have a team-work and can-do attitude, and always wanting to praise one another
- Perks: They ain't cheap! - a plethora of free snacks stocked weekly, monthly lunch and happy hour (+more depending on your team), volunteer activities that always in happy hour, arcade room, etc. Oh, and you get to visit Paris to meet the global team once a year
- Benefits: Great benefits, health care, match 401k, and reimbursement for your cell phone and commute
- Office: Getting very cramped but we are moving to a bigger place soon - and that was after extensive input from all employees, they truly value your opinion
- Other: Very little negativity all around, very transparent about the business in every way including earnings","- Depending on your team, you may not get the cushier perks that other teams do, but again dependent on your manager

Compensation is great.

Everyone is so willing to help each other out, but no one ever tries to micro-manage you. It's an international company, which is really cool, and it has a ton of room for global mobility. I'm in sales and I feel like the product I'm selling is honest and it really does help people make money, as well as spend their dollars more intelligently. Lastly, you just gotta respect a company that doesn't pinch pennies when it comes to talented people.

There are well defined career paths for every position and the potential to be promoted quickly along the path is good. Most importantly Criteo doesn't just respect and appreciate it's employees, it loves them. The perks and benefits the company offers are huge and really unheard of for most of Boston (free snacks, generous time off policy, 401K match, 100% paid medical/dental/vision, yearly company trip to Paris, jeans-tshirt environment, company swag, great compensation and potential to exceed goals for larger bonus, fairly flexible work hours, reimbursement for transit/cellphone, etc). Every person in the office is specifically selected for their skills and drive along with overall personality to make for a wonderful office culture where everyone meshes well and actually cares about their fellow employees.

- Great career opportunities within the company: employees who have been with the company for 1 year are eligible to apply to any Criteo position regardless of location (as long as their experience matches the qualifications/requirements of the position). 

- Internal company career map is very transparent and allows you to see what opportunities are down the road within each department, along with the requirements and qualifications needed  for a promotion/job change.","- Company headquarters (Central organization) is based in Paris, France which sometimes results in delays when requesting approvals/support/tasks.

~Amazing, helpful, laid back personalities of fellow employees and management
~Frequent happy hours and social events
~Casual yet professional dress code
~Yearly trip to Paris for a company summit
Criteo is an amazing company to work for, some tweaks need to be worked out, but I can honestly say I enjoy coming to work every day.  Everyone here works hard and it shows.  Having that kind of environment pushes everyone else to go above and beyond.","The technology is not up-to-par.  I don’t have the authority to do a lot of the things I should without going around the red tape.  

Since this is a French based company, working with the time difference is difficult, it’s hard to get things done.  
I feel like the offices outside of Paris are just following along in their footsteps without any control.  Its not fair when we have issues at hand and need an immediate response.  All the decisions come from people who work in a completely different time zone and its impossible to get answers and get your job done. 

We don’t have a dedicated IT person who knows everything with our systems and programs in the office daily to help us with all the different issues/questions we have.  Usually, we wait for Paris for answers, and waiting for Paris is definitely NOT a pleasant experience; especially when they really don’t understand the issue at hand.  

We are a tech company correct??  Well, we definitely need more knowledgeable technical people helping employees out with daily issues in every office."

813,Criteo,Good work experience,2014-03-10,4.0,Technical Solutions Engineer,"-- The technical solutions role is a challenging but engaging position within Criteo.  
-- You'll get to work with every team (at some point) within the organization.  So if you enjoy feeling like you're in the center of everything where things are always changing, you'll like this.
-- I love the people I work with in Boston.  They're nice and fun.. The Boston office is expanding rapidly but we're working hard to keep the ""small community/family"" feel in the office.
-- Opportunities for fun.  Ex: There's a ping pong table; We have occasional outings that's catered by Criteo (breakfasts, lunches, after-work happy hours).  
-- You have ownership over your own work.  This was a big draw for me.. Yes the job still needs to get done but I get to decide what I'm working on, prioritize my workload and organize it in a way that suits me.  
-- You'll learn business, retail, data analysis, debugging JS code, how to talk to clients, how to talk to internal teams, etc.  If you have time, you can work on your own coding projects.
-- Free snacks","-- Rapid growth means that there are some communication challenges within the organization.  It can be difficult at times to communicate local needs/issues to our Paris office and having them understand the urgency at times.
-- I don't think this is a con but you need to be sharp, adaptive and be on your game. Definitely not for everyone but for the right person you will thrive.  You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived.
-- On that note, plan to fight for yourself hard here.

For example mobile is an area that a lot feel is exploding, yet Criteo seemed not to be dedicating lots of efforts in it a few months ago (things might have changed). Another point is that during my period there, a lot of management was hired directly from Yahoo, to leave afterwards, which certainly sent the wrong message to employees."

Good international expansion and momentum as a company.","(SMB Department only)

Management is awful. Low-profile mid-managers, inefficient and heavy processes that leave no room for flexibility, creativity, innovation. ""Go-getter"" attitude and proposing new ideas are seen more as a risk than as the right thing to do: you always have to bear in mind that appearing smarter than your boss will make him/her feel endangered and thus may hinder you from moving forward in your career. Managers rarely congratulate you, and emphasize on criticizing instead. 
There's a relation of fear to your boss and to hierarchy in general at Criteo. Managers are afraid of their manager(s), which makes communication and decision making very centralized in this department.

Things are written in stone like nowhere else. Employees are asked to stick to their prerogative, to do no less, no more than their scope: this is called Fordism. SMB execs always brag about Criteo being a startup, but it couldn't be any further. 

Unfair and unethical decisions: not the best people are promoted. No transparency whatsoever on roadmap or just general department information. You barely know what future is made of (but an educated guess makes you realize that the future is elsewhere). 
 
SMB is just a cash-machine that attracts no attention from Paris HQ at all. You don't feel important to the company. No HR, low salary and inexistant perks, you're just another brick in the wall. 

Most boring office I've seen."
833,Criteo,Expand Your Job Search,2013-02-19,1.0,SMB,"A company with a great reputation, product and growth","Bad Management of staff – Especially in the SMB team

You will be promised progression, and that if you have any ideas on how to improve a growing company to please bring suggestions to your weekly 1-2-1 meeting / interrogation. 
The reality is that you will be stuck in whatever role they give you. Some roles even within the same team will favour some and hugely disadvantage others. 

While the staff that are being recruited are mostly great and intelligent people, the atmosphere that is created by the managers and middle managers, creates fear among staff and even backstabbing and misdirection by the more senior staff  in order to make sure that they stay ahead of new starters.

Making any suggestions of improvement and equality are taken as a challenge to set systems and structures already in place that are obviously in need of changing as the company and teams grow.

Main topics of discussions ‘at the watercooler’ are mainly about how unhappy people are and when they will be leaving.
I feel so sorry for those that have battled against all of this in hope of an internal promotion, only to find that they will recruit someone external (Usually form Yahoo) to come in and cause more disruption and create more systems that that will obviously fail.

The best part is, that when all of these doomed systems fail, they use a member of their staff / teams as scapegoat to cover up their own shortcomings.

The worst experience of my career, and a waste of a year."

They have a competitive advantage in that they have developed best in class technology and continuously improve the product offering in competitive marketplace. For an engineer or a technical role, this is a great company to be a part of.","The (sales) work environment is extremely unpleasant and unproductive. In the US, there is little communication between mid and upper level management, leading to confusion, misinformation and intimidation when numbers are not up to par. As another reviewer mentioned, you are only as good as your last week, and mid level managers have made it clear that anyone can be canned at any moment. 

The potential for this company to foster a great environment is there, but unfortunately inexperienced managers and politics have stifled employees and created a high churn rate. Managers from the UK office are often in the US and implement drastic changes (processes, target clients, number of employees), sending the US team into a nervous frenzy. This type of boiler room, pit everyone against each other mentality is not how Criteo initially positioned itself, but given that your manager has complete control over you, this is unfortunately what it has become."

Alternating every two weeks are 1 of 2 events for staff: beer 'o' clock and sushi/pizza lunches, which is good for morale on those days. The Criteo product actually works, which makes the job a whole lot easier. The company as a whole is going in the right direction, it will continue to grow and will enjoy a successful financial event at some point in the future. It is great feeling to be a part of something so successful!","There is no staff development at all which leaves progression and the prospect for growth perpetually up in the air, there is not much of a meritocracy within the company and praise is not often given. The very, very senior management is impressive, but below your MDs and certain Directors, the management and senior staff are uninspiring, not there by merit but more because of relationship. There is a heavy Yahoo influence and legacy in the company which lends itself to the classic 'Old Boys' issues. There is also a very high churn of staff at Criteo which either shows they hire the wrong people or are not offering the right opportunities. Criteo is no longer a startup, it is a hugely successful growing global technology business, yet there is only IT support one day a week and the Wifi does not work properly in the UK office. The pay and remuneration is not as high as other companies and much lower than competitors. Partly this is due to how successful Criteo is and also partly why Criteo is so profitable."

The company is hiring a lot of middle managers and not promoting from within.

Politics have started to creep in and take a major hold.

Management is very self-centered only caring for their gross margins specifi. Every step taken is very tactical and the human aspect of the job is not even considered. Its all about numbers numbers and again numbers..you are as good as your last week."
