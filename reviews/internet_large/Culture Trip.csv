In a twisted way, the fact the company is so poorly run allowed me to learn an awful lot in a short amount of time but I wouldn't recommend it!","The CEO listed isn't correct, the current CEO has been in post for 4-5 months but was the defacto CEO for some time previously. I bailed on the company after watching the CEO fail again and again to articulate strategy or a path to achieving the company vision; watching operational plans switch repeatedly so work got binned and nothing was really achieved; fail to own her decisions and instead throw other people under the bus; fail to be able to understand simple data but instead latch on to a sarcastic, throwaway comment about how long it would take to reach goals at current trajectory and treat it as a promise of success. Oof. Half the company is being made redundant, I hear the CEO has been wandering the office crying. The board has just reappointed her. It breaks my heart, this should be a wonderful company but leadership is clueless and good people have suffered the consequences."

Working at CT taught me a valuable lesson in that never again will I be overworked and underpaid. They tried superficially with the office culture but lurking underneath was a mental health monster hell bent on swallowing you slowly. No room for career progression or salary increase. The now ex-CEO made really off-colour comments about women once and made us sit through a talk given by a guy who had performed lobotomies on gay people. The then CEO also acted as high lord with his 3 PAs microwaving his lunch when his glass-fronted office was right next to the kitchen.

-A company that has suffered from having too much money, too early with no real guidance from anyone who knew how to spend it sensibly
-Despite an almost complete change in the senior leadership team in 2020, a highly toxic culture still prevails 
-A CEO who has little/no commercial acumen, a lack of knowledge of the industry in which they're operating, an unwillingness to engage with those who do have the skill and the ability to make the company more successful - a dangerous combination
-The focus shifts too much and too often with no rationale to justify it - constantly chasing ridiculous targets and vanity metrics 
-There is no commercial strategy
-I feel sorry for the talented people who are working hard to try and make it work under almost impossible circumstances. I've seen every day how their emotional wellbeing is being systematically destroyed.

Our People team (read HR) have also been amazing this year gone, providing different opportunities for the company members to get together, whether it’s to learn new things or to socialise through bingo and other online virtual events.

I can’t say the last year has been easy, but working for Culture Trip has certainly made it less so.

Our new CEO, from what I can tell, seems very experienced and driven on making revenue for the company which is very welcome.","The only cons I can think of is that we’re still moving too fast after the next shiny thing and not leaving enough time to go back and review how features are performing, this creates a lot of technical and design debt. We’ve gotten much better over the years, but it’s still an issue. 

I’d like to see a proper product feature overview process where the whole team evaluates the feature’s effectiveness in the chosen metrics, and maybe we even kill the feature if we find it’s not working as expected. sometimes we don’t get stat sig results and leave things running longer, which is fine, but then we move on and forget about it."

I could reiterate all the points other reviewers have raised, but as I've been axed in the Great Mass Redundancy of 2020 (which was the third mass redundancy during my time at the company, mind you) it might read as disgruntled former employee grumbling. I will say, read the reviews focusing on CT's financial status and decide whether you want to enter employment in such a precarious situation.

Culture Trip is by far the worst and most toxic company I have ever experienced and worked for. For the sake of your mental health, I would actively discourage anyone from applying. From incredibly offensive, insensitive and tone deaf presentations on International Women’s Day and BLM, to chaotic decision making and a narcissistic CEO - I can’t encourage anyone reading this enough to look elsewhere. 

The company is taking a sharp nosedive into bankruptcy and have made it perfectly clear that they do not value their staff at all. I have never been made to feel more worthless in my 10+ year career. There are countless shocking stories I could reel off, most of which have been covered in the negative reviews below, which I can confirm are entirely accurate. The Wired article outlining workplace bullying is all true too - and it is well-known within the company that ‘good’ reviews on Glassdoor have been planted. 

The future of this company is limited, even with a £100m investment, their chaotic spending has meant that the company still hasn’t made a profit. Culture Trip is a ticking time bomb, don’t put yourself through it."
56,Culture Trip,"No hard feelings, but please steer clear",2020-08-22,1.0,Senior Level Role,"Some of the good bits of a start-up - breadth, adaptability, building things, committed and intelligent people. It served a career purpose for me at a particular point in time, so in that sense I don't regret (most of) my time there.","That time has long passed, and I would have advised anyone against joining CT at any point in the last 1-2 years, and even more so today. The CT business model of content-driven media and transactional revenue was pretty much dying by the time it secured its first major raise; and it was only ignorance on the part of PPF, an investor with no tech/media/consumer experience, which enabled the raising of so much money. That, coupled with a founder with no experience in any of those sectors either, meant that the writing was always on the wall. Kris's approach to building CT was fundamentally flawed, in that he was building a business which he thought the world should need/want, rather than one which it actually did (despite often vehement and well-informed advice to the contrary by those he hired with the relevant experience):
- Want to build a travel business from scratch with no brand loyalty and no proven user intent? Why let a major OTA do it for you for free, when you can invest millions in a bespoke tech platform and sub-scale supply, commercial, operations, legal and finance infrastructure;
- Want to grow traffic sustainably and efficiently? Why not spend millions more p***ing it into the wind on digital adverts.

Some stats then:
- average tenure of CFOs: 5 months
- average tenure of CHROs: 5 months
- average tenure of all C-level departures in the last year: 9 months
- number of people on exec team at peak (for a company with <£1m in revenue per last published accounts): 11

So what now? Despite the $100m+ of funding received (implying a peak valuation of a multiple of that). Culture Trip today is likely worth not very much at all. With revenue that was meagre before Covid, and now must be almost non-existent; 100's of employees still listed; and no significant assets (barring several thousand pieces of cheap written content, and some videos), it could actually be worth less than nothing. Whilst Covid has undoubtedly accelerated the downfall, it will be the final nail in the coffin rather than the driving force. Don’t believe anyone who tells you otherwise. With probably no income, and the only source of funding being handouts from PPF, Kris will sooner or later lose control of the business and have to go. He will blame Covid, and that won’t be the whole truth. 

If you joined at any point in 2020, don’t say you weren’t warned. Mine is only the last in a long line of red flags on GD. If you’re still thinking of joining now, please don’t.

(For the avoidance of doubt all information stated or conclusions drawn are based entirely on publicly available information obtained from company filings, LI profiles, and press releases.)"
57,Culture Trip,Run for the Hills,2020-07-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Some very good people and a great office location,"If you've come this far then you're considering a position with Culture Trip so I would like to give you some balanced insight into the company so you can make an informed decision. You will have no doubt already read articles in Wired, Skift, Sunday Times and business insider.

These articles along other reviews you read on Glassdoor (Not the fake ones that have been posted and plastered at the top by the complicit HR, Kteam and other employees bullied into posting ) barely scratch the surface of what is by for the most dysfunctional, delusional (CEO) and Toxic organisation I have ever encountered in my career. Some of the behaviours I saw and experienced were truly an out of body experience, I could not believe that any company would operate in such a self destructing and negligent manner.

Culture Trip is not going bust because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is in trouble because of toxic leadership, poor decision making, erratic changes in company direction and gross financial negligence on a catastrophic basis. This business has failed to identify any sustainable avenues for creating or generating revenue in 9 years since its formation and to put icing on this cake, it has now squandered 100M of hedge fund funding in careless and wasteful pursuits, many of which you have read in previous posts and articles so I won't go over them again.

Crisis talks had already begun in late January after the Culture Trip Leadership team spent the majority of the last few months in the US desperately trying to secure more funding, They had returned to tell the whole company that while ""Many people have heard of Culture Trip in the US, No one wants to invest further because it has almost no revenue and no path towards generating sustainable revenue. In addition, WeWork have ruined the smokes and mirriors for anyone who wants to get funding, investors are now doing more due dilligence on the state of company numbers so given that we don't make any money we can't get funded right now"" Lightbulb moment for the clueless Leadership team. It's time to work out a way to start making revenue (9 years too late), but big problem, you have blown most of your 100m funding and will need to start making mass redundancies because you can't afford to keep these people on the books much longer let alone keep the lights on in Mayfair. So what's the plan, work the company tirelessly towards a pointless deadline to launch experiences that was going to save the company from extinction, really get the last bit of blood from those stones then turf them out into the COVID wilderness... really classy move from the Leadership team. Like everything else this company does, The OTA, experiences etc, nobody one was booking. It was another half baked attempt at something new for a company that has spent 9 years failing while generously backed back an unsuspecting Czech hedge fund who had begun to see the light and starting to write off their investment. How was CT going to rescue this impending disaster? Current investors won't give you more money to waste and new investors won't touch the company.  Culture trip became desperate, it was evident by the erratic emails/messages being sent to employes at crazy hours of night and weekends from the hapless leadership. This desperate period was surely coming to a head and Culture Trip was nearing the point of coming clean about the failures of the leadership team. Then a miracle happened, and the leadership had their prayers answered, the world was entering into a global pandemic. Culture trip could get rid of most of the company, take advantage of government help and not lose face for lack of business acumen by blaming the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope that those reading the countless articles and these Glassdoor reviews can see that the writing was on the wall long before COVID-19 was present. It's been a 9 year disaster in the making. Do not be fooled by many of the awards that have been won by the content team who funny enough have all been fired. Look into the numbers and the losses YOY before you consider joining this organisation. Think about your role and if you want to keep your integrity as an individual. Think about if you believe this company will survive in a space where there is huge competition from major players who do have strong leadership and a successful business model in place.

Culture Trip Leadership are obsessed with awards, accolades and the CEO's personal image, so much so that he has multiple people in the organisation dedicated to 'CEOs propaganda in the the public and media'. Many of which have been fired over the years for being unable to contain stories about Leadership behaviour or conduct away from the media/press.  The CEO feels he has been deamonised by the press but fails to recognise that their sources come from the individuals that have had the displeasure of working directly with him. It sounds too crazy to believe but that is the world of Culture Trip, It's a whirlpool of smokes, mirrors and sustained failures. The HR team hide engagement survey results from employees because the Leadership does not want to the organisation to know that no one has confidence in its leadership or the company future. They also realise that Culture Trip has one of the worse Glassdoor ratings you can imagine and CEO's approval rating is the lowest on Glassdoor at just over 15%(All fake approvals) . The Company is clearly embarassed about this but is unable to turn the tide becuse that would mean a monumental shift in behaviour and a basic respect for individuals in the company. Culture Trip's tactic to combat this has been to coerce employes who feel obligated to write overly positive reviews like the CFO and CPO after just a few days in the company (Both have now left in suspicious circumstances, haha). Refusal to do so puts you in an extremely awkward position with the leadership team. You are labeled as an outsider who won't drink the kool-aid. It seems counterproductive to just fixing the problems in this organisation but they only care about the appearence. Similar to fake initiatives around mental health and well being.

Culture trip has played its own version of Brewster's Millions and Like Monty Brewster has been successful in recklessly squandering 100m, The problem in this story is that there is no pot of GOLD at the end of this story and no future funding for this organisation. I imagine when the company is audited that Culture Trip will be hard pressed to explain where the 100M has gone without any form of product to show. The similarities between Culture Trip and other failed start ups like Wonga, Juicero and WeWork are indistuinguishable. Like WeWork, once the bones are picked out of the finances of this one and the dust settled from the ashes, I suspect that like WeWork, some individuals will ride off into the sunset with a handsome fortune but it won't be from making this company a success. The HR function which was mentioned and celebrated in the press has already been dismantled with the female leaders they touted around having left the business after 5 months and 7 months respectively. The writing is on the wall. Culture Trip is a dead duck."

Dogs in the office!
Talented peers","Culture Trip has followed the trajectory of the Titanic quite closely, and is currently at the bit when the ship is belly up in the Atlantic Ocean. They've just made almost the entirety of their award-winning content team redundant. Not because they wanted to, but because the morally bankrupt C-suite manages funds the way your loser friend with a rich dad would. Stupidly, and with no regard for it cause they didn't earn it. 

They claim to value 'mental health', but treated a colleague who was going through mental health issues abysmally. They claim to value 'women', but make it a point to loudly pat themselves on the back on LinkedIn for having 'female leaders' (they're just called leaders guys). They say they value 'multiculturalism' but the remaining skeleton of the editorial team all look like clones. They say they value 'inclusivity', but are now publishing articles with classy titles like ""The First Woman Of Colour To Visit Every Country"". They say they 'embrace the world' but have stayed deathly silent on the current political situation in Hong Kong, due to a vested interest in China, where they have been reallllyy thirsty for an audience. 

Now with no more money, CT is planning on using and abusing young freelancers who will be willing to work for free in exchange for a platform, with no one to guide or help them. RIP to the days of great content at Culture Trip, watch that space for absolute drivel, and desperate attempts at making money through bookable experiences (which surprise, surprise, no one is buying). They also genuinely believe they're the first travel content company to have thought of turning into a trip booking platform after being unable to make it as a media company.....who's gonna break it to them?"
63,Culture Trip,The only thing this company is capable of disrupting is itself,2020-06-03,1.0,Personal Banker,"Pre lockdown we were entitled to 1 work from home day a week
Dogs in the office","Where to begin...

CT is currently undergoing a long, painful and poorly managed redundancy process which it claims is due to Coronavirus. While this obviously has had an effect its clear the company has tanking for a while and it would have been in this position in a few months without Covid.

In the more than 2 years I've been at the company I've never seen anything other than abysmal management at the top of the company. It's true the CEO secured a huge amount of investment a couple of years ago, but it's also clear that the C-suite clearly didn't really know what to do with it. 

Instead they waxed lyrical about funnels and how if people are willing to read listicles on the ""10 best things to do in wherever..."" its a no-brainer that they will therefore want to book holidays with CT. Strangely enough when this product offering did eventually emerge, in the most meagre way possible, bookings flat lined from day 1. Not quite the breakthrough category disrupting result they expected. 

Since then there has been a continual procession of half baked strategy changes implemented with little thought, but often sizeable lay off's in staff. Many things didn't change though, for example the hubris with which the C-suite declared that CT was such a unique company providing an offering that other company in the market place was: nobody else combined travel content and the ability to book holidays - presumably they'd never heard of Atlas Obscura or Conde Nast Traveller to name but two - and nobody else provided experiences to do while you were there - Air BnB anyone?

The company has always been so intensely top down that no reality check can ever soil the rarefied upper echelons of the company, or when it did the perpetrators were summarily fired or bullied - the accusations of bullying behaviour by the CEO are well documented in the press.

There were things to celebrate, Culture Trip won lots of awards for its content. However given the top down nature of the company most of the staff lower down the pecking order who often did the lions share of the work were rarely thanked and there is always a manager or director or vice president willing to take all the credit themselves.

In fact the company has a tendency to single out certain individuals and invest heavily in them - there are many people in the CT aristocracy despite being clearly useless - and operate on this method of ""brilliance bias"" rather than recognise the collective work that teams do as a whole.

To try and etch out more of a place in the market Culture Trip tried to style itself as a ""values based company"", the kind of company that would make such brave, fearless statements as ""Brexit kind of sucks"" - as the CEO stated in an internal email - however despite the CEO's declared hatred of ""virtue signalling"", the values CT supposedly stand for don't stand up to the slightest bit of scrutiny: CT launched a major editorial series last year supporting LGBTQ+ Pride - a virtue CT bravely signals with other brave pioneers such as the UK Home Office and Specsavers - however numerous stories were spiked when they related to countries where the LGBTQ+ community is discriminated against by law, or stories based in religiously conservative and oil rich middle eastern nations where the CEO was looking for investment at the time.

For a company so tuned into social and political injustice around the world it has been remarkably silent about the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The indifference towards their plight might have something to do with the fact that CT has been trying - not very successfully - to establish a presence in China for some time now, but maybe I'm being too cynical.

A few other highlights of how hilariously tone deaf CT is include:

- The first internal event celebrating International Women's Day featuring a panel comprised almost entirely of men talking about how important men are in the fight for feminism and how great they all were

- The Chief HR Officer publishing an article covering herself in glory and talking about the importance of sensitive and emotionally intelligent leadership during the pandemic while failing to acknowledge she was leading a redundancy process that was sacking nearly half of the entire company and providing no meaningful leadership or support to anybody a risk of redundancy (the article was later taken down)

- The Chief Data Science Officer talking about how fantastic the new AI software is that CT is planning to use to write articles and stressing that it was there ""to help people, not replace people"", while almost all of the written staff were in the process of being made redundant

The redundancy process is nearly over now and after 2 years and the best part of $80m all that will remain is a fairly uninspiring app, a pretty meagre website with some great content which is almost impossible to find, almost no income and no realistic path to profitability.

For all its high concept talk of being a category disrupter and a potential multi billion pound business, it never even got the basics right.

All the worker ants have been sacked and what's left is a phenomenally top heavy structure, packed with directors and executives. While millions across the UK lose their jobs and their livelihoods CT is left with a C-suite which is almost the size of the rest of the entire company and who having took a minuscule cut to their astronomical and utterly immoral salaries, are unable to do anything meaningful if they tried but instead pose and pontificate on their greatness as the ship of fools sinks even faster and the water begins to cover their feet."
64,Culture Trip,11 Reasons You Shouldn’t Work at CT (from someone who did),2020-06-03,1.0,Content,"You will meet amazing people who are incredibly talented and passionate about what they do. I’ve met some of my best friends here and had a lot of fun. 

Some of my managers have really cared about me, professionally and as a person, and I’ve learnt a lot from individuals in the company. 

There are dogs. 

Once a week they give us snacks to try and fill the gaping void where a company culture should be. 

There’s a fancy Zip Tap so you don’t have to spend too much time queueing in the disgusting, cramped kitchen.","1. Much like badgers, CT employees undergo a traditional yearly cull. Sometimes you come back from the bathroom & an entire team has been given 30 minutes to pack their stuff & leave the building. After one cull remaining staff were taken out for an evening of canapés & drinks at an extremely expensive seafood place to “boost morale”. Spoiler - it did not boost morale. 

2. Office itself is grim. Someone repeatedly put human waste in the tampon bins - not strictly CT’s fault but during the course of the investigation it was revealed that the tampon bins (of which there were 5, in an office of around 200 people) were emptied once a month. Speaking of bathrooms, we never had a disabled one in the Mayfair office that we’ve been in since summer 2018. Inclusive! 

3. I’ve never seen a place pay as much lip service about mental health, yet do so little. Sure, we have an in-house yoga teacher; we also all live in fear of losing our jobs & are barraged by spur-of-the-moment shifts in what our teams (and indeed, the whole business) actually do. Pay was ridiculously low for many editorial staff until very recently.

4. We once had a mandatory, full-company presentation right after lunch on a Monday from a pal of Kris’s who practised experimental brain surgery. In the presentation he showed us (without warning) graphic videos of actual lobotomies, called mentally ill people “diseased” people with “bad behaviour” and discussed at length the use of conversion therapy for gay people. (This presentation features in the Times article about CT.) When I raised how inappropriate this was with HR, I was told (direct quote) “sorry to hear that you found the presentation insensitive and inappropriate... The speaker is a highly respected professional and as far as we are aware his presentations haven't caused upset in the past.” OK then. 

5. Much with mental health, they paid homage to the idea of helping support minorities by starting networks; however, if you tried to do anything that threatened institutional change rather than stick with craft clubs or movie nights, you were quickly slapped down. The networks aren’t there to help make the company a good place for POC, women, LGBTQ people, disabled people, etc; they’re there to make the company look good.

6. I hope the investors know that the 100 million they pumped into CT went to good causes, such as the wildly expensive custom footstool, flying the yoga teacher to New York, the disastrous SXSW event (which featured drag queens, a London bus and bingo) an office directly above Bond Street Station, bloated C-Suite salaries, the CEO’s army of assistants, and an entire China office we started before actually securing the right business license in China. Money well spent. 

7. Kris. Kris pays himself a lot of money. Kris once told us a story about using a Mars Bar wrapper to manipulate people in interviews. Kris once told us he knew the professional struggles of women because he had two exes: “one white, one black”. (Yes, that does refer to their race.) He said this during an international women’s day panel, which was him, 3 other men, & two women who barely got to speak. Kris promoted his pal’s son to chief of staff after he entered in a junior role & had been working there for less than two years. Kris founded Culture Trip in 2011, has had at least 100 million worth of investment, & has never made a profit. 
 
8. We have just gone through a painful round of redundancies with over 100 people put at risk during a pandemic & a HR team that wouldn’t answer any questions. They refused to furlough any staff in the UK apart from the receptionist & the in-house yoga teacher. They finally agreed to give us pay in lieu of notice at the 11th hour (up until that point we  were lead to believe we might have to work 3 months notice) but it’s being paid in instalments because the company apparently doesn’t have enough cash to cover salaries. Great budgeting there. They still haven’t actually provided a payment breakdown to many people (and no one has it on the official letter), days after the redundancies were made. The actual job selection seemed quite dubious and got rid of basically every person in editorial who was not white, straight & cisgender (not that CT had many people who didn’t fit that mould anyway).

9. To add insult to injury, on the last remote meeting the week we were all due to leave, Kris didn’t bother turning his camera on & he didn’t acknowledge that over 100 members of staff would not be there next week. We really meant nothing to that man. 

10. Their values are completely hollow; as people across the world protested police brutality, and every brand put up a statement even if it was just performative allyship, Culture Trip put up an Instagram post about brunch. They didn’t respond to any requests internally to make a statement until days had passed. Again, the company (especially at higher levels) is almost entirely white. Weirdly they were really quick to donate to Notre Dame. I guess black lives matter less than a building. 

11. You are worth more. Please just apply somewhere else."

- Regular layoffs, and very poor handling thereof. The company has announced it is making redundancies due to COVID-19, but it is clear to all that this is just a convenient justification for doing a huge restructure i.e. getting rid of 80% of the content team. The whole process has been handled appallingly, from the company's announcing to employees that there were at risk via a LIVESTREAM (where some people who were not meant to be were tuning in), to the decision to furlough just two employees (including the in-house wellness practitioner...) and failing to give proper explanation as to why this is, and making a mockery of the collective consultation process and stonewalling questions/suggestions from employees at risk.
- CEO appears to either be tone-deaf to the mood of his staff or simply doesn't care. Though I have not experienced it personally, he is known to be aggressive and cruel towards anyone who deigns to disagree with him
- Awful internal communications 
- Phoney company values .... ""Stand Together"" (have seen little evidence of senior management putting this one into practice)
- Despite hard times (as evidenced by layoffs), CEO donated company funds to the Save Notre Dame appeal and threw an obscene amount of money at CT's SXSW launch
- Company continues to claim that it prioritises mental health and wellbeing, despite making the lives of employees miserable and stressful (e.g. moving our monthly pay date with very little notice, and little compassion when people raised the financial hardship this would cause). Yoga in the office is great, but it is not enough.
- Ever-changing strategy -- irritatingly termed being ""nimble"" by senior management, when in reality it just means we never get to finish a damn thing and are expected to drop everything at the whims of the powers that be

67,Culture Trip,What I can say about leaving Culture Trip after 3 years,2020-05-28,5.0,Content,"I recently lost my job at Culture Trip in light of the downsizing related to Corona-led circumstances. Why am I writing this? Because I had an amazing 3 years here and because I would still come and work here in a heart beat! 
Reading some of the comments written here and articles in the press shocks me as they are so far removed from my experience and those of my colleagues. Has it always been a smooth ride? of course not, but what company is perfect? What I can testify to is that I made great friends, worked on exciting projects, had fun and most importantly, even at times of pressure, always felt valued. This was true when I was an employee, and remained true during my departure. 
I am incredibly sad to be leaving but continue to believe in Culture Trip's vision and the mission that I proudly contributed to. I also genuinely appreciated the conversations I had with my manager (who always supported me) and how they handled and helped me in this difficult process.

- Office dogs to play with when not working from home","The company never managed to generate much revenue following its $80 million series B funding in Q2 2018. This is on account of poor business strategy implemented by the very people who hope to ride this wave of coronavirus turbulence by cutting the vast majority of Culture Trip's lowest-paid employees (people in the £20-35k salary range), whom they continue to manipulate and exploit until the eleventh hour. It may seem strange for a startup, or whatever type of company Culture Trip claims to be today, to exacerbate an astonishingly top-heavy structure but leadership seems hell-bent on defending their stance (likely because they too would prefer not to collect Jobseeker's Allowance). 

What’s truly unprecedented - and frankly, embarrassing - is the complacency and corruption shown by senior management as they continue to claim prioritising employees' mental health by publicly stating stuff like “Employees are looking to leaders in the workplace now more than ever to model the grit and grace navigating this pandemic requires.” The only grit and grace Culture Trip leadership has shown during this time is how to be a snake [insert snake emoji x 3].

It's rumoured that plans to cut the company's workforce began long before the impacts of coronavirus had even taken hold but the CEO stood in front of the entire company in mid February at an all-hands meeting and said launching bookable experiences (now live on the site) could be a career defining moment for some. If this isn't an example of manipulation for personal gain, I'm not sure what is.

The People Team (HR) is complicit in leadership’s poor behaviour which is exactly why it’s nigh on impossible to write to them privately even though they’ve made claims in response to previous Glassdoor reviews that many of the negative experiences had by current and former staff aren’t what they’d wish any employee to endure.

The CEO has previously made requests of SEO staff to push the company’s Glassdoor profile down Google’s ranking as a search result for “Kris Naudts.” This has been accomplished somewhat through the writing of articles bearing his name as author and starting a Twitter account."

Private healthcare package","My first month on the job at Culture Trip I witnessed my first cull on the editorial team, saw them packing up their stuff in tearful shock and leaving an entire bank of empty desks within a 30 minute window. Anxiously I asked my team mates if our jobs were safe and they said 'oh don't worry, they do this all the time.' - so often in fact that they call them Red Weddings, and they happen around March/April every year.

Not long after this particular cull, during a company meeting we were warned of some 'nasty articles' that were about to be published and expose Culture Trip's CEO for who he really was and give us the DL on a toxic work culture, bullying from the top down, and something about post it notes...

In order to save their dented ego and adopt the persona of BE A GREAT COMPANY TO WORK FOR, Culture Trip went through an intense period of contemplation last year to attempt to win round its jaded workforce. They unveiled new core values on beautifully designed postcards, announced staff networks for minorities in the workplace (but refused to allow them the chance to hold the company accountable). They mapped out career projections for each employee, hired a woman into the C-suite (SHOCK) and patted themselves on the back for it by announcing it on Linkedin. We were forced through 2 staff surveys in an attempt to regain our trust and monitor progress. In the background however they were forcing new recruits to write phoney glassdoor reviews, messed us around with our monthly pay date, plastered over gaping wounds with pizza parties and put us through awkward ask me anythings with our CEO that neither he nor us really wanted to take part in.

Then this year rumours started up again in February that the next red wedding was imminent, saying the company wouldn't survive 2020 because it was broke - and this was before coronavirus was a threat to our lives and livelihoods. Considering it had been drummed into me during my recruitment that the company had received seed investment of over 100 million pounds, my Carrie Bradshaw moment consisted of - I couldn't help but wonder, what the hell did they do with all that money?

The foolish spending of a mega rich CEO on a power trip might explain some of the financial deficit - Donating company funds to the Save Notre Dame appeal, throwing an obscene amount of money at our US SXSW launch which belly flopped into failure and then firing those who worked weeks of overtime to pull it off, opening an office with a Mayfair postcode on a whim and hiring c-suite employees on ridiculous salaries could point us in the right direction.

In February I was told on the grapevine that content was going to be hit hard despite the fact that our targets were increasing by over 100% month on month in 2020. Rumours of illustration and animation being wiped out completely and our commissioning editors being replaced by automated programs were all things that I had heard. However with a strong and supportive message from our CEO and HR department about 'standing together' through coronavirus gave me a false sense of security that Culture Trip actually did care about its employees through this difficult time. 

We were reactive, changing our content, publishing news-worthy articles to support our users through the crisis and keeping them inspired from home. Then at the end of March, with no prior warning during our regular company meeting, the bomb dropped from Kris's mouth that for some of us, we may never meet again, and best of luck for the future. Within the hour nearly our entire New York Office was wiped out with 2 weeks severance, and immediately afterwards I learned that I had a target on my back.

I'm now being dragged through a frustrating period of collective consultation with over 100 other colleagues 'due to coronavirus'. Some 'safe' colleagues have been furloughed secretly but it wasn't an option for us, no one knows why but It has now been half-way admitted from the horses mouth that Culture Trip wants to appear leaner to investors.

The content team are being whipped into finishing everything we've been working on before the end of May so they can sell it to clients and make money. Teams which have almost been wiped out completely have been nominated for awards and staff are being bombarded with requests by managers to 'Vote for Culture Trip! Well done guys!' when we all know that nearly everyone who worked on those projects is about to lose their job. Kick in the teeth much? Read the room guys..."

If you scroll through, most of the positive reviews here are generated by members of the C-suite or incoming employees. New employees are encouraged to write a positive glassdoor review after their first couple of weeks on the job. The CEO has been obsesed with the negative reviews here.

It’s a “revolving door of hire and fire here,” as one reviewer stated. Without fail for the past 3 years (sometime in March/April) there is a big round of layoffs (including this year). The rest of the year people are constantly leaving or silently getting fired. This causes serious disruptions to teams and coupled with the lack of experience in management it’s hard to get things done.

All of the major problems stem from the CEO. He belittles employees throughout the organization. Various HR Managers left after several weeks on the job, the CFO suddenly resigned (with no replacement for nearly a year), the COO left after a month on the job, and the CMO suddenly left as well. The CEO gets defensive during AMA’s and drones on and on about how the company is innovative (talking about AR, VR, AI, Machine learning - none of which exist at the company) without giving any sort of direction during company meetings. This man is a psychiatrist but is unable to read a room and his lack of emotional intelligence at times is shocking. 

There is no transparency at the company. Nobody knows the financial state of the company and budgets for projects have no apparent guidelines."

One WFH day a week.","- I'm surprised to see the Chief Content Officer's recent review on Glassdoor, telling potential applicants that Culture Trip values its employees. The CCO oversaw a massive round of layoffs in March 2019 -- and it shocked everyone, since they  came one week after what was apparently a successful debut in the US and after a year of the CEO telling everyone how successful CT was. Soon-to-be laid-off NYC employees were told to wait 3 hours so that the staff in London could be fired first. So the NYC employees sat waiting in a cafe to be axed. The CCO told employees at the all-hands after that unhappy employees should leave the company. And he continued to repeat that we should leave in private meetings and office meetings. 
- The founder and most of his C-suite lack basic leadership skills, which is exacerbated by their lack of knowledge of tech. In response to questions, they will regurgitate platitudes such as ""Move fast and break things"" or get defensive, saying that the questions are too difficult. The CEO would lash out and get into petty back-and-forth, as though he were more concerned about his ego rather than the question. Does that sound like leadership to you? Are these the people you'd trust your career with?
- Culture Trip isn't doing anything innovative in tech, but the leaders are so adept at talking themselves in circles rather than acknowledge the truth. 
-  A lot of CT's content is written by in-house editorial staff, NOT freelancers, that have never been to the places they write about. So don't expect editorial integrity at Culture Trip. 
- I have seen colleagues steal each other's work, including my own, and take credit. Managers and leaders turn a blind eye; in fact, they are often the perpetrators.
- If you're in the NYC office, your benefits will be minimal compared to what your colleagues in London get.
- All the marketing material bragging that CT employees come from Airbnb, Expedia, Google, etc. are misleading -- those people were hired, but then fired or left as soon as they could. Check their LinkedIn profiles to see how long they stayed at CT. Time served ranges from 6 months to 1.5 years. 
- People doing the same job weren't paid the same. These people seemed to be mostly women. When they went to HR, the previous HR director said that they might be terminated.  It sounded like a threat."
84,Culture Trip,The  Culture of Culture Trip,2020-02-06,5.0,People Team,"Having had the fortunate opportunity to work with founder-led, high growth and successful tech companies many times in my career, late this summer I made the decision to join Culture Trip. 

My decision was driven by the deeply held belief that the founder and the leadership team had - that in order to succeed in the marketplace with an exceptional product for the curious traveler, they needed to consistently focus their efforts to ensure sustainable success for everyone - on the inside. Brilliant!  For a Manager, Employee, Leader, Talent or People professional, this is an amazing opportunity. 

According to research gleaned from the Founders Mentality, ""85% of companies fail to thrive - not due to external market conditions but due to overwhelming internal factors."" The internal complexities of a growth company can lead them further astray from the core mission and vision. The founder and leadership team refused to let this happen. The stand together, with hearts and minds in the right place to make CT a success.

We are on that journey, together. As a leadership team and as a company of employees we bring our unique talents and creative best to create a special company in pursuit of something better for each other and the curious traveller.",There is so much to do and so many possibilities that it can be overwhelming.  It is essential that you are good at prioritising. This is not unusual in an earlier stage scale up but may not be for everyone.
85,Culture Trip,Fantastic Company & Amazing Culture (w/ real focus on Diversity and Sustainability!!),2020-02-01,5.0,Account Director,"I joined Culture Trip last February after having worked in 2 growth stage startups in London. Some of the  negative feedback that I read in posted reviews are actually illustrative of very common growing pains in startups. What is quite uncommon is the way the executive team reacted to these concerns, how attentive they've been to feedback and how much effort they've put in to make sure eventual mistakes are corrected and not repeated.

I think this is a reflection of the quality, vision and maturity of the Leadership team. It is also most certainly a result of the diverse group our CEO was able to bring together in the K team over the last year! You just simply cannot find lots of companies out there where more than 50% of the Executive positions are (now) held by Women!!!

I am convinced this is the result of an active effort by our CEO - who has in numerous company events voiced his focus on diversity and closing the gender gap! 
In addition to diversity, there is also a very open dialogue and a number of new initiatives - with broad participation across the firm - that have been rolled out by our CEO around mental health (he used to be a Psychiatrist),  Sustainability and  Climate Change.

I know after working here for a year that if you are a hardworking, motivated, ambitious person who strives in team work, you will be given lots of opportunities to grow at Culture Trip!  

All in, I think this is a fantastic place to work: ambitious mission, inspiring colleagues,  fun work environment and cool perks - what else can one want??! - GO Culture Trip!!!",Office starts to feel a little crowded!
86,Culture Trip,Celebrating one year at Culture Trip,2020-01-29,5.0,Chief Content Officer,"I've just celebrated my first year at CT, and what a year it has been! Feels like 3 months and 3 years at the same time! Before joining, while at the BBC, I was privileged to say that every last year I completed there, across the last 10 years or so, had been the best in my career. That legacy would have been hard to beat, surely! However, I can genuinely say that the last year has indeed been the best year in my career again - with all the learnings, certainly more ups than downs, and most of all the kindest, talented, supportive and committed teams across the company's global offices. Like in all companies, there are hard bits, of course, there are, but we are evolving, and fast. The main highlight for me from the past year is a weekly affair - every Monday, when I put together a weekly editorial highlights email, I feel grateful and honoured to lead such a fantastic group of people and working on the intersection of creativity, tech and travel.","This environment can be challenging but as one of the leaders in the business, I am proud of the progress we are making every day. We are improving at every level and I would wholeheartedly recommend considering us as your new employer."

91,Culture Trip,"How much longer can this go on?? For me, not so much.",2019-11-21,2.0,Anonymous,The work life balance is good. 1 day per week WFH is permitted as standard but there is more flexibility.,"A lot of the downsides of working at Culture Trip have already been shared but I'd like to further talk about:

- Revolting attitude from senior leaders  (the K-Team). The CEO-founders clique are essentially his lapdogs. Their regular meetings are an ego boost for themselves while putting down the rest of their teams. On a number of occasions in the London office I have heard and seen K-Team members being rude, aggressive and belittling to employees - bullying!

-Wired article - if you've come this far you'll have no doubt read the Wired article that has been published. All true

-Loss of talent - the company continues to bleed talent. Content, Marketing and HR teams have all taken a huge hit. Senior Leaders have vanished into thin air without any explanation. I wonder where they are being kept locked up.

-Funding - take a look at the latest submissions on Companies House and try and tell me Culture Trip is in a good place. It makes extremely grim reading. The company made a loss of £24M last year, while Kris paid himself £225k. Total salaries were £11M. There is no logical way this company can last - makes sense there is no CFO.

- We claim to have 20 million unique monthly visitors - we're just lying to ourselves. The real number is 17 million. We're lying to ourselves, investors and the press. 

-Company Decision Making - is shrouded in secrecy. There is no transparency at any level. And you wonder why employees are disillusioned. 

- We're creating layers upon layers upon layers of management. We're not at the stage yet where this is needed. We lose so much communication. People in senior roles are tripping up over each other as they try to work out what they are doing. 

I am tired. I am tired of waking up and coming to work in an organisation where there is no trust. I'm tired of going home and talking to my partner about how bad it is here.  

For so long I tried to convince myself that things actually were not that bad, and to ignore the negative press myself. I realised I was just deluding myself. I AM WOKE!"
92,Culture Trip,Culture Trip ruined me,2019-11-14,1.0,V P,"Wonderful team mates with amazing drive in horrendous circumstances and a terrible culture.  They kept you sane, they kept you going.  Thank you to you all - you know who you are!","Please please, for your own mental wellbeing, for your career, and for your financial health, read the reviews and the recent articles in Wired and Skift.  This will protect anyone that is preparing to join CultureTrip - I'm just sorry it cannot help those that are stuck there.

It is called out by many, but everyone outside of the inner circle ( a small few of the Kteam) are mentally and verbally put down, ignored, or under utilised in their skill set.  These are talented people and so many of them have left, or want to leave, because of the CEO.  Despite the denials, a number were forced out.  Leaders weren't even allowed to see the financial performance of the business - it was all hidden from them.  I wonder what they make of the recent (but late) publication of the 2018 accounts on the Companies House website.  It doesn't make great reading and I fear for the staff there.  No wonder there has been no CFO in the business for the last year!  The business urgently needs funding but who is going to invest in a business that has blown $100m and manipulates the data and stories it tells its current investors.

I saw so many people leave with mental health issues.  They were bullied, dictated too and a shell of themselves - all the way up to senior leaders above me.  They escaped and it is horrible to witness them going through this.  So many people want to leave, and it's no wonder so many people contributed to the Wired and Skift articles.  I myself am on medication for my mental health.  This is a business lead by a Psychiatrist, who campaigns to help mental wellbeing.  If you ask most leavers, it is a business that causes mental health issues, and on that basis it needs to take a long hard look at itself and not just say (and probably post below this) the usual story of ""we are changing"".  

Resources in the business are focussed in the wrong areas and people build what they want to build and the focus changes week to week.  There is a huge amount of conflict as the company isn't really clear on what it actually wants to do.  If it does know that, then it doesn't demonstrate it, and there is a lot of back stabbing and personal agendas going on.

Leadership is poor.  There is a distinct lack of emotional intelligence.  Most of the real leaders, who care for their staff, their wellbeing and their development have left.  This leaves a ""do as I say"" culture.

Employees are treated very badly.  As an example, forced changes to pay dates were followed by leaders saying people should manage their money better.   No wonder the recent employee engagement scores are extremely low and nowhere near the +90% mark the CEO quoted to Wired.  That's not the only number the business lies about.  It keeps publicly declaring 18-20 million MUV's - please check google analytics for a more accurate number!  Are the investors aware ?

The company continues to advocate fake reviews here on Glassdoor, whilst dismissing negative reviews as a minor few disgruntled ex employees.  Wake up!  Two years ago you had a rota of who should post positive reviews and you recently forced the Kteam to post positive reviews - look at the stream of them all coming at once!

I could go on and on.  Please please take note of this - candidates and leadership.  To the CEO - please step down and let a leader make your vision a success.  You've lost so many staff including your CFO, COO, CHRO (2 days in), CRO, CMO, SVP engineering, SVP Travel, as well as so many wonderful and creative employees who just had to escape......Alarm Bells!"

- Good company mission.","- When there's a success, be it from content or engineering, there's a genuine sense of relief, a feeling that the product is valuable and that creativity is championed, sadly however the hard work is often unrecognised and the credit is taken by seniors who put in about 2% of the overall labour. 

- The toilets block frequently. 

- Management think a pizza party every Friday is a trade off for underpaying and overworking members of staff. 

- The companies hire and fire policy is frankly outrageous. 

- Managers are so severely baked into the culture of fear that they cannot make meaningful change for the talent they're attempting to look after. 

- Current managers are disillusioned, mislead, untrustworthy and out of touch."
95,Culture Trip,Great people and great mission and vision but CEO needs to get better at listening,2019-08-27,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"London office location, some great people. Great vision, mission and content is amazing","I read some terrible reviews on Glassdoor before I started and took the risk anyway as I met some really nice people during the interview process.

You might read lots of bad things about the CEO, Kris (Wired). He is actually a very nice guy. Very passionate about how he wants to change the world for the better. Some of this might be ego but I think most of it comes from the right place. 

The issue is that he doesn't always know how to listen. He can be quite arrogant without realising it of course. He can also be very nice. The issue is that he doesn't know this, which is disappointing  for a person of his age and background. I’d hope a CEO would have more self awareness. 

He is a great guy but his emotional intelligence lets him down occasionally.  Normal behaviour you might say for a start up CEO/entrepreneur with great passion. But a shame to be a cliche. 

It's a very hard job running a start up /scale up. Great things have been achieved and I wouldn’t discourage people from joining the company as it’s a fun and creative place to work overall . I don't think I could be the CEO."
96,Culture Trip,A great company to work for with some unique programs,2019-08-17,5.0,QA Engineer,"I approached Culture Trip through their get back to work program, which the CEO started to help people who have been out of work for a period of time. I had previously worked in tech for a reasonably long period of time but had some health problems which reduced my confidence a great deal. 

The people who interviewed me were very supportive and after a couple of interviews, I was offered a job there. They allowed me a great deal of flexibility in my working hours and helped me find a role which suited my skillset. All this has really helped me to get back on my feet. The company cares about employee wellbeing and has many emotionally intelligent people working there. 

The management genuinely try to improve the working environment all the time, taking steps to empower the teams and continuosly increase their autonomy over the processes and technology they use. Even during the short time I have worked there I have seen the company evolve for the better and change where it is required. There is a data driven and experimental mindset which can be seen in the way the teams are structured.

The community here is friendly and made me feel welcome. The company as a whole has a strong culture of inclusion with many benefits. Everyone I have come across has been extremely capable and works very hard. The hiring policies contribute extensively to the great working environment at Culture Trip, as the people are of a certain calibre and their personalities match the vision of the company. 

The CEO and founder was a high level psychiatrist and scientist before starting Culture Trip, who understands the importance of mental health and its effects on society very well. He is approachable and supportive and having read some of the papers he authored during his time as a psychiatrist I found him very interesting and highly intelligent from a different angle to what he is best known for, his considerable accomplishments at Culture Trip. He has a difficult job in a very competitive sector where many challenging and difficult decisions have to be made.

The emphasis on trying to foster a culture where mental health is at the forefront of the employees' minds is very inspiring, since a large percentage of the workforce will have to deal with these issues at some point in their careers and hence support from their peers and the company can be very important. I also think the substantial support for the LGBTQ community at Culture Trip is fantastic. All this creates a very humane and inclusive working environment, which is a pleasure to be part of.

Culture Trip is a great mix of technical and creative people which always makes conversations very interesting and is something I hadn't experienced to this extent before. It also provides a great social life for those who are interested in that. We have a tradition of providing food and drinks from different cultures every Friday in the kitchen which is really enjoyable and great for meeting new people. Going to local pubs after the weekly social is also a common occurance. There are company wide parties in interesting locations, which are very enjoyable. There is also an in-house yoga instructor who provides sessions for those who are interested as well as meditation and mindfullness classes. Full time employees can also work at home one day a week.

The roadmap and vision are well articulated, in the form of interesting presentations, meetings and updates which keep the employees in the loop. There is a weekly meeting where the CEO provides highlights of important milestones which is very useful. As a company, Culture Trip fosters an agile mindset and continuosly strives to improve processes and systems. 

The product is highly engaging, useful and is growing day by day. I am sure Culture Trip will further realise the huge potential it has in bringing cultures together and helping people plan their travels in new and captivating ways, through all the product enhancements that are in store for the near future.","Culture Trip is still evolving so there are many initiatives which are happening to improve processes. I think this can be difficult for some people but I have found that one can learn a great deal from this, if approached with the right mentality. Building a successful business is not easy."
97,Culture Trip,"Smoke and mirrors from management, avoid",2019-08-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Diminishing pros.

The sadi management tier has already got their new titles etc and promotions. 

Recent events (read the Wired article!) have shown that the problems that the company face has been repeated in multiple guises as the company's management have not resolved the root cause - namely their ineptitude, firing people that do not agree with the CEO, pretending all the impact on the employees are just BAU. This is not a company that cares for their employees.   

As to recent ""changes"" as celebrating success more, this might only last till the next problem.  An 80 question questionnaire will only be useful if there is transparency  and concrete action."

2. There are a few benefits that staff appreciate: being able to work from home, having access to Yoga and Mindfulness classes, free fruit, Friday drinks, and a day off on your birthday. However, all of these are fairly standard for startups and not as 'generous' as the CEO would have the team believe.

3. Attempts to change the culture are in full swing. A few brave individuals are pushing for improvements. It may be too little, too late. But we all appreciate that you're trying!","1. The product is still really basic, despite major investment. Core product features are abandoned in favor of cosmetic changes requested by the founder or chief product officer. Even these take 3x longer to execute than they should. As a result, site visitors are totally disengaged. Culture Trip's bounce rate is one of the highest I have ever seen, and nobody returns. Traffic is going down month on month.

2. There's no real monetisation strategy. The little revenue that's generated through ad sales / affiliate clicks barely pays the salaries of the ad sales team.  The launch of the online travel agency won't change this; the few hotels that are on the site are so well hidden that no visitor will ever find them. It doesn't take a genius to work out that the Series B funding will run out sooner or later, and who would invest into a declining site? 

3. Reporting is nonexistent. The Product team introduce new features without testing them properly and results are ignored if the chief product officer doesn't like them anyway. The Marketing team focus on KPIs that are completely different from the Product team's. There is no forecasting - financial or other. Teams don't have budgets or meaningful targets.

4. The founder has no experience in leading people. He seems to try to rule by exerting pressure on those around him, and just won't trust anyone. As a result, staff turnover is incredibly high at all levels, and the gaps in the leadership team are so large that it's not functioning at all."

Content is mediocre at best with listicles being the preferred format usually written by university students on their Erasmus year abroad.

The CEO, Kris Naudts, is a former psychiatrist  with zero business experience and is surrounded by a c-suite of amateurs. The company calls themselves a ""hyper-growth"" startup but have been around for 8 years and have made zero strides. They are completely resistant to change and as another review mentioned, their NYC office is London's pet.  Here are some things I experienced during my time:

- Within one month of joining, I heard from 90% of the office that the company was close to closing shop. ""We were ten minutes from going bankrupt last year"" is a direct quote from an employee.
- Within two months of joining, the company went through a round of massive layoffs  ""American Idol"" style. Those that were safe were asked to sit in one building and those that were not were asked to sit in another building to learn they are being fired immediately.
- I never met my boss because he lived in London and was also fired 
- Within three months, HR had vanished 
- There was constant fear of people being fired 
- ""I don't care about company profit margin"" is a direct quote from a lead producer
- ""I'm afraid if I stay at this job too long, I will fail at my next job because I haven't learned anything"" is a direct quote
- I spent hours and hours and had meetings about meetings arguing with the London office to implement any sort of process
- I was advised to tell clients that ""projects would get turned around when they got turned around""
- The lead of every department has zero prior experience pertaining to that department and resigns or eventually gets fired

In sum, Culture Trip is a cheap Wordpress blog. If you want to work to simply collect a brain check and to avoid using your brain, Culture Trip is the place for you."
105,Culture Trip,No Idea How to Use Potential,2019-07-11,2.0,Editor,There are some interesting ideas being worked on and there is a lot of talent. Sometimes interesting projects can be worked on when while management shifts focus and don't pay attention to what lower-level employees are doing.,"I am generally an optimistic person, so when I read the terrible reviews here, I told myself, ""well who writes Glassdoor reviews? Only disgruntled employees, not the average employee."" Plus I needed a job. 
In my time at Culture Trip, my job description changed frequently as the goals and plans of upper management shifted. I was constantly put in the position of having to ask detailed, seemingly dumb questions to figure out what I was supposed to be doing. This has been the long term state of the company and has created a constant state of low morale. When I first started, I was frustrated that my co-workers couldn't look at the bright side and roll with the punches. But I soon grew weary of the inability to get comfortable with knowing my job. 
CT is great at recruting great talent but has no idea how to use it. People hired at upper levels don't have the most experience and I found their egos often prevented talented people from using their whole potential. 
When hearing about the ambitions of Culture Trip, I was inspired by the interesting ideas and talented team, but I would never see the execution from idea into product. Instead, I would see flashy rebrandings and expensive grabs at media attention.  After spending millions of dollars for a pop-up at SXSW, CT laid off about 15% of the company. This was only about a year after they held similar layoffs. It was frustrating to see such misuse of resources. This was after a CFO quit suddenly, which is never a good sign. 
There were never any signs of possible advancements as most people were fired by the time they were about due for one. 
Overall, I constantly felt frustrated at being underutilized, asked to do tasks that were outside my skillset, and seeing the ways that upper management talked a big game without being able to follow through."
106,Culture Trip,"""...Like Butter Scraped Over Too Much Bread""",2019-07-11,1.0,Project Manager,"- The outrageous three-month notice period ensures that you get paid while looking for a new job
- Great talent has joined and left Culture Trip (especially when the Glassdoor ratings were better than they are now), and there are a few truly wonderful people remaining in the company
- There is a yoga practitioner on-site, with a one-on-one yoga session per month and a weekly after-work class","About two months ago, at a company meeting, the CEO of Culture Trip made light of the reviews on Glassdoor, attributing them to disgruntled employees who had left the business ‘involuntarily’. I’m going to start this review by stating that I left Culture Trip voluntarily - and I felt a great sense of relief in doing so. Secondly, I think the main reason why people leave these reviews here - apart from the therapeutic benefits of sharing our experiences - is to help other people avoid making the same mistake we did by joining Culture Trip in the first place.

I joined Culture Trip when the reviews of the company were bad, but not nearly as terrible as they are now. There are many reasons behind the ratings. In March, there was a mass dismissal (with no warning) of members of the Content Team and other senior roles, which led to a mass exodus of employees who didn’t agree with this dismissal. The second major reason is because Culture Trip’s business plan is chaotic, which feels like an understatement. 

“I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.” Bilbo Baggins may have said it, but the same statement applies to Culture Trip. The CEO and senior management aspire to be competitors to so many different companies: Airbnb, Netflix, Disney. Never mind the fact that these companies all have completely different offerings and monetise in entirely different ways - employees are all expected to go along with this misguided plan, where projects and tasks seem to be prioritised according to leadership’s instantaneous, under-researched whims. Culture Trip is pulled in so many different directions without doing a single one of those things particularly well. Combine this with the alarmingly high turnover rate of employees - including on the senior level - and it’s difficult not to feel like the company is heading for imminent failure.

I can’t speak for the New York and Tel Aviv offices, but the atmosphere in the London office is the worst I’ve encountered during my 10+ years of working. Bullying behaviour is tolerated on all levels of employment, senior management takes credit for the hard work carried out by everyone else and the atmosphere is overwhelmingly negative. Leaving Culture Trip was the best thing I could have done for myself and I know that many former employees feel the same way."

This place sure does prove this statement to be correct!  

-Be sure to sort these reviews by most recent, don't fall for the ""paid to be at the top of the list"" reviews as they are all being written by senior leaders of the company, as asked by the CEO.  Not only are they telling you their exact role, which why would they do that unless asked too, but some are lying about where they work.  There are no senior leaders in the NY office as stated by two recent posters.  It's totally clear they wanted to raise the overall review score for NY by doing this! 

-The fact the CEO did an article for Forbes this week trying to clear up the bad Glassdoor reviews is comical! Especially since I think he literally made it worse by what he said in the interview! Even in the article he makes it all about himself! Not one person at Culture Trip receives any recognition for what they are doing to help the company. 

-Above I wrote a Pro as ""the basis of the company has so much potential"" I truly believe this, but it needs a new leader.  The idea man had a great idea, but he has lousy skills at running a business.  There comes a point where you need to relinquish your power. The problem is, he will never walk away.

There's little to no revenue generated and if they don't find new investors soon money previously raised will most likely be exhausted very soon!  Let's hope if they get new investors they will be smart enough to not be silent and will create a board of directors, which currently does not exist! Another reason why the CEO can continue to do as he is doing, he has no one holding him accountable for a failing company.  

-We lost all of our HR Leaders/Managers, literally every single HR person hired in the past year, came and left already, some didn't even stay a full year! They weren't asked to leave, they all wanted to leave! If that doesn't tell you something, then I don't know what else will!  

-Don't fall for the pretty exterior. What you are sold during your interview, doesn't exist once you start."
108,Culture Trip,Great company to work for,2019-07-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Culture Trip is on the rise and it seems like very exciting times are ahead. Culture Trip tries to use creativity as a differentiator in the travel industry and with 20 M MUVs, it's pretty clear that it's working. It is also that kind of content that I'm proud of and happy to share with my friends.","A couple of months ago, I would have said that internal communication could be better. The company has tackled most of those issues though."
109,Culture Trip,Believe the REAL reviews not those by upper mgmt,2019-07-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Has potential and good snacks. Worked with a few good people.,"-The reviews about the CEO and group of unqualified generals  (inexperienced or with no experience, ex accountants) and brand name media sycophants, at the cross roads of their careers, lead the team.

-Revolving door of upper management of CRO, CFO, COO, VP, Managing Directors, Head of .... Chief of.....and HR. Very top heavy in the Editorial and London based. Those who do actually stick around have stock, which employees don't get or didn't and are also just sycophants.

-No efficiency other quarterly firings. 

-Time gap between London and New York creates quite a barrier make efficient business decisions.

-New York team is treated very poorly compared to London team, in terms of leadership, US market approach, benefits, and respect, including to women. 

-Fake reviews: One can join Culture Trip and see what is true for themselves and be underpaid, under-appreciated, have no NY HR, and worry about being fired and expect a very meager severance package. 

-Yoga instructor when other are getting fired."
110,Culture Trip,Challenging and Rewarding,2019-06-28,5.0,Chief Product Officer,"I joined Culture Trip for a number of reasons, and they remain true today:

- I like the people. I joined from big well known tech company and I couldn't believe how friendly and downright nice the people at CultureTrip are. The chance to work x-functionally with everyone from animators, to film makers, to data scientists and UX designers, was a real plus for me and we all enjoy working together to solve the huge and interesting challenges we have . Also, everyone is passionate about what they do and there is real affinity with what we're trying to do as a company.

- I like the mission. I've always been a traveler and it is one of the main things I choose to spend my time and money on. What could be better than building the world's best travel platform and reinventing the genre in the process?

- We have a clear path to success. There are so many start ups out there which say 'hey we have a whole load of funding, and smart people, and a great mission and all we have to do is solve these three impossible things which have never been solved before.....'. CultureTrip is not like this. There is a clear and feasible path to company success. All we need to do is execute! 

I've been here for over two years now and it has been a roller coaster ride which I would not have missed for the world. My job has changed a lot since I joined going from a team of 2 to a team of nearly 20. We have implemented OKRs and squads. We have more than quadrupled in size. All of these have thrown up their challenges, and all of these have been both hard and painful at times to overcome but incredibly rewarding at the same time.","Culture Trip is not for everyone. When people ask me what's the best thing I say 'it's creative chaos'. When they ask what's the worst thing I say 'it's creative chaos'. You need to be prepared for this. If you look at all the different disciplines trying to work together, from illustrators to machine learning engineers, of course it's going to be difficult! You need to be smart, flexible, able to rise to huge challenges and not afraid to go beyond the conventional. If this sounds like you then I would not hesitate in applying."
111,Culture Trip,Great place to work,2019-06-24,5.0,General Counsel,"I joined Culture Trip about 3 years ago as sole legal counsel and now head the Legal Team.  

We’ve set out to disrupt the travel, media and entertainment space and bring people closer together. This is a big and compelling ambition and it’s amazing to help with this. At Culture Trip, you have the opportunity to build something, sink your teeth into a problem and see it through. I agree with one of the posters below, the impact one can have on the business is huge.","No cons for me. Building a business isn’t easy and we make mistakes like other businesses. The good thing is that if something is not working, we set out to fix it and don’t waste time."
112,Culture Trip,"Free advise if you are considering Culture Trip:  if you have ANY other job offer , opt for that.",2019-06-21,1.0,Sales,"The people I work directly with are really friendly and we all share our mutual dislike of the company and CEO.
Dogs in the office.","On paper, the company looks good - ""flexible work hours, yoga, work from home etc. In reality You are overworked and underpaid. ""flexible"" work hours is so untrue - you are worked so hard for the wage you are given.
I wish I took these reviews more seriously before I started. 
**Please do read the ones that are real (not the fake fluff that the company churns out to boost their ratings).
Oh and benefits/bonus? HA!"
113,Culture Trip,My view after 4 years at Culture Trip,2019-06-19,4.0,Vice President Operations,"My name is Ben and I’ve worked at Culture Trip for over 4 years now, having been here since the very early days when there were just a handful of people in a tiny office. I built our first desks! I’ve worked with almost every team in the business and now focus on Operations. The company has been through lots of different stages even in its short life and it has been quite a journey. Like many start-ups we’ve made mistakes along the way. Oh boy, we’ve made mistakes. Some were avoidable, some were poorly managed and some were misunderstandings. We still make them, although less often now I would say.  

But as a place to work, Culture Trip, is really nothing like what it seems from this site. I would have left a long time ago if it was! I’ve hesitated to come on here and say anything, but there are lots of positives that people should read about too. The people are lovely and you can’t walk down the corridor without smiling. The work itself is super-interesting, the company is operating in an unusual space between creativity, travel and entertainment so there is great variety and a real meeting of minds. The creativity is incredible in many of the teams and there is a huge amount of freedom to express yourself. The mission is truly inspiring - if we succeed, Culture Trip can truly make the world a much better place. There is a real meritocracy. Talented people, no matter the age or stage of career are given opportunities to shine and achieve. Successes are fuelled with encouragement and resource. I’ve had the privilege to work with some of the most inspiring and talented people from across many companies and industries, countries and disciplines. I’ve seen them grow and blossom.","Some people have had a bad experience here, no doubt, the company style is not well suited to everyone and I would be the first to acknowledge that things have definitely not been perfect, sometimes they’ve been hard, on occasions just plain bad. But the positives definitely outweigh the negatives by a long long way. Also, there has also been a clear change in tone throughout the organisation recently that comes right from the top and a commitment to fix the things that are not working, and build on the ones that are. The company is honest about its failings and isn’t just sticking its head in the sand. 

Overall, I would urge anyone reading the reviews on here and thinking about whether they should work for Culture Trip to simply come and see for yourself. If it’s not right for you, that’s fine, but don’t let others make up your mind for you."
114,Culture Trip,Exciting and unique place to be at,2019-06-18,5.0,Senior Vice President Engineering,"I work in the company for more than three years.

We have a unique company, with a special product and special people. Great talent in different fields. I believe that the company is trying to do an amazing thing - to give a full travel experience in one place. The product is something that is easy to connect to.

The company has grown quickly. We had our growth pains, but we managed to grow from a little team to 300 employees, in three locations within 2 years, led by our CEO.

As a senior manager and someone who has been in the company from the beginning, I saw the fast growth and the changes the company has been through. Not everything was as smooth as we would have liked, but we have learned from our mistakes, and we are trying to improve constantly - in internal communications, in operations, in leadership etc.

We have an amazing engineering team, which grew from 4 to 80+ within 3 years, and still growing, now located in two sites. The eng and product teams are working on our products which are used by millions of users monthly. The company gives unique opportunities in working with a B2C product that combines unique content and technology. We have a growing DS and BI team, analyzing our unique data, and implementing algorithms in big data environments.

I want to see the company scale, and, as we do, give more unique opportunities to join the great people and talent we have today.","We went through a hyper growth which caused some growth pains as we grew very fast with some missing processes\roles. The company is working very hard and putting a lot of effort to solve these issues, and we can see daily improvement"
115,Culture Trip,Proud to be a Culture Tripper,2019-06-02,5.0,CMO,"I’ve been leading Marketing at Culture Trip for over a year and a half.  We’ve more than doubled in size in that time and have pulled in some of the best marketing talent in the world.  Having the opportunity to work with people who love to figure out tough problems and have both creative and analytical skills to come up with game changing solutions has been an incredible experience.  People that thrive on change and love a good challenge do very well here.  Several members of the Marketing and Media Sales teams have already had the opportunity to expand into new roles and expanded responsibilities based on their strong performance in their initial roles.  The impact one can have in the business and the development of the brand is huge.  The combination of working on a beloved consumer brand, with an ambitious vision of its future, and a team of smart, fun individuals is very rare and I’m lucky to be here doing this.","Rapid growth makes everything harder.  Our headcount rose very quickly in the last year.  It’s difficult to manage and there have been some missteps along the way.  It can lead to feelings of elation and crushing disappointment sometimes swinging on either end of the spectrum within the same day.  It can be draining and overwhelming, but it also means you never come to work feeling that what you’re doing won’t make a difference."

A nice problem to have!","Start-up world inevitably means that the company has to be flexible and adaptable to changing landscapes as we learn what works and what doesn't. Breaking new ground can be painful and it's not for everyone. We're working on making it easier and Kris, the founder, has recently made some specific commitments which will help."
117,Culture Trip,Startup Taking Focus,2019-05-29,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I felt compelled to write up a review on my one year anniversary with the company.

We've come such a long way in just one year. It's been exciting to see our mission and value proposition come into focus in such a short time.

It's been enlightening working for a truly global brand. Daily interaction with my multicultural staff has broadened my insights, both personal and professional.

Culture Trip has given me plenty of autonomy (much more than my last corporate role), but the accountability is greater too.  This is definitely a place for a self-starter who can deliver against goals, deadlines and expectations.

It feels like we're gaining momentum, I'm optimistic about the future and every ""win"" feels special.","There have definitely been challenges along the way, but honestly, those challenges are pushing us to be a better brand and company.

I'd also add that I have worked at several large companies previously, and I'm impressed with how Culture Trip is investing in employee needs and concerns, especially during these early stages of growth."
118,Culture Trip,Only writing a review to deter anyone from applying,2019-05-08,1.0,Producer,Work from home one day a week.,"Everything else. I worked in the NY office last year and I’m only writing this review now because I saw they posted a ton of new job openings and I felt like I had to say something. DO NOT FALL FOR ANY OF IT. Maybe you’re thinking all these terrible reviews are just from disgruntled, recently fired employees, or maybe you want to give Culture Trip the benefit of the doubt because startups often deal with “growing pains.” That’s what I thought too. I read the terrible reviews before I accepted my position, but in my interview everything seemed great- they were fun, seemed to have solid direction, made all the promises in the world, so I gave it a shot. A month in and I knew I had to get out of there. Another reviewer on here compares Culture Trip to Theranos and it’s not that far off. Senior management has created this false reality of what they think Culture Trip is, but it’s just a house of cards. No one knows what they are doing. NO ONE. You will beat your head against the wall trying to communicate (only on London time of course) with the incredibly unqualified, inexperienced team in London that holds all the keys. They will be intimidated by your legitimate qualifications and talents, and the second you voice an opinion or make a suggestion about anything, they will either A) ignore it, B) steal it as their own, or C) fire you as a way to cover up the fact that they are FAILING and wasting millions of dollars in VC money in the process. I quit as soon as I could and I am soo much happier. Run. Run far away. Still not sure? Take a look at their replies to all of these negative reviews. Copy and pasted stock responses. They do the bare minimum to get good optics. It’s just not worth it."
119,Culture Trip,People Are Fleeing Quickly,2019-05-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"PROS 
I had the opportunity to create work I'm really proud of.
They are riding on the zeitgeist of the experience economy... but so is Google, Amazon, etc.
I learned a lot during my time there...even if one of those things was resilience.","CONS
-There was quite a bit of confusion caused by mismanagement. 
-The nature of the workplace is volatile. They will jerk you around a lot. 
-Job description and the expectations laid out were always in flux. 
-Boy's club at the top - a few toxic people heading departments spoil the bunch.
-Creative roles are, as a rule, grossly underpaid. If you aren't - it is made clear that you can be replaced by someone cheaper. (At one point while I was working there, most of the office thought they had gotten a raise - turns out it was just the minimum wage increase making their salaries legal.)
-Lots of tone deaf content rooted in a shocking neo-colonial mindset. 
-CEO talks openly about ""optics"" but does nothing to cultivate those values internally. All external messaging around diversity/inclusion/gender equality is bogus."
120,Culture Trip,"It's pretty good, but that may be dependant on team, company communications can be lacking",2019-04-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexible working hours, including work from home

121,Culture Trip,Believe It Or Not!,2019-04-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Every pro comes with a stipulation :
- Decent paid vacation BUT not nearly equivalent to counterparts in other offices
- Provided snacks and fruit BUT only on the first day of the week, and not nearly enough for everyone
- Work from home once a week BUT otherwise the office would continue to be overcrowded
- Talented and creative coworkers BUT mismanaged by unqualified managers, unrecognized for their accomplishments and hard work, and devalued to a point where it is just plain insulting","OVERALL: Where do I begin? The Culture Trip that is pitched to every new hire is a completely different thing than it will inevitably shape up to be. You will enter excited about the possibility of creating and supporting meaningful, unique, culturally rich content, but ultimately the bureaucracy, office politics, and lack of industry intelligence exhibited by upper management will leave you unmotivated, spinning in circles, and longing for the weekly happy hours (so that you can leave as soon as people crack open a beer and get a drink in a less toxic place, like the local dive bar).

CULTURE: N/A

Just kidding. Sort of. The culture at Culture Trip is largely one of fear and turbulence. The term ""hyper-growth"" is used very liberally here to explain the mass hiring and even less justified mass firings. Also, as a UK-based company, it is easiest to just accept that things must first come to a decision in London before trickling out to the satellite offices, despite a difference in market and audience needs. This includes promotion opportunities and raises, important decisions like hiring personnel, and even minor ones like whether or not you can purchase paper for the printer. All of these decisions need to go through and be approved by the London HQ first. The negative effects of this are countless: inefficient creative workflow and process, little to no upward (or even lateral) mobility, endless miscommunication, an exuberant amount of meetings, and ultimately an inability to build on the momentum generated in satellite offices.

COMMUNITY: There has been a lot of talent and genuine creativity that has come and gone from the company. I have made real connections with my coworkers that will likely last a very long time. Mutual frustration and suffering usually create strong bonds. 

DIVERSITY:  For a company that prides itself in its ethnic diversity and ""cultural sensitivity,"" the content on the site is filled with either superficial or exoticized perspectives. This can be seen in the ""insider"" content about Asia through dim sum, ramen, or if you're feeling extra ""exotic,"" barbecued rat served on sticks. The reasoning behind this is because those handling the directional initiatives of the company could all be cast as the white-collar criminal in a Law & Order episode. 

LEADERSHIP: The most objective way that I can describe the leadership would be SEVERELY LACKING. While much of the upper management now has come from notable companies like Facebook, Google, or other tech companies - Culture Trip is (in its most recent iteration and marketing campaigns) a media company. In addition, they have been so removed from the actual processes of how these companies got things done that they simply articulate what worked for their old companies without any idea of how to enable the teams to execute these initiatives in this new environment. 

MANAGEMENT: When it comes to the actual day to day dealings in the manager-employee relationship, your mileage may vary. There are some managers that are a delight to work with, completely helpful and open to collaboration, and then there will be other managers that will be dismissive, abrasive, and legitimately MIA. It is very apparent to those at the ground level of the company who are the competent managers and who are just playing the part. 

WORK: If you choose to work for this company, you may have the opportunity to pitch an idea that you are passionate about with the hopes that it will be signed off and greenlit and you can pursue it to the full extent, but in reality, if it a good idea, you will likely have it taken out of your hands, and the credit will be given to someone else that upper management likes more. That’s the best case scenario. The most common scenario though, is that you will be told “no” for any plethora of reasons - lack of budgets (despite company paid-for international flights for yoga instructors), lack of timing (due to seasonal shifts of content direction that call for the entire company to stop everything they are doing and shift focus), or worst yet, your correspondence will simply go ignored, later to resurface as someone else's idea.

CONCLUSION: There are definitely lessons that could be learned working at Culture Trip, but I have found that the most painful ones could be avoided by simply reading Glassdoor reviews.

Let me leave you with this - everyone who I know who has left this company is genuinely happier and relieved that they are no longer there."
122,Culture Trip,So much potential,2019-04-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits, competitive salaries, central London location. 
With $100m in funding, Culture Trip is without doubt the most exciting startup in the media and travel sectors in Europe. The potential is huge and the business model  shows great promise. Lots of work to improve management and benefits is paying off - slowly. The creativity of the editorial team has been unmatched. Lots of vision and lots of hope.","But will Culture Trip get there? Recent progress has been slow, really slow. And mistakes have been made. Senior hires - too many - have come and gone. And too much has been excused by the rough and tumble of start-up culture. When is the momentum going to pick up?"
123,Culture Trip,"I wrote a review titled ""Really Happy"" when I first started. After one year at CT I need to take it back",2019-04-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good office location, free (instant) coffee.","The glow of Culture Trip has well and truly worn off. I remember when I first started I looked at the website and thought - wow.. this looks like an out of date blog (but dismissed it and thought it would get better)  - it STILL looks like an out of date blog.

People are fired left right and centre.
There is no direction.
Staff morale is at 0.
There is ZERO work life balance. 
All these buzz words that fly around like diversity, women in senior roles, flexible hours, work life balance is non existent. They were all lies."
124,Culture Trip,Culture Trip is a blog run by an egotistical CEO who remains painfully out of touch,2019-03-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The ONLY thing I can possibly give credit to Culture Trip for is the introduction to some amazing people. The unshakable bond I formed with my colleagues must be similar to the bond soldiers form in the trenches of war because that is basically what working at Culture Trip is like. There are literally no other pros to working there.,"1. Kris Naudts is an underqualified maniac who seemingly woke up one morning and thought ""wouldn't it be a gas if I had my own media company?!"" Turning his niche blog into a content mill of listicle-ridden crap should be enough to tell you that this man is HARDLY a media mogul. 

2. Management does not care about its employees whatsoever. There are actually a lot of parallels to be drawn between Culture Trip and Theranos (the ill-fated company run by the equally maniacal CEO, Elizabeth Holmes). Like Theranos, Culture Trip has a tendency to hire top-of-their-field employees only to fire them the moment they begin to question the internal operations of the company. People who ask too many questions are considered 'non-believers' and ostracized by management for not drinking the kool-aid of Culture Trip, leading to their ultimate dismissal. In their place, springs up a slew of post-grad college kids with limited experience. 

3. The company has NO IDEA what it is doing. Culture Trip lacks originality and spent the first year post-funding seemingly copying INSIDER Travel and Buzzfeed in terms of content and social strategy (which did involve BUYING Instagram followers). Once the CEO realized he can't possibly reinvent the wheel against these major players, they fired half their editorial team and ""course corrected"" to an editorial strategy that is now a hodgepodge of disconnected stories. Culture Trip neither captures culture or makes any real contributions to the travel industry.  

4. Let's get to the important part: compensation. If the above is not enough to deter you from choosing a role at McDonald's over Culture Trip, then compensation surely will be. Employees are GROSSLY underpaid at this company. In fact, the New York office was AUDITED last year for paying their employees below the legal amount as outlined by the state. The company does NOT match 401 K contributions, has crappy health benefits, and basically operates on giving its employees the BARE MINIMUM. All of this happens while the CEO secures multi-million dollar investments that go toward his...office decor? Wherever that money is going, I can tell you this much: the website looks like the same amateur Wordpress site it's always looked like and employees are paid the same measly salaries they always have been."
125,Culture Trip,Not Recommend,2019-03-26,1.0,Sales,"Easy and unchallenging so if you're looking to collect  a low grade paycheck without a fuss, work here.","Easy and unchallenging. No room for growth or for opinions/points of view to be considered/heard. No Sales strategy of any kind to bring in revenue nor does the company seem in a hurry to put one in place. After years of trying to sort out what type of company (Tech, Media, Travel) they still have not figured it out. But the biggest con, is that management keeps a close eye on employee loyalty but does nothing to foster it and does nothing to grow the skills of their workers."
126,Culture Trip,Deeply broken,2019-03-21,2.0,Staff,"- Culture Trip recruits good people. There’s a lot of nice individuals here
- There’s a lot of talk about mental health, equality and inclusion.
- Free yoga and meditation sessions","The CEO’s former career was as a psychiatrist studying violent psychopaths. I think he’s used all of that experience to build culture Trip. Quoting from one of his papers: The neurobiology of psychopathy A focus on emotion processing.

- “arrogant and deceitful interpersonal behavior”: Culture trip lies routinely. It lies to investors about the source of traffic. It lies to staff about reasons staff disappear in the night, it lies to candidates about the reasons for the poor glass door reviews.
- “poor impulse control”: Culture trip doesn’t have a stable and clear strategy. Priorities change overnight back and forth. People are fired without much thought or planning.
- “callous/unemotional traits” Culture trip has a strong hire and fire HR policy. People disappear shortly before the end of their (long) probation period. They’re not fired though, they’re bullied into resigning. It feels like anyone who disagrees with the CEO ends up leaving or being fired so the managers are all yes-men implementing poorly thought out and damaging actions dictated by a micro manager.
- “more instrumental aggression” and “use aggressive behavior, as a tool or instrument, to achieve specific ends” I’ve seen people reduced to tears in meetings. Senior people. Reduced to tears.
- “preference for more risky decision making”: decisions are made seemingly without thought. Culture Trip spends millions on lavish video content without a real understanding of how it helps the travel business."
127,Culture Trip,Valuable experience on working at a toxic company for a toxic leader,2019-03-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pretty slides on the first week, portraying Culture Trip as a shiny object to its new employees ($100m funding, MUV, number of employees, creative content, founder ex. psychiatrist)

Some solid group of creative and passionate individuals who joined Culture Trip ready to contribute and add value.","It is never the chaotic nature of working at a startup, such as working crazy hours, scrambling through tight deadlines without any clear guidance or processes that makes the Culture Trip undesirable place to work.  People knew well beforehand about the level of volatility and scrappiness when they signed up to work at Culture Trip. So please do not make that as your petty little excuse for all the consistent poor reviews you’ve been getting.  Also when you hire folks from top companies, keep in mind that those people not only bring A+ experience and functional expertise but they also come with a high bar associated with company culture, integrity, equality+diversity and expectation for A+ leadership. So don’t try to BS with startup cliches and not being the right fit. The problem at Culture Trip is way beyond that. 

Shortly after two weeks, I started seeing many red signals all over the place. Within my first three months here, it became evident that this place was toxic and I was surrounded by some of the most severely toxic minded individuals. 

Here are some signs of toxic company/leader that I’ve keenly observed since the day 1 at Culture Trip.

CEO - I concur with numerous comments on the founder/CEO. At first, CEO came across as a mature (given his age) and credible person who are willing to listen and engage (his psychiatrist background also helps). However, just after a few weeks leading onto Culture Trip, you realize he is the master at sending obscure messages, manipulating individuals, and making people feel eventually worthless. There is zero sense of “we” anywhere to be found. CEO is full of arrogance and has notorious self pride but when I take a step back, I see nothing but an insecure leader who are just clueless.  

High turnover - as you see from reviews below, I can also confirm that unstable leadership is real. In the past 6 months, COO, CRO, CFO, and CHRO were gone. Only additional point on that is, pay extra close attention to the departure of CFO and CHRO and think about the implication behind that. Frequent departures don’t stop at the leadership level. I see people departing daily & weekly (in both forms of resignation and termination) across the organization. Ask yourself, is this really the scrappy nature of working at a healthy startup? 

Persistent disgruntlement -  this is a byproduct of having a toxic CEO that has successfully created the culture of fear across the every corner of the office. Employees are silent and passive. The fear culture of “am I next?” blocks ownership and engagement but leads to gossips and more sycophants. Again CEO has zero empathy for its people. Company recently went through a big layoff and CEO was nowhere to be found for the full week. What does that tell you? 

Lack of transparency - I strongly believe that people at Culture Trip is sensible enough to distinguish between confidentiality and transparency. Again, symptoms start at the top from the CEO. CEO is fixated on anti-sharing mindset. Think about this quote from Jack Dorsey “Ultimately, if you want people to make smart decisions, they need context and all available information. And certainly if you want people to make the same decisions you would make, but in a more scalable way, you have to give them the same information you have.”"
128,Culture Trip,Smoke and mirrors - complete car crash,2019-03-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- there are some nice & talented people - but they will probably leave soon
- salary is ok","Too many to list, but I will give it a try.

1. The company's 'success' is based on raising 100m  from 1 investor who has zero track record in this space (that should make you raise an eyebrow, why haven't VCs chipped in?) and on the fact that they have 'millions' of users. Traffic is however very reliant on paid social, and no-one is returning to the service.  Vanity metrics all around. No retention, no brand awareness, nothing. 
2. There is NO tech: the website looks like an amateur blog from 2007 and the app has no traction - because there is no strategy for it. Squads are not shipping anything, our velocity is close to zero.  Our search & recommendation team has no clue how to surface the right content for the right user. So it's completely random. 
3. On the content side - lots of legacy, click bait articles. Poor quality. No one really knows the purpose of why they are covering certain topics. Too much to fix and no link to the 'business model' - whatever that is.
4. We're reverse engineering the business model - trying to scramble for money wherever we can. Everything is a 'test' - because no one is confident about any product market fit. A simple question like ""why would someone book a hotel through Culture Trip"" can't be answered with 1 consistent point of view. 
5. The company is burning through so much money and the lack of leadership is so obvious that everyone is stressed out and people are getting let go on the fly. Those who are not stressed out just don't care about the company as they have given up on it.
6. For a company with the word Culture in its name, it's ironic to not have any company culture whatsoever. The office lacks a vibe, it's kitted out like an 80s corporate office, no one smiles and people don't hang out. It's dreadful. 
7. Change in 'leadership' is unbelievable - in the past 6 months alone our COO, CFO, and CRO  have been fired (and the CHRO left after 1 week or so, that's a bad sign in itself).
8. Finally, the founder is borderline megalomaniac - his 'vision' is to become both Airbnb and Disney. Well, there is a reason why this has not been done before.  I sometimes think this is all just a social experiment - given his background as academic psychiatrist that wouldn't be a surprise."
129,Culture Trip,A revolving door of hire and fire,2019-03-19,1.0,Staff,It is convenient for Selfridges.,"Many, many dismissals, often dressed up as resignations. 

Dismissed a manager last week and are spreading a total fabrication that he resigned due to sour grapes not getting a more senior role. When he tried to correct this lie, his comms were cut.

Similar story with another person - she was pushed into resigning knowing they were about to terminate her and her team.

Everyone has less that 2 years service so no need for redundancies, proper procedure or anything, it’s just straight out the door."
130,Culture Trip,"Toxic Leader (noun), See Also: CEO Culture Trip",2019-03-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,- They have no budgets so you get to spend money like you're making a 50 Cent rap video.,"Like everyone before me has written, most (if not all) of the glowing reviews from 2019/2018 are fake and CT pays people to write them. I asked about the negative reviews in my interview and the company told me, ""Oh, those are just disgruntled writers who weren't aligned with the company vision."" My gut was telling me that this was a lie, but the opportunity seemed so great that I ignored it. This has been my biggest career misstep to date. I wish I could BOLD this statement, highlight it, heck, pay to promote it (like CT does with their ""VERY HAPPY"" 5 star reviews.) 

Please please pay attention to the real reviews and do not let the exec team discredit them. 

- CEO is the most horrific and discriminatory leader (if you can even call him a leader) that I have ever encountered.  PERIOD.

CEO's ego is second to none and he treats all people like peeons regardless of their expertise and experience. He thinks he is a celebrity and refuses to join valuable meetings, interviews, and events, if he is not surrounded by Fortune 100 CEOs or other people he thinks are famous. He gets in arguments with press, his employees, partners, vendors, etc. The delusion is real and everyone in the company suffers from it.

CEO verbally berates and disparages his employees at every. single. turn. 

CEO treats women like second class citizens and has hired a boys club around him. Do not be fooled by the images of women on ""The Team"" page on their website. Truth is there is a small group of white men who run everything. BROs.

- There is literally no vision. The company pivots on every single day that ends in a ""y"" and my job changed multiple times during the course of my tenure. The company thinks that it will be ""the next Disney Company."" I laugh even writing that.

- The company threatens people with their commission, base salary, equity, etc. They  demote people with no reason and half the pay.

- Culture of backstabbing and job insecurity: People attempt to do their jobs, ""ask the wrong questions,"" and get put on a ""black list"" because they ""know too much."" If you file an HR complaint, the legal team will bury it and set you on a course to termination. 

- So many shady dealings about data, traffic, financials. They lie to everyone, even to internal employees.

- Healthcare and benefits are AWFUL. 

- Execs validate inappropriate behavior, mismanagement, and lack of vision to ""oh, we're just  a startup."" No bro, it's not us, it's you.

- Oh, and some Glassdoor reviews say that Culture Trip has fruit, but I've never seen it."

132,Culture Trip,Tips to spot the fake reviews and make an informed decision,2019-03-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"At mid-level management, there are some terrific people that come with a lot of skill from prior jobs and have a desire to train and development their teams. If they stay.

You can work from home 1 day per week.","The CEO. He controls all decisions but is slow to make them, and frequently changes directions. He has the swagger of a CEO of a company that has made it, but we still need a scrappy startup leader that can get their hands dirty

Frequent leadership departures. In less than a few months, our COO, CRO, CFO, and CHRO were gone abruptly

Lack of communication and sharing. Nobody knows our business results or progress on key priorities

Lack of women in core leadership roles

Lack of professional development. HR rolled out a training, but senior leadership did not support

Content for a long time was quantity over quality so talented editors focus on cleaning up mess

-----

So you can make an informed decision in the hiring process, consider these questions to identify the cracks. Based on those answers, decide if the glowing reviews here are as fake as many of us employees claim. 

Ask about how Glassdoor reviews have impacted the company. Has it been buried or led to positive change? 

Ask how the CEO talks about diversity. Does he value diversity of thought or just want to change the optic 'when a bunch of white men stand up front' 

Ask the CEO's philosophy on transparency and sharing

Ask how long the Chief People Officer lasted before resigning"

I have a visionary, supportive and energetic boss, and I'm given space and resources to define the direction that matches the vision.

137,Culture Trip,Culture Trap,2018-11-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Who doesn't want to work in travel and help people discover different cultures around the world? 

At face value, it's a dream company. In reality, it's far from it.

Genuine pros include: working from home days, some brilliant creative and kind colleagues, yoga. People always seem impressed by the brand name.","At our peak, editors were publishing a ridiculous amount of articles per month in the pursuit of volume (and in defiance of logic). In my opinion, this was incredibly stressful and frankly unethical. For a company that places so much emphasis on 'the importance of mental health', they think hiring a yoga teacher makes up for the huge strain they put people under.

And for anyone who says ""You can't handle start-up culture"", send me a few good reasons why a company with hundreds of employees in Oxford Circus is still considered a start-up? It's not a matter of chipping in to help the small ship - it's literally pushing people to their utmost limits because Culture Trip think they can get away with it. Give them an inch and they will milk you dry.

In my opinion, the company uses far too many spreadsheets and is far too reliant on data to dictate content direction. If you're looking for an creative editorial job, steer well clear - you may feel like you're a cog in a machine. Everything seems like it's dictated by numbers, including the creative and ideation process. Welcome to Culture Trip, the dystopian future of digital innovation, where even a journalist is automated.

Management seem to expect 5 star editorial but are frustratingly reluctant to invest in this side of the business. There's a philosophy of scarcity - do as much as possible for as little as possible.

Massive obsession with hierarchy, which stunts contribution and creativity. Managers have been known to take the credit for their 'subordinates'' work. Yes - this is an actual term I've heard used to describe people. A cult of power exists which is completely alienating.

There are some wonderfully creative, passionate people at this company who simply aren't being cultivated. Little to no room for progression or development when every week a handful of new people join. 

It feels like a very toxic work culture. Not the friendliest place. Sit down at lunch and watch as people drift onto separate tables. Walk down a hallway and notice how people just ignore you point blank. It says it all."

- Failure to appreciate employees skill sets. 
 ( NY office is London's pet. London tells NY what to do instead of creating an environment for an open discussion. There is a lack of communication overall, and lack of will to listen) 
- People in management often have less experience than their employees. This directly reflects the company's questionable priorities, goals and direction. 
- Restructuring / re-strategizing every 6 months. 
(Sure, the direction of startups can change often but not like this. There's constant firing and hiring all the time.) 
- Tunnel visioning 
For a startup company of this size, you'd imagine they can multi task. The answer's no. Whenever there's a new project that comes up, everyone needs to stop whatever project their working on and just solely focus on that one the company wants.
- You can make a suggestion but it will take a year for it to be considered. It will only be considered once someone in London office brings it up.  
- you are panelized for taking an initiative, and penalized for not taking an initiative.

141,Culture Trip,A content mill you won't want on your CV,2018-09-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- There are some very talented people stuck there, if you can seek them out you may make contacts worth keeping.","- Culture Trip is a vacuous pit where creativity goes to die. Some of the company's most impressive acts of innovation can be found in the falsified reviews right here on this page. 

- Culture Trip was built on the brittle foundations of fast, cheap, poor quality content, and despite recent efforts to address the terrible standard of articles on the site, can't quite pull itself away from the promise of a quick and easy page view or a vaguely racist interaction on Facebook. There are thousands upon thousands of awful articles on the site, a fact acknowledged on a daily basis by management. Yet rather than slowing down production and improving quality, the substandard stories keep on flowing, submerging any acts of decent journalism in a tidal wave of mediocrity. 

- Culture Trip employees who have stood up and asked for adherence to the most basic standards of journalism have quickly been added to the 'non-believers' list, and pushed out.

- Most of the stories on the site are shallow to the point of being translucent, and far from exploring and celebrating culture, they poke fun, otherise, and stomp all over the non-western world with the full force of a colonising empire. This is the British stag-do of cultural appreciation, staining the name of journalism like vomit on a war memorial. 

- The most recent attempt to cure the many ills of the company has been to give the marketing department huge power and budget. Unsurprisingly this has led to a campaign to paper of the canyon-sized cracks and present a glossy outward sheen to the rest of the world, all while the employees enjoy poor wages, asphyxiating work conditions, condescending, impatient management, and more. 

- Culture Trip also identifies as a technology company, despite its level of technical expertise being on a similar level to a bad '90s teen movie about hacking."

- If senior management doesn't like you, they'll let you know it. If they don't insult you with enough random requests that you quit, eventually they'll just fire you and say you ""weren't a good fit.""
- While I was not fired, the company DID post a job description for a role that essentially mirrored mine.
- Stellar, well-documented reviews of your work mean nothing. What matters is whether the inner circle likes you.
- I was in a pseudo-managerial role: I had the title of manager, did all of the hard work of a manager, but my insights about processes and decisions concerning my team mostly went ignored.
- In my 2 years at Culture Trip, I had 3 different managers. All of them were white men. None of them were as educated as myself.
- Only 1 of my managers was more EXPERIENCED than myself. I enjoyed learning under his tutelage. He was fired abruptly after a few months.
- There's a diversity problem in the NY office: I was the only black person, which led to some pretty uncomfortable exchanges with a few of the all white senior management.
- When posing for a photo at a company event, the CRO reached towards my hair and called it ""kinky.""
- In a meeting about changing the desk configuration (something wholly outside of my job description -- I was an editorial manager) the CEO balled up post-its and threw them at me in front of my colleague.
- The next day, when I told the CEO the above interaction made me uncomfortable, he said I needed ""thicker skin"" then proceeded to reach out to members of my team to ask them if they were interested in my role."

The CEO continues to make claims that page views and impressions aren't based on social media (particularly Facebook) when that is a blatant lie because many posts were significantly boosted online to skew numbers/views.

- Abusive and hostile behaviour in senior meetings (as an attempt to bully junior employees)
- Unhygienic and unsafe working environment (a limited amount of toilets and exposed wiring, for example)
- The company encourages its employees to be 'frugal' (one of the moral codes set by the CEO) this term is a huge reflection of the care and respect that the company has for prospective clients and it's own workers.
- Severely underpaid freelancers (refer back to frugality)
- Overt favouritism which was made evident by the mass redundancies made in both the London and New York offices

All I can describe is what I see here and now and again there are many things that need to worked on. There is a great deal of raw potential and the right intent to build the company for both those who run it and those who work there. Whilst you can't ignore the journey you can at least appreciate where they are going.

A move to a bigger office in April and better facilities, plus working on better benefits for the staff show that positive change is happening.

163,Culture Trip,Cons Heavily Outweigh the Pros,2018-02-07,1.0,,"- Employees receive one work from home day per week
- Relatively flexible office hours","- Poor benefits, limited vacation time, limited sick time, limited parental leave, poor 401K plan with ZERO company contributions, poor salaries

- Lack of clear direction in the overall company makes for frequent turnover, firings and unpredictable changes. In short, Culture Trip wants to be everything and anything (a high brow travel publication, a local city guide, a video creator, a tech company, a Buzzfeed, a tour agency, a Trip Advisor, etc). Rather than perfecting any one goal, the company spreads itself thin over trying to be everything at once, which makes it VERY difficult for employees to stay on top of their ever changing job roles. 

- Terrible lack of communication between the NYC and London offices, and between management and their employees. Employees are often an afterthought to the whims of management. The company seems to care more about giving the appearance of success and expansion rather than cultivating a positive work atmosphere, retaining their current employees and succeeding at any one thing. 

- With a primarily all male management team, it seems hard for women in the company to rise up or be taken seriously. There were multiple instances of inappropriate remarks from management towards female members of staff during my time at the company."
164,Culture Trip,A Poor Excuse for a Business,2018-01-24,1.0,Editor,"- I met some incredibly smart and intelligent people here. However, they usually get made 'redundant' or made to feel so uncomfortable that they resign themselves.","Where do I begin?! 

- Staff are paid so poorly for their hard work and commitment to this 'startup'. 
- Hours are long and zero benefits exist.
- No HR structures, holiday pay or real contracts are offered.
- Massive exploitation of unpaid labour, which effectively bankroll the business into operating. 
- Nobody values your opinion, expertise or output. 
- Content on the site is based on internet research. Writers usually have no real experience of what they're writing about.
- Managers feel the need to write the FAKE reviews on here - disregarding and taking zero accountability of what past and current employees are actually saying.

Avoid working for this place at all costs."
165,Culture Trip,Insular & Injudicious,2018-01-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- I was able to negotiate a good salary, due to my experience and expertise, alongside their series A funding and revenue forecasts
- I gained a huge amount of experience in 6 months, this included conflict management, maintaining professionalism in an inexperienced environment,  adapting to frequent strategy reversals and upholding a work life balance.","- Culture Trip was the most hostile work environment I have ever experienced; new starters were treated with suspicion from existing co-workers and the induction period was woefully inadequate. Aside from the promise of 2 extra-curricular books, favourites of the CEO which rarely materialised, new starters were advised that it was not customary to take a lunch break and that was deemed sufficient welcome.
- The office itself was dirty, inadequately furnished, over-crowded and unsafe – I am aware of at least 2 electrical sparks caused by multiple extension cables overloading singular outlets and overheating.
- Established members of the Senior Management Team, whilst evidently passionate/indoctrinated, were unwilling to accept or give respect to externally gained sector relevant and channel specific expertise
- During my time at Culture Trip, I was harassed in internal meetings and bullied into over forecasting, my personality and aptitude was repeatedly attacked, and I was made to feel increasingly uncomfortable in the presence of the company Directors
- Following my resignation, it was implied to remaining employees that I had been made redundant and I have since become aware of continued aspersions being cast on my ability, contribution and success whilst at Culture Trip."

The office- disgusting. Not only is there a line for women to use one bathroom, the fridges rot of expired food, undone dishes & a lack of forks. Everyone has to share a desk, so we're all scrunched up like sardines. Their excuse for all of this- we're a start up. How is a company that's been in business for 6 years a start up? 

Upper Management- Misogynistic, racist & enablers in creating a highly politicised work environment. I'm not going to pinpoint specific instances because I probably can't do so on a public forum. But the things I've seen & heard are borderline disturbing, and shocking at a company that seems to pride themselves on ""celebrating difference"". 

Employees- Undervalued & micromanaged. Most ""Managers"" are grossly inexperienced. The fact that the previous ""positive"" review on here compared employees to uber drivers speaks for itself. 

Content: Quantity over quality. Editors are scored based on the number of page views they get, making the whole thing really click-baitey. Articles aren't thoroughly sub-edited and users notice it (incorrect spelling, lack of thorough fact checking). Just look at the facebook comments!

The management team are belligerent, duplicitous, inexperienced and ignorant. They preside over a culture of fear in a woefully (in fact in many cases, illegally) inadequate working environment that's filthy, cramped and unsafe. 

The company is fractured and combative, with departments refusing to work with others in a constant battle fuelled by nonsensical KPIs that offer no incentive to collaborate and in most cases are far beyond the reaches of reality.

Pay is also awful, and there's no benefits to back it up. Don't believe what you're told when you're offered the job, those soon-to-launch benefits are never happening.

There's a lot of work being done now on the brand and also on company culture, which is exciting and probably about time for a company of this size. They've been seeking out all the staffers opinions. 
The vibe is pretty chill, average age maybe 26 years old, and a lot of seriously creative people (including illustrators, videographers, photographers). It does feel like a good home for creatives.

Good staff and some managers are decent people, although I'll get onto that later. Some people are good at their jobs, like the Tel Aviv tech team and a few people from the UK and US office.","There is quite clearly a distrust of the workers from the CEO and he tries to squeeze as much as he can from everyone here for as little in return. This is evident from him giving the staff no benefits, no pension contribution (they are leaving this until the last minute they can legally get away with it), poor salaries for 90% of staff, cramming as many people as possible into a small office where everyone (apart from the CEO) has to share a desk. When WFH, you need to log it and you can only do so on certain days.

There is no effort to make the place a better working environment, and instead of addressing these issues in the office or on Glassdoor, some members of the senior management team are writing obvious fake positive reviews here. Any social activities are paid for by the employees, apart from the xmas party, as the company would rather  hire another team member to make the company look like it's growing than make the current workers happier.

Because a lot of the staff are underpaid and in their first real jobs from uni, they have ""manager"" in their titles. This gives some an inflated ego and can be difficult to work with, and they make a lot of mistakes in their work. 

I find the office sexist in subtle and not so subtle ways. Despite the office being 60-70% female, there is only one toilet cubicle, SMT is mostly male, women are constantly referred to as ""girls"" despite none being under 18, women are hired into low pay roles because some males in the SMT think they look nice."

- People think it's a cool job (it's not)","- Long hours: 9am-6:30pm and start at 8:30am on Monday with only half an hour lunch break. There are of course many jobs with hours just as long as this or longer, but their pay reflects this (see next point)
- Low pay: £16850, which amounts to minimum wage when doing a 48 hour week. On this wage you feel massively undervalued, especially as the job description specifically looks for high-calibre graduates with 'intellectual gravitas'
- The poor hours and poor wage are not made up for by a management team who are grateful for the hours and effort you put in for minimum award – your hard work is taken for granted rather than praised. For example, during my 6+ month time there, I was never once allowed to leave early, and my manager never took us out for drinks. The CEO told us that he did not think that thanking employees was necessary.
- You have to bring your own laptop in
- The office environment is poor. There isn't enough space. There is also no basic office stationary such as pens, notepads, or even a printer that works (and when it is working there's no ink!)
- Most of The Culture Trip's writers are unpaid. This means that you can never expect quality writing. This is incredibly dissatisfying and often embarrassing to work with.
- Quantity is certainly far more valued than quality. Articles of absolutely no substance (for example, random photographs of Paris taken from Wikicommons) are published simply to get the numbers up.
- Those responsible for editing articles are massively underpaid. So unsurprisingly, errors frequently slip in.
- The Culture Trip shamelessly employs unpaid interns, which I'm fairly certain is illegal. At some points during my time there, more than half the office were unpaid interns.
- Obviously with that number of interns, most do not get offered a full-time job at the end. They are simply taken advantage for the free labour they provide.
- If you have a sick day you are asked to fill in a form on your return describing your symptoms. This feels massively intrusive and untrusting. 
- The management team are inexperienced, which probably explains why moral is so low. Meetings end up going on for ages because no one takes control. There is also a very limited amount you can learn from them.
- No prospect of a pay rise or a promotion (this is specifically stated on the contract). It feels like this is done in order to keep you working ridiculous hours for a ridiculous low wage for as long as possible.
- The inexperience of the management was also shown when I gave my notice. They seemed surprised that I wanted to leave, despite all of the above. Instead of accepting this in a mature and professional way, they were incredibly awkward about it, and tried to bully me into staying. No one in the management team even said goodbye to me on my final day."
205,Culture Trip,The worst job I've ever had.,2016-05-16,1.0,Editorial,"They somehow manage to hire over-qualified people who can be lovely to work with and who bond over daily frustrations of working here. If you have no experience or clips to your name and are looking for someone to publish you, it might be worth working here temporarily. You can occasionally write about something or someone of interest rather than dry formulaic 'top 10s.' Some articles/subject matter are interesting to read, though it's difficult to find them within all the junk. If you live in a place with a very low cost of living, you may be able to survive off the salary.","-Complete lack of editorial standards-- Management has little to no editorial experience, and has no idea what typical editorial practices and ethics are. 
-Content mill that is trying to lift information from other sources and capitalizes on young people who want to break into journalism--the vast majority of content comes from unpaid ""interns"" many of whom work full-time for months at a time, which I believe is illegal in the UK, where the company is headquartered. 
-Lack of technological know-how. This is a media startup that lacks an understanding of media practices, an innovative technological product and a plan for monetizing page views. 
-Complete lack of transparency--tiny team of upper management does not communicate to staff any information, including company vision e.g. What is the Culture Trip? What is the product we are trying to create/sell? No information about funding or funders. 
-Impressive candidates are sometimes lured in with false promises of raises, advancement, perks, etc. 
-No offices--they say they have ""hubs"" all over the world, but employees work from cafes using their own equipment. 
-Strange passive-aggressive culture passed down from management--pervasive in emails, phone calls, etc and makes for an unpleasant digital work environment. 
-Unrealistic goal setting from management (# of articles, social media followers, etc.) coupled with unbridled micro-managing creates an untenable work environment for any sane employees. 
-Incredibly high turn-over rate--The majority quits, many are fired. There is zero job security and no opportunity for advancement within company. Those who do try to excel quickly burn out trying to reach unrealistic goals."
206,Culture Trip,"Love, poverty, and war",2016-05-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"– Get to work in a start-up with real responsibilities. 
– You are ultimately in charge of your own output, for better or for worse.
– Type of work usually unavailable to recent grads.
– Company (most likely) has a bright future.","– Hours are grueling, pay is minimal.
– At this pay, many coworkers are inexperienced – some barely qualified (writing quality being the first casualty).
– Management inexperienced as well, which leads to communication problems; the recent restructuring (as a result of spectacular growth) was poorly handled."

208,Culture Trip,Unscrupulous Management from Hell,2016-05-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"the only pro was being able to write interesting articles, but that really is something you can do anywhere in any company and this place did nothing to encourage or further our writing talents","Absolute monstrosity of a company to work at, have no respect for their staff who built the company and landed them funding. They swiftly proceeded to demote every single person on staff because of whom they landed the funding deal. Make you work overtime without pay, constantly upping work pressure, no incentives, no budgets for anything except coffee!! They have zero respect for people or culture, despite what they say. They are led by a very manipulative management who will say anything to keep you interested in the job, will promise promotions and what not, only to then dish out a termination notice to all staff across their several global offices. Do not accept their job offers because they will lead you on to nowhere. I left a great job to take this on , help this company get funding and be shown the door, as did my colleagues across the world.  They will not succeed as a company because they are terrible people which you can easily tell from the turnover rate. The writing is terrible and they are very ok with it  - a company whose core proposition is writing, does not care about it's writing because they want to make money anyhow."

-Looks great on CV
-Lovely colleagues and camaraderie due to management","Where to begin?

-constant turnover due to terrible management- like a revolving door
-unrealistic expectations based on pure speculation (and embellishment of website performance)
-no transparency- new projects/methods/people brought in with no explanation, and often thrown out as quickly
-terrible work environment- before they got the office employees were made to essentially squat in hotels, using free wifi and often getting in trouble for not buying enough, though management refused to pay for coffees, etc. No place to eat our lunch- either had to spend money to buy somewhere, or eat out in the cold even in the rain
-extremely poor pay, and employees made to register as self-employed without any of the benefits of actual self-employment
-job descriptions were untrue- some colleagues were hired as editors and were turned into statisticians without consultation
-complete micro-management
-management completely inexperienced
-unwilling to listen to staff feedback despite people leaving all the time
-tried to force people to work on weekends at short notice, despite not even paying most people minimum wage
-rely on unpaid staff for the majority of the work- this leads to very little quality control, to the point that the website can become an embarrassment
-made to use our own computers without being informed beforehand
