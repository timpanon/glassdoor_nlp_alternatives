0,DAZN,Avoid if you are an ambitious PM,2022-04-07,1.0,Product Manager,"- Genuinely nice people in product and engineering who build things with a smile

- Good place if you see your future in an old school broadcasting company or in the betting industry","- ""Fast moving"", ""constantly changing"", ""not for everyone"", ""thrives on chaos"" are just duct tape phrases to gloss over a fickle-minded leadership that has made 4 x CEO changes and 3 x reorgs in 2 years

- PMs are just project managers who are supposed to deliver a top-down roadmap created at the whims of the marketing and rights teams. It is demotivating and kills your spirit

- DAZN had an inspirational product leadership from Amazon and BBC in 2018. Now it's full of mediocre managers from assorted Israeli and British betting companies with lacklustre pasts

- Do not join if you aim to work for Google or Facebook one day. All you will do here is deliver projects and not do any actual product management and that will reflect in your CV"

It seemed they often changed their minds on how the business would run which resulted in team layoffs even prior to covid. As covid started it only got worse, long furloughs turned to mass layoffs, and of course management told us after the big layoff, no more were to come. Fast forward to a few months later after being told diversity is the new goal, women will stand out more, more culture will be brought in, boom another round of layoffs.

144,DAZN,By far the worst company I have ever worked with. Avoid it like the plague.,2020-12-11,1.0,Senior Backend Developer,The tech stack is good and you have a lot of opportunity to learn.,"It is plain chaos. 

People argue and shout at each other in the office. Sometimes you can hear them screaming from across the office arguing or saying borderline racist and sexist remarks to each other.

You have teams where very few people do work while the rest slack off all day. These people even have the nerve to say that they are not doing anything during stand-ups! 

Some colleagues working there for months did not write a single line of code! And some of them took it a step further and sold their story and got promoted to senior positions! Talk about meritocracy.

External contractors do not care about the product but they were given by management the power to have the final say in the architectural design of solutions. This meant that the in-house teams that disagreed with the decision were forced to shut up and swallow the pill even though they knew that in the end, those decisions would cost them in the future. The whole ""You build it you own it"" mantra that is said daily is an outright lie. 

The hiring process is broken as well. A few candidates might not be hired at the company depending on their nationality. Additionally, you get surprised by a new contract saying that you need to be “on-call” rotation every few weeks after you actually get hired.

I do not know where to begin regarding the development process. It is totally disorganized. There are other reviews here that describe the chaotic scene perfectly."

148,DAZN,Great,2020-12-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,A great team of people,I haven’t spent much time with my colleagues because of COVID
149,DAZN,"Shiny veneer hides chaos, miserliness and rank nepotism",2020-12-02,1.0,Production,"DAZN as a product is theoretically an amazing idea, and for all the company’s faults you can’t argue that being involved with something like this project is quite exciting. I personally worked on many projects that were professionally highly satisfying and I met some good friends at the company.

Like most production environments, there was a laid back atmosphere. You could get away with watching TV all day while you worked, with the nonsensical justification of it being important to your job. There was no dress code whatsoever.

The shambolic, siloed organisation structures and general refusal to spend more than the bare minimum allowed enthusiastic junior employees opportunities beyond their expectations and experience level.

Management often worked from home (pre-pandemic) or were sat glued to their desks in another room, meaning you had long periods without seeing them, allowing you ample down time.","The worst place I have ever worked for 'jobs for the boys.' I got the impression that a small cabal of friends ran the show and gave one another promotions whilst they car-shared. 

Some dreadfully under-skilled people had quite important positions. Some were very lucky they had friends in high places and that many of the more junior production staff had the professional integrity to put right their manager's ineptitude. I had the ongoing impression that the place was fuelled by secrecy and rampant cronyism.

Underpowered, old equipment that crashed on an hourly basis. No access to replacement peripherals such as a mouse or keyboard and a totally useless technical support team. I personally once asked for a replacement HDMI cable and was told the company doesn't have them. This was a television production department - which says a lot. 

Extreme frugality with pay, total refusal to offer worthwhile overtime rates and never once did anybody in production, to my knowledge, receive any form of bonus. The argument was often made that working in sports broadcasting was reward enough.

The management were wilfully opaque with revealing salaries - and would often ask employees to keep quiet about earnings, I assume to avoid mass protests such was the disparity between workers. They introduced a system of ""career levels"" to counteract this murkiness, but it had no bearing on pay whatsoever and so proved to be absurdly trivial. 

Yearly staff surveys seemed more an exercise in mutual onanism for the Senior Management team. Recalcitrant employees were constantly hounded to take part in them on the basis things would improve, yet when results showed obvious areas of concern, they were seldom fixed properly, if at all. 

As with many large companies, bureaucracy was omnipresent. Almost any action to move a project forward had to be accompanied by filling in a form and having it authorised by five dimwits before you could move forward. Stunk of self-preservation for middle management who had nothing else to do.

For a company that had access to worldwide sports rights, they point blank refused to allow employees any access to the sport, whether that was free tickets to events or discounted TV subscriptions. - unlike any other broadcaster I am aware of. If this was a tiny production company, I could understand but the hypothetical argument that it was too expensive is completely futile when you consider the lavish fees spent on an office in Manhattan, large Christmas parties (that everyone thought were rubbish) and the type of cars driven by senior staff.

My biggest gripe was the general ineffectualness of the bloated middle-management. The obsession with career progression and pleasing the bosses among the lickspittle production management team meant that they showed minimal empathy or understanding to the more junior staff, who were almost always those who actually created something tangible. They usually seemed more interested in briefing against others and getting a better grip on the greasy ladder of career ambition than making worthwhile changes. If you were skilled at ego-stroking it was very likely you would be a good fit.

Obviously there are exceptions to the foolish or selfish people I have referenced, and it was largely on the back of the extreme goodwill of the well-intentioned, professional (and almost certainly underpaid/overworked) staff members that DAZN continued to operate."

Pay is significantly below the market rate (~25%), and pay increases and bonuses are either non-existent or minimal unless you’re in the inner circle of senior leaders. Benefits are poor. DAZN didn’t top up its employees’ salaries during the furlough scheme, despite its owner being one of the wealthiest men in Britain. 
Sometimes corners are cut and processes are rushed to get things done. A senior manager informed me that he believed it set a bad example for younger staff, however I understand it’s necessary at times for such a fast-paced company.
DAZN is intent on aggressively pushing and contributing significant amounts of time and money to tokenistic D&I initiatives. These are devoid of any legitimate justification or objectives beyond “positive discrimination” and quotas, which are predicated on unfounded assumptions that any diversity imbalances amongst employees are the result of discrimination."

This results in a fast paced environment where decisions are quickly made.","The flip side of ambition is that there is zero emphasis put on true culture building. The corporate culture and D&I strategy feels like nothing more than a PR move. The biggest issue I found at DAZN is that leadership is very cold, unapproachable, and single minded. Leaders are also pretty much all elitist white men who sit in their glass offices and don’t make eye contact when walking through the halls. If you’re not working on a team that is of utmost importance to leadership, you’ll face two problems: 1) leaders will never recognize you or your work amongst the staff and 2) other teams will assume you are unimportant.
It’s a sterile, cold environment with executives who are more excited to talk to the media and outside world than they are to connect on a personal level with the worker bees that do the hard day to day work that keeps things running.

Also seems there is little alignment between business units and often feels like different leaders want to achieve different things every few months. This creates a push and pull effect that is very apparent to staff and also serves to frustrate and confuse teams who work all day and night on something only to have their project suddenly deprioritized."

These people are unwilling to change anything substantial and they actively block people that bring in better ways of doing things. Politics and incompetence are the main elements powering this top heavy corporate management group.

New people join DAZN and bring a lot of energy to do things well, but face severe resistance to change and they eventually leave having become exhausted. Usually from giving so much and getting back very little. Usually within 12 months or less. Attrition is exceedingly high in this company. 

DAZN is suffering a lot with the loss of sport but in the typical fashion of mediocre companies it’s handling it poorly.

They hire and promote based on loyalty and how your relationship is with the senior boys, which puts very incompetent people in senior roles. For a company with an ambition to be a reputable global company, they need to stop running around and telling people what to do and put right personnel in place and enough ownership to make judgements. Depending on old british guys in London to make every call with their gut is no way to run a global business.

- Nice office location and general layout.
- Management has started to catch on and is now attempting to fix some of the issues raised.
- Diverse teams","I ended up writing a lot, so here's a quick summary for those just wondering if DAZN Amsterdam is a place you want to work:
It's been in a disorganised state since the beginning of 2019, with a lot of change and not a lot of management.
However, there are new initiatives taking place across the office and company that _should_ resolve these issues in the coming months.

Things are looking up in the long term, but if you join right now you'll still find people in jaded by the (very real) problems of the past 12 months and you can expect quite a few headaches.

Onward with the essay, which is roughly broken into 4 topics:
- Poor Management
- Amsterdam is a second rate office in the company
- Built for investors
- Too many voices, not enough direction.


-- Poor Management --
This could be a huge topic in itself and is mainly born from an over-accelerated growth in workers with no corresponding scaling of the management population or pre-emptive structure being put in place to deal with such a large amount of workers.

- Too many projects come in with ""high priority"", but then fizzle out
From somewhere up the chain there seems a lack of forward planning: projects to meet ""legal obligations"" are only started 2 months before they're due, but then after stress working and many meetings explaining ""it's too much work to complete and you didn't give us much time, we have to delay"", it eventually becomes a non-issue, the project is binned and another ""high priority"" project comes along.

- No procedures, no responsibility
A lack of procedures means that no one is held accountable on any levels. This leads to or exaggerates many of the problems listed elsewhere.
This goes from ""required cloud infrastructure since abandoned by those that created it"" to issues acquiring the hardware required:
- by people with health issues or limitations
- to implement mandated system monitoring
- to comply with legal office requirements
- to correct wrong assumptions in how people make use of an office space

While there may be arguments that ""there's a procedure"", a procedure that takes 3 months for a simple request, requires weekly follow up to get progress and that has seemingly arbitrary success rate is no procedure at all.

- Over-reliance on idealisms and attempts at ""gaslighting""
I hate to use oft overused and exaggerated terms like ""gaslighting"", but it has to be said that many criticisms on lack of procedure or requests for guidance on ""how can I get this done within the frameworks of the current company?"" are met with standard phrases like ""You build it, you own it!"" or ""You, the developers, have full control"".
We don't.
There's been numerous occasions where, especially closing in on a deadline, some other team pops up with a ""you can't do it that way"", ""the system doesn't work like that"" or ""You're required to also do X, else we can't let it go live"". These are things we should know about in advance. That's what we mean when we ask ""how should this be done?"". 

Frustrations at poorly planned projects, constant team switches and strategy pivots are met with ""that's what it means to be agile"" and ""we're just responding to shifts in the market"", when really it's indicative of a lack of foresight and no real dedication/commitment from management.

- Seemingly inexperienced management
I'm sure if I look through LinkedIn I'll find very ""impressive"" résumés detailing their many years of experience, but it feels like no one in management has ever dealt with a blitz scaling company. Because of this it appears no-one at any level was prepared for the many challenges that would come from such an aggressive scale-up.
Change management in a large, established company is very different to managing scaling from 15 to 150 in one year.
No one seems properly prepared for any of the issues that everyone is facing and no one seems to know who can resolve any particular issue.

-- Amsterdam is a second rate office in the company -- 
The company started out of the Hammersmith office and it's very obvious that all decisions are made out of that office and they're not keen to relinquish any of that power.

- All architecture, product and ""heads of"" are based out of London
As mentioned in an earlier review, all architecture is based in London and there is very little input from the team until someone from London appears one day to ""present"" the design, then they get sent back with a list of things that are wrong, can't be done or should be changed. There's no developer feedback until this presentation and product seems to calculate timelines as if the architecture will be perfect the first time.
There is seemingly no power to create and implement product or service ideas within Amsterdam: All specifications and designs are drawn up in London, then punted across the channel to be implemented in Amsterdam. As mentioned above, architecture team is in London, but so are all the product and project heads, meaning ideas and concepts are batted around and finalised before Amsterdam hears about it.

There are new initiatives to include the Amsterdam developers earlier in the idea/conception stages, which help with some of the above problems, but the fact remains that most decisions must go through London, from ""We need to change the API of our microservice"" to ""Did you really mean for these UI conflicts?"".

- Product, management and other steering group members makes a big deal about ""coming to visit Amsterdam""
Because they're not based in Amsterdam, they all like to make a big deal of ""I'll be in Amsterdam next week to discuss X!"" and we're then pressured into consolidating all our issues, concerns and feedback into bite sized chunks that can be established, discussed and resolved in short periods of time.
The fact is, they're _visiting_ Amsterdam, meaning that 80% of the team they're _not_ in Amsterdam or thinking about our issues.



-- Built for investors --
Looking at the key figures, ""what we achieved"" posts and targets shared from the company, it paints a picture of a company built to sell well to investors, moreso that any other company objective.
Goals such as ""have X many subscribers"" and ""be live in N countries"" seem generic, but when coupled with their aggressive hiring and office opening it paints the picture of a company trying to blitzscale in hopes of quoting ""we went from 0 to N million in just 3 years!"" to prospective investors as they launch their IPO.
It feels a bit like a bubble that's got to burst at some point: the cash spent on hiring and licenses must dry up at some point. Currently it's only sustained through large cash injections from initial investors.
That said, I'm no investor and ""blitzscaled new tech company that isn't profitable for the first 5 years"" seems to be the standard these days (Uber et al), so maybe it will all be fine in the long run. I just expect the huge cash flows and lack of financial controls besides ""get someone who seems important to approve it"" will subside. After that they'll have to clamp down hard to try and stop the capital haemorrhage so they can stabilise their balance books.



-- Too many voices, not enough direction --
Diversity is a great thing. People from a variety of backgrounds and experiences bring new perspectives. The problem is too many voices and ideas with no solid guidance, leading to endless discussion and ""but what if"". 
Stop me if you've heard this one before: you're in a meeting and a simple idea is raised that ""will help make things better"". 
Someone raises the point that they think it will help. Someone counters that ""this one time it didn't help"". 
Someone else then suggests this alternative thing that they prefer. They give reasons, but it's pretty obvious it's mostly personal preference. 
This interaction continues for an hour, with a bunch of ideas being thrown around.
At the end of meeting (because they've run out of time) everyone gets up and walks out. 
No actions have been noted, no decision was made and everyone is just a bit more anxious that ""their idea wasn't properly heard"" and that ""those other people will make the wrong decision"" (whoever ""those other people"" is).



-- Conclusion --
Many of these problems have been communicated and are being worked on. In my opinion most of these issues will be resolved as the company and office matures, but I would predict that to be 1-2 years off, with a further prediction that if they decide to IPO (likely given the strategies seen) it will delay the resolution to maybe 3 years.
It's not as bad as it was for some of the previous reviews and there's definitely light at the end of the tunnel, but there's still a lot of issues that need to be resolved before I would consider ranking this place against any of my previous positions."

213,DAZN,The worst experience of my 15-year career - avoid this toxic nightmare,2019-09-20,1.0,Business Analyst,Some very gifted and personable co-workers,"The engineering team management had never previously worked in such a role and it showed. They were mere tourists in our Amsterdam office. Terrible decisions were made around the staff they hired - leading to numerous problematic characters being tolerated, and a refusal to take serious action to stop them disrupting the work environment for the truly nice members of staff. 

During my time I experienced outright aggression and violent words towards members of my team, female members of staff suffering sexual abuse, meetings forever elongated by confrontational and argumentative individuals, and entire teams who were finally forced to undergo behaviour training to ensure they treated each other with respect. When I flagged this to HR, I was ignored, and engineering management tried to gaslight me by blaming the nice developers in my team, and claiming it was they who were the problem.  They were a mess in terms of organisation. As one of my London colleagues told me, they considered visiting management to have the attitude of a ''Little Mussolini'' and that their function in the office was nothing more than to ''arrive, create chaos, and leave''.

One such instance of chaos was reorganising scrum teams a day before a new sprint was due to start, with nobody made aware of what they were supposed to be working on, or the reason for the change. I immediately contacted my department directors to say it was an issue and causing me to resent going to work to endure the toxic and chaotic atmosphere, where on a daily basis I'd be in meetings with other senior members of staff, during which we'd discuss how on earth we could deal with the guilty party's attitude and mismanagement. Many a shoulder was cried on. 

The feeling was the issues in Amsterdam were being suppressed and kept out of view of management back in London HQ, for self-preservation. Sadly when I contacted my department heads in England, I was fobbed-off by saying it was actually par for the course, and I should just wait and see if things became less chaotic. As a professional who is used to squashing issues faced by my team, I found this an appalling response and indicative of a workplace that didn't take complaints and worker happiness seriously. 

Eventually the stress and toxicity drove me to the point where I couldn't face going in to work. I had to withdraw from the office and coudn't even bear to read e-mails as it would trigger my anger and anxiety towards how I'd been treated. I'd mentioned my mental health was suffering numerous times, and HR wasn't interested (literally ignored my emails) until it manifested in my absence. To top it all off, while they were promoting themselves on LinkedIn during mental health awareness week as being a compassionate place of work, they stopped paying me and gave me notice that I wasn't wanted. It was a perfectly terrible encapsulation of how tone deaf and removed from reality these people were. I would avoid this place like the plague. I've worked at over a dozen large and well-known brands, and nothing remotely came close to the toxicity and unprofessional experience I had at DAZN.

Even the projects and delivery style were terrible. We effectively had huge waterfall projects to work on, and didn't release any software in one of my teams during the 6 months I was working there! It was completely demoralising, especially as the team didn't have full-stack control (something we begged management for the whole time), and so we could never deliver in complete user stories, and we left mocking and stubbing everything. As a Business Analyst it was frustrating having to chop my user stories into pieces just so we could actually deliver partial tickets within a sprint, with no complete slices of functionality being possible.

The final nail in the coffin was when members of our London HQ product team came to deliver a presentation on the plans going forward, and multiple times told us that the main focus of the company was something that none of us were allowed to touch in Amsterdam; the 'sexy' part of the business, i.e. the streaming. I remember struggling to muster the energy to even chat with a co-worker immediately afterwards, as all the enthusiasm had been zapped from me. I left the company within two days of that tone deaf meeting.

As if that weren't bad enough, shortly after I joined I discovered that the owner of the company contributed millions to Trump's campaign in the US, so by working there or even just paying for a subscription, you're contributing towards hatred and bigotry. Seriously, you can do better."

238,DAZN,Life changing opportunity for me,2018-12-06,5.0,Software Engineer,"I have been growing personally and technically at DAZN. Colleagues are clever developers and  cool people, the environment it's relaxed but we are getting things done. Quality over quantity is key. As engineers we get to do things properly, tested, fully automated. The tech stack is awesome for me, Node.js, AWS, Serverless, Terraform, Drone, go, and much more. I have had really good line managers. In conclusion I am really happy here and I would recommend this experience to everyone.","Legacy management culture from Perform Group. DAZN is starting its own group now, so it should get better."
