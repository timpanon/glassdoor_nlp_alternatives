2,Deliveroo,"If you're lucky, it'll be great; If you're unlucky, it's toxic",2022-04-05,2.0,Senior Account Manager,"Good work culture; Most people are nice and considerate; Good benefits such as free delivery, free food, monthly gym allowance, and work-life balance.","Terrible remuneration (salary & increment): overall remuneration DOES NOT match employees' efforts and the company's constantly asking for more.

Workplace bureaucracy and injustice: Works were done with minimal recognition and credits are often been taken by the ""more favorable"" employee; Management saw it but decided to do nothing. The ""more favorable"" employee ended up being promoted.

No internal communication: Though HR implemented a channel for employees to express thoughts and suggestions anonymously, all the comments were seldom presented to related departments and the upper management doesn't care what exactly goes on on a slightly granulated level. Don't expect support from them.

Unreasonable team organization: with newer management additions to the company, many teams underwent restructuring. Though most of the new arrangements make sense, some from certain teams are extremely unreasonable and even presented more obstacles to current employees' career progression. 

No clear career path: Though the company was great once new structures were in place, the career path is no longer clear in this company and the culture has skewed further away from that adopted by all other markets.

Terrible organizational skills: Projects are always pushed out without internal alignment on the timeline or additional assessment of the plausibility of each project. Upper management doesn't care if employees are suffering because of their lack of organization and logic. No strategy whatsoever and the market success is solely built upon exploiting extremely skilled employees and the demand for delivery service."

They will promise the Sky to use you but that promise will be deliver.
For safety they only rely you to do the online course but at warehouse they don’t follow the procedures that the health and safe curse teach you: like if you hurt you back.

Tech is treated as a first-class citizen and engineer voices are never ignored. The performance review process is transparent and everyone takes it seriously, dedicating time to ensure it's useful. There's also a healthy level of pragmatism amongst developers.

Also rather nice is the agreement of ""the right tool for the right job"" no matter the financial cost; if the correct AWS product to use costs quite a bit, that's absolutely fine as long as it's the right choice - no penny-pinching there!","Career progression above Senior is very tied to your impact on the wider company outside your team, which can become quite time-consuming."

A lot of favoritism at least in my office and you do not get promoted based on your work. Toxic positivity at times and not enough direction from top management. The company has been operating for the past 9 years and yet it still feels like a startup with all the chaos. Salaries are super low compared to what's being offered in the market."

With many people coming from A-level tech companies (Amazon, FB, Google, Booking, Expedia, Swiggy etc) you're surrounded with people who've seen & worked in the best tech companies in the world. I think Deliveroo strikes the right balance between documentation & execution and I believe teams are truly enabled to do their best job","We're struggling a bit to hire at the pace we want to grow, furthermore as there's been such a focus on product & tech, supporting teams like data science & design are somewhat understaffed causing slight bottlenecks.

344,Deliveroo,Not the company or team it once was...,2020-11-24,1.0,Senior Data Scientist,"- Cool office and roof garden
- Interesting problems","When I joined Deliveroo, none of the cons below applied, we had different leadership and the team was high flying. However, many issues arose in 2019 that means I really could never recommend this company for DS now:

- The DS leadership really do not know what they are doing. Genuinely some of the directors can't even code in anything but SQL and do not know basic stats!! Worse though, they do not have a strategic focus, meaning DS was not having impact, and is the reason they got hit so hard in the latest round of redundancies compared to other teams. I have felt like they care more about appearing to be good at their jobs than actually caring about their own team or actually driving impact. 
- I wasn't part of the latest round of redundancies, but I was appalled at the extent to which the group that were made redundant over-indexed on being female or from minority backgrounds.
- On the ground level, data scientists seem to just be trying to constantly prove how clever they are (this gets particularly had with the most senior ICs) rather than concentrating on how to drive impact for Deliveroo. I often found people throw around technical terms without properly understanding what they mean, and often confuse others rather than breaking it down to help non-technical stakeholders use the analysis effectively to drive strategy. 
- The company as a whole used to have an open and transparent culture, similar to big tech. After Mike Hudack (CTO) left, it became very secretive and dominated by those from investment banking backgrounds and their mentality. The c-suite has become extremely reactive, constantly shifting focus between growth and profitability, and also with all the retreats from countries their operated in recently, I don't think they have good long-term strategic direction or growth trajectory
- I was lucky in progressing very quickly up the ranks during my time there. However, I know many others who are struggling and have been promised promotions and opportunity by their managers that turned out to be pure lies, which is hugely de-motivating. There has only been one round of promotions in the last 3 years, despite promising them every 6 months. There have been 3 rounds of redundancies over the same period."

The pay is terrible. If you try to speak up about the pay, they will shut you down. They will overwork you and underpay you and not compensate you for your efforts.
Certain members in the people team are not capable with dealing with issues, and you would be shocked at what they can say. You end up feeling like you really have no one to turn to. I advise you to have another person in the same room during any meeting such that the tone from the HR managers can remain respectful.
Multiple cases of sexual harassment in the company which were not dealt with in a promising way for the victims. It’s the company culture that really needs to change as it emboldens men to sexually harass their peers.

Over my tenure at Deliveroo, there have been multiple investigations regarding anti-Semitic language, racial bias and sexual harassment claims. Most claims never lead to disciplinary action, and instead, the victims are left with no choice but to leave the company.

At first look, the company can be mistaken for being open and diverse, but if you scratch a little under the surface, you’ll notice that there’s a lack of diversity in senior positions. Treatment seems fair until you ask questions regarding gender pay, temporary vs permanent contracts and reporting misconduct from senior execs.

4. Lots of employees were laid off at the end of April 2020 (possibly the worst time ever for an employee to be let go). The CEO just read a script to acknowledge what happened.

The Exec team doesn't seem to have a plan, and don't care to listen to anyone outside their circle.
Data Science leadership is inexperienced - they focus on politics and playing favourites (which is a shame as the actual data scientists are generally very nice). Meanwhile, the team had no proper strategy, literally no roadmapping or goals, no visibility with senior leadership, but was hiring like crazy regardless. It was no surprise that DS was hit so badly by the most recent round of redundancies- even those of us who are safe are interviewing elsewhere.

451,Deliveroo,"Interesting challenges, but the company has lost its direction",2020-05-19,4.0,Software Engineer,"Relative freedom on technologies, some interesting business challenges",Career opportunities are fairly opaque. Company has either little idea of a long term direction or terrible communication.
452,Deliveroo,N/A,2020-05-18,4.0,Software Engineer,Lots of free food and perks,Poor top-down leadership within the company
453,Deliveroo,Hi,2020-05-14,4.0,Customer Service Associate,love the working environment and company culture,the salary is quite low and I can't see any career opportunities for fg.
454,Deliveroo,It is a sinking ship - Do not join!,2020-05-13,1.0,Data Scientist,"- The data system is pretty messy so one side effect of this is that as a data scientist, you will have the chance to get your hand dirty and understand how to log data and clean data
- Some very good talent in the team（however, they deserve something better I believe）","- Management: the management is very rubbish, especially some middle-level managers. A lot of them are very hypocritic and lack of empathy. The only thing they care about is whether their team is doing some work so that they can show off and get themselves promoted. They literally don't care how you feel, what is your career progression, what training you need. They are no difference with slave owners as their only job is to whip you and squeeze you to deliver. 
- Business model: it is not a money-making business. Even without Covid-19, the company is losing money, with the hope that one day they can turn it around. It is basically a delivery company, disguised under the fancy tech startup title. With Covid-19, it is clear that the company is going a downward spiral. There will be a big lay off in Data Science and it will not get anywhere better in the foreseeable future 
- Frugal: the first company that put frugal as one of its core values. How ridiculous! They can rationalize anything under it - cut all training budget, cannot afford to get you some basic tools, cut the over-time meal benefit, no promotion (the chance of getting promoted to senior is extremely low no matter how good your performance is... people are getting furious about it)
- Huge pressure and hierarchical: as a DS, you need to join daily standup and speak out what you did yesterday and what you are going to do today. However, a big part of data scientist is thinking and exploration. You need to think about what is the best approach and what is to improve. With the pressure of daily standup, you have to deliver something tangible every day. It doesn't matter whether you put enough thinking to your analysis or whether you are using the right approach. All you need to do is to make sure you have something to speak in standup and make people feel you have done a lot of work! Also, though deliveroo is not a big tech company, it is very hierarchical. A lot of work is political related, without any real value. Nobody is willing to help you if you are stuck as everybody is so busy."

457,Deliveroo,Work somewhere else,2020-05-06,1.0,Software Engineer,No delivery charge for employees ordering Deliveroo (still pay service fee & food cost),"Main thing to be aware of is that Deliveroo isn't a tech or logistics company like its competitors, so good engineering / solving interesting tech problems isn't valued.
Bad culture, people generally unfriendly. Maybe just because the company is quite large now and is not a small startup: it feels quite corporate and hierarchical.
Deliveroo lobbied against Lombardy government shutting restaurants to combat COVID-19.
People too worried about productivity to collaborate: eating at desks, if you need to ask someone something you probably have to make an appointment with them on a later day which blocks your team's work. Too many managers.
People like to make complaints about nonsense behind each others' backs.
""Frugal"": Training budget has been completely removed, new cafeteria overpriced, perks are worthless. Snacks are rationed and released only at certain times where everyone must rush to grab snacks like animals or miss out.
Very distracting, noisy, open office with people video-calling at their desks and events happening in the middle of the office.
While there are onboarding presentations, nobody will help show new starters how the different Deliveroo systems work so most people had no knowledge about how stuff works.
Don't believe anything they tell you at interview.
There's nothing special about working here (maybe there was a while ago)."

-Non-HQ markets have some great GMs and their own micro-cultures that resist the toxic HQ culture. 
- If you love food, it's a great place filled with food lovers.","- Arrogant approach to global expansion, no localisation whatsoever (we don't even have an Arabic app in the UAE 4 years in).
-Product and engineers are few and far between for a tech company (we can't attract enough at the low salaries) and act in a lazy and entitled way. 
-Exec team are not really competent and don't know how to work together
-Bro culture that keeps a lot of mediocre white men in power positions. 
-Blatant acts of bullying (that make the AWAY stories look like childs play)  are overlooked by HR when committed by legacy friends of the CEO.
-CEO has said that you can't be a customer-centric company and an employee-centric company so doesn't see the need to take care of employees.
-CEO more concerned with PR-ing himself as a CEO than working with the team.
-Not an inclusive place: in my 3 years, I saw multiple women fired when they got pregnant. The diversity committee has no senior leadership buy in and does not have the mandate to make any changes to dismantle the bro culture."

- A bunch of seriously talented people in middle management and alot of bright young things
- I did see some career progression while at the company, despite the poor way the company manages development and reward","- Senior management and strategy is built around whoever is the CEOs flavour of the month. (And this does change monthly). The personal feuds that develop between the CEO and his exec team as a result of his short-lived favouritism are well known across the business and always result in a very public and embarrassing firing. The CEO tries to conceal his shortcomings through giving humorous company all-hands which impress the inexperienced or those in his favour. 
- The company operates a culture of protecting legacy hires rather than tackling poor performance and proven bullying. It's a boys club in which you'll only succeed if you are in with the right crowd. 
- Men are shown preference when it comes to promotion and salary adjustments, and women are forced to fight their way toward any recognition. 
The female leadership that does exist is non-supportive and made up of women who see subordinates successes as a threat rather than a credit to their team. 
There is no training for senior and exec level management, and as such the people management at Deliveroo is atrocious and HR are snowed under with complaints from staff about unfair treatment. 
- Salary is below average, and internal progression is not rewarded with higher renumeration. They throw money at new hires though - so be warned - the package will look great but it'll stay that way for your entire time at Deliveroo."

534,Deliveroo,Low team morale due to excessive micro-management.,2019-08-22,1.0,Sales Development Representative,"Free lunch on a Friday (quality hit and miss)
Good pay","Management will quite happily scream, shout and swear at the team. This isn't a one off. It happens a lot. Its embarrassing to watch. 

There is a culture of fear in the office. People will not bring up any issues in team meetings because you risk getting your head bitten off by management and publicly embarrassed.

You wont be encouraged to work, instead you will be scared into doing it. If you aren't hitting your call targets expect to be publicly shamed.

You will be severely micro-managed. It's honestly like going back to primary school. You sit where you are told to sit. If you are seen to be talking too much off the phone, you will be forced to sit on the managers table. Sometimes they enforce team punishments such as everyone has to stand up for an hour because we haven't made enough sales.

You will be promised team trips if you hit your monthly target or even free Deliveroo credit. Don't get excited. Even if the target is hit, you very rarely receive your prize and nobody speaks up because of the culture of fear mentioned above.

You might be excited to work for an up and coming start-up like Deliveroo. Let me burst your bubble. The big London office is where the fun is. You will be sat in a call centre in Manchester and expected to call the same takeaways over and over again until you lose your sanity.

Being fired is the norm. Next to no focus on employee development. If you're missing your target, regardless of any legitimate explanation you might have, they don't care. You'll be out the door in a heartbeat.

In summary, you will sit at your laptop calling the same people non stop all day whilst being screamed at by management. You wont feel trusted, just constantly on edge."

536,Deliveroo,Great potential let down by poor management,2019-08-12,2.0,Designer,"With a company of this size, you're always likely to find people you get on with, and I've made friends for life through Deliveroo. There are some useful perks available through The Rewards Hub, such as discounted gym membership, travel, health and dental insurance, plus various sports clubs, classes, free lunch on Fridays, and a free Deliveroo Plus account (free delivery) for all full-time employees. Generally speaking, the working hours are satisfactory (09:30–18:30 is a long day, but you rarely have to stay late), and it's easy to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Despite the cons below, Deliveroo has been used as a great stepping-stone to bigger and better things by numerous former employees in the creative studio. The size/fame/reputation of the company, the relatively decent marketing budget and the little remaining ""startup culture"" occasionally allows for interesting projects and good portfolio pieces.","The creative team has seen a change of leadership five times in three years, due mainly to the management techniques of the wider organisation resulting in people being pushed out/asked to leave. The resulting chaos every 6–12 months leads to near-constant frustration and low morale for the team itself. Due to its relative size, the creative team is placed under the marketing umbrella within the company structure, as if it's just another small team, rather than standing on its own, where it can be given autonomy and the ability to better serve the business as a whole. The people in management positions above the creative director, who are marketers, don't understand or appreciate the value of good creative work, unless it directly results in an increase in the metrics they care about. This is no way to run a creative team in a supposedly disruptive and innovative company, because it is in no way conducive to good creative work, which occasionally needs to rely on taking creative risks. The management issues do not only affect the creative, design and marketing departments, however, and the head office has seen (and possibly is still going through) an intense period of turnover, especially across the last 12 months. Deliveroo has always had the potential to be great, but the constant empty promises of ""things will be better!"" following the latest change in management or structure, make it an incredibly frustrating place to work when things inevitably don't improve."

From the outside, Deliveroo is a successful business and a place where anybody would want to work. The salary and commission are amazing when working there.

As a new starter, you will also buy into the fabulous London HQ; filled with enthusiastic individuals from different departments, food and scope for opportunity. Sadly, these things haven't been introduced into the Manchester Office.","The infrastructure and culture of the sales dept in Manchester isn't anything like what it set out to be. Understandably, most startups don't have things down to a T in their first few years.
But culture and management is something that can most definitely be mastered while building businesses foundations.

When starting a position at Deliveroo, you're told about how important ""fun"", ""food"" and ""freedom"" is to the company and to your role.

Management is anything but ""fun"". Nobody in the team dares to question the manager when prompted to do so, in case they appear to be 'patronising' or 'rude' - when really they're almost bullied into being silenced.

Employees are given a seating plan. If you treat people like children, they're likely to act like children. If you treat adults with respect, they will respect you.
Everybody knows KPIs and Targets have to be hit - nobody works to get fired or to not maximise on their commissions. So why must a manager scream across a room of adults to ask for how many calls they've made?"

Free lunch on a Friday + opportunity to win more food throughout the week; often granted with credits so you can enjoy the food from the comfort of your own home.","Was massively miss sold the job as I was told it would be the perfect opportunity for graduates with good progression, responsibilities, etc. 
Couldn't be more different! Extreme pressure from an inexperienced manager, 0 chance of progression or horizontal movement, intense micromanagement and not using degree at all. Just felt wasted, unutilized and stressed.
The job itself is talking to restaurant owners all day on the phone till 7 pm, with some (if not most) not being the most business savvy individuals or most organized.
The job is for a certain type of individual if you're fine with bashing out the phones all day and dealing with B2B (B standing for Basic) then it's a great opp to make some money! Although I wouldn't see it as long term.
And don't be miss led by the temptation to work for a glitzy startup, the 'sales' team is just bolted onto the side of what seems to be a good company at the HQ (London) which is a shame! It is just a highly repetitive telesales job, which isn't mentioned at all on job spec or interviews.

Second the opportunities for personal growth. Deliveroo's business and engineering teams are growing quickly, leading to new technical and product challenges constantly.

Third the ability to have a large impact. Small teams look after huge parts of our systems which reach millions of customers. There are few companies at this unique time period where they have both lots of users and small teams to own entire sections of the product while scaling very quickly.","Like any startup, there are growing pains. Specifically for tech, the main two I see:

1. Management is stretched thin. The tech organization has grown quickly without enough management support. It's being actively fixed now with several new EMs joining recently.

2. Rapidly changing product roadmap. Often we can be quite reactive to external forces with our product roadmap which can cause some vertigo for teams. We've recently started having a company-wide product roadmap which hopefully will help."

Most of the engineering managers and product managers were quite supportive as well.","The HR department simply isn't fit for purpose. There have been instances of members of the HR team silencing minorities in the company, in one case physically pushing staff after their actions had been reported to an engineering manager. When grievances were eventually raised, senior management did everything they could to protect HR at the expense of the emotional well being of their victims.

More generally, there is a bullying/humiliation culture in senior management that often trickles down to individual contributors. One team in particular went without an engineering manager for over a year because of the poor way in which senior management had treated their previous manager. As a result of poor management at this level and uncompetitive salaries, large swathes of the engineering team are expected to leave in the coming months and it's unclear how they will be replaced.

The office itself is rather noisy and a lot of time is wasted on the company Facebook (Workplace) and most individual contributors find themselves in an absurd amount of meetings each day. There's some scepticism around the efficacy of the levelling framework currently in use. The hours are a little longer than some places (9:30-6:30) and all engineers are expected to join the on-call rota which often means supporting services that you haven't actually built. There are surprisingly few perks when it comes to working there as you're only entitled to free food at Friday lunch time and on the app, all employees get is free delivery."

-You can choose when you want to work but the best nights to work are Friday, Saturday and Sunday when it gets really busy.  In some areas you have to book slots to work in advance; other areas like Bristol or Leicester you can log on anytime you are free.

-Payment as a Deliveroo rider is per delivery, with payments varying slightly according to distance - typically between about £3.80 to £5 per drop, plus tips.  In busy times I can do typically do three or four deliveries an hour and so with tips earn quite a decent rate. 

-The work itself is fun if you like cycling and exploring your city. 

-Restaurant staff are usually friendly and you get to chat to other riders while waiting for orders to be prepared in the busier restaurants.

-Potential £50 bonus after 20 drops if you sign up with a referral code - such as  JO173976.","-Have to buy your own kit. The basic kit of the large backpack, smaller thermal bag, and cycling jacket cost £45. Obviously you also need to own a bike, a good bike lock and a reliable phone.

-Cycling in the cold and wet is not fun but bad weather means more more orders and higher earnings so at least the time passes quickly.

-Hills suck, even if they make you fit. 

-You need to be motivated if you want to earn money - there is no boss to make you work. 

-You need a good bike lock.

-No job security, career progression, holiday pay, pension, etc. You are a self-employed contractor."

It's great to be able to working amongst people who have previously built and scaled companies such as Twitter, Facebook, Netflix and Google.

The people & environment are very friendly, and make it a real pleasure to go to work every day. Everyone also has a very healthy attitude towards working from home and flexible working hours.
 
We often have team nights out and drinks after work.

No expense is spared on learning materials, bring influential speakers into the office and generally developing one's career.

There is a great culture of open and honest feedback, with a real emphasis on improving process so that problems of the past never happen again. This was eye-opening for me, coming to the company as you can see how much more efficient and politics-free everything becomes when everything is out in the open.

Free food on Fridays :)","Honestly, not many but here's a few small ones:

The company has grown so rapidly that there sometimes seem to be basic things which should have been fixed long ago, but no-one has got round to it yet.

Much of the core business still depends on an large monolith application (which is slowly being de-composed) but this does cause friction sometimes when wanting to move quickly and ship a feature. I have been lucky to not have to work regularly within the monolith.

We care constantly hiring new people, which is great, but this means it sometimes becomes harder to keep tabs on everything that is going on and what everyone is working on, as you would do in a smaller startup."

Unsafe office environment for example dangerous staircases in supply offices. Often asked to do work that is not part of the job description such as moving heavy kit deliveries up and down stairs. Abuse from riders who were having issues was a daily thing. We did not have security for over a year. Unorganised and the supply managers don't know what they are doing, we would be told one thing and 10 minutes later it would change. No progression although it is promoted by higher ups, when people do get promoted it seems to because of friendships or relationships (Sexual or other) not on experience or knowledge which is a huge shame. Had an employee of the month scheme but never paid. If you have payment issues its a nightmare to sort it out, you email and no one replies. When you do a good job there is no reward or bonus. Poor training especially when it comes to documents, no training was given looking for fake documents which are seen on a weekly basis. There is no safety test or training for new riders which could cause more issues on the roads and finally i'm sure none of the riders pay any tax. The worst place I have ever worked felt underappreciated and overlooked."

The management thinks that they are all machines and that is normal and fair to stay at work several hours past office hours (for free) and not having a life out of the office. Plus, the company isn't able to provide proper training and blames employees for every mistake, while they just struggle to learn what the managers don't want to teach.
I wouldn't recommend working for them if you want to keep your life healthy, it's a really stressful environment, there is no team work at all and each employee just wants to stand out in front of the manager. Arrogance and lack of trust is what dominates this office. Absolutely the worst place I worked in."

- Extra food is often around. You get to try new and exiting food
- Team is young and you will become friends with people if you are in your 20s
- Cool office
- Central Location 
- £30 Gym membership","Worst Management Ever. 
- Targets change all the time and you are not told so, then blamed for not doing the right thing.
- Reviews are completely untrue, no ones tells you what they think to your face
- When you ask for clear and honest feedback you are not told the truth even truth you ask for it.
- You are promised to be given more responsibility but the salary does not follow. 
- Some people can get by not doing anything at all while others have to work twice as hard and do not get any reward for it. It is extremely clear that some people where hired because they might know people useful for the CEO/ Top management and this allows them to be sloppy, hand in incomplet work, blame others for their own mistakes and barely work at all.
- I am not surprised that turnover is so high. 
- Deliveroo employee are so full of themselves and some are even official bullies. I know people going home crying after work because they were treated so poorly. It's a shame that a company with such an amazing project is ruining it's reputation and futur from within with a clear lack of leadership, of managers who actually know how to manage teams and a culture created by a couple of self-centered teens who think they are the reason for this food revolution just because they were amongst the first people who got hired.
- Do not trust anyone in this company, they will use you to their advantage without the blink of an eye.

743,Deliveroo,Extremely unprofessional environment - did not get paid!,2016-06-24,1.0,Hiring Team Member (Internal Sales),I can't really think of any pros whatsoever. A very unprofessional environment that reminds me of secondary school - dodgy people with no qualifications acting like 10-year-olds.,"Where do I start? First of all, I worked in internal sales in the Angel office. This environment was very unprofessional and dodgy! Not everyone is held up to the same expectations. There is a huge favouritism going on, where some people can get away with not doing their work at all, being obnoxious in the office and openly being racist to a specific nationality. Secondly, some staff do not get paid for the hours they worked. I have decided to leave after I found out I did not get paid on the day when everyone else in the team got paid. The team leader was trying to say that my details were not sent in time to payroll, and my pay will actually be sorted the next payday, which was supposed to be 4 weeks later. However, that was not the case, since payroll has sent an email with the deadline for submitting documents, and I have actually submitted all documents 3 working days before the deadline. It was clear that the reason why I didn't get paid was because the team leader could not be bothered to submit my details in time to make sure I get paid. Leaving this job straight away was a very wise decision. Four weeks later, and I have almost £300 missing from my pay. Instead of getting paid for the 104 hours I worked, I only got paid for 72. Furthermore, the team leader promised that whoever will choose to work on bank holiday (30th of May) will get £100 alone for that day. I obviously did not get any of it! It's quite obvious by now that the only way this company is still running is because they save a lot of money by not paying staff properly. Please take note that I am not the only one having problems with pay in Deliveroo, as so many other people have complained."
