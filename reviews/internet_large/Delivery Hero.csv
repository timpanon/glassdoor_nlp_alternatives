As an engineer especially, it is easy to avoid meetings-overload.
- Very welcoming, very multicultural environment. They take inclusivity seriously and are at least trying to make the team more diverse.
- Huge team, very easy to meet new people, find new projects. It is not uncommon for people to move teams after a few years, often as a promotion/track change.
- Ridiculous scale for tech projects. Not ""Google scale,"" but big enough that it'll impress any startup you interview for afterward.","- Internal communications have become less and less humane, more and more corporate. Transparency is not a company value.
- A hierarchy so big that no one, even senior leadership, feels like they have a real impact. Just the overhead of such an enormous hierarchy causes pervasive alignment fatigue.
- Remote working and relocation policies are comparable to bait-and-switch. The legal team has warned employees of termination if they work outside of Germany for over 30 days.
- They're an investment company first, a services company second, and a tech company as an afterthought. The tech team (usually) won't admit it, but suffers a lot of legacy, tech debt, and strategy problems because of this."

- Few benefits are great
- People's team is warm, Inclusive
-Colleagues are wonderful, international","-There is no social life beyond work within designers. You get on a meeting, you get out of a meeting. 
- Product Designers lack thinking let alone design thinking- it's a fad for them. They just do what is briefed. Look at another app, come up with solutions that are "" the best in a given timeline"" and meet expectations! 
- You won't find anything new happening in the company because the designers/ management is too scared to try anything new- that's how Gorillas eat your business away
- did you ever imagining ordering food when you hungry and you are to swipe right or left restaurants to find the best matching restaurant? That's how *empathetic* the product team is. towards a hungry user. 


-If you don't ask for it(anything-pay, promotion,rest, burn out you won't get) you are your own flag bearer. *Tips to succeed at DH*
-You need to have a big mouth and incremental contribution to the company. 
-If you form a guild and facilitate: you will be the only person recognised ( no one else) *tips to succeed at DH*
- Poor analytics and data science, subpar -developers ( the first reaction to any solution for them is: it's looks too challenging) 
-Developers don't actively share and question enough about product decisions: they beleive developers are doing enough by developing and keeping a clean code. 
-People being promoted keep getting promoted, others leave. 
-To shine, you will have to loose all your blood out and still have bring *their* attention to the bloodbath. They won't see,if you don't tell. Showing doesn't matter
- The tech team is the poorest that I have seen ever."

- the company grows fast which leads to ineffective or complete lack of internal processes and structures
- There is very little supervision/control of team managers by their superiors. This leads to situations, where team managers get away with very poor behaviour towards their team members, taking all the credit of the team without taking responsibilities at the same time. E.g. , my manager was not interested in the work I was handling and totally unaware of the work situation within the team, which led to inaccurate and unfair evaluations. I also experienced no respect for sick leaves or vacation leaves from my manager. 
- No support for future professional development plans (even though they would be fully conducted in my free time and be directly beneficial to my job in the company). I was told that i should 100% focus on my current job and that me thinking of future developments showed a lack of interest in my job."

International environment.","Around 80% of upper mid-management (Directors, Sr Directors, VPs) lack basic leadership skills. A lot of managers are either bad at management or have to deal with incompetence from their peers and supervisors. A few good leaders are reporting to incompetent and inexperienced people.

The Tech organization is a macho, alpha male environment, with no women in the upper management levels. Upper management positions (Director, Sr. Directors, VPs) in the tech department and across the entities are making decisions without the minimum tech knowledge to run a tech company. A big majority of engineers have no idea about the applications they support. But behave like rockstars. 

Few or nonexistent chances to be promoted. People with who you never had contact will decide your career future. 

The core values are a big lie. HR is implementing Corporate America culture. Fake niceness culture. They talk about the amazing onboarding, amazing working, amazing experience, which is an amazing joke. 

Overall lack of strategy and planning, startup mentality despite the DAX recognition. OKR culture is promoting short term planning. Everyone is just thinking about the next three months, thus no long term planning or strategy.

No clear or documented processes (even for basic stuff) and extreme lack of accountability and ownership from critical teams like HR, Legal, or Procurement, they provide a slow, bad, and sometimes rude service. They do not understand the company they work with.

Since COVID communication between teams got even worst, a lot of initiatives and projects at the same time without informing the teams affected. No life-work balance.

Lack of transparency from all C Levels."

-good relocation package","You would read many 5 stars reviews here, posted from 2019 to 2020. Please don't believe in everything. Company encourages HR and managers to post them. Check the reviews from the past 2 years before applying. You would see the pattern in the negative comments. This is the only authentic image.

My insights:

- company creates an illusion of positive working atmosphere (they invest a lot in PR, social media). They might create a nice onboarding experience, but it's all fake. Usually people are amazed by the company within fist 6 months or 1 year of employment. Real Delivery Hero starts after 1 year
- extremely backstabbing culture, lack of feedback culture. If someone questions your performance - you will not get any feedback directly. Your stakeholder or team member would go to your manager and this would have an impact on your performance review. Might lead to having no chances for any career/salary progression.
-managers tend to ask too many questions about your private life. They pretend to be your friends, would go with you for a lunch, invite you for a walk etc. My adivce: don't share anything. It would be used against you, especially if you are going through some tough times 
-questionable competency and lack of professionalism of people on Director/Sr. Director level. Especially in non-tech and HR
-inclusion does not exist here. It's diversity&favoritism
- it's not a place for young, talented people, especially from IT and Product department. You won't get appreciation, your job won't be recognized - neither in salary, nor in your team. Salaries are below the market 
- they can terminate you without any proper reason, even if you have unlimited contract. Termination experience is totally inhuman. They behave like you have never worked there
-unpaid overtime in non tech is classic
- if you care about knowledge sharing - this would be perceived as something negative
-if you care about the innovation - it's not a place for you. Company is not interested in your innovative ideas. Management doesn't support arranging hackathons. They did this once and that's it

 Remember, that there is life and good people outside of DH bubble."

- Best computer equipment money can buy.
- Personal education budget of 1000 per year.
- Flexible working hours. Although this is pretty much the standard in Berlin. Also often you end up working more than 8 hours a day. Not sure if this is really a pro.
- Flat hierarchies in most teams.
- Each year you can use a few workdays to do volunteering work.","- A very bloated and bureaucratic HR department (the single biggest department at HQ) that is not helpful when you need them and annoying when you don't.
- Too many political talks, emails, and posts from their Diversity & Inclusion team. I am a liberal as well and fully support anti-discrimination, but at times it feels like they're really pushing their agenda too aggressively and politicising the workplace beyond a reasonable degree.
- Although this is team-specific, if you're unlucky, you will end up with a hyper-micro-managing boss. From what I hear, there seems to be quite many teams that are like this.
- The salaries are better than some small companies but much lower than similar sized companies and many well-funded startups in Berlin."

Senior management here is the most immature, inconsiderate, and inhuman you could ever imagine, with the meanest attitude you could ever encounter. Their role is to constantly provide you with destructive feedback that kills your motivation and drains you, but they love pretending in front of everyone that they care about their teams. This fake niceness is quite sickening. 

Turnover rate is really high which isn’t surprising, given that either a lot of people decide to leave because they’re burnt out from the culture/environment here, or they just silently fire employees.

354,Delivery Hero,Not a tech company,2020-06-09,2.0,Software Engineer,"Your experience might vary based on your position, I can only share those of a Software Engineer.

Delivery Hero is the German version of a sweatshop. The company fails being challenging for anyone above junior level, but rewards loyalty, and you can be sure that you'll move up the ladder if you decide to stay long enough (although the long term incentives are not great by any means). 

There might be still good enough reasons to join this company:
- you are junior: there is a lot of stuff going on, you'll have to write and rewrite your code all the time, the codebases are pretty big, so it's a great first experience. With a little luck you'll also have some good mid-level engineers to coach you (until they decide to leave for joining a tech company),
- you want to move to Germany from outside the EU, and you need a company to get you a Visa,
- you just wanna do your hours, do what you are told, have a stable career (well, as long as that sweet VC money is flowing), and you don't care about the rest that much. Good luck for your interviews though at your next company, but in the worst case you can just go to an other Rocket company :P","On the other hand if you'd rather work for a tech company, you might consider these points:
- Since the company values more than anything people who executes their tasks no questions asked, autonomy and capacity for initiative is not somethings that will be expected from you. Even worse, your manager probably has been appointed as a manager because he excelled at this.
- Look at DH’s public GitHub repo for how many good quality open source project they published. About 0. For comparison, even Zalando has a couple of interesting projects.
- Automation at its worse. If you are working on client facing services, you’ll be required to execute manual load testing of the services that you are responsible for during your night hours (without extra compensation (anyone reading this from DH: no, finishing 1-2 hour earlier in exchange to spend your night babysitting the loadtest suit is the bare minimum, not a compensation)),
- Expect busy on-call shifts. If you'd rather not doing on-calls, expect your manager reminding you that they won’t forget about it during your bi-annual performance review.
- Developer productivity has no value in the manager’s eyes. Anything that’s not a feature or tackles an immediate production issue won’t be addressed, until it blows into your face. Hypergrowth is not something to be proud of, but a direct symptom of this mentality. The company needs more and more meat to throw at the problems to avoid the software stack crumble under its own weight because of the rust and rot.
- Company hackathons were organized only once, and after that C level management considered it as something not worth the time."

- IT equipment to make you comfortable.

- Smunch delivered in office daily.","- Nepotism and corrupt favouritism. Leadership covers up everything bad that happens within the company by selling negative figures to the investors.

- No transparency at all and they may ask for your anonymous or non-anonymous feedback, but be very careful as they are liars and will retaliate for what you say.

- They're losing all the time but still call themselves hero. It's a mockery of the term itself. Nothing heroic about them.

- If you're non-European / non-white, I'd highly recommend you to stay away from this company in all locations or forms, especially when the European economy is tanking and they need to lift or favour their own kind. It's so sad that they are incompetent to even operate in their own home market - Berlin and still are able to control or operate such a multi-billion dollar corporate, by entering undeveloped tier 2 economies like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, UAE, Uruguay, etc. and hence have created a more refined or modern version of colonialism. Whites will call the shots while all else do the groundwork.

508,Delivery Hero,"If you value your talent, avoid this place at all costs.",2017-05-04,1.0,,There really have been none.,"My interview process started over 7 weeks ago. From initial application to be contacted took about a week. I was tasked with doing a 2 day design test as I was applying for a graphic design position, having been told that they loved my portfolio. Once submitted, they loved what created for the test. It was then about 2 weeks before an actual Skype interview could be had.  It was short, quite informal and I was told that they'd be in touch with information about the next round.

Since then there's been no contact. I've not had a single email responded to me. I've now sent 4 emails, looking for updates. I've even CC'ed the creative lead for the department, and still nothing. This forced me to ring their HQ in Berlin multiple times (I rang them 21 times over the span of 4 days) and no one picked up.

I shouldn't have to email 4 times for an update, and having no one manning the phones. It's a complete joke. I wouldn't be so sour over the situation if something had gone wrong, but I was shaping up to be an ideal fit for the position. Delivery Hero is atrociously dis-organised and clearly don't care about those who could positively impact the company.

""I'm sure they're busy""......""They're hiring a lot at the moment""....""They're re-structuring their admin"" .......this is what went through my head over the last few weeks, but that's just making up excuses for a companies poor communication.

The main positive thing about DH are the people. Everyone is really friendly and open to helping others. There are lots of initiatives in place where people can learn from other departments which also promote networking. 

I also like the fact that there is a focus on quality, too. Of course, we must not forget that DH is still growing like crazy and sometimes it has to be speed before quality, but in really important topics there is always a focus on quality.","Unfortunately, DH is not the best paying employer and there are some discrepancies which need to be sorted out.
