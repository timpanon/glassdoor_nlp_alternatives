You have to be extremely patient because it can literally years, even with exceptional annual reviews. If you're being hired on, make sure to ask for at least 20% more than you will actually accept.

Include tuition reimbursement, discounts, and free parking.

* Handled the COVID pandemic well - was very flexible about WFH and the needs of working parents, etc.

* Work doesn't get too routine - new challenges come up to keep you engaged and prevent you from going on autopilot.

* Despite any disagreements, you do get the sense that most of the people running DR are invested and care about the company and its employees.","* Communication between exective leadership team and subject matter experts in various departments could be improved. 

* A focus on changing the company's business model has created significant pressure on operations teams due to the constraints of current technology. This has had deleterious affect on morale.

* Layoffs of key long-time high performing employees have negatively impacted morale."

22,Digital River,Poor Work culture,2021-06-10,1.0,Tester,I learned a little bit there but more so what not to do in my next role as opposed to anything positive.,"Constant churn of staff, always waiting for the next round of job cuts. This is the only company where my nationality has been raised as part of my performance. Employees are entitled to holidays but management kicked up a fuss over how I wanted to take those holidays. I was completely aghast at this. When staff submitted their friend's resumes for roles it was like a disadvantage to that person so I just gave up doing that. Not a lot of respect for employees in other countries. When your manager doesn't travel to other countries and makes hire and fire decisions from their seat, it is difficult to respect their decisions or lack of performance. All in all I was glad to move on to pastures new and leave behind the work culture I had experienced. 

I would not recommend to other employees."

44,Digital River,Very Disappointed,2020-12-28,1.0,PMO Consultant,The team is amazing to work with! Great people working their hardest to help the company be better.,Anyone with a manager title and above is only out for their own interests. Specific individuals have no problem working to get you removed from the organization is they don’t like you. Zero growth opportunity and no long term plan at all. Frequent ‘reorganization’ within management roles that don’t align with their experience. HR only protects those in leadership roles instead of using fair practices to protect and listen to employees. Discrimination runs abound within this organization.

51,Digital River,Plenty of opportunity,2020-10-30,5.0,Marketing Specialist,"Everyone's opinion is welcome. Top executives solicit and listen to the rank and file. They have responded very well to the pandemic - following guidelines and being sensitive to needs of employees worldwide. We have been operating well as a distributed workforce partly because we planned for that kind of flexibility. Time off is flexible, people are treated as adults and trusted to get the work done. The corporate culture is both fun, and also driven to succeed. It's a good mix. Because it is an ecommerce company, it's been busy at a time when other companies are struggling to survive. That's no small thing. Our CEO is strategic, brilliant and people-focused as well as results-focused.",Some might feel overwhelmed by the pace. We are growing quickly and that can be demanding. It can also provide opportunity - so it's up to individual perception.

59,Digital River,Digital River,2020-04-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Benefits package is overall pretty good.,Constant change of corporate direction at present makes the culture tense.
60,Digital River,I guess if you don’t have any other options in this market you’ll fit right in at Digital River,2020-03-19,1.0,,Flexible work environment with options to wfh and decent benefits for full time employees like unlimited PTO that people actually use.,"Everything else? The culture at DR is frightening with employees that are combative and destructive instead of collaborative - with a lot of public shaming happening. There is next to zero strategy happening here with key decisions, down to product requirements happening in the hallways. Lack of leadership from the top down, with most executives working their way up and only knowing DR bad practices so the loop of poor mgmt and decision making never ends. Most team members are either very green or way under qualified for their roles, so it’s comical to watch their plans come together and the execution isn’t really happening. The lack of talent has to be bc of their reputation in the market or non-competitive salaries, either way it’s difficult to get real work done here. Turnover is also through the roof, I witnessed someone leaving nearly every week I was there on top of 3 leadership changes and 1 lay-off in less than a year. If you’re looking for somewhere to coast by or are really great with buzz words but lack actual experience you’ll fit in so well here amongst the crazy egos.

HR when they’re not adding to the poor culture at play is trying to hide the cons by offering things like bring your dog to work days, Halloween parties, and more options for alcohol in the office then in most college dorms."

65,Digital River,"Those that remain, its time to move on.",2019-09-19,1.0,IT Support,"Long long time ago. DR was the envy of the market. Work hard, play hard. Respect by management, and most if not all loved to come to work. Now its just a pretty building with two coolers full of beer on Fridays.","Years ago, this place had it all. Once bought by Siris Capital, those who craved larger bank accounts, decided its was in their best interest to cash in.  Staff is not a priority, selling DR is. Market is hot, get out why you can.

Open door policy with management, always time to speak openly. Eamonn Barry was in charge then, he rocked his role! I had great admiration for him as a leader, and even more so now!
Great coffee, cakes every fortnight on a Friday!","It was completely targets driven, being a call centre, but when agents do twice the work of others and took an extra break, it was always an issue, better off doing the same as every one else and just reaching your targets"

Beer Friday
Covered outdoor ramp parking
Dogs in the hallways
Hockey games on the pond","Digital River is burning through their remaining cash and every year more rounds of layoffs.  I got out before this years rounds.  Twelve months ago we had so many RIF rounds that every week we had a group pool to see when the team meeting was going to pop on our calendar.

Major clients have left, became competitors or  routed traffic to Amazon that Black Friday and Holiday is a now a great time to spend with family instead of making money.  

The PE firm that owns Digital River  bought a competitor to try to get out of this mess.   Digital River being the Netscape of eCommerce happened ten years ago and someone forgot to shut off the lights.

They reason they have job postings is because everyone is leaving or left and they just  keep to rec open to make it seem like they are strong and growing.

Stay away and work for anyone else."
75,Digital River,I probably need therapy after ending this relationship,2019-02-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I’m trying really hard but I can’t think of 1 thing that is worth it.

Sure they have beer Friday’s (you’ll be lucky if you can go). 
Flexible time off (they just don’t want you to earn PTO because when they lay you off they will have to pay you out your PTO)
It was nice having a cafeteria in the building because I never had time to go to lunch. I would much rather have time to take my lunch.

So yeah, nothing they offer is worth it to me.","There are so many to list. Here we go!

There is NO work life balance. If you care about your family and your health this isn’t the company for you. This can vary significantly across departments, but the expectation of the company is that you are available when they need you any day any time. When you leave work expect that you’ll be logging in when you get home and working a few more hours. If you are the type of person that gives everything to your employer then you might like it here. 

The employees are rude to each other, being respectful is not required. So if you like to be mean to people and you like being treated like that then this is your company. 

Layoffs. The question is not will layoffs happen, it’s when. And it’s not when in the next year it’s when in the next few months. Layoffs will happen and probably more then 1 time a year. It seems to have become standard business procedure there. 

The company is not doing well. The investment company that owns DR is moving every job they can overseas and selling any part of the company they can. 

If you decide to work here, good luck!"

In fact, company is so ""Minnesota-centric"", that you feel completely isolated and forgotten if you work for them anywhere else, almost like they were a small local business instead of a global one (many examples of this like benefits, events, communications, etc). Management lacks the vision to take company into the future, and the technology stack is years behind the competition.  Big customers have noticed this an are leaving in droves.  Although, I like to stay at companies (at DR for >7 years), I finally was fearful of my career because DR had a very bleak future."

They take care of their employees.,"In the engineering group, collaboration and working together are actively discouraged.  If I asked for advice or help on something, my manager would look very unfavorably on me.  The general viewpoint was that I should research everything myself and get to know all of how a complex codebase worked, without help from others.  With code that's more than 15 years old, including at least two different content management systems, it's impractical for one engineer to learn everything.  And, discouraging collaboration slows down the time that it takes to go to market with new features.

One of my coworkers told me the unofficial motto was, ""You're an engineer, figure it out for yourself.""  Although that lesson was never put out there openly, it sure seems to be the way that things are done."

Somehow, Digital River's legacy technology is of use and value to companies through duct-taped code that supports e-commerce for businesses who are too naive to do it themselves.

Second, leadership and specifically, Dave Dobson, is crass, rude and anything but what you would want in a leader.  He stated that the unlimited PTO was simply a way for the company to save money so they don't have to payout unused vacation.  How caring and honest!  When the company was sold to Siris in 2014, he stated that it was a good day in his household (he pocketed millions in stock).  How classy!  

Regardless of what DR writes in their response to this review, I'll give you the truth.  Unlimited PTO is not because the company cares about you.  The pay is below market value.   The benefits are a complete joke and would cost a family of three several thousands of dollars in out of pocket deductible costs because the company cut back on healthcare for its employees.  Their technology is outdated, and will be replaced by machine-learning in the not-so distant future.

The presenter pleaded and practically begged employees to go on glassdoor.com and leave a good review. A fairly lucrative way to tip the stats in Digital River's favor if you ask me. However, Digital River does have fairly competitive pay, and the benefits are okay. They recently implemented a ""Flex time off"" policy, and you get a good amount of paternal leave when your child is born.","Digital River is a “fast paced environment” which translates into chaotic and not well managed. There are too many tiers of management. Which results in team responsibilities not being well defined. Middle management then sometimes tries to power grab to make their team (or themselves) look better.

The culture is declining quickly. Office parties are not my thing, but at Digital River they are a reward if the company as a whole does well. Kind of like how you reward dogs for doing tricks. There is also internal shaming between teams. Which has created a general distrust and unwillingness to cooperate when collaboration is needed, and just a bad cultural dynamic on top of that.

When working on a project, you do not move on from it. It becomes what you do or own for the entire time you are at Digital River. Even if this job is not your responsibility anymore. And if a particular owner of a product leaves, that knowledge base is gone. Typically with no replacement. Then individuals are left scrambling to figure out how to work through the gaps. A few individuals have a great deal of legacy or “tribal” knowledge. Which will also leave large knowledge gaps if they were to move on.

Overall Digital River is a frustrating work environment at best. There are few to no attempts to better the culture, that recently has only been getting worse. Aside from just a paycheck, there is not much benefit to working at Digital River."

This helps them to focus on developing the correct solutions. There is still an open door policy, at least with managers and directors. The benefits are stellar! Oh, and don't forget Dog Day! There's a strong attempt to keep/enhance the culture there. And people who need to work from home on occasion have the flexibility to do so. A lot of the people there are really nice, genuine people. And some of these have left.","Over the past year or more DR has been losing top talent. Some of this is due to poor project planning causing mandatory overtime for development. They have recently been focused on the bottom line. Now with them being a private company again I fear that they will continue to push hard to get features out the door quickly without taking the time to do things right. The last lay-off let go of some people with core knowledge. And they have announced a pending lay-off to happen in the future. It's like upper management wants people to leave.

215,Digital River,Genuine Work rather than BS in Client Facing Roles,2015-10-27,4.0,Senior Manager,"Digital River's business model centers on shared success with clients (revenue share model for commerce and marketing).  This fact keeps everyone aligned and honest.  It is a unique asset, in any conflict between departments or people, to be able to fall back on ""Doing what is best for the client is best for DR"" and have it be obviously true on the face of it, rather than a remote abstraction or wishful thinking.

Per the review's title, the business model means there are internal stakeholders tied to genuine client success -- people who really want to understand what works (not just what we can get the client to buy).

""Nothing in life is handed to you""-- and at DR you'll earn what you get from clients and from the company.  There isn't a lot of excess capacity and clients don't come prepared to spend lavishly, but, there is enough intelligence around you, value in the core offering, and in the business model, to allow you to realize success you can earn.

There are some recently announced HR benefits changes that set a (novel) tone of generosity and forward thinking with regard to compensation.

When I hear from executives, I expect to hear 90% optimistic fluff, 10% truth.  Dave Dobson sets a very different tone—he’s saying what other executes often wish he wouldn’t.  My intuition is to flip expectations, and trust 90%.","The wider commerce relationship often means the marketing agency over-resources clients relative to fees generated.  Nonetheless, the agency P&L is strictly tracked on its own merits (fees vs salary) alone.  This has contributed to chronic under-resourcing relative to work demanded.  

Although we work with great brands, those brands' store teams often have lean budgets.  No client is spending their CMO's branding budget, but rather working with tightly limited funds for a very concrete return.  This limits (but does not eliminate) opportunity for exciting, visionary projects.

The marketing agency's image is not polished.  Sales materials are underwhelming; deliverables have no branding cohesion.  High-level communications between agency leaders and clients are irregular and focused on sales or handing problems rather than strategy, vision, and pro-active course-correction.

Lean budgets and resourcing all around mean you will have to scratch and claw for time to execute proactive efforts at innovation or improved efficiency."

The HQ location also meant a lot of people having to work late to take part in US calls. A lot of business is done over the phone rather than face to face.

For me, the attitude was a bit too relaxed. For example, is it really good business sense to shut down the office for the afternoon and get the employees to paint the walls?! Fun but nonsensical. There was no opportunity for progression in my area. However in Marketing roles, it seemed progression was easier. The staff turnaround seems quite high."

237,Digital River,Poor Management and Bad Atmosphere,2015-06-17,1.0,Account Manager,"One of the best reasons to work at Digital River is that your colleagues will likely be wonderful, and you'll take great joy in working as a team with them.
Beer Fridays are also a nice perk!","The management at Digital River is frighteningly bad! They don't care about their staff, will work them to the bone, then pass your hard graft off as their own. To advance your career, you need to work a huge number of hours and be willing to engage in office politics, being friends with the right people and integrating into the 'boys club' mentality.
Training is non-existent and managers have no interest in helping you learn the ropes. This is just one of the many reasons for the high staff turnover in the company and general low morale."
238,Digital River,"leaving was a blessing in disguise, glad I did",2015-06-11,2.0,Lead,"Highly talented individuals 
Good fun in the office I worked in
In the early days we had Xmas parties in Germany, soccer tournaments in Europe
Learned tonnes about my job
Got great guidance from my Managers, some of whom were excellent. 
Great travel opportunities
Worked with team members in Asia,Europe, USA, South America
Wii xbox and playstation in the break room

Paid the mortgage for a few years, bought a few cars, had some holidays and could afford a decent social life. 

Some excellent lunches and meals when travelling which contributed to learning more about the world. 

Really was a great company to work for. But all masterpieces have a passage where the key players think they need to take action to do better and they don't. Julius Caesar, King Lear, Walter White, Digital River.","To progress one needed to work their backside off or be pretty ruthless. I chose to work.

Finishing salary was on a par with lower level roles in other jobs

There was a takeover that upper Management focused on. The whole point of the takeover seemed to be to make huge money for Senior Management. The long term viability of the company was an after thought. A bit like killing a piglet for its meat today without thinking how fat the pig could get

Time and again a top new executive would arrive with powerpoint presentations buzz words and ideas. A few months later they would be gone. A year later a new executive would join and regurgitate the fallen comarade's ideas. 

How this company terminates people's roles is weird. It is a bit like grandma having an accidental poo in the pants at xmas meetup and her being whisked off home and nobody being allowed talk about it. The only way to find out who had left was to check outlook. For years I had to send myself mails from my personal email to see had I been canned.

I was once told that when I would leave the company I would suddenly see all the flaws Digital River has. A month after leaving I saw this. The company is a distant memory now, but I just look back and smile thinking of the disorganised chaos that used to reign there.

The company makes a big deal about the business it conducts at thanksgiving but other companies do that business in an hour. Like that uncle at your wedding telling young girls how he almost got a place in the Tampa Bay Bucs squad for the 95 superbowl only to drop a can of beer on his big toe."

Sadly, none of them remain at the company. They were either let go, or left of their own accord, seeing the direction that the company was headed in.","Under Joel Ronning and his immediate fleet of management, Digital River was a great company to work for. Approximately 3 years ago, Joel Ronning left Digital River and soon afterwards a large majority of his trusted staff began their departure as well. They were replaced with a pool of money hungry sharks, that ultimately aligned the company for acquisition, knowing they would line their pockets handsomely. The acquisition resulted in insider trading that was covered up extremely well. No traces left behind, all internal email correspondence and such deleted. After getting their payouts, the new management have mostly left or are leaving, looking for other healthy vessels to loot. Unable to hire from outside the company, due to both tarnished reputation as well as strict expenditure restrictions by the acquiring firm, open positions are being filled by promoting next in lines and not necessarily experienced individuals within pretty much every department. The company is in a sad state of being. It is a sinking ship. The days of glory are over and it is a simply a matter of time......"

The teams globally under senior management are great (Taiwan, UK etc) - Ops, Fraud, Client Marketing, Implementation, Sales Engineers and Legal  - great personalities, determination to succeed but sadly new ideas for growth hampered by Senior Execs not knowing the Ecomm space and the ex IBM mentality will stunt and chance of new business growth further ...... if the individual business could be sold off they should be but thats a Herculean task in itself and would need a brave PE business to support that   ... I worked at DR for 6 years plus in new business...  The model on an international basis for branded manufacturers is still strong - if they were prepared to partner more with Demandware / Hybirs and use DR's back office internationally, growth would come!

Board still gives them time - despite lack of growth since 2013 when new CEO came in - pure protect base strategy still in place.  Internal decision making in DR is comparable to the time it took to build the pyramids. The business model on an international basis for branded manufacturers is still strong - if they were prepared to partner more where the current platform has ongoing issues they could win a lot of new business - but the requires lateral thinking.

Leaders don't seem to understand eCommerce but pretend that they do.  Leaders say one thing but it seems that the strategy and message doesn't flow down the chain.  There is clearly a huge disconnect in the software engineering areas between the COO and the people who actually know the system which has led to some senior level turnover.

Absolutely terrible work/life balance.  If you take a job there be prepared to work nights and weekends without any on call pay or comp time.  Also expect to be paid less than you could get elsewhere but be told that somehow beer Friday and bring your dog to work day make up for it.  It doesn't."

306,Digital River,"Decent idea, poorly executed, views workers as disposable",2013-02-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"* Tech company perks
* Seemingly laid-back culture (see cons)","* Poor starting salary
* Little to no chances for merit increases or bonuses
* Little to no chance of career growth

* Terrible management with no vision and no ideas.  Too many chiefs, not enough indians
* Many critical positions left vacant for months upon months
* Awful senior and middle management, HR, and especially IT
* You have to play ""the game"" to maintain your current position, let alone advance"
307,Digital River,Inconsiderate company,2013-02-06,1.0,Senior QA Engineer,Lots of cutting edge technologies,Company does not care about employees and encourages a high turnover rate. Low salaries. Makes profits with takeovers and demises. Out of touch with the industry.

Today was my turn.  The company went on and on about how they wanted to be a good company for employees, but as hard as they try they never got there.  They let me go when we are expecting our first child."

310,Digital River,Ecommerce in Flux,2013-02-02,3.0,Product Coordinator,"Digital River has a wide array of very talented and brilliant people.  The capacity to recognize, go after, and solve problems is unlike anything I have ever seen before.","The company isn't terribly organized.  Many inside believe that the organization is fast paced, but it is often left chasing its own tail to make up for a lack of proper planning or resource allocation.  Many problems could be alleviated or avoided by better forecasting of needs."
311,Digital River,"Lack of innovation, lack of leadership",2012-12-28,2.0,Senior Director Business Development,Still has some brand value.,Antiquated platform that no longer meets the needs of the market.  Business units to not communicate well and mass account ownership confusion at the field level.  Management is very level conscious and do not work below their direct reports.  Management is also very inexperienced on how to factorize the products and service delivery business units so that the company can scale.
312,Digital River,Three managers in five months makes things very confusing,2012-10-17,2.0,Monitoring Administrator & Management Pack Developer (SCOM),"Latest technologies are implemented at Digital River, which lends the opportunity for an engineer to remain current in their skills and expand their knowledge with the products they work with.","Although the vision of the business is exciting, management doesn't have a plan to get there and they will typically make hasty decisions based on input from those that have no experience with the products and technologies they plan to implement. This leads to more administrative overhead and implementing bad practices."

317,Digital River,"Good, but too easy to burn out...",2012-08-02,3.0,Web Developer,"Solid web development, co-workers and peers truly collaborate on development. Compensation is above average, benefits are solid.","Work-life balance almost non-existent: despite having a global presence, 10 hour days and working weekends are far too common. Development usually dictated by what the client wants, rather than what the existing platform can do: as a result, long development hours and systems that can be unstable due to over-customization. Archaic tools and procedures. Compensation above average to start, but raises/performance bonuses are few and far between."
318,Digital River,Get hired away from a good company and get laid off when the stock dips.,2012-07-30,1.0,Business Development Manager,Definitely the coworkers and all of the awesome techies.  Ability to work at a high level with interesting customers and detailed proposals.,A manager that micromanaged me to the point of asking where I was when I went to the bathroom because I wasn't there to answer his IM.   The same manager that couldn't even look the customer in the eye when we were doing a presentation.   The same manager that had to approve every email I ever wrote because I didn't follow his verbage to the letter(ie. A cross between a phd thesis and a lawyers briefing).
319,Digital River,Positive,2012-07-30,4.0,Software Engineer,"Competitive pay, good people, laid back culture.",PTO is not great and it takes a long time to earn more.
320,Digital River,Technology lacks innovation,2012-07-14,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Respectful environment
- Large, multi-datacenter server deployment
- Good 401K matching
- Flexible work hours","- Preference for commercial software, and as a result, innovation through cutting edge technologies and ideas is not actively encouraged or rewarded.
- The company's MN head office location limits their ability to attract top tech talent.
- Although the company has locations in CA, their reluctance to pay higher wages (non MN based wages) further limits their ability to attract and retain talented employees.  Additionally, the prevailing sentiment among senior management seems to be that it is better to pay for 2 low to mediocre skilled employees, than one excellent employee.  This may be explained by the fact that maintaining largely commercial based technologies requires less skill and tech savvy.  
- Outdated technology stack.
- Very poor interdepartmental cooperation.
- HQ often has adversarial relationships with other offices.
- Too dependent on very few large clients.
- Reactive VS. proactive mentality.  
- Upper management are often too involved in the day to day dealings and problem solving. limiting their focus on company vision and strategy."
321,Digital River,Working here has been as rewarding as it has been challenging.,2012-05-14,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"They have very competitive compensation and benefits packages. You're constantly working with world-class teams on complex projects. The company has grown steadily over its history, and hasn't outpaced the industry in terms of growth. For the most part, as long as you do your job well, you can expect to be here for a long time.","It's not a very exciting field. If you want exciting, try social networking. Ecommerce is solid, but can be a bit boring. You'll find some excitement in your day-to-day challenges, but you'll also find yourself bogged down by enterprise level time tracking and project tracking."
322,Digital River,"Depending on the team you're on, the support level varies greatly",2012-05-06,3.0,Contact Center Representative,"When working on a team that handles big name clients, the stress load on yourself is greatly reduced. Because you can be more personal with the contacts you get, you can handle each issue more efficiently.","If you work on a smaller team, it becomes very stressful. You are judged more on the most emails and/or calls you can complete rather than the resolution of the matter. You are also limited on how you can help the customer as you may not have authority to complete simple requests for the customer (contacting vendors, provide refunds, provide vendor contact information.)"
323,Digital River,Overall a good experience - just overworked and underestimated,2012-04-27,3.0,,"excellent environment, lots of employee extras.
