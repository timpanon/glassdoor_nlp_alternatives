HR TEAM: They will only come to see you if they have any issues, which needs to be fixed ASAP. If you try to reach out to HR, they will use words like, we will see, will get back to you tomorrow or day after tomorrow.

In Directi i came across a very uncommon word: ""BIG SHOT"" basically these are people who are sitting on higher positions, and if they raise a issue, and to fix the issue if usual time it takes it 10 minutes, it should be done in 2 minutes as it is raised by ""BIG SHOT""

- A Pre-dominantly young workforce, open to ideas, even from junior associates
- Steep growth rate as far as company is concerned
- Competitive pay for most functions
- Flexible work-hours, lots of freebies, casual environment and plenty of engagement events. 
- Great products team - I think these guys truly have some of the best products in their space.","- Opportunities for your personal growth depend a lot upon the Business Unit you work for. Some of the older products do not offer as many opportunities to grow quickly as some of the new ones do. 
- The general understanding amongst the workforce as a whole is that unless you are a crucial dev, or really high up in the heirarchy, you aren't indispensible. Not necessarily a bad thing - it's expected in a tech-driven company
- Not the kind of place most young people will look at as a long-term engagement. In my experience, I've seen two kind of people here - those that have been here for so long that they can't possibly work for anybody else, and those that don't have a very clear career goal (which isn't to say they are insincere BTW).

3. Nobody cares about employees. They are considered as slaves and paid peanuts compared to the work that is expected.
4. No process, unorganized management. Your salary and the chances of growth depend highly on how good are you at impressing your manager rather than at your work and productivity.

The selection team was extremely friendly throughout the process and even a senior manager was involved in the coding round, moving around and helping people with debugging the code. They showed great teamwork from the interview process itself and I later realized that they were comprised of people from Bangalore as well as Mumbai office.

There were a total of 2 technical interviews and 1 HR interview. They tested practical as well as theoretical knowledge of the subjects. Even if you don't know the correct answer, they tried guiding to the correct answer without telling the answer to test if you could solve things if given a little push. I guess you just have to be true to yourself in the HR interview

It's a fun place for someone to start their career IF they want to be in the digital/internet space. The firm stresses on work-life balance. The superiors/bosses are very approachable, friendly and helpful. You can be promoted fast if you perform well and the right opportunity opens up. Almost everyone I knew in the firm has risen from the Research Analyst level and are now Team Leaders and above.","You have to play your cards right and be friends with the right people. Most often than not, who you are friends with determines how well you advance. However, that's part of company culture. They are looking for a tight group of people to run things, although no one says it out loud. Secondly, one of their offices is in SEEPZ. That is a major drawback. There's LOTS of complains from employees who work there, and it does affect morale at the lower levels. Thirdly, the company is very stingy. Someone I know has been at the company for three years and barely makes 25k. This is the story across the board. The company also has a no negotiation policy when it comes to salary. You take what they give. Finally, the company is run totally ad hoc. My department was first demerged with another group, then shifted to SEEPZ, then merged and then removed altogether, all in a span of  a few months. There is no long term goal that you are told of, or told to work towards. Sometimes, I felt the long term goal of my Team Leaders was to win as many games of pool as possible!
