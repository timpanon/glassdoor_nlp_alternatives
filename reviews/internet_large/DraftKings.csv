The effort that the leadership team has put into supporting the business resource groups is admirable. They show up to meetings, they listen to complaints and enforce positive change. 

People are awesome - smart, driven, passionate environment with lots of room to learn and grow. 

If you work hard, you will be rewarded. It may just come at mid year and end of year.","Growth comes with challenges, new management and new ways of doing things can be scary at first. But these changes, processes and guidelines are here to make DK a better place. Hopefully the changes start to ease off and we can get back to what we do best.

Do not force people back into the office when most of their team is remote."

122,DraftKings,"Not just the best in the industry... one of the best, period",2021-03-31,5.0,Senior Revenue Operations Analyst,"-One of the best possible landing spots for anyone with a passion for working in sports.
-Even non-sports fan employees can enjoy the still-ascending trajectory of the company, great benefits, and good inter- and intra-departmental mobility.
-Surrounded by teammates who know what they're doing and make me want to be better.
-Still has a lot of the scrappy startup DNA without being trite or cliché.
-Tremendous upside for company growth as sports betting is legalized in more states.
-Intellectually stimulating environment with a lot of smart people and new, exciting challenges emerging all the time.
-New ideas, no matter how small, are always welcomed and considered.
-Excellent senior leadership... as one particular example, without getting into too many details, they extended themselves to help a certain segment of the employee population out when they were no obligation (other than to do the right thing) to do so, and might have had a nicer-looking balance sheet if they'd stood on the sidelines. These guys say they want to be a great place to work and they care about their employees, and actions like these are testament to that.","-Hours in my line of work can be a little longer than normal. Doesn't bother me personally that much since I think this job is a lot fun.

135,DraftKings,There's Always a Ceiling,2021-02-22,2.0,Manager,"-DraftKings has decent perks between flexible time off and immediate enrollment in health benefits.

-Most people are really excited to be working for DraftKings. If you're a hiring manager, you get to interview and hire enthusiastic people for the most part.

-High growth is generally a good thing, although it could also be argued DK is getting bloated and not operating efficiently in many areas.","-There's no culture of accountability. Employees can go MIA for days without a word or even abandon the job. It'll be up to the manager to track the employee down. Policies in our HR Handbook are not further defined anywhere else and will be treated as unenforceable. This is difficult if you're a manager of any high growth team.

-""Diversity and Inclusion"" initiatives are just ""feel good"" and don't have any material impact on day to day. Certain teams that are traditionally female dominated, like Customer Experience, are majority male here and most leadership outside of People Ops is male and white. There are teams I interact with regularly that are very ""bro-y"" and who are able to use their personal relationships with those higher up in the company to their advantage.

-Poor communication across teams in all of DraftKings. Whether it's software engineering teams not consulting other tech teams when designing and implementing features that cross over into the other's domain, lack of documentation and knowledge bases for operations teams, or transparency from those at the executive level, communication here is frustrating and results in wasted time, poor implementations of product ""improvements"" and more.

-Too many people with seniority but no actual skill get promoted to high level positions."

I feel like I have lived 3 life times at DK and can't see myself leaving anytime soon. We are fully remote until July at this rate, which has been a challenge for everyone. But even then, the company has been SO transparent with updates & news. They are allocating funds for officer furniture & WFH necessities. Always putting us first. 

I miss the office and my teammates but I know someday we will get back to that and be better than ever.

About my team and my colleagues, I have only positive feedback to share. In a few months, they taught me so much and I improved not only my professional skills but also, I became a better version of myself.

Great team dynamics, and cross-team communication.
Fun work environment, (miss seeing the team each day since WFH started)","Only down for me, engineers wear many hats, and some of those can really cut into the day. The plan of engineers needing to own the process from design to support is understandable but isn't my favorite.
Though not 'put forth' by the company, the people who really excel, never really turn it off, always watching the dashboards etc, it can take you over."

Base pay is solid. 
Laid back culture, no babysitting, they treat you like an adult and expect you to do your job as such
Managers want to have a good time at work and love to see people succeed","Relatively new territory/market. 

Need better universal training for present leadership and those who want to become leadership. 
Seems that the culture is mostly laid back which can have its own set of negative effects if left unacknowledged  

Not a terribly difficult job but when you are expected to know answers for several different products and you subsequently become an expert, you should be paid a higher wage. 
Obvious success and growth of the company should yield higher wages for those who have helped that growth (across the company, not just execs)"

Our issues are still very prominent to old employees who aren’t wowed by the snacks and $15k video game system in the caf anymore.

It’s also nice to have a stable core product and new ones that seem very promising.","Much of the workforce is young and relatively inexperienced - lots of recent college grads. That can lead to newbie mistakes across the board. Jason is a fine CEO when addressing the details of running the business, but he has a tough time inspiring the workers. The company does reorgs relatively frequently, which don’t involve layoffs but do involve headaches and unknowns that impede effort.

The culture is fun and people really seem to enjoy spending time with each other. There is a great deal of freedom to socialize and build camaraderie while being balanced with a commitment from everyone to work hard and get things done. 
The leadership team seems to really care about the people there and wants to ensure that people are happy, motivated and are given the opportunity to work on interesting work. 
The potential upside here is unparalleled. I have the opportunity to work with smart, friendly people who are driven, passionate about succeeding and who are great to work with.  
I feel strongly that this is the next big company in Boston and am really excited about working here. 

Pay and benefits are very good. They also offer 12 weeks maternity leave, tons of free perks (mani/pedi/onsite barber/massages/great food) and have a solid 401k match. 

I also feel compelled to share that I am not someone who considers watching sports or playing fantasy sports as hobbies. I am also a woman. When I first joined I was a concerned that both of those things might create obstacles to my success here or that I wouldn’t fit in. I’m glad to say that these things are not must haves and that the company is working hard to hire people who bring differences in thought and opinion. 
I’m so glad that I made the decision to come work for DK.","The office space presents challenges for serendipitous interactions with people outside of your department because we are spread out on multiple floors at the moment. That’s changing with our new one floor office that we are moving to early next year.
