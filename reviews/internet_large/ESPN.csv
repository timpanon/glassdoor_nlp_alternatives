Upper Management needs to wake up to better understanding what's really going on in their organization.

Work/Life Balance - Tough work schedules/shift hours

Low Pay - Salary not competitive with the current job market"

286,ESPN,Proceed with caution,2020-02-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"It is a company known worldwide, looks good on your resume.","Where shall I start first off there is not really a work and life balance at this company unless you are working normal hours. 

Location- this is in the middle of no where they try to sell it to you only 2 hrs from NYC and Boston. But really who's going to do that every weekend? 

Seniority/Favoritism they will get the best projects and hours and will hardly work a holiday, many people have been there for 10+ years. It is hard to ask for time off because of the senority they will always ask for the summer and the holidays off and you have to ask for your time a year in advance to lock whatever you might think you want. 

Scheduling- plenty of short turnarounds and long days, you will burn out pretty quickly. 

Diversity- they don't have that much in important roles those that are the movers and shakers. Its still very much a boys club. Women and people of color are not that represented and they need to be more progressive and up with the times. There are many walks of life on this world and we need to embrace this. Even though Disney is the parent company and harp on diversity this and diversity that- you just don't see it at all in the important roles. Plus you are not treated with that respect either, HR will not do anything about it so it doesn't help with going there cause everyone looks out for each other and it shouldn't be that way. 

Stuck on how they have always done things- this comes from many of years of the same people in management and they seem to carry this way of thinking year after year. Just because someone has been there for 15 years or more doesn’t qualify them to be in management. Many of these managers don’t even know how to relate or speak to their employees. I thought I was going to work with the best of the best in the industry and this is definitely not the case. Many of these management folks are from an inner circle of the good old boys club and want to keep it this way, anyone else is viewed as an outsider no matter what experience you might have. Totally disappointed if you ask me."

ESPN would never relieve itself of these employees.  This created a culture of entrenchment.  Not the best.
292,ESPN,Proceed with caution,2019-12-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you’re a sports fan bent toward a career with a big name company, part of a bigger name company, any role at ESPN/Disney is enticing. Full time employees have access to company perks like annual Disney passes, ad hoc sporting events, and of course, big brands on your resume.","DTCI (read, Disney) is undergoing a major consolidation which involves looping in all brands under the parent company system and processes. Luckily, ESPN is the first brand to undergo this change. But growing pains still exist. It is impossible to get into contact with IT and HR since most of these departments are remote. This leads to major inconveniences from the smallest password change to the larger reporting an employee to HR. 

The biggest downside of working here is the culture. It is extremely archaic. While the demo of employees appears “diverse,” (50/50 women etc) senior leadership is still an old boys club consisting of northeast archetypes who’ve been at the company 20+ years. Expect team lunches to consist of middle aged men complaining about their wives, judgment toward female coworkers appearance, and jealously toward professional athletes access to “Instagram h*es” (actual quote). If you 1) are a woman 2) read a book in the last 90 days 3) have a vague understanding of professionalism, proceed with extreme caution before signing up to work for this peanut gallery leadership.

TV side is well-oiled and impressive. Tons to learn and soak in.,"Technology professionals needn’t apply. The expression out of the frying pan and into the fire comes to mind. Promises of ownership and career growth are quickly dashed aside by reality: ESPN as a digital technology group is reeling with uncertainty and chaos due to weak leadership. Having worked in a multitude of large scale technology groups, the people in charge of tech should not be. Your contributions are not contextualized and therefore not understood and often undervalued. Communication is an afterthought. There is no transparency into prioritization because a select decides for the whole. I’m not inferring at an initiative level: that would be normal for executives to create a common set of goals for the rank and files of the technology group. However, there is rarely talk of company-wide initiatives and alignment. Instead, senior leadership will micromanage engineering and design priorities to an excruciating extent to further their own, often unknown agendas to the detriment of the user experience. Priorities will shift without regard to the original strategy or effort that went into building them. Occasionally, this is inevitable, but the constant churn inside the walls of the ‘Worldwide leader in Sports’ is all but the symptoms of a healthy organization. Customer insights are rarely taken into account when designing and build product. It is usually the highest paid opinion. If you really don’t care about what you do, and just want a paycheck, then maybe ESPN is for you.

The current leadership is stagnant and trying to compensate by throwing money at top tier talent from other companies. But then you enter a tech culture of ‘do as I say or else’. There is no respect for the intellectual process behind building customer-focused product and design driven thinking. You will be dominated and pestered 24/7/365 because the incompetent tech leadership is constantly seeking approval from leadership on the TV side. This is their priority and everything you’ll do flows from their desire to impress their counterparts. It's become ‘good ole boys’ telling real professionals how to behave, act, and work - and it's a complete joke. Work/life balance is atrocious because people are not the priority. You are only valuable insofar as you make your VP look good. The TV culture is very much alive in the technology group, and it does not fit. Mealtimes are filled with complaints and the turnover rate is alarming. If you ever talk to someone who worked at ESPN tech, the response says it all – I have never met anyone who wasn’t glad to get out.

If you have any hard skills, take them to a company that will empower you and cultivate your career. This is nonexistent at ESPN. ESPN is living in a time bubble where they still think they're the greatest place and it’s such a privilege to just be there - but the reality they're more like that washed up 50-year old at your high school reunion who still think they're prom queen/king. Do you really want to work for that? The reality is frightening if you have a point of reference.

The 'good times' ended in 2015 and now indefinite are the times of endless politicizing, layoffs, re-orgs, and confusion. The pay is not competitive considering how expensive Connecticut is. Career growth is simply not a company priority. I have met several great people who have not been promoted in over a decade. Meritocracy is replaced by popularity content."

419,ESPN,TLDR - TV Company Can't Run a Technology Group - Chaos Ensues,2018-02-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"It’s a sports oasis if you are truly a junkie then you will be surrounded by it 24/7. The novelty of telling your friends you see famous people everyday is there if that interests you.

Pay is market level for the area. Benefits are pretty good.

- Free admission to Disney Parks
- Onsite Daycare if you have kids (there is a waiting list)
- Subsidized Cafe on-site
- Free Gym + Classes","This place is a bubble, plain and simple. Bristol sucks. Connecticut sucks. Don't make the mistake and move here, ESPECIALLY if you are under 30. You will be signing your social life away. If you have kids - BE CAREFUL. ESPN knows if you move your family here, you are basically stuck here given the lack of competitive tech jobs in the area. There is no incentive to keep employees happy as a result.  Bristol was optimized for TV, not tech, remember. Don’t make the same mistake I did.

The tech culture is REALLY toxic now. Since most people have only ever worked here, and this was a peacetime company up until a year or two ago, now it’s become pretty shady and in-personal with a poor work life balance.  Be prepared to work 60-80 hrs a week because your engineering leadership can’t manage it’s resources! Managers are also not willing to fend for their subordinates. There is a criminal amount of having no transparency. For example a manager I know of had part of his long serving team laid off and didn’t even acknowledge it with the others until weeks later!

Incompetent ESPN-lifer middle/senior management is literally destroying this company. The CTO & most of the VP suite is really old school and don’t have experience in tech - no process, definitely no career development and position growth. If you come here, you'll learn that Disney rewards longevity, not merit or performance so if you want to sell your soul to the Mouse, then this is your place. There is no manager review process, so there is no opportunity to call out the weakness. either.

Everyone in tech feels like a number. It’s still an ultra-corporate 1990s boy’s club with a bunch of non-technical old guys who call all of the shots. If you have a new idea or a passion - don’t bother, they don’t care about it. It's all about appeasing the manager above them in the end, there are very few people here who actually care about shipping quality stuff the fans will love. 

Whoever made the decision to base the technology group in Bristol should be FIRED. There is a very high churn rate here with more leaving than coming in since I started, and that trend is going to continue given no one under 30 wants to sign their life away. ESPN has offices in LA, Charlotte, Seattle, and NYC so there is NO excuse for that decision. I’ve heard cost as an excuse but look at any COL map and see where CT is. Ha. Talented engineers are never going to come here so any hope of ESPN becoming a streaming company is really a far cry. They’ve begun outsourcing more and more even after laying people off so good thing Disney got that tax cut! 

If you're in tech, don't come here. Find the whichever city tech hub fits your preferences and stay/move there. Don’t relocate to Bristol. Just don’t do it."

Lots of 70 hour weeks at terrible pay. They will pay you nothing because there are a line of thousands of other people who want to work here behind you. You are on a need-to-know basis about anything. Curiosity and new ideas are not welcome. Richard Deitsch/Jim Miller tell you if you're going to be fired and if the product/show you work on is going to be abandoned. I once asked my boss for sports tickets and thought I was going to get fired for even thinking of such a thing. He then went to MNF two weeks later. Their incentive/bonus structure (long-term incentive cash) rewards time, not performance.  Reorg every six months. Layoffs every year. This is just what came to the top of my head. Don't work here."

No one below VP is empowered to make any decisions or supply any analysis that is contrary to what the highest paid person believes. Expect to get railroaded on any original idea or project you execute, unless of course it is good, then you can expect your superior to take credit for it and pass it along as their own.

Company culture is abysmal- no one is nice to each other, no one above you will ever say thank you, every actual worker is underpaid (unless you're a corporate shill who has decided to stick around for long periods of time). The mistreatment and utter apathy towards culture/moral is 1970's level disturbing. Beware of the snake oil salesmen that await around every corner here. No leader has a vision for the future of the company, their department or you, only how to advance their own career and put you down. Lack of transparency and communication on individual projects, company goals and careers is intentionally awful. Keeps the workers from expecting any more than ""do your job"" status quo. Management can be abrasive which just adds to the toxic environment. 

The technical workers are expected to take requirements, timelines and deliverables from those who have no technical discipline or skill in that required area then be critiqued and judged by the same who do not understand it. Very few in the tech org actually understand what the people below them do and their is no sign that that is changing at all.

If you like your career, happiness and mental well-being, stay away."

Also the opportunities to attend some of the most exciting events and games really is a rare thing to have access to, very very cool.","I think ESPN has a suffering middle class. Think about the NBA when you think of ESPN. Only a handful of teams -maybe 3 or 4 - in the league have a chance at winning. ESPN is very similar. Only a few people really have a chance to ""win it all"" because the level of favoritism is something I have never seen before or even heard of before.  For example, lets say Person A needs an apple to exceed their quota for the quarter. Just one apple. Person B has 50 apples more than their quota, and becasue they had been there for 10x longer than person A, they actually started the quarter only needing 4 apples to begin with. Anyway, someone drops off an apple on the last day of the quarter to the manager. 10 times out of 10 the manager will give it to the person who has 50 apples instead of the person who needed just 1 apple to hit their goals."

Free Disney passes, and discounts at the hotels. On-site gym and cafeteria. You have the opportunity to learn a lot if you are proactive.","Review process is convoluted-- you're expected to write goals regarding things that you have no control over (like assignments) and then held to them. You have zero control over the direction of your career (they put you on the track that they want you, not necessarily where your strengths/interests lie). It's hard to get promoted if you aren't friends with management. People who do go out of their way to learn new skills are put in positions to use them with more responsibility but management is shocked when you also ask for more pay or a promotion.  In studio production positions it's really hard to get holidays or weekends off. Having seniority no longer means anything. Perception is more important than reality."

455,ESPN,"Solid place to work... Be prepared for Bristol, CT",2017-10-16,3.0,Production Assistant,"- Tremendous experience... You get opportunities to do different things and acquire different skills.
- You share a lot in common with your co-workers so you'll naturally build friendships
- Variety level of egos you will deal with. This is a positive. You'll get to learn with people that think extremely highly of themselves and you'll learn with very down to earth people.
- Top notch equipment, studios, technology
- A rare media company that can literally do anything it puts its mind to
- Try to experience everything possible. The natural thing to do is to stick on one specific path (especially if it's working out for you). But it's extremely uncommon where one media company has a campus where: TV, radio, print, digital, business, etc is all located in one place. Treat this like college in a way. Try to experience as many things as you're allowed to.
- Pay is fine if you make your living in central Connecticut. I was personally able to make ends meet being part time for a couple years.","- If you want something to do outside of work, it might be tough. Bristol is a pretty limited town and unless you're from a small town, it can get boring. Couple decent towns surround Bristol, but be ready to hate Bristol. The state itself is dying and many businesses HQ'd there have left. Hartford isn't all that special.
- Due to where ESPN is located, it is common that your social life is connected to work. So when you're at work, you obviously think about work. When you're outside of work, you likely will be talking about work. Once again, this is a Bristol problem. Make sure you find your escape from work someway, somehow.
- TONS of gossip. Don't get trapped in that environment. You just don't know who will start opening their mouth.
- The management typically are 15+ years ESPN lifers. So the managers are very pro ESPN. The other issue with this is if you start on the ground floor, in all likelihood, those managers last did what you did 10+ years ago. Things change, so it can be a weird relationship since they're trying to give you guidance on something they know very little about.
- Upward mobility can be tough. If you consistently good work, you'll probably eventually get promoted. But it's a major company so politics will play a part in promotions. Don't let it get you down.
- Figure out who the people you can't trust right away. If you find out too late, it might be too late for you."

- The resources at your disposal are considerably superior to its competition. Can gain lots of experience right away.
- It is impossible not to meet and bond with people with interests similar to your own.  Many employees relocated and have the same passion for sports.","In my opinion:
- ESPN is an empire, but its stranglehold is loosening.  Layoffs in 2013, 2015, 2017.
- Since it's a large corporation, there are a lot of politics.  The employees with the highest written evaluation marks don't necessarily get promoted. 
- Upper management sends mixed messages about what they expect from employees.  What one boss preaches may contradict what another boss would like to see."

Being part of the Walt Disney company provides quality benefits & perks along with job security.","The decline of the cable industry has had a visibly negative impact on the culture and progression of ESPN as a company. Every decision is reactive from the top>down. Too many complacent, lackluster people who continue to stick around while the best talent leave. The majority of people take the path of least resistance on the day-to-day work which leads to a lack of innovation and challenging the status quo. Compensation is very low compared to the industry average - another clear sign that the company fails to recognize it can no longer get away with how it operated during its peak.

551,ESPN,ESPN does not respect its employees,2016-11-20,1.0,Production Operations,"- The full-time work is good because it allows for a consistent paycheck and benefits. 
- They are willing to spend an inordinate amount of time training people (rather than just hiring competent people to begin with), which can be to the individual's benefit when they realize how poorly ESPN is treating them to perform skilled tasks that other companies value.
- It can be a good place to start out and get some practical experience, but ESPN is definitely not a place anyone with a brain would want to work at for more than a few years.","- ESPN embarrassingly underpays its employees for making national television for the two most watched cable networks. By staggering pay with a bizarre, purely subjective process for performance reviews and promotions, no two people make the same amount of money for doing the same job. In the end everyone at ESPN is paid half to one-third the compensation they should receive for working skilled positions on national television shows.
- While TV is a 24/7/365 job, ESPN does not respect its employees and forces them into inhumane night and weekend shifts for years with no change in sight. 
- ESPN only wants to do more with less. There is zero focus on actually creating a quality product. ESPN, or the Every Single Penny Network, only cares about its bottom line. As a result, productions are severely understaffed. Employees receive unreasonable expectations that jeopardize their ability to succeed and also create an unsafe and uncomfortable working environment.

Many in management distrusts everyone around them and belittles you if you don't do things in the same style.
The video stack is a horrible mess and many managers treat everything as a fire -> focus is not on fix this but on CYA all the time. 
Most developers treat everyone with contempt while bragging about completing tasks that a jr level engineer should be able to complete, they also will take your work and use it for personal gain while leaving your credit out to dry.

You find yourself spending more and more time on administrative tasks and less time on actually getting your work done or creating great products.

The biggest current issue is morale after the 2015 round of layoffs, which didn't seem to take into account performance reviews, past service, awards, etc. The stories I've heard from many people still there is that no one feels secure anymore. Job performance doesn't matter. Personal or career growth doesn't matter. It used to be a place where you could work, build a career, bring up a family while actually spending time with them when you weren't working. A lot of folks now feel (some of them actually being told) that they should be working longer hours to get the job done. Deadlines can't slide simply because the bodies are no longer there.

Many who are self-confident are prepping resumes and opening up to new alternatives before they find it necessary to look. The ones who don't feel they can leave, the ones who are scared to move on, are hunkered in, working hard, and hoping to be missed by next year's announced culling.

629,ESPN,OK place just know what you are getting into,2016-03-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"I work for a satellite office on the west coast, so YMMV if you work in HQ (and there is pros and cons to that as well).

Pros:
-Flexible working hours
-Work from home
-Disney Benefits/discounts
-Generous expense account
-Great people for the most part, you will work with some bright individuals
-Commuter Benefits
-Great for people with families
-Really cares about diversity

Overall I recommend for mid-late career for the long hawl or people who are more family than career focused.

Many people actually get the job, work 2 years, leave and then come back for a better higher paying position.","Cons:
-Most higher level positions are located in Bristol.

-Politics, politics, politics. Once told I would not see a higher rating in my performance review because other people in my office (who do not ever directly work with me, in different departments) had the perception that I didn't work enough, even though I was the only one in the office in my dept who met their goals for the year....OK. Basically I just slowed down the pace I complete tasks now and become inefficient in order to make it seem like I'm working. Oh and also take 20 minute water breaks with other people because politics and thats how you seem like you are working apparently. 

-Not great for single, career focused individuals. While I say that definitely get the experience, ESPN is great on a resume but the people either stay 1-2 years then leave or are lifers for the most part. This because career growth is awfully limited unless you are in the dept you want to advance
in already or know someone in the department you want to move to.

-Career advancement. The internal system for applicants is the exact same as the one for external applicants. Moving to a different company under the Disney umbrella is near impossible without connections as you have no advantage or leg up being an internal employee. To inquire about internal positions I had to look recruiters up on linkedin first, that is insane.

-Disney never fires anyone. I know more than a few under qualified individuals who I question how they tie their shoes in the morning let alone do their job. 

-Lots of talk to improve synergies between teams with little action or actual impact.

-Outdated internal systems"

Additionally, the company culture defines itself as nimble and entrepreneurial at the core with a focus on technology to stay ahead of the game.  As a result, working at ESPN can be both stimulating and challenging.  However, things are changing....","The company is currently facing a number of challenges which are stressing the established (successful) operational model.  The primary issue is the trending loss of subscribers across the cable industry and the difficulty monetizing digital media offerings.  Altho the company remains hugely profitable, there is pressure (from the parent  company) to reduce costs both in capital and expense categories.  Add to that the ongoing turnover of most of the original senior management team and there is an unfortunate stew on the boil.  
The previous 3 years have generated multiple layoffs  and changes at all levels of management which has spun off an ever-evolving org structure.

The HQ is amazing and exciting events happen throughout the year (especially in the summer/fall). Work-life balance was encouraged and hours were flexible (you will see many employees arriving between 9-9:30am, leaving by 5pm). Working from home was usually an option and management made you feel like you were valued/important. There is a cafe and gym on-site, as well as ample opportunities to get personal and professional training (First Aid/CPR, Navigating Through Conflict classes, Building Your Emotional Intelligence, etc.) - the wellness team is awesome and personal training is provided if you want it.","It's all a lie. Management will give you amazing benefits when you first start out and then they will break you down after 6-7 months by taking away your benefits and focusing on a lot of negatives. First, say goodbye to ""flexible work hours"" - even though it's part of the culture to have relaxed hours, certain management will be quick to demand that you are AT your desk at whatever your starting time is, not even a few minutes late. When this isn't something that you were told or expected to do (let alone what you see other people doing) for the first 6 months of working there, it becomes a stressful work environment. Your options to work from home diminish (or completely disappear) and you end up with extra work/projects that aren't even in your job description or business objectives, just for the sake of chaining you to your desk. Middle and upper management are extremely political and take part in these immature games. They expect you to be at your desk 24/7, even as far as expecting you to come in early/leave late without wanting to pay overtime. Oh, and yes they are watching you like a hawk (even though they say they aren't monitoring you). I don't believe this is company wide, but this was my experience working here and I can confidently say ESPN looks like a great place to work, but it really isn't. Like many other reviewers have mentioned, the excitement and shine wears off REALLY quickly, so be prepared to be treated like you are easily replaceable by the lack of trust and respect you end up with over time."

You are part of thee preeminent sports company in the world and the opportunities to work in a number of career paths are broad.  Depending on your job, you get to work with many celebrities and former athletes. You also get the benefits of being a Disney cast member (complementary entrance to theme parks and discounts on anything Disney).","Being a 24-hour, 7-day a week operation means that you will likely work nights and weekends.  ESPN is the final destination for many in the sports field and because of that, I believe they are able to pay less in salary since interest working at ESPN is always in high demand."

As such, it's a pretty old school company. There is a lot of slow moving bureaucracy and out-dated policies - at least when I was working there.

It is not like working in big cities like NY, Boston, etc. ESPN basically doesn't have to compete with anyone, so, don't expect market range salary here.

Another point is the location, Bristol is in middle of nowhere, nothing much to do around, you need to drive at least 30 minutes to find something.

Rather high turnover, because they hire a lot of young people who get their feet wet, get a little ESPN experience, then get the heck out of Bristol for a better city with more pay.  

Bristol is an ugly, boring, somewhat run down little town.  You may move out here from someplace else to start that ""Dream Job"" at ESPN, only to find yourself in a place that isn't exactly full of entertainment options and quite a bit worn in places.  Not a knock on the company, per se, but may negatively effect your morale and desire to be here.  

Not going to lie; drugs & booze are most definitely prevalent in this companies subculture.

Don't step out of line or HR will punish you severely here.  People can, have, and will be fired over the silliest little non-politically correct office prank, joke, or questionable email.   They can publish racy photos of naked athletes in ESPN the Magazine, but share those photos at work or (God forbid) display them in your cubicle - that's a trip to sensitivity training with HR, or worse.  

There really aren't college sports mascots walking around the halls.  ;-)"

885,ESPN,Watch your back,2013-05-21,2.0,,Great resume builder. Working for the top entertainment company in the world definitely has it's perks. Working for the worldwide leader in sports is a great talking point for your future employer. Most of the perks come in Bristol though...not if you were in a regional office like I was.,"I came into a working environment that was filled with people that had been working together for over 10 years. I was hired because they were making some major new shifts and they needed to staff up accordingly. I was told from the beginning that all input would be welcome as everyone's roles would be changing in the coming years. This was a complete lie. Basically if you're not in with the old boys club, then you'll never be accepted. They will find ways to make it seem like your work doesn't meet their standards, even though others that had been working there for years were producing work that was sub-par to mine. There were some very shady HR practices that led to my separation from the company. 

Don't work here unless you know that you're going to be protected by someone higher up who has had longevity with the company."

They are extremely innovative both creatively and technologically.  Always one of the first on new technological platforms.","Not a good place to work for women (I am a man). 
There are few opportunities for anyone to advance, regardless of gender. 
 An old guard still runs the Programming, Production, Administration and other departments, which stifles creativity.  They are not welcoming to those who started their careers at other companies, and promotions and good assignments usually go to those who started careers at ESPN right out pf college.  
ESPN has **extremely** homogeneous employees and a complete lack of diversity. There are an average number of employees of color, but they tend to be from upper middle class suburbs and Ivy League schools.  There is a lot of pressure to fit in to the Connecticut suburb/white picket fence/let's play golf/my kids play lacrosse, hockey and soccer/I like beer mindset.  
Has gotten complacent over the past 15 years of dominating the sports business.  
The Affiliate Relations department is different, and more diverse and dynamic than other divisions, with more opportunities to advance and is more of a meritocracy open than other departments.  
Salaries are low, even compared to people at sister companies at Disney who do the same work."

People who worked other places with other real life experiences other than Bristol CT typically do not do well here unless they are willing to drink the Kool Aid served in Bristol.  People right out of college can learn some things here.  Mobility up or laterally is difficult when one self advocates.  Do not be discouraged, every year or every other year there is a re-organization where management decides what to do and where you go.  Management chooses to under staff and provide limited resources for most projects unless it is one of the two top priorities.  Other lower priorities get so prioritized they end up taking extended time 1-2 years to complete or are forgot about all together.  HR and other HR employee support people sponsor events at ESPN. These events are all show and no substance.  They go through the motions but really do not truly care for and about the employees and their families.  Core Medical and Dental benefits are governed by Disney and they are abysmal.  Worst core benefits received in my whole career.  Great potential but Disney is choking ESPN's ability to grow.
