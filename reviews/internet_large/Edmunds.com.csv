There are small things like Thinking Thursdays and extending Summer Fridays that really help with recharging and becoming a more productive worker. I was beyond burnt out from my previous company because of being overworked in a remote environment, which I imagine a lot of people are facing right now. Quitting that job and being hired at Edmunds has completely changed that, and my work-life balance is so amazing now. Meetings are focused and productive, deadlines and expectations are manageable, and I feel very rewarded for the work that I am doing. Weekly departmental and Cadillac Catch-up meetings with the CEO have been great for fostering innovation and cross-pollination of different domains. Coming from a fast-paced product-driven company, this has been amazing to experience, with time in the week actually dedicated towards growth and learning outside of immediate job responsibilities. The people here are some of the smartest and respectful people I have ever worked with, and as a remote new-hire I have felt super welcomed, especially with the Workplace Experience and PITSTOP teams making the transition very easy and accommodating during my onboarding.","It can be overwhelming at times when ramping up on automotive domain knowledge (especially for newcomers), internal Edmunds tooling, and documentation on all of the different processes and systems, but this has been getting better with time and experience.

51,Edmunds.com,Will it get better? Because it can't get much worse...,2020-10-13,2.0,Manager,"Nice office, decent benefits, flexible work environment, bagels on Friday, fro-yo and popcorn everyday, mostly nice and smart people","At the end of December 2019, the company warned ALL employees of upcoming layoffs - this caused every single employee to fear for their jobs and update their resumes through the holidays. If Edmunds were trying to handle layoffs the worst way possible, they succeeded.

So January 2020 comes around, and 25% of the staff was laid off. Multiple employees that were due promotions were instead rewarded with being let go. The layoffs stripped the company of tons of talent, and left departments decimated - only one employee in PR, zero in marketing, etc. Morale was at an all-time low.

For those that survived the layoffs, many started to job hunt immediately. To prevent anymore talent from fleeing, retention bonuses were offered to a minority of employees, which instead created tension with those that weren't included. Could things get any worse?

Yes. Because then, COVID-19 hit. The decrease in car sales led Edmunds to offer discounts to its dealer partners to retain their business. Edmunds then passed along this loss in business revenue to their already overworked and understaffed workforce via a 10% reduction in salary, and gave no estimation of when salaries would return to normal.

How did a company with such a long standing in the automotive industry sink to such lows?

1) Leadership
No long-term vision or strategy. CEO is nice and accessible, but he and the leadership team are leading the company straight into the ground. They need to sell the rest of the company to CarMax and cut their losses, or gracefully exit and step aside for new leadership. You've had your chance and you've failed. Take it on the chin.

2) Product
In tech, you're only as good as your product. Total lack of innovation here - the products are mediocre, and EVERYONE knows it. Yet, the product leadership still have their jobs and extremely bloated salaries. Why? Because they're in the ""in crowd""? They need to be gone.

3) Sales-driven organization
Sales team is too reactive, too focused on short-term sales goals. Sales team starts fires weekly, and the cross-functional teams have to clean up their mess. Both the Tier 1 and Tier 3 businesses are dying. Churn is high. Turnover on the sales team is high. It's all bad.

4) Marketing
The org doesn't believe in marketing at all. There's a reason everyone's heard of Edmunds' competitors, but they haven't heard of Edmunds."
52,Edmunds.com,Nice Work Environment,2020-09-23,4.0,Data Scientist,"Like anywhere else, your experience is strongly affected by who you report to. Most everyone at Edmunds is friendly and capable. The company goes out of its way to keep employees ""in the loop"" about company initiatives and direction. The offices are comfortable and nice. There are reasonable expectations in terms of work load and deadlines. They do value learning and stretching.","The company tends to change direction often, maybe too often. This sometimes gives the impression that management is mercurial, and seems to pivot with that latest thought or fad. The org chart also changes often, especially for upper management. The company's structure is fairly flat, so, with a few exceptions, it's possible to work there for a long time and go nowhere."

55,Edmunds.com,Totally unstable,2020-04-27,1.0,Director,"Nice office in Santa Monica, but it doesn't produce any revenue unfortunately. It's a money pit that sacrifices many other things that lead to failure.","Too many to list unfortunately. If you want to have a long, prosperous career with advancement and an opportunity to be set up for success, then this is not the right company for you. Upper management and Execs will act like they listen to new ideas, but in reality, they will never listen or act upon anything new because it might threaten their cushy existence. There is zero alternative business experience at the top. Literally zero. All of the top people have been at Edmunds forever and they have nothing new or innovative to bring to the table. They operate in a tiny box, and if you don't agree with their narrative, you will be pushed out of the company. It's that simple. There are leaders in the company (again, who have been there forever) that treat their direct reports like absolute garbage. One in particular who controls a large part of the western U.S. has countless HR complaints for harassing direct reports. Nothing has ever happened to this individual and he has a job for life, because he echoes the narrative within the small circle at the top. So, he has a job for life. This is a glaring example and a microcosm of how the entire organization operates across all of their departments.

Secondly, the company knowingly rips off their customers. They allocate a tiny portion of the overall budget of a client's spend to actual media. They take 60%-80% of the money and pocket it. Their reputation on the street is awful. Their cancel rate is astronomical and there is no bottom in sight. It's very sad, because with the right leadership and ownership the company could innovate great things and be a leader in the industry. But, this will never happen. Ever."
56,Edmunds.com,"Once amazing, now middling",2020-03-13,2.0,Senior Software Developer,"The people below the C-suite are genuinely great, talented, and smart. Some of the best people to work with and for are in that office.

The employee perks are wonderful. The insurance is pretty decent considering they're a mid-sized company and there's fresh fruit brought in every day. Results-only Working Environment (ROWE) is a big plus of the corporate culture. In addition to that the coffee/beverage bar is well-stocked and diverse. The office staff does a great job of hosting events and taking care that the space is well maintained.

The office itself is beautiful. It truly is a stunning and effective layout. There are always quiet spots to find, and the conference room electronics work! The location is convenient to the commuter rail line and you get paid parking in the lot or a reimbursement should you not choose to drive.","The auto space is strange. Edmunds' entire fortune is based on two things

1. How the overall auto market is doing
2. What Google thinks of the site.

For far too long, anyone bringing up the fact that #2 wasn't working or that #1 was a core issue was roundly ignored.  Executive bonuses were being made so everything was fine! The auto market has slowed spending and Edmunds has not been responsive enough to its customers. I can't think of a product that Edmunds has that is a category-beater across the auto space, not the inventory, the dealer products, nor the ad platform. They're just ok and kept afloat by a very dedicated sales staff.

Let's talk about ROWE. The Results in ROWE were at best ill-defined unless you could put a dollar amount to a sales goal. I don't the product nor the tech side of the business could point at a 'result' they were supposed to achieve. The results were to show up/dial into meetings, produce something that resembled work and collect your paycheck. 

Opportunities for advancement are hampered by a lack of growth in the company/sector. The company is having the problems of efficiency, not the problems of scale. 

Finally, the vision thing. Looking at their competitors, you can see organizations that have clear goals and visions. What's Edmunds' vision for remaking/reworking the auto shopping space? I worked there for a while and I couldn't tell you. Without a vision, the [company] perishes."

The office is insane

ROWE and unlimited PTO are awesome","Edmunds is a sinking ship. They just laid off a large portion of the company which they notified us all during the holiday break and made us all wait over week to find out our fate, I assume so they could report the severance payments in the 2020 fiscal year to improve the bottom line for the banks and investors. There is no great way to lay off employees but I think making the entire company wait a week to find out if they had a job was a mistake. I have already heard many of the people retained whispering about taking interviews with other companies so there with be even more attrition and it will be extremely difficult to attract talented people to replace them.

Credit where credit is due, they did give a generous severance from what I heard so they do care about the employees to some degree. 

I personally don’t think Edmunds will exist within the next 1-2 years. Best case it’s acquired and worst case it just closes up shop and sells off its assets to try to retain some wealth for the owners."
62,Edmunds.com,Micromanagement with no clear company direction,2019-12-20,2.0,Field Sales,The employees are good people,"Definitely reminds me of the Titanic but this ship is just sinking a little bit slower. Can’t speak for employees at corporate and how they are treated. For prospective Sales Executives, Relationship Managers, and Account Executives in the field here is what you should expect if you take the job: 1. The main product being sold is mostly smoke and mirrors 2. Be ready to be micro managed all day long(spreadsheets, constant check ins, way to many pointless conference calls) This takes a lot of time away from actually accomplishing the job in the field of servicing dealers 3. No transparency: That went away when the company started struggling. They used to send out weekly leaderboards to everyone for each position so you could see how well everyone was doing around the country. Now they just send you the leaderboard for your position because they don’t want you to be discouraged by seeing the people leaving off the leaderboards and the numbers being way down. Did they not think that subtle move would resonate with employees? 4. Lots of middle management and not enough workers which leads to field reps having way to many accounts to physically be able to manage and see on a consistent basis. Double the accounts to manage as some of the competitors in the market. They wonder why they hear from their clients they aren’t seeing their rep. It’s not because the rep doesn’t want to do the job. It’s because the rep is doing 3 people’s jobs. This leads to reps being demoralized because they are trying to do everything they can to physically be at their clients locations but realize there is no possible way to accomplish that task 5. Hiring freeze for months as great ex employees leave for other companies is the biggest warning sign that needs to be seen. 6. 2020 and beyond for this company ? Don’t look for a grand vision. They are trying to hold it together week by week and month by month. Short term solutions instead of long term strategies. Provide new clients with 3x more value for 3 x less the money then existing loyal clients and wonder why they get cancels. They say they want to take care of existing clients but then when it comes time to do the conversion the managers just complain about the loss they will have to take to make it right. 7.

Additionally, I was told that the work life balance was great due to their ROWE policy.  I was also advised that their training was top notch and that they would allow me time to learn the role while providing attainable performance goals.   This was not my experience.  In terms of useful skills, this role was 50% waiting on hold from external inventory providers, while the other half was doing endless task from a queue to fix various discrepancies on the Edmunds.com website. I never dealt with databases or SQL EVER.  Next, the ROWE policy is an excuse not to give employees time off.  Result oriented work environment. If you get your work done, you get time off.  Sounds good unless you are never done with your work. I worked 60 hours a week at that office and had to take home a laptop and do additional work after I got home.  Its a salary position so forget about OT.  Finally, the training I got was rushed, non specific, and from individuals who had worked there multiple years and didn't want to train people.  Not to mention half the people in the department were fired while I was there. Fortunately, I found a job and quit before I received the boot as well.

Edmunds is strongly based on transparency and growth, both individually and as a company. So, you always know how the company is doing and you get a real sense of how your work aligns with the company goals. Individually speaking, there are always opportunities for the employees to set personal goals in order to grow within the company. If there's a skill, software, or program you're interesting in learning, the managers will go out of their way to make that possible.

99,Edmunds.com,Director,2018-04-01,5.0,Director of Product,"Edmunds is one-of-a-kind place to work. Its pioneer spirit (i.e., the company basically started the 3rd party car shopping & buying industry 20 years ago) is still very much a driving force in how the company operates. Three reasons give Edmunds an edge:

- Product teams are hard at work continuously testing and innovating around the customer experience. This creates an enormous learning opportunity for junior and senior employees alike to own substantial part of the road map and experiment with ideas and concepts. 

- As a privately owned company whose owners are actively involved in management, Edmunds gives employees direct access into how tough decisions are made and executed. This alone is a sizable learning opportunity for anyone considering applying to Edmunds.

- Edmunds has a strong culture based on optimism, camaraderie, and a belief in individual responsibility. The company expects hard work, but is also very generous with personal time to learn, relax, and re-charge (e.g., very flexible vacation policy + Thinking Thursdays with no meetings).",Edmunds can do a better job branding itself to the outside world. A lot of the great work that happens in the office doesn't always translate well when we interact with dealers and customers. There is a sense of internal pride mixed with occasional external lack of confidence as to who the company is and what makes its product and position unique.
100,Edmunds.com,A Fact-Only Review From A Software Developer,2018-03-30,5.0,Software Engineer,"- As a software developer you will get plenty of chance to explore various new technologies that the company has yet to adopt. (I had to learn Scala on the fly while working on a new project)
- Unlike a very large companies, a developer here won’t get pigeon-holed into really narrow areas of tasks.
- Unlike small and early startups, a developer here won’t have to crunch frequently to meet tight deadlines and sacrifice engineering quality. 
- There are plenty of opportunities for a developer to grow here. For example, there are bi-weekly sessions/workshops that focus on data science and various other technical topics that are open to any eager learners within the company.
- There are two company-wide hackathons every year where developers spend two days straight prototyping innovations that will possibly be used in production.
- Really good compensations & benefits for a Southern California company","- Our developers are really focused on their projects, so you might have to ping them a few times asking for feedbacks and approval for a code review.
- A developer might need to juggle on multiple projects sometimes. (That could be a good thing if you are good and enjoy context switching a lot :)
- Software developer job titles are still being optimized. For example, we want to transition into a level system (SDE lv.1 - 10) instead of current ternary composition of junior, regular, and senior."
101,Edmunds.com,Best Place I've Ever Worked – And I've Been at Some Great Companies,2018-03-30,5.0,"Curriculum Manager, Sales Effectiveness","Edmunds is hands down the best place I've ever worked. It starts with the people, who are truly incredible. It's filled with smart, passionate professionals. There is also a lot of diversity – we're not all the way there, but Edmunds is well ahead of other places I've worked. And aside from ethnic and gender diversity, we've got a great blend of backgrounds – small college, large university, liberal arts, STEM, we have representatives from all.  And, while the majority of our staff is based out of Santa Monica, we have salespeople spread across the country, which gives us geographic diversity as well.

Edmunds also has a fantastic office space. As someone who does creative work, I find the place incredibly energizing. As the weather warms up – and we're located in Southern California, so it’s mostly warm – they pull back the sliding glass doors to the interior courtyard. You can take your laptop out there to work – or meet up in one of the pods throughout the building.

I also love the egalitarian office space. Everyone has the same desk configuration, from the owners of the company all the way down to new hires in operations. You literally can’t tell someone’s rank by where they sit. (There are some exceptions: our in-house lawyers do have traditional offices so that they can have private conversations, but, as noted, the owners all sit out in the open with everyone else.) I spent years working at companies where mediocre middle managers rated offices - I really love the layout here at Edmunds.

Another plus: the Workplace Experience Team, which runs the facility, is devoted to employee satisfaction. In every other company I've worked for, the operations department is all about enforcing the rules: making sure you keep a lid on your coffee cup or you clean up the conference room after you've used it. Here, the Employment Experience is focused on organizing events, making sure that employees have everything they need to do their jobs, and, oh yeah, keeping the place sparkling.

Finally, I want to say something about our Results Only Work Environment. I really love it. Under ROWE, I can scheduled family and personal time without asking for permission. I can work from home when I need to and I have a lot of flexibility around the hours that I work – this is great for me, because I can usually schedule my workday around the times where I have the most energy.  Obviously, if you work with other people – as I do – you never have complete control of your schedule, but Edmunds does a great job of allowing you to reach a good balance.

Here's how I'd sum it up: Edmunds provides the most fun, creative atmosphere I’ve ever experienced, a place where you can relax while also getting a lot of serious work done. They treat you like an adult. You'll have outstanding co-workers. And you'll have the benefits of working for a relatively small, family-owned business while enjoying the perks of a much larger company.","Edmunds is located in Santa Monica. That's actually a plus in many ways – for example, there are lots of fantastic restaurants in Santa Monica, but the flip side is that there's a lot of traffic. Unless you are fortunate enough to actually live on the West Side of LA, you will have to deal with traffic.

Also, Edmunds is a fast-paced environment where things change quickly. I think this is a plus on the whole, but there's definitely a downside. If you want to work in a place where you'll be doing the same thing in the same way for years, this isn't the company for you."

104,Edmunds.com,The Truth,2018-03-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"While most other companies go through layoffs on a regular basis, Edmunds never really has.  That's why this one was jarring for some and why it's all over Glassdoor reviews, but most companies go through these events.  The layoffs were necessary to prepare for an new and innovative ad model.  It's not because the company doesn't care about it's people.

Still at the core of Edmunds is that the executive team cares about the people.  I have a hard time believing that other CEOs and Presidents care enough to get to know their employees and try to make decisions that are in their best interest. Despite the changes made to some of the company perks and benefits, they still offer an amazing office space, frozen yogurt, soda machine, popcorn, bagels, flexibility that most companies don't offer, and a 4 month parental leave! 

There is a renewed focus on where the company is headed. The President sends out regular Daily Diaries to having an ongoing communication with employees about what's happening at the company.  They have All Hands Meetings twice a month to feature different areas of the company so  employees understand the strategy, goals and progress and how what everyone is doing ladders up to what the company is trying to achieve. 

But, the two most important pros to mention are that: 
1) At Edmunds you can do anything.  If you have an idea, you won't get bogged down with bureaucracy.  You can make it happen and be as inventive as you want to be. 
2)  The people are amazing.  They are smart, talented, kind, supportive, and truly egoless. There is so much wonderful collaboration across teams.",None I can think of.

In the first half of the year, with the release of the new 2017 website, the company suffered some heavy hits across the entire traffic front.  There was an aura of illusion for the first half of that year, because us employees would keep hearing that the business was slowly failing (traffic declining, dealership issues, etc.), but there was seemingly no consequence and the business still seemed healthy. A lot of people at the company, including myself, were confused as they continued to add cool benefits (daily salads and free snacks, new health initiatives), when it seemed like many parts of the company were failing. 
Then in late October, without notice, almost 60 people were laid off. We were told that the executive team became acutely aware 'too late' that these issues were plaguing the company and that they would have to take cost out of their infrastructure moving into 2018. 
There are only two possible explanations for this.
1 - The executive team genuinely had no idea this had to happen until a  few weeks before the layoffs, in which case I am genuinely amazed by their blind stupidity;
2 - Which is my guess - They had known since January 2017 that we were losing in the competition in the industry but were standing with closed eyes, blindly hoping that they would wake up one morning with all of our problems fixed. Ostensibly, this was never going to happen. 
When they could no longer turn away from the issues the company was having, and they saw the damage was irreparable, they haphazardly went through and found 60 people to cut to save their own skin. NONE of the executive leadership was let go. Only people in the middle to lower levels that helped answer the same questions that the executives would freak out about time and time again. This is what made me seriously lose faith in this company.
Although I was not laid off as part of this cohort, the sentiment after the layoffs has been largely the same. There is still a culture of fear of the executive team, where in one ear we hear soundbites of hopefulness from our Executives, and in the other ear the VP’s and the Exec. Directors are badgering at us the same demands that we heard in 2016, because they know the C-Levels actually do have the same requests. There is truly no unified vision for the company - every week is some new initiative that they have put together at the last minute. As long as the same executive team is in place, I have no hope for the future of this company."

112,Edmunds.com,A Roller Coaster of Emotions,2018-01-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"There were so many notable things that made Edmunds a great place to work. 

- New state of the art offices
- Employee centric perks (coffee machines, soda machine, daily froyo, company provided snacks, a slide IN office, etc.)
- Refreshing place to work with excellent office furniture, including thoughtful lighting to limit florescent lighting fatigue
- Incredible IT services. You need it, you get it
- Awesome meeting rooms with state of the art technology 
- Two Corvettes hanging over the front desk and spinning 

There's probably so many things I'm forgetting, but when I was there, it was incredible to work with other people that wanted good things for the company. We felt like we were accomplishing something great. It almost hung in the air, this palpable drive to get your part of the job done so we could all be the best versions of ourselves. Morale was incredible and high.","After being there for a while you start to see a sort of mask slip. You start noticing more and more people having negative things to say and more viable criticism about the direction of the company.  People in power seem to ignore it, or do a very bad job at acknowledging. 

You bring glaring problems to your supervisor, and they want to fix it just as much as you do, but you watch it die when it lands on a VP's desk. Stamped with a proverbial ""not important"" stamp because there's bigger money making fish to chase. 

You start realizing that what you do is not really that important if it's not in line with chasing said fish. Frustration builds, but you still love Edmunds enough to keep fighting. 

Then, they let go of a LOT of permanent people in one day as a money saving effort. Shortly after they let go of contractors as well.  If you haven't been let go, you have serious private conversations about how  you will voluntarily exit this sinking ship. 

Then after watching a lot of your friends lose their jobs you're expected to have the same tenacity as you had before, even though your only explanations were the executive team pandering to the tattered remainder and trying to make 1+1 equal morale boost. 

Don't expect anyone to listen to any criticism above your direct manager. It's met with silence."

At the time they also had pretty flexible hours and options to work from home.  They were on the ROWE program.  I heard instead of taking ROWE away, they recently rolled out ROWE 2.0, which from what I hear is about the same as no ROWE.","I was with Edmunds for a year and a half.  During that time, I had 5 different managers, 2 different directors, and the commission structure changed 4 times.  The company has no idea what they're doing and doesn't really care about their employees like they say they do.  The annual ""best place to work"" survey is sent out by the company every year and they really push the employees to fill out positive surveys.  That's the only reason why they get the ""best place to work"" award."

They gave us freedom to be productive.  We had an amazing work/life balance, the culture was great, managment seemed intelligent, the salary and benefits were outstanding.  This was the type of company I had bee hoping to work for...FINALLY I was!","They are transparent when it's convenient, they don't fix the issues they currently have with product, instead they create new product which doesn't work either.   
 They can't decide what the new focus should be on but it's not retention for the outside sales team.  They no long admit when they are wrong.  They don't do any traditional advertising but spend MILLIONS on Google, which isn't helping drive new traffic to their site.  Dealers will say ""I've never heard of you why would I give you any of my dollars""  There are no plans in the works to adjust this way of thinking.  Edmunds is 50+ years old and they are thinking like they are still in that time period of the publication days.  Rumor is that there is another round of layoff's coming but I'm sure it will be just under that 10% mark in order to avoid red flags as it was in the first round."

- Great coworkers","Just had a big layoff (58 people) with no warning.  They pledge transparency but this really came from out of the blue.  Even during the recession of 2008 there wasn't a huge layoff, so they must really be in trouble.  They laid off an assortment of people, including long timers loyal to the company, PREGNANT women, and women who were on maternity leave/just back from leave.  Really shady.

They spend money on perks and superficial things to keep employees happy but currently can't figure out how to actually run a successful company.  They change direction every year and instead of innovating try to copy what other companies do.

Recently just got rid of a ton of perks that made working here bearable including things that have been around for over a decade.  Pretty sure it's bad corporate strategy leading to inability to turn a profit, not the fact that we used to have half days before major holidays.  I can see taking away things like TripCash, Bonusly, etc, but the half days have been around FOREVER so I can't see how that really is going to make much difference.  Again, blaming the wrong things."

This was a few months after I had received a raise and praise from my supervisor. I was told to meet with the CTO and the woman from HR who coolly informed me of their decision. I had worked here for 3 years. Worked hard too. And I was given 30 minutes to exit the building.  My supervisor had no say in this. Apparently neither did the supervisor's supervisor.

I learned after that, while the people who stayed were still in shock, many perks were taken away. So not only do the people who were not laid off now have to shoulder the work of their teammates, now they don't even get the good stuff anymore. Good job Edmunds."

Benefits are above average, even with the changes to ROWE.","If you have to teach consumers how to use your website to access the most basic features - and we do - you've done website design totally wrong.  We consistently decide what WE want the website to be, and then expect users to conform to our wants and needs.  
The president told us at the beginning of the year to ""ignore the haters.""  Let that sink in.  Ignore criticism from the users of our website.
We have glitchy, buggy, and difficult-to-use products all over the website.  Attempting to get these fixed or altered to be consumer-friendly results in a, ""sorry, no resources for that,"" answer almost every time.   It's disrespectful to our consumers.

The elephant in the room - the layoffs.  It's understandable that companies go through swings and need to make adjustments.  What is entirely puzzling, and contributing to the lack of morale, is that plenty of good people, who bore no responsibility for decisions that led to our current state, were let go, while those who made and championed the poor decisions are still here... and further, are in leadership positions that will determine our future direction.

Much incompetence at highest ranks exploit and blame mid level, creating a world in which the minority of people do the majority of work.  There are many lifers that cling on to their position at the expense of new blood and dwell always first on why things cannot be done.  Many people have not had any other jobs for many many years with skills that would not be competitive in the open market; essentially many people suffer from ""this is how I have always done it"" syndrome.  No one is allowed to disagree and everyone gives empty false praises.  If you may expose the wrong person's mistakes or limitations, you are done -- ROWE or no ROWE.  This causes a scary reality that is very unaware of technology, market, and societal trends.  Finally, executive leadership give huge lip-service to treating employees like family; however, the minute revenue projections are even at risk or not being met, people not yet entrenched prove 100% dispensable even as incompetent lifers continue to just hang around, and layoff events are very unprofessional (that is where the perk reality ends)."

- CEO is a genuinely nice guy. Stay away from the Chairman. Can't speak for either of their business acumen.","To start, Edmunds is extremely top heavy. In fact, it seems there are more people with manager and director titles than engineers / analysts. Certain groups suffer more from this affliction than others but it seems pervasive at a company level. Titles are handed out based on politics and tenure alone. Things are run straight out of a community college MBA handbook.  And, as we all know, being a Manager or higher means you don’t touch a lick of work yourself so over half the company is inundated in perpetual ‘strategy’ meetings while the rest of the peasants do the actual work with little to no direction.

Waste is another issue. Positions are opened and filled without any consideration as to whether more resources are actually required. A large number of people sit around all day twiddling their thumbs. If you randomly fired 1 / 3 of the people at the company, I’m not sure anybody would notice after the initial 1-2 week chaos (this goes double for Directors, and triple for VP and up). Actually I have a suggestion: given how panicked the Execs get when we’re 1% below revenue budget, maybe you should follow the aforementioned advice. That’s an easy way to save a few million dollars per year. We might even be able to get our Bonusly budget up to a whopping $20 per month. I digress.

On the technology and innovation front, Edmunds is hit or miss depending on your group. Some groups do semi-cool things and some don’t. Some groups doing cool things will get reprioritized and roped into boringness based on the whims of executives. The company is very reactionary, even though it constantly touts that it can afford to think long term as a result of staying private.

Our implementation of ROWE is an absolute joke and you can easily ‘work from home’ multiple times per week and nobody would notice or care. ‘Urgency’ is one of our values but the only time I’ve seen true ‘Urgency’ here is when catered lunch goes out. Bottom line; stay here if you just want to coast. The company will probably keep making decent money (but that all goes to the Chairman). If you’re not very skilled then definitely take advantage of the Edmunds charity payroll. If you’re very talented then the pay is going to be significantly below market when compared to brand name tech companies. Edmunds is a place for subpar technical/product people to retire in a ruthlessly ambitious middle-management mediocrity."

The office is like nothing I had experienced in my previous employment ventures. However the perks and great scenery of the Santa Monica location fades like cheap wall paper. The training is mediocre at best to get started and you are a victim of products that don't work as well as the competitors. Sure the subscriptions are cheaper than Auto Trader, Cars and True Car, but in life you get what you pay for. The ideas are worn and dealers need a whole suite of products to get any results really. The management group is the worst I have ever dealt with. The management and upper executive positions change and turnover in a heart beat indicating a huge problem. ROWE is great but you always feel guilty to take any time off and if you are in sales you loose momentum with any breaks. The account managers  many times are way too slow to address issues and often their is a snowball effect, which hurts the customers since the subscription really does not work without the full suite of products. . Running reports and seeing dealer results are agonizing most months and for a business with a defined number of opportunities you are on borrowed time before the dealership realizes the return on investment regardless of the spin is often with half of the car brands at least poor."

Also, a drawback of being at a company that's been around for a while - some of the tasks I get assigned feel somewhat archaic and could really be simplified/eliminated as they're not really practical in this day and age.

-Work/Life balance is so easy to achieve. They allow you the freedom to build your own work life. You're judged by results achieved and not hours worked or face-time. And they actually MEAN it.

- Competitive pay: not the most important part of a job, but it sure doesn't hurt!

- The office is AWESOME. We have a popcorn machine, arcade games, soda machines, fruit, snacks, lunch, nap pods, an open-seating area, and a coffee bar that puts most cafes to shame. There's also a gym and tons of restaurants and food trucks in our building. Super convenient

- Challenging work and thoughtful managers. I'm constantly being asked what more I want to learn or get to work on. Feedback comes quickly so you rarely don't know where you stand. I feel CARED about here.

- Accessible Executives. There are no offices, so our Execs are literally out in the open and actually approachable. I was actually introduced to the President during my interviews as he passed by. It speaks to the openness/transparency of the company culture.

- This place loves to hear new ideas. Most companies hire you and then expect you to fall in line with how they do things, but Edmunds actively encourages you to bring your best practices and ideas to the company.","- Santa Monica/West Side traffic

Generally relaxed work environment, progressive vacation policy (which admittedly may not be for everyone). The CEO seems to genuinely care about creating a progressive company that takes care of their employees and being seen as a leader in that area.

Engineering is generally good, although somewhat dependent on the team. Developers get to work on reasonably up-to-date technologies and development practices (thanks to some brave work by predecessors of the current engineering leadership). There are relatively low levels of bureaucracy and the impediments to getting things done are normally due to lack of resources, which one would encounter at any company.","Edmunds has the money, industry knowledge, and technical expertise to build whatever they want, but they lack focus and commitment. The leadership of the company has trouble committing to something when there's no immediate and clear revenue opportunity. They can commit to A when B brings in the money, but have trouble with A to B to C where the money comes in at C. They then look at other companies who have been able to commit to something and made it to C, and ask 'why can't we do that?' Any signs of improvement in this area are probably just a result of seeing competitors' success and using that as a clear way forward.

The founder has no patience, gets distracted by every fancy article that he reads, and disrupts the company's tactical choices in every area.

Product managers at Edmunds have to roll with the punches. One week you might think you're doing the most meaningful work of your life and the next you'll be forced in a completely different direction. Edmunds talks the talk when it comes to A/B tests, UX, usability, NPS, etc, but they haven't figured out a transparent strategy to efficiently deliver product improvements based on those measurements.

Those at the highest level – but still controlling what happens on the product level –  are not product people, and seem incapable of assessing the company's products objectively. Unfortunately they need to be told by outsiders what's good or bad. They should get, or promote, a proper product leader and get out of the way (this will not happen)."

Wide variety of technology and a lot of smart people. It's a great place to learn. 

Results Only Work Environment (ROWE) provides a ton of flexibility in terms of being at the office. There really is no expectation that you be there every day, unless it's required for something specific you have going on that is better suited to being in person (e.g. presentation to executive team, etc.). 

Fun, open, engaging office environment. Tries to be a bit like Google offices - wide open spaces, bright colors, couches, TVs, ping pong, video games, free snacks + coffee, in-office happy hours, etc. 

Compensation is middle of the road. It's fair by most standards, but it's definitely not paying Google / Facebook / Amazon / other dot com type salaries. Then again, Edmunds is not those companies. So I list this as a pro instead of a con. Being paid fairly is a good thing, right? I mean, we'd all like $3M in stock options, but that's not really a fair barometer to judge all other companies by.","Note: I gave 5 stars despite the cons listed here because it's still a fun and engaging place to be, which is more than most people get from a job these days. That indicates ""Very Satisfied"", which I am. 

Probably the biggest concern - I don't have a lot of confidence that the strategies in play will result in long term growth, or even maintenance of current revenue. There's just nothing obvious that jumps out as ""hey, this is our 30% per year revenue growth engine"". It just feels a bit stagnant and grasping at straws to maintain current state. Hope I'm wrong, but it makes it feel like it's a short term spot for me.

Ton of turnover for a company of this size - seems like at least 1-2 people every week. Not necessarily a con, but usually an indicator of something bad.

The wide variety of technology mentioned as a pro also has a dark side - massive complexity, mostly unnecessary. There doesn't seem to be a unifying technology platform strategy; it's a huge patchwork of every open source technology that has been hot at some point over the last 5-7 years. 

It's a bit clicky, as some other reviewers pointed out, but that hasn't really been a problem for me. It's much like other places - there's a culture and personality type that naturally fits in and flourishes here. If you happen to be that type, you'll do well. If not, you'll probably feel like you're on the outside looking in.

It's a family run / owned business, so you have to deal with some arbitrary annoyances that you don't find at normal companies. For example, the elder Steinlauf (Chairman of the Board, son is CEO) roams the office, not appearing to do much, but more than once has unapologetically poked his head into important meetings (with Directors, VPs, etc.) for stupid reasons - he can't get into his email account (user error), or his wife's cell phone is acting up, etc."

When looking at jobs at Edmunds, realize that developers, engineers and Interns live in a completely different world then you inhabit as a Sales rep.  Edmunds is struggling to find an identity; are they a listing site or a research site. 
Even with the industry high base they are having a difficult time keeping people.  They are desperate to find sales reps that can start closing on day 1; so you have to have deep connections to get hired.  You will need them; its only your relationships that will keep customers.  Price cuts and free products have done little to stem the loss of customers.  There is no marketing of the product or company and you will receive little help from the executive team.  They are unapproachable and anything but transparent.  Fear and intimidation are the management tools.
The executive team is more focused on getting people fired than adding new business.  They take great pride and go through great lengths to get people to leave.  Remember, they are offering an Industry high base salary and people are still walking away!  The majority of people have been there less then 2 years and most have looked elsewhere; but they stay for the high base.  Look at all the reviews on Glassdoor; then subtract Interns, Software folks and every review written on August 1st and you will see a true picture of Edmunds.com.

270,Edmunds.com,"Culturally oppressive, Competitive.",2014-07-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great location, professional office arrangement, frequent visits from outside consultants who share relevant insights to push companies forward in times of change.","The biggest challenge that I see at the company is the lack of support for professional growth. When I was first hired, I remember being provided with a document which listed all the perks that this company offered. “Results only work environment, medical benefits, work and professional training” to name a few.  I was enthusiastic, ambitious, and felt excited at the prospect of actually working with a company that was fair to people in exchange for devoting periods of their life to assist the company in making profits. I was reminded constantly from friends in other well-known companies of how jaded people can become after putting in so much effort into their work just to realize that the efforts didn’t pay off, and that promises were not kept. I was convinced that this company was different and adopted a new way of living, of conducting business, of managing people. 
After working here for a short period, I began to see the true disconnect between those promises that were made and the behaviors of those actually managing the business. I witnessed senior level executives whispering negative remarks about other executives, witnessed executives take “walks” while they strategically discussed hiring and firing decisions. It was truly reminiscent of the TV show “Survivor” when people on the island formed “Alliances” to win the game. I was invited to meetings with executives to join in on the Alliances and encouraged to share negative feelings about my colleagues. I listened to them make negative remarks about the very people they shared lunch with during the day. I didn’t like any of it and felt that it was unprofessional and created distrust. I came to the realization that these behaviors are simply a byproduct of a culture that has developed long before I arrived, and due to fact that not many opportunities exist in the company for professional advancement enough to prevent people from being forced to create strategic alliances in the workplace. The company asks its staff to make a promise by writing down a promise on a “Promise Card” and asks it staff to place this on the company wall for everyone to see during the year. After the year ends, they reward the staff that kept those promises. Its titled “ A promise made is a promise kept”. Unfortunately, since the company does not deliver on its promises to its staff, it doesn’t deserve the reward of being highly rated."

Edmunds seems to be having an identity crisis. The company built its reputation as a great resource for consumers to find information and reviews about vehicles. Over the past couple years, the company has cheapened itself to more of an advertising/car buying oriented website and drastic organizational changes are made hastily every few months to try to compete with pure automotive buying/selling websites such as TrueCar.

Santa Monica office design

Many talented people (many underutilized)

The HR team is one of the best.

Edmunds could be a really great place to work long-term if some of the negative and inexperienced management were shed.","With the talent mentioned above, there is also a lot of dead weight. Too much middle management, many with little to no experience who aren't good, but have the right alliances. Politics weigh very heavily in certain departments. Overall, it's a very status quo place and I would often avoid telling people where I worked out of embarrassment because the website is such a fragmented and outdated experience.

I mention ROWE above in the Pros. HR has embraced it, some departments have embraced it, but many in management (both middle and upper) have not. Something to consider if it's a deciding factor in taking a position here or not. Many who have embraced ROWE as it was taught aren't looked upon favorably.

Touching upon the openness to new methodologies, it's much like a child at Christmas. Excited because something is new and fresh, then it's quickly discarded for whatever the next big thing is. It's not only impossible to keep up and stay enthusiastic. It ends up being a big waste of time and money. Pick something good and live with it. let it evolve for your specific uses.

To the point of my review title, Edmunds is a very ""design by committee"" environment. It is also very heavily driven by the product team and VPs. It felt like every opportunity to make positive change has been cut short, then there's a 180 degree pivot. When you pivot that many times, you obviously don't get very far.

There are also a number of executives that you find yourself wondering ""how on earth did they get this job?"" One, who will remain anonymous, was fired from their last job and endured a mutiny at their previous job because their team was so fed up with poor management. This person isn't doing any better by their employees at Edmunds, but is considered some kind of thought leader amongst their peers. Go figure."

The brand is tired and stale and there are no plans to do any marketing.  There is a giant disconnect from the home office and the sales force.   You can not expect huge jumps in product placement if you raise the price 500%.  When that doesn't work you ""force"" bundle the product; but what you don't understand is, nobody knows about the product!  Edmunds is barely  delivering on their existing products but there is an expectation to force the adoption of all the new products!  
The expectations for results is immediate and constant.  The goals for revenue is daunting and the financial pressure for retention is severe.  Fear and threats are common management tools, this comes from the top and filtered down to the ""middle"" managers.  Turnover is extremely high at Edmunds. For every 1 person they convince to stay 3 people leave.  
Be careful if you are thinking about working here. Read all the reviews on Glassdoor, research the average tenure of sales people form Edmunds on LinkedIn.  The sales side is completely different from the software side; a different world.  It's strange to see a company where 1 year is considered ""a long time""."

There have been some growing pains, but one thing that has never wavered is the company's commitment to employee satisfaction and work/life balance. The benefits are top notch and senior management is accessible and responsive. My career has flourished at Edmunds and I am grateful for the opportunities the company has given me to continue my education and develop my skills.

I've never seen an HR team work harder to take care of the people who work here. Amazing vacation policy, great work-life balance, fantastic benefits, super family-friendly environment, ongoing training, what else can I say? And an HR department who are approachable, earnest and here to support us. 
2. Innovative culture. Have a new idea? It's welcome here, and if it's a good idea 20 people will offer to help you make it happen.  From Product ideas to Process methodologies to new ways of getting feedback to employees, the management encourages and supports innovation from the troops (not just from the top). 
3. Incredibly high work standards. Some people on here clearly see this as a negative, and Edmunds is demanding. But it also means that we create products you can be proud of, and that under-performers are pushed out of the company (to the relief of the rest of us). 
4.  Family-friendly company.  This is a company where you can have a passionate, exciting career and have time & energy for your family as well.  No one frowns at you for taking a family vacation, making time to attend a child's play, or heading out early for a date with your spouse.  
5. Passionate, smart & compassionate management team.  The C-level execs who head up Edmunds  are the best I've ever worked with (and no, I'm not one of them). They're smart, well educated and will challenge you to do your best. They are focused on creating the best possible experience for our customers, even at the expense of the dealers/OEMs who pay our advertising.  And they are deeply concerned about the satisfaction and advancement of their employees.","Some major changes have taken place in the last 6 months, which have made this a much much better place to work.  In the past we had these problems: 
1. Bitter, disenfranchised employees who think they're entitled to promotions simply because of how many years they've been here.  Thankfully many of these have left, although we still have a few hanging around. I hope we can get the rest of them out before they can do harm to the happy people. Many of them seem to be posting reviews here, unfortunately. 
2. A long release process. Again, this has changed and we've gone from a multi-month (or even year) release cycle to a quick & efficient <monthly iteration. 
3. A cumbersome, slow infrastructure that prevented real innovation. Again, happily, we've fixed this problem which is allowing us to move quickly and actually see our ideas go live in a matter of weeks."

See below.","What makes Edmunds exasperating is the astoundingly myopic senior managment, 35-40 grossly overpaid project managers, HR keystroke spying, infrequent time to use your vacation, cliquey silos, someone else taking credit for your ideas, projects that span years, reactionary ever-changing corporate road maps, design-by-committee, top-heavy management, and an endless stream of worthless life-sucking meetings. There are meetings for planning, strategy, project kick offs, project recaps, burn-downs, advertising, sales, training, education, vaccinations, grief counseling, fire drills, harassment, ethics, morals, mentoring...truly a bottomless pit of meetings which everyone must attend and negatively affects their core product, morale and certainly the bottom line. There were (and I'm not kidding) meetings ABOUT MEETINGS. Add to that a slew of tri-annual mandatory off-site meetings where you must arrive at the LA Convention Center at  8am to listen to a monotone CFO ramble on for hours about operating margins, unique cookies, capitol expenditures, and bonuses that are rarely doled out. Edmunds prefers to waste their coffers on inept VP saleries and severely overpriced data centers and bloated Engineering costs.  This 400 person company could honestly be run better with 20 people, an Amazon Cloud stack and Joomla!. 

If the owners would stop the buck, they could give out bonuses but they do not know how and at the end of the day, almost nobody in Senior managment really knows that much about building a website.
