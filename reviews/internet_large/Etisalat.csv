Nowadays, company is so focused on sales primarily and some specific rules that staff are getting crazy on how they’re going to achieve their targets due to the fear of being terminated. However, company set a lot of rules and makes a lot of changes in terms of customer requirements when applying on a service. Hence, creating a lot of errors on staff side.
Aside from that, they continue to hire incompetent managers who has no experience nor idea on how to manage their staff.
Being a counter staff for quite a long time is not good because not only you’ll get used on your comfort zone but having such a small salary will not help anyone in the long run given that there’s no career path contrary to what the company is claiming."
