4,Eventbrite,Very little executive confidence,2022-03-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice People, Location in San Francisco","Leadership is all over the place, Unorganized, Not Transparent"
5,Eventbrite,Excellent Culture,2022-03-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I wish all companies had the type of culture that Eventbrite has. They spend a lot of time and effort selecting the type of employees that fit their amazing culture and it makes working their extremely enjoyable and motivating.,Some of the sparkle did start to fade working for the company once that went public and their demands intensified but that can be expected of any publicly traded company.
6,Eventbrite,One of the best companies to work for in 2022 and beyond,2022-02-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Extremely talented and smart colleagues 
-The product has evolved more in this past year than it has in the history of Eventbrite. It's an exciting time—lots of forward-thinking change
-By far, one of the best companies to work for right now. The Org truly cares about employee career growth and mental wellness. I joined about a year and a half ago, so things may have been different before my time, but I'm allll here for it. 
-The org has invested in building culture across global teams and it's paying off. 
-Leadership is held accountable via employee engagement surveys. They are fast to address feedback and follow through with solutions that stick. 
-Incredible health benefits / Unlimited PTO / First Fridays off every month",-Change never happens without some struggle. There's a lot of technical debt to be worked through (but something we're actively working towards)
7,Eventbrite,"Great Company, Great Leadership",2022-02-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great benefits and work environment,Entry level salary could be better

Great culture and work -life balance
Excellent benefits
Generous leave policy
Motivated and Supportive people","Nothing as of today, will revisit as we continue to grow here"
9,Eventbrite,Growth,2022-02-05,4.0,Anonymous Employee,There was a fun energetic vibe in the office. Room for growth professionally.,There were growing pains as the Company expanded quickly
10,Eventbrite,Great place to work,2022-02-01,5.0,Senior Data Scientist,"The pay and benefits are great, we get the first Friday of every month off, and everyone I've worked with so far is exceptional. There is a culture of ownership and I feel empowered to make a difference without a lot of bureaucracy.","The only con is that everyone else is so exceptional, I feel like I need to excel just to be average. Not a bad problem to have!"
11,Eventbrite,"Great company culture, tech in need of modernization",2022-01-31,4.0,Senior Backend Software Engineer,"The best part of Eventbrite is the company culture and the support employees receive. There's a very good work/life balance, and I see a lot more respect for this compared to other places I've worked. There's also a very vocal emphasis on creating a welcoming and diverse company culture - it doesn't mean Eventbrite always hits the mark, but I still appreciate that it's a clear emphasis that I see taking action to hit their D&I goals. I also have a lot of opportunities to drive the direction of my own work, which is something I love as an engineer.","It's not the most modern tech stack and a lot of the tech is tied to internal libraries which can be more difficult to work with compared to the more commonly used open source alternatives, but the company is working on modernizing and I'm hopeful this will improve with time"
12,Eventbrite,"Great benefits, company does care about its employees",2022-01-20,4.0,User Experience Researcher,"Awesome benefits like unlimited PTO, wellness stipend, WFH stipend, great health insurance, good work life balance",Messy top level management with lack of direction at times. Great potential to become a great product but poor internal operations make things move inefficiently
13,Eventbrite,work at EB Cork,2022-01-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,it was great to work at Eventbrite. Very strong positive culture,None really. It was great.
14,Eventbrite,Truly walking the walk,2022-01-10,5.0,Senior Business Development Manager,"Many employers talk the talk, very few walk the walk. Eventbrite walks the walk and I'm thrilled to be on the team!

To name a few of the pros...

- Work/life balance and support to achieve it
- Genuine flexibility
- Lots of support for families
- Very welcoming environment that encourages you to be your authentic self
- Hybrid working - you choose where you work
- No micromanaging
- When we're in the office, it's always stocked with supplies and has beautiful views","There are very few cons to working for Eventbrite. I would suggest the only one is the time difference between global offices (US, UK and AUS) and the challenges that it poses. Everyone tries to manage the difference as much as possible to mitigate meetings outside of hours, however the AUS team misses out on attending US presentations as they happen while we're sleeping. Hopefully after covid we'll have the opportunity to travel to the US and see the presentations/leaders in person."
15,Eventbrite,Awesome company to work for!,2022-01-06,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Autonomy, Flexibility, Culture, Time off policy, Transparent",I don't have any cons!
16,Eventbrite,Great company - would recommend,2022-01-05,4.0,Senior CSM,"Ample career development opportunities, talented and kind colleagues, internal mobility and follow through from leadership. I've never seen a business hire so many thoughtful and smart people.","The strategic direction of the business changed frequently (though I believe this is being corrected after feedback in 2020), frequent org structure changes, poorly executed M+A strategy."
17,Eventbrite,Best place to work!,2022-01-05,5.0,Customer Service Specialist,There is a sense of community and management go out of their way to help and understand your needs as an individual so that you can achieve your goals with a set clear path. The team is amazing and we have great clients to work with once you understand your role the skies the limit.,The site could do with better updates but other than that non come to mind.
18,Eventbrite,Ok until Fired,2021-12-31,3.0,Customer Service Representative (CSR),"Great people, benefits, and space.",Too corporate and not enough recognition.
19,Eventbrite,A wolf in sheep's clothing,2021-12-22,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Salary and benefits package : Health insurance, pension plan, life insurance, etc. are offered in Madrid.
- There is a lot of freedom with schedules, which also implies problems.","- Although the stack is starting to modernize, there is still an unassuming amount of technical debt.
- The number of meetings you can have can be overwhelming.
- Improvement plans are disguised layoffs.
- Some layoffs are not even notified.
- If you are a manager, stay as far away from Eventbrite as possible. The average duration of a manager in Madrid is 6 months.
- Not only managers are burned out but also ICs
In the last internal survey more than 40% of employees responded negatively to the question ""I rarely think about looking for a job at another company"".
A very similar number of employees answered negatively to the question ""I see myself working at Eventbrite in two years time"".
- They try to make believe that there is a work-life balance while forcing their employees to work on-call 24x7
- In addition, certain meetings are held at ungodly hours and their usefulness is questionable.
- Complete opacity of salary ranges
- be very careful with the reviews you read. management has changed with many Amazon roles and their style of working (the one in the bottle, if you know what I mean).
- Every 3 months you will be writing feedback from you and your colleagues.
- the HR team is focused on DEI, which honestly doesn't affect me, having all the problems outlined above

I'm sure I'm leaving out more cons, if you think they are not true contact Linkedin with any IC in Madrid and ask them directly."
20,Eventbrite,"Lovely team, great benefits but too many changes",2021-12-03,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The people is amazing
- Great perks and benefits
- The teams are great
- Good opportunities for career progression","- Too many changes from leadership.
- Way too ambitious with their growth plan, it's taking a toll on the employees, especially in non-tech, which always end being neglected in tech companies anyway so it's not surprising."
21,Eventbrite,Customer Success Specialist,2021-11-30,5.0,Customer Success Specialist,"Great team to work with, clear objectives and a smooth experience navigating the company!","No cons at all, has been a great experience!"
22,Eventbrite,Amazing benefits and work culture,2021-11-27,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Great benefits: the best healthcare coverage of any company I've worked at
- Good work/life balance: ""Take the time you need"" unlimited vacation policy; people actually use it; managers encourage you to take time off
- Positive learning environment: Lots of mentoring from senior engineers and peers; other engineers always quick to help you learn / debug / pair program

The benefits & work culture at Eventbrite is the best of any company I've worked at. I had an issue with my benefits coverage and reached out to the Eventbrite team a year after I had already left the company - they went above and beyond to help me resolve it, even after I had already left the company. Eventbrite takes work culture very seriously and really prioritizes their employees.",Some growing pains as the engineering team scaled

28,Eventbrite,Great Place to Work,2021-10-07,5.0,Senior IOS Developer,"- good pay and perks
- stock
- take the time you need vacation policy
- 100% remote is an option as long as you are in the same country as the job listing
- great coworkers that are fun and interesting
- the leadership is concerned with more than just $$$. They do the right thing even if it isn't always profitable.
- very diverse and there are systematic rules set in place to make it more so.","I honestly can't think of anything, it's the best place I've ever worked."
29,Eventbrite,Sr Prod Manager,2021-10-05,3.0,Senior Product Manager,time off and flexible working hours,"Big company, hard to push for changes"
30,Eventbrite,Great group of people,2021-09-19,4.0,Software Engineer,"Excellent people, really good company culture. Great CEO!","Company is lacking in diversity, particularly in management. Pay was lower than other companies in the area."
31,Eventbrite,"Good People, Questionable Strategy",2021-08-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great office culture, fun people to work with. Challenging problems to solve.",Corporate direction changes with the wind. CFO made $10mm the same year they laid off half the company.
32,Eventbrite,Avoid this company,2021-08-20,1.0,Manager,"Honestly, I’m not sure I can find any pros for this outfit. The only thing they have going for them is their reach, but it’s dwindling fast as other companies catch up and surpass them in all regards, culture, product, strategy. Also, you are free to be awful at your job and do almost zero work if the right people (CEO and minions) like you.","Eventbrite is what is known as a sycophantic culture. You MUST drink the very scary orange cool aid aggressively pushed into your face from the CEO all the way down to the sheep like ICs. It’s very disturbing. If you don’t chug it and finish with a cheeky orange grin, you are ostracized. Even worse, if you speak up and/or raise an idea contrary to the company line, you are put out to pasture, ignored, excluded and ultimately made useless. I’ve never seen an organization that is so roundly dysfunctional and brainwashed. The irony is that they champion their “culture,” but it is little more than window dressing, the core of which is forced indoctrination with a splash of frivolous and ultimately valueless “perks.” Leadership is a hot mess and in way over their heads. Strategy is non-existent. Merit is ignored, while high school level cliques and favoritism reign. Again, another irony being that good ideas and novel thoughts are pushed aside despite the dire need for innovation and a fresh perspective. 

No sour grapes here. I only lasted a few months because I saw the writing on the wall early. Not to mention that they have abandoned some of the very most important players in the event space for who knows what reason after making the pandemic an excuse to cut most of the company lose to make up for horrendous business decisions (TicketFly acquisition). Sound like Silicon Valley disaster? Sound like the type of solid future you’d like to be a part of? You’d be better off joining a cult. No wonder that most of the bright people left or were pushed out. What remains is a weak group of groveling boot lickers. 

Don’t join this company."
33,Eventbrite,Eventbrite in Argentina,2021-08-12,5.0,Director of Engineering,"Good People, good balance work/personal, culture around feedback, career oportunities, coworkers around the world (people in Madrid, SF and Nashville), international company, product people embebbed within teams, UX and Data within teams, decision making within team. Facilities are great (if there's a need to go back to office).","The business right now it's messy because of Covid, once it's normal will be great."
34,Eventbrite,Easily the best place to work,2021-08-11,5.0,Product Design,"Eventbrite has excellent values that they actually live by.
They put their users above all else. 
Team members are treated like family.
Extremely generous PTO and benefits.
We are encouraged to take time off to better our communities.
There's ample room for growth.","Like anywhere, there are opportunities for improvements in communication between teams and different segments of the business. That said, leadership is always working on ways to improve in this area."
35,Eventbrite,Great Experience,2021-08-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The work and office culture were phenomenal; it was a classic tech startup with all the benefits you'd imagine.,"This was a business that was going through mountains of changes, so I sat there as plenty of employees were let go and strategies were altered by the hour. If you weren't malleable, you weren't going to cut it."
36,Eventbrite,Mixed Bag,2021-07-27,4.0,Sales BDM,"Free lunch

38,Eventbrite,Great place to work,2021-07-15,5.0,Senior Business Development Manager,"Takes cares of employees, great product, great culture",Pricing of product is difficult in market.
39,Eventbrite,Cliqueish and cultish environment,2021-06-30,3.0,Client Success Manager,"Excellent benefits, exciting industry, innovative approaches to old and new ideas for solving age-old ticketing dilemmas. Generous PTO and perks. Exciting, sometimes out-of-the-blue or unexpected activities that break up the work week. Financing to accomplish objectives. Had some great clients and seemed to be on an upswing pre-Covid.","Employees are referred to as ""britelings""

Quarterly employee evaluations and reviews cause more problems than they correct for both managers and teams. These create mountains of busy-work when actual work should be being accomplished. This causes a major backlog and stressful situation for managers like clockwork every quarter especially for those who have larger teams. Time consideration is not given to managers who lead teams of fifteen versus those who lead two. 

A very millenial-oriented and egocentric take on the ticketing industry. Company has the sort of attitude that they know best even though they're a relatively new kid on the block to the industry. This causes them to make some foolish decisions and purchases. It also causes the employee whiplash as they're asked to sprint in one direction, only to be asked to sprint in the opposite direction in a coming quarter.

Lots of virtual high-fives and shaming through social media platforms. People are promoted because they are praised by their clique or shamed because their 'like' count is too low.

Have alienated many great people and clients the company has acquired over time. Pre-Covid had been moving full steam in one direction only to do a complete about-face when the industry took a downturn. Company seemed to just throw their hands up and abandon that direction and a significant chunk of their clients when things got tough. I can understand that they wanted to focus on the core of their business to stay afloat during the hard times but to clients and staff it seems that they just abandoned the work and promises of the previous several years leaving everyone in the lurch."

41,Eventbrite,Basically a private school for adults.,2021-06-16,1.0,Customer Success Representative,"Catered lunches, modern offices, table tennis, and other generic tech company distractions.","Diversity and inclusion is non-existent. Senior leaders proudly joked that there were no POC's in the office (even used the term ""Event-White"" to describe the business).

47,Eventbrite,Sad to see them hiring roles they laid off in Nashville and not reaching out to the people they laid off,2021-06-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,I'm glad they've been able to survive the pandemic.,They laid off 50% of the organization at the beginning of the pandemic and as they've recovered they've posted some of the roles that they had let go and haven't been reaching out to people who held that role to see if they are interested. I just think that's a sad way to treat people especially knowing that they had great talent here.

72,Eventbrite,Great place to expand your skillset,2021-02-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Eventbrite is a great place to expand your skillset and transition upward or into other areas of the business. You have the opportunity to work with many different teams on many different projects which gives you the opportunity of exposure to senior leaders or E-Staff. 

Overall, the company genuinely cares about the employees and is definitely a very employee-friendly workplace. Some of the benefits employees once loved have taken a hit since our offices are closed due to COVID, but I'm personally appreciative of the fact they are prioritizing our safety and not forcing us to return to an office before it is safe to do so. They've been working on getting creative with the WFH benefits but they are definitely not fair and consistent across the company (employees in California receive a monthly WFH stipend but no one else outside of California receives this). 

For the most part, the people are all very creative, resilient, friendly, intelligent, and wonderful to work with. The company really does have some fantastic people and the culture was amazing before the pandemic took a toll. The company is still healing from layoffs last April but I genuinely enjoy the majority of the people within my team and other teams I collaborate with.","You have to be VERY scrappy, agile, and comfortable with change to succeed here. It is an everchanging environment and most teams are stretched very thin due to the impact of the pandemic on the industry resulting in layoffs last year. If you are not able to multitask, be agile and autonomous, or you're uncomfortable with the continuous change you will not succeed here. Work / life balance can be a struggle at times and some teams are able to take more time than others. The company and most leaders encourage employees to take time off but it can be difficult to do so or lead you to feel guilty when you know your team is stretched so thin. 

A lot of opportunity for growth and internal mobility but you have to really fight for it and advocate for yourself. Unless you have a leader that goes above and beyond to fight for it for you, you won't progress much unless you're extremely proactive. The company does not offer much support on internal mobility resources and opportunities are a bit scarce right now."

89,Eventbrite,Worse for your mental health than an entry-level job at Goldman Sachs,2020-12-21,2.0,Account Manager,You may advance quickly - I was promoted two times in a year due to high turnover,"If you are client-facing, those clients will constantly be angry with you, and they will have the right to be. During my time at Eventbrite, we did everything to lose trust, credibility, and honor with these people. Every promised feature was late. When it came, it wasn't complete. When it was completed, it wasn't like we told them it would be. When they were angry, we threw money at them (as we did during a renewal as well). 

Unsurprisingly, the external situation affected the internal situation in a negative way. Large chunks of my colleagues left for greener pastures. I've never seen turnover at this rate anywhere - not even close. The people that stayed took on all of the load from their departed co-workers, they became moody, and the office became a depressing place. By the time that HR was able to fill those roles (which sometimes took months), more people had left, more work was carried by even fewer hands, and the downward spiral continued down.

This is the past of course - I have no idea if lessons will or have been learned. But I toughed it out for two and a half years and held on hoping for that change. It did not come, and I wouldn't bet on it for the future."

Senior and manager people who were hired just 3 weeks ago from other top companies are also being fired. People who's been there for more than 7 years also. It's crazy what it's happening.

But it is not surprising. The level of expenses are high and the margin of ticketing is very low. They are wasting A LOT of money and the fastest way to reduce them is to fire people.

Holidays need to be worked, and while the holiday pay is nice, it kinda sucks almost drawing straws to see who gets stuck on their computer on a holiday. I'm not sure what the fix is for that, and it may just be the peril of working customer service, but it's worth mentioning.

-There's been a major lack of clarity on the state of the company since it wen't public. The vibe is that things are not going to plan. Some high profile folks have left for reasons that don't seem genuine, and we've reorganized in different ways a few times. The higher ups swear everything is fine, but that feels suspect.

163,Eventbrite,"Great Culture,  Mission and Work Life Balance",2019-03-12,4.0,Brand Designer,"A very welcoming and fun culture with opportunities to grow and learn. Everyone here is very passionate about all aspects of live events and believes in our mission.

Great work-life balance.

Hard working colleagues who care.","No clear path of how to be promoted within and what my career path looks like at Eventbrite.

Lack of meeting rooms and quiet places in work in the SF office. 

The office tends to feel chaotic."
164,Eventbrite,"Problems at Vancouver office potentially saved by Eventbrite brand, but history of toxic culture and high turnover",2019-03-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Eventbrite has a positive brand and culture and will likely try to improve local reputation.

- Fun space to work in: events.","Do extra research and reference checks if you're looking at a job at this office. While Eventbrite has a workplace brand of being inclusive, diverse, and supportive, this office has a reputation of something quite different. The Eventbrite Vancouver office came from the acquisition of a Vancouver startup called Picatic. That team and its leadership are still intact there, but was wrought with high turnover and toxic workplace culture for years. Here are some specific examples:

- Extremely high turnover and so many disgruntled former employees. In the last 2 years leading to the Picatic acquisition by Eventbrite, for example about 70% of the people hired to do sales, marketing, or support (the half of the company not coding full time on the core product) left in frustration or were abruptly fired. You'd never get a genuinely convincing reason why they quit or were fired, they'd never visit the office, you'd see them remove Picatic from their LinkedIn bios, you'd see them write insinuating comments around the web about it being a mediocre job, and you'd even see them leave disgruntled comments on the management team's social media posts. The origin story of the company was rarely shared because it's full of burned bridges. It was so painful.

- Not diverse, not supportive. For example, no women were hired or could be retained as employees. Many times, you would hear people's opinions be insulted out loud in front of other teams or colleagues. If an opinion wasn't the same as management's, often you would be ganged up on. Over time, everyone just started sucking up because other opinions and debate were so dangerous.

- These aren't just fixable skills, like hiring, managing, firing, defining job responsibilities, etc, but systematic problems. Also being able to say that the company was acquired (though really acqui-hired to the detriment of many people) probably only gives them validation that how they were doing things is ok, so they are unlikely to change.

- Look at roles at other offices, or just hold off 6 months and see if things and office leadership dramatically change."
165,Eventbrite,"Great coworkers, great culture, and interesting challenges - what more could you ask for?",2019-03-10,5.0,Engineering,"Great career opportunities here - lots of intracompany mobility. There are a lot of really tenured engineers at Eventbrite because people like the work culture, their coworkers, and with all of the opportunities within the company there's always an interesting next project.",Dev environment and release process need improvements. There's still a lot of work to be done to break out of the monolithic codebase.
166,Eventbrite,Best place I have ever worked,2019-03-08,5.0,Software Engineer,"- We have a great educational culture.  For me, the most important thing I was looking for was investment in my engineering education, and that's happened on both a team/manager level and department wide.  We have many internal educational programs (lectures, workshops, funding for conferences and educational materials, mentorship program, access to Udemy courses, etc), and my managers have been fully supportive of helping me transition to fullstack engineer.  I mean, I am working right now with one of the founders on Django on an educational project.  That's so awesome in and of itself.

- We have a great engineering culture.  We have a healthy culture of feedback and discussion - I feel like we are always discussing the best way to accomplish things, and people are really passionate about finding the right way forward that's the best for everyone.

- I really believe in the product and mission.  Our goals are to help create live experiences as well as support our event creators, which is something I can definitely get behind, having been an event planner in a previous life.

- I get to bring my whole self to work, and get to do all the things I'm interested in.  I'm not only interested in coding - I also love education and diversity initiatives, and have been allowed work time to accomplish things like an internal mentorship program and bringing diverse groups into our space.

- We have a great culture overall. Management is celebratory of the work we do, without being too over the top and flashy (unlike some other companies in the area).  We have lots of great internal events as well.  Also, I really feel like management cares about both the employees and customers.  Management is constantly asking for feedback and acting upon it.

- I have lots of opportunity for growth and promotion, and options available to pursue the career path I want - either continuing to be an individual contributor or go into management.  I've also had multiple directors across different departments take interest in my career growth and offer their help.  

- I feel like I'm being paid very fairly and there are great benefits.  Good medical, and lots of really nice perks around the office - smoothie bar, in house massages/chiro, lunch is provided, snacks, commuting benefits, wellness stipend, etc.

- I am really listened to by my manager and upper management.  I was rather unhappy on a project due to extenuating circumstances, and was switched to a different project that was more in line with what I want to accomplish.  All of which I feel very grateful for.

- Good work-life balance.  Sometimes there's a project deadline and people have to work really hard to get stuff out of the door, but in general managers are really respectful of work life balance.  We also have a really good culture of being flexible with time off and working remote.

- I get to build cool stuff, working for our R&D department.

- The interview process was one of the best I've ever been through.  They were willing to meet me where I was at (being a junior engineer), and my first phone screen was with a director, not a recruiter.  That really left a lasting impression on me.

- Lastly, the people.  I LOVE the people I get to work with - they are so incredibly knowledgeable, kind, and supportive.  Also, just really freaking cool.  Everyone has something that they are passionate about, both inside and outside of work.  I have met so many amazing and inspiring people at work, and genuinely feel like I have made friends.  This is probably one of the biggest factors of what's going to keep me around for a long time.

All in all, I can't recommend Eventbrite enough.  I love it here, plain and simple.","The internal development environment has been really difficult to work with in the past - lots of lost time and productivity.

We don't have an official QA department.  That sometimes is a bit concerning.

Sometimes our internal culture isn't as cohesive as I would like - both SF wide and engineering as well.  I do feel connected to other offices, as we have had opportunity to visit and work with each other which I feel grateful for.  But I thankfully have friends across all the departments, which makes it feel a lot smaller."

184,Eventbrite,Making an Impact not just on Events but Me,2018-11-05,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"They weren't kidding when they advertise the 'take the time you need' policy. Even being a newer employee, they respect when you need to take some time off. The perks around wellness, meals being catered, a stocked kitchen, great benefits, are all legitimate. The onboarding experience was one of the best experiences I'd ever had and was extremely relevant to my role. Further, there is a clear understanding of growth in my role in how I can continue to expand my knowledge and leverage my talents to impact the company as well as my career. I also truly appreciate the obvious investments made in its employees (continuing education leveraging Udemy, internal training opportunities, etc.)","Nothing immediate comes to mind. With any company that is growing rapidly, there can be some pain points but I think due to the transparency of the CEO and its leaders, they do their best to get ahead of it. Recently the company endeavored on some reorganization. That hasn't been easy. But again, leaders have tried to be ahead of it. Compensation can always be a bit more realistic to the cost of living and the changing times. But, I'm grateful I have a job in the first place!"
185,Eventbrite,Are We Really Happy?,2018-10-29,4.0,Engineer,"* The management has really improved over the last year. I think Eventbrite actually tries hard to make sure employees are happy, but there is something missing and hence a handful of good people already left.
* Great work-life balance.
* Some of the smartest and kindest people. There is a few people who are not that good but there is few of them.
* Free lunches
* Work across the world as there is more acquisitions if you are lucky
* Unlike salary, benefits are pretty good","* Pay quite below the average for engineers
* If you are one of the hire up favorites, your concerns are more likely to be addressed. Same goes in engineering. Not much gets done unless you are one of the people who is ""respected"". It's a bit biased to be honest.
*  As someone already mentioned, behind that good exterior there is hidden lies and lack of enthusiasm."

193,Eventbrite,Horrible 2-Year Experience,2018-08-13,1.0,Manager,"Usual perks: free food/snacks, coffee, health benefits, nice office","I quit Eventbrite as soon as I was able.  Despite the nice office/perks and facade of a ""fun company culture"", I did not enjoy working at Eventbrite.  Don't be fooled by all the hyped 5-star reviews by entry-level new hires who don't know any better (yet).

1.  Senior leader(s) of my department created a toxic, uncomfortable working environment.  Complained to me about my own peers/colleagues, putting them down behind their backs.  I've never experienced such unprofessionalism, and I was really disappointed about this.  Given how frequently this happened, it was very hard to trust my managers:  seeing them pretend to care about an employee, only to turn around the next moment and complain about them.  I don't doubt that they've done the same to me. 

2.  Unappreciative.  Leaders take their most diligent employees for granted.  Constantly made heavy demands of the team to meet deadlines, but did NOT take the time to understand whether we had enough resources.  Because of this, team would kill themselves working long hours just to hit deadlines, and management WON'T go out of their way to acknowledge dedication and hard work.  On the other hand, if anything is less-than-perfect, then fingers ARE pointed and you'll get facetime with upper management to talk about what they don't like about you or your work.

3. No actual work/life balance.  I was expected to return emails/calls in the evenings at home and while I was on vacation.  I felt judged by my leaders whenever I asked to take any of my ""unlimited PTO"", even though I took less PTO than most others on my team.  They were definitely counting days and letting you know they didn't like it.

4. Clique-y and cultist culture.  Like a few others here have written, if you don't live and breathe Eventbrite, you don't fit in.  Managers show favoritism."

Some things stayed good throughout the difficulties - good coworkers, good work/life balance, a positive atmosphere, and the priceless opportunity to work alongside the talented and hilarious Randy Befumo.","HR is still getting back on its feet, so a lot of the issues on that side are still not under control.  Benefits are good, but salaries still aren't competitive against similarly-sized companies in the Bay Area.  

A lot of folks are operating like we're still a startup underdog, but others expect us to act like a huge, cautious company.  That tension can be confusing and leads to mixed messages from our leaders.  Not everyone in a leadership position is qualified or ready to lead other people, so be prepared to lean on their peers for help.

We were largely centralized in SF for a really long time, so the transition to being a global company with teams spanning continents has been a tricky one.  I think we will get there, but it's a painful thing to navigate while we figure it out."

Working at Eventbrite helps me feel like I'm accomplishing meaningful product output and contributing to an overall organization that knows what its goals are and where it is heading into the future. Not to mention, Eventbrite excels at offering not just competitive, but truly phenomenal benefit packages, work/life balance and options to work-from-home, catered daily lunch (plus breakfast & snack options!), continued learning and growth opportunities, and more. The leadership from the top down to my own people manager is positive, personalized, and inspiring. I love working here!","It's hard to think of anything that's ""wrong"" here. Would higher pay be nice? Of course (when would it not be?). Would additional benefits like a student loan repayment program be helpful? Yes. However, there is already so much offered, it feels greedy to ask for more. That being said, I have very clear goals and objectives, so that I know when the time comes, I can point to everything I've accomplished and that could open the door to a discussion about compensation. It's not something that's ""taboo"" or off limits. Eventbrite wants me to grow.

The company is growing quickly! It's difficult to keep up with everything happening, so I think there could be some focused new-hire training/education on all the various teams and departments. This would provide insights into what everyone across the company is working towards and accomplishing."

Every team does seem to be in the same goal of advancing the business, but everyone also has specific metrics they need to hit to be credited for advancing the business - which can be confusing."
216,Eventbrite,"Yes, it really is as amazing as it sounds!",2018-06-02,5.0,Contracts Administrator,"During my application process, I read just about every review on Eventbrite's Glassdoor page - and from the minute I walked in for my interview, I saw the positive vibes in action. I've now been with the company for a little over two months, and every day I wake up even more excited to come to work. There are many, many pros to working at Eventbrite (hello, endless La Croix, delicious and healthy catered lunch, employer-paid healthcare and a host of other perks that simply make life easier), but the best part is being surrounded by super smart and driven people who really love what they do. I also really appreciate the push for strong communication and personal/professional development. Finally, as a woman, I have been incredibly impressed and motivated by the strong female leadership at Eventbrite, both within my team and company-wide.","Not really a con but a general comment - it's not all ping pong tables and free snacks. I've found the work/life balance to be great (and that balance is VERY encouraged), but this is not a place for people who just want punch the clock. However, if you're looking for a place where you will be pushed out of your comfort zone, encouraged to dig deep and learn about many different facets of a business, Eventbrite is it!"

- Good compensation and benefits, lunches and snacks provided 
- Mostly flexible working conditions","- This isn't the workplace for people who just want to coast by, and management can be brutal on under-performers
- Offices outside the U.S. are still outside of the loop on a lot of things, and communication lags behind. It can be difficult getting assistance from the U.S. teams on anything."

They were very welcoming during the interview process and had a great training program to get me ramped up.

227,Eventbrite,Best Place to work in Nashville,2018-05-22,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"I don't think you can find a better place to work in Nashville.  The people are genuine and make work fun, but also push you to do your best and be competitive- the ""Work hard, play hard"" attitude is alive every single day you walk through the doors.  The perks are just a bonus on top of that- amazing free lunch every day, dogs in the office, generous time off policy, work from home capability- and that's just the beginning.  I'm immensely proud to be a Briteling and still get excited that I work here.","There are a lot of changes as expected with a growing company, but sometimes I feel the communication could be better.  They do a great job with overall company updates and communication on growth, but sometimes the updates on what matters most to our day-to-day duties are kept in the shadows for a little bit too long by management.  Compensation may be below market, but there are so many other benefits and perks that make up for it, and it is definitely something that has been given attention."
228,Eventbrite,Couldn't be happier with where I am!,2018-05-16,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Eventbrite has an incredible workplace environment. I feel genuinely cared about and valued not only within my own team and office but across the company as a whole. My coworkers are my closest friends and I spend so much time with them outside of work.

The company is growing at a rapid rate and it is incredible to be a part of. I truly feel that I am contributing to that growth in a very real way. From my manager all the way up the chain, there is a consistency and transparency regarding my role, expectations and future opportunities. 

The benefits are incredible. Catered lunch every day, happy hours in the office regularly, and a full fridge and snack drawers. Quarterly office-wide parties and celebrations.

There is a great balance between accountability and freedom to control the work that you do on a daily basis.","Very difficult to find Cons. With any growing company, when changes and growth occur there can be some shifting in responsibilities within roles. Managers are effective in communicating these changes with the altering expectations."

I'm really excited about the future of this global company and I'm happy to be along for the ride!","Compensation tends to be on the lower end in this market, but benefits package is great.

Do your job and enjoy all the great benefits (health insurance, catered in lunch, unlimited snacks, unlimited PTO),  So happy to be working for this company and excited to be a part of where we're headed as a team.",can't think of any
239,Eventbrite,On an upswing,2018-04-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Through my time at Eventbrite there have been ups and downs, as I think is natural for a company that is rapidly growing and changing. I would currently say we're at a significant upswing based on recent positive changes made to the business.

It feels good to be at a company that consistently wins- we acquire our largest competitors, are at the forefront of innovation in ticketing, and consistently push the envelope. The business is strong and growing and the future looks bright. That success allows us to reinvest in things that matter for the business.

Our physical office locations around the world are top notch - from sweeping views in our Amsterdam office to the typical ""tech perks"" in San Francisco, there is no shortage of good vibes in the environment. The company benefits are very fair and the new 401k match is an exciting improvement. The recent work HR did to relevel comp according to market rate was a much needed remedy to our historically below-market pay. It finally feels more equitable to the rest of the tech world in San Francisco.

The leadership culture is evolving for the better as well. I feel proud to work for Julia and believe she is an empathetic leader who truly cares about each employee (especially welcomed in the current ""me too"" political climate). It's a relief to say that Eventbrite has reinvigorated our HR leadership to be more active in shaping company culture and addressing personnel issues.

Work/life balance here is the best of any company I have ever worked for. Time off is not only ok, it is respected (i.e. you won't be expected to work from the beach), and being able to get home at a reasonable hour most days is such a gift.","As with any company at this stage of growth, there are times when priorities shift abruptly or things seem to be moving very quickly. There are also longtime employees who are no longer effective or mesh well with current culture, but are kept around for historical knowledge, which is frustrating."
240,Eventbrite,Eventbrite is the best company I've ever worked for.,2018-04-18,5.0,Software Engineer,"Amazing people to work with, great lifestyle, great healthcare, good other perks.",Pay should be better.

I have also been impressed with how welcoming everyone is especially with new employees. If you have a question, don't hesitate to ask. Lastly, our CEO is awesome. Each time she speaks, I come away feeling inspired. She is genuine and brilliant at the same time. The empathetic leadership she displays is such a big motivator for me. While we are trying to build a business, I certainly feel she cares about the people that work for her. She is amazing!","With any company experiencing the type of growth we have in a short time, there are challenges along the way. Some of our HR processes can use refining.

245,Eventbrite,Engineers beware,2018-04-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,- Catered lunch 4 days a week,"Of course, a lot of these reviews are biased based on people's experiences. If you're an engineer, I would encourage you to carefully read all of the reviews and consider who wrote these reviews before you make a decision on whether or not to join this company.

- Even though I had expressed concerns about my career growth and offered my help to come up with a path for growth multiple times, my manager never once discussed my career growth or options during my time here.
- Some of the management here has no business being people managers. I think you'll find this is a common theme among some of the reviews here.
- Review process was a joke, so your feedback on your manager won't make a difference.
- Poor transparency and communication. People you are working with on projects would be let go, and it would not be communicated to you.
- It was a very sales/marketing driven company when I left, which also suggests weak Engineering leadership at the executive level. Features were jammed down developer's throats, and oftentimes incomplete features were released in order to meet deadlines at which time the next feature would get worked on. Tech debt and bad code everywhere.
- Not a lot of innovation.
- Compensation is on the lower end of the market."
246,Eventbrite,Former Employee Review,2018-02-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The early years of Eventbrite were great, amazing, best job I ever had. I woke up everyday and wanted to go into the office and see my coworkers. I even wanted to hangout with them after hours. 

I remember walking into Eventbrite in 2011 for my interview and I could feel the energy. I saw smiles on every employees face. The office had a Disneyland vide - 'happiest place on earth.""","The company culture changed drastically as Eventbrite grew and executives were shuffling in and out of VP and C-level roles. Eventbrite stopped interviewing for culture fit, negatively affecting team and cross functional team dynamics. 

My last few years at Eventbrite, I would wake up and not want to go to work. I didn't care for my coworkers and I didn't feel upper management, or even my manager, cared for me. I also struggled with a few ethical issues the last few months of my time at Eventbrite. I was asked by HR to lie to my coworkers, I was also told by HR that there would be times in my career where ""I wouldn't have a life outside of work."" That conversation with HR was the straw that broke the camels back for me. It also supported my observation on the company culture changing dramatically - no work/life balance directly being communicated to employees from an HR representative."
247,Eventbrite,New Mama - Career on Track,2018-02-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I'm a new mom of twins. Not only did I accept my role at Eventbrite while I was on maternity leave, but Eventbrite was flexible with my start date so I could fulfill my duties as a new mama. Overall, work/life balance is great, while still requiring a high quality of work. This in not a coast-through-your-career kind of place - and I find that those who do well here are oriented around action, teamwork, open-mindedness, and accountability. Corporate bureaucracy is low - action is high.","It could be easy to burn out, but the company's ""take the time you need"" vacation policy and general acceptance of vacation helps make up for some intense times."
248,Eventbrite,London office - 5 stars,2018-02-16,5.0,Account Manager,"Number one reason this is the best place I have worked is because this office has some of the best people I have ever had the pleasure of working with - collaborative, hardworking, sociable and passionate. 
The leadership team are supportive and truly invested in our success. 
The right team is in place and this shows through the amazing results and growth we have had in the last year.","We do still have to be a bit scrappy to make things work for us locally, but I kind of like that."
249,Eventbrite,The most fulfilling and challenging professional experience I've had to date.,2018-01-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"For me, the most important things to find in a company are tough problems to solve, inspiring co-workers, and collaboration.  Over the past few years at Eventbrite, I can say without a doubt that I am having the most fulfilling and challenging professional experience I've had to date.

We're at a really interesting point in the Eventbrite's journey, where we are big enough that have resources to go after crazy challenges,  but small enough that not everything is figured out yet.  After about 6 months of establishing that I was competent at my job, I have felt continuously pushed to raise my hand and solve tough problems.  I've gotten to take on responsibilities that are usually reserved for high level management, and I get to work strategically while also getting my hands dirty.  I can honestly say I've learned more in my few years here than I had in my whole career prior, and I think the experience I've gotten here sets me up well for the rest of my career.  I've always felt encouraged to seek that career growth within Eventbrite.

Solving tough problems is more fun when you work with impressive people, and I feel lucky to be surrounded by some really brilliant individual contributors and inspirational leaders.  Even as Eventbrite grows, there is a feeling of a family that Julia has found a way to keep around.

What continues to inspire me about Eventbrite is the spirit of collaboration.  Over the past year, and definitely for the next few years to come, we will be figuring out how to work together as a large global company.  While these growing pains are really hard to go through for any company, I feel strongly that we will excel - simply due to our dedication to collaboration.  I've seen many cross-functional projects exceed expectations, and I've seen us gracefully move through large acquisitions - and it all comes down to collaboration.  At the end of the day, we get to solve tough problems, with smart colleagues, and we are dedicated to working together to make it happen.  After a few years, that still gets me excited to come to work every day.","Over the past 2.5 years, we expanded globally very aggressively.  We added offices in new countries and added a lot of new Britelings - both organically and via acquisition.  This was not an easy expansion to go through.

For me, the biggest downfall of the expansion we've gone through was the fear that our culture could be diluted.  There were times when it felt like we were making decisions based 100% on what was good for the bottom line, and losing our focus on growing a people-first, ""best company to work for.""

While I would say there were a handful of cons that came with this growth (RIFs, lack of focus on global competitive total compensation, feelings of distrust and lack of a clear path forward), I have started to see a clear shift back to our goal of becoming the best ticketing technology company AND the best company to work for - in tandem.  This shift is noticeable, especially with the hiring of Omer Cohen, our new Chief People officer, and that prompted me to write this review."
250,Eventbrite,Best company I've ever worked for!,2018-01-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have worked at Eventbrite for over a year and I can say that I still look forward to going into work everyday and I am still happy on a daily basis that I was given the opportunity to work here. 

The people, culture, environment, etc is incredible. I have never been happier with a company and, at this point in my life, I can honestly say that I don't see myself leaving any time in the near future. 

The company is very transparent with everything that that can be and I feel constantly supported by my supervisor. They are sincerely invested in your growth and career path. I have had the opportunity to transfer into three different positions so far during my time here and I constantly see people getting promoted internally and given the opportunity to interview for many different teams/positions. They are very invested in their employees and highly encourage a work-life balance and opportunities to shadow other teams for new opportunities within the company. 

Bottom line- I love working at Eventbrite and cannot speak highly enough about it!","We have grown rapidly and that can make finding a conference room challenging at times, so I would like to see investment in additional private meeting spaces at some of our offices, but otherwise I sincerely love working here and really can't think of many other cons."

252,Eventbrite,Stay away,2017-12-17,1.0,Sales Representative,"Nice looking Office ,  Free lunch , parking is paid for, free beer","Worst professional experience ever. Don't get fooled by high ratings. They are from young new hires who are fascinated by free coffee, snacks, and energy drinks. This place has massive deep-rooted problems that are not going away. Its like working in a frat house. 

- Managers - extremely incompetent, inexperienced, unprofessional.  One manager openly said ""Its like high school here... CS, Developers are the nerds, and sales are the popular kids"" I thought this was funny and meant as a joke -- but she and most of the sales team genuinely believe that... this brought up SO MUCH Politics - all this makes it impossible to get things done

- No opportunities for career development and nobody really cares about developing talent. You are blindly promised development, training -- but instead you are given 1-on-1 with your managers that are not helpful. They say they are open to questions at any time ... I asked a question once and they said ""what? thats a weird question..? kinda dumb?"" I get you want to foster a competitive spirit in the office - but thats just bullying and not helpful

- During my interview, I had mentioned I had wanted to go back to school... I was promised tuition reimbursement, time off, flexible schedule, and more. But after joining the team, all dreams of going back to school and pursuing an MBA were met by odd looks and ""oh... why??"" or ""no... we don't have a tuition reimbursement program""


- This place fires people all the time and not in a nice way - you will be doing everything perfectly and arrive one day to your desk being cleaned and you being escorted out the building in front of everyone. Other places, if you're doing something wrong, you get further training and help. Here, however, they just fire you. Or apparently... if they don't like you.. you're fired. 

- compensation is VERY low compared to industry standards"

After receiving confirmation that this resume and my recommendation was forwarded to the appropriate recruiter and hiring manager, kid you not, they were rejected 5 minutes later...not even the courtesy of a phone interview. Extremely unprofessional to the candidate."
255,Eventbrite,Struggling to make profit. Inexperienced managers. Huge tech debt. Office politics & groupism b/h faux-positivity,2017-11-14,1.0,Staff Software Engineer,"-$100 per month commute allowance
- free snacks, fruits and coffee
-free catered lunch 4 times a week. Quality is mediocre and options are limited if you are vegan/vegetarian.
-nice espresso coffee machine
- modern, big office
- you can park yourself here and work for your pay stub.","Most managers don't have any prior experience in people management. Please do yourself a favor and review profiles of Engineering managers at EvenBrite before considering taking a job here. Be careful of not hurting manager's ego even accidentally and unintentionally, or be ready to be terminated at any minute. Seeing your colleagues suddenly getting disappeared is a norm here.

Communicating indirectly behind the back and in the groups is the accepted practice here. Meetings are used for discovering what other thinks. There is just weird tendency of agreeing as group.  People Don't raise genuine issues and express honest opinions as they fear getting isolated and retaliation from rest of the group. Even long-time employees don't speak a word as they are waiting for an IPO to encash their stock options.

It is the worst quality code base I have ever seen in my long career. Accruing technical debt is encouraged as inexperienced managers attempts to direct entry level developers without any planning and design. Much of the code is a monolith and remains unchanged since inception. Tight coupling, circular dependencies and code duplication is common occurrence. Unfortunately in the absence of mentorship and guidance , young developers write best what they can. There are no architects around.

There is no thought leadership other than repeated attempts to induce excitements by announcing birthdays and anniversaries, cheering inter-project movement and celebrating festivals. There is nothing wrong with celebration. However there ia a lot of faux-positivity. Most young employees are attracted by this, free food, shower in the office and relaxed work environment. However there is no real growth and in absence of challenges and mentorhip, there isn't much to learn. 

Salary is subpar as compared to average salaries in SF.  Beware of those stock options as the strike price is very high.  When you are granted $40K of stocks every year, you are getting $65k of options that you can exercise only if you pay $25k in cash. Since it is private equity, you cannot sell your stocks until company goes an IPO or mgmt gets approved investors. It means your money is stuck if you decide to leave. There is no 401k match. no bonuses. No PTOs and no cash payment for PTOs. 

Unlimited TTYN policy isn't same as unlimited PTOs. Per CA laws, employees earn PTO/ vacation time and it is your right to spend the way you want. With unlimited time-off, it is on the discretion to your manager to approve your time-off.  You may be asked to reduce your vacation, participate into meetings and supporting 'business' during your time-off.

There is no work methodology followed here. Company has recently started introducing Scrum(in 2017) and most teams don't like it. Basically running projects with no focus and hiding failures behind excuses and allegations is the preferred way. Often decisions are based on individual biases without considering any data points. No wonder why many project fails and company is struggling to make profits.  Also very few customers bring repeat business and many of themare tired of  technology issues and high fees. Management has shifted its strategy to acquire companies as it cannot fix inherent problems and grow organically. Management is aware that without consistent growth company cannot go for IPO. 

Performance is reviewed every quarter. When the project fails, engineering manager starts finding a scapegoat, blame failures on that person and fire him. I have seen this pattern repeating numerous times. I have even witnessed people getting extremely positive review in last quarter but fired within a month for performance reasons. Make sure to dine and drink with your group members and build a personal relationship or you are next in the line.

I have seen many il-managed companies in my long career. But this one is the worst. Everyone in middle and top management has an inflated ego. 

Other cons - only 1 restroom with 4 lavatories for an office space of 50,000 sq ft and among ~300 people. Long queues in the morning is norm. Loud rock music in the restroom doesn't help so please stop playing it. 
It is imposdible to find a conference for next 2 days."
256,Eventbrite,Great colleagues & room to grow,2017-10-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"What I love most about Eventbrite are my colleagues. This is the sixth company I've been working for, and never have I had so many colleageus I enjoy working with, and whom I truly admire for both their intellect and personalities. Right after that comes that Eventbrite is a fast moving, ever evolving company. If you don't mind oreven enjoy that – and the opportunities that come with it – this is a truly exciting company to work for, and one that has a real shot at becoming the operating system of the global event industry.","The constant change can be unsettling for certain personality types. While a lot of effort is being put into it, Eventbrite is still getting to grips with acting like a truly international company. Eventbrite is unmistakibly a Californian company, ever so slightly overenthusiastic, always happy and optimistic, which can come across as fake and off-putting to more serious / critical personalities."

-Nice perks 
-Work life balance 
-Access to great events 
-Perfect place to start an entry-level job","Here were my determining factors in deciding why to leave one of the 'Best Places to Work': 

1. It's hard to get an honest opinion about other employees' experience when the company places pressure on current employees to inflate the ratings. 

2. Some of the worst management style I have ever come across in my career. My manager was extremely incompetent and has never managed a group of people before Eventbrite. They would give inconsistent feedback and empty promises on career growth and advancement. Their entire team has now left the company. 

3. Compensation is below market rates. Management tries to bake the perks of the company into your package, however, this should be an added bonus, not part of your yearly compensation. 

4. Part of the motivation driver of the sales team is fear. There is a top-down culture that creates politics and tension. Consistent layoffs mixed with irrational, quick decisions creates a layer of paranoia that is deeply rooted into the team and culture."
260,Eventbrite,10 year old 'startup' struggling to turn profit,2017-08-11,1.0,Software Engineer,Work life balance is pretty decent compared to some notoriously high stress Silicon Valley companies.,"Management is a total chaos. 
Company didn't hesitate laying off workers regularly in the spirit of 'for profit'. There is also way too much politics for a company this size. I also heard a lot of bad things about their remote offices, as well as customer service/finance department. Prepare to take below market pay if you decide to work there."
261,Eventbrite,Some flaws hidden behind a lovely exterior,2017-08-10,3.0,Engineering,"Cult-like employee positivity. Modern office with all the ""Silicon Valley"" style perks.","Cult-like employee positivity... it wears you thin. Jr. Engineers are coddled and given interesting projects, which is an excellent idea. Yet, Senior Engineers are thrown into a hostile and unsupportive environment of pedantry and confrontation while being expected to support a decades old mess of spaghetti code. Lots of churn of employees. The rating on Glassdoor is artificially high because employees are pestered repeatedly to post positive reviews."
262,Eventbrite,Core values don't pay the bills,2017-08-07,2.0,Customer Service Representative,"I joined for the amazing benefits, although from what I understand the fully covered healthcare (that actually provides coverage) is the only remaining benefit.  Can’t confirm if the $60/month gym reimbursement still exists or not.

Unfortunately, grocery reimbursement, flexible scheduling, the option to work from home, and unlimited PTO no longer exist.

This is a good job if you enjoy being bombarded by tech illiterate, irate callers at 1am on a Saturday and having a manager who preaches about teamwork making the dream work tell you that they don't feel like helping you.","The company claims to promote transparency, autonomy, authenticity, and growth but fails to practice what they preach.  The leaders would schedule Q&A sessions with the team and then plant questions of their own in an attempt to avoid addressing the issues that plagued the CX team.  

CX reps would repeatedly endure abuse from callers regarding the platform's constantly changing features and the greater team would not be held accountable.  Oops, an engineer accidentally turned off the payment processor and went on vacation?  Just use your *Make it Happen* spirit.  Someone in the SF office would love to help you but they’re tied up with yoga or in the Manicube.

Compensation is based on a variety of factors, including how active you are in the team’s drinking cult.  Not a place to work if you’re not a fan of getting obliterated in your office."

268,Eventbrite,"Excellent culture, interesting work",2017-05-22,5.0,Software Engineer,"Reasons I love my job:
1. My coworkers: there is no one at Eventbrite who doesn't want to talk to you, teach you things, learn from you, and improve the product together. It's a really unique group of people. 
2. My projects: eng does a mix of new projects & keeping down tech debt, so there's always a mix of learning from existing code and getting to build entirely new stuff.
3. The product: it's awesome working on a product that has such a huge impact on small businesses in tons of different verticals, AND on a product that most of your friends & family actively use. 
4. Culture at large: Eventbrite's culture is focused on allowing employees to be their ""whole selves"" at work. This sounds corporate-speak-y but I think they're succeeding at making a place where a wide variety of people can feel comfortable being themselves.","Like any tech company that's been around for 5+ years, some of our code base is messy and outdated in ways that aren't ideal. More investment in our technology infrastructure would help the engineering teams move faster in the long run. 

Like almost all tech companies, we have a fairly un-diverse engineering team, though our ""diversity numbers"" are better than some. I believe eng leadership is interested in keeping our existing employees happy and intelligently addressing issues that come up for women & people of color in the workplace, but there is room for improvement in our recruitment & retention work."

free lunch, and some great benefits. However there is still no pension plan for UK employees.
Some good staff
Great potential if they had stronger leadership","The company is dominated by a sales culture that is driven by targets, and lead by a management team who have a blame culture. They are quick to sack staff rather than taking responsibility for their own incompetencies as managers.
The US office often make decisions on behalf of the international teams without consultation and without any knowledge of the international markets and their business needs. There is a lack of experienced leadership in the UK and a complete lack of understanding of the market they are trying to move in to. The culture has been on the decline in the last 2 years and much of the talent in the UK and US has moved on. The huge turnover of staff is something that I have never experienced before."
276,Eventbrite,Past it's best,2017-02-21,2.0,Business Development Manager,"Eventbrite employs some incredibly talented people who work very hard & (used to) have a lot of fun doing it. I have seen more brand / employee loyalty and emotion attached to this place than anywhere I've worked - to me this is a sign of truly great culture. When times were good they were really good, but when they were bad.... (I'll get to this later)
You get free lunch!","Eventbrite masquerades as a ""startup"" when really they have been running for 11 years but still haven't sorted out some very basic business processes (like employing local HR, ensuring people get paid the right salary/commission, actually reaching profitability etc etc). Although Eventbrite celebrates & boasts of it's ""startup culture"" it no longer exists. In reality management want everyone to behave like they are in a big, musty old corporate machine with no diversity, no freedom / trust / autonomy, a very slow pace of change, an extremely hierarchical structure and a general ""do as I say not as I do"" attitude. This is a shame and a waste of the talent & loyalty of the staff that built and stuck with it over the last crucial 3-5 years or so. It's no wonder the last 12 months have seen a mass exodus of key staff members from all departments in every country Eventbrite operates.
This is a business that's lost it's direction and lost it's soul."

Some great team members","Eventbrite WAS a great place to work. There was a real buzz and people were collaborating across the business towards achieving a common goal - which was making Eventbrite a great success. It was also an environment where management/leadership were supportive and it felt like we were all in it together.

However things changed...

Understandably when a company grows it needs to get more streamlined processes, systems and become accountable - it is debatable if this has happened at Eventbrite - what is becoming clear though is that the culture has taken a dive.

Leadership appears to have taken an 'us and them' approach - lots of 'have you got a minute mate, let's grab a room/go for a walk' type chats. Minimal communication. Lots of people leaving quite quickly and quite uncertain what the long game is.

Leadership seems to neglect that employees emotionally invest in a company and work hard to make it a success. To have a leader say 'tough, there are worse places to work' when raising concerns is incredibly demotivating.

A lack of trust has also crept in, management have spoken negatively about absent employees in open spaces as well as making inappropriate comments about employees personal lives. Management has also been vocal about their political views - which is fine - however the ways and means that this has been done has left quite a few feeling uncomfortable.

Inconsistent career progression 

It seems that HR are quick to respond to Glassdoor reviews however the reality is that HR on the whole were unresponsive and seemed to be more focussed on the US."

No HR in place outside the SF office, and no anonymity - if you had a grievance this would just be reported back to your manager creating a more hostile environment.
Lots of internal politics, often the person who shouts the loudest or is friends with the right person gets their way.
No career progression within UK office - no transparency or structure in place. Often promises made at interview and annual review stages which are then never acted on. 
Not a transparent company despite insisting they are - really bad at communicating both at a team and company level, which creates a thriving rumour mill."

1. Eventbite does not know how to execute.period. so many projects get started and not finished due to the lack of focus by senior management
2. people managers - extremely incompetent; a problem across departments - i saw many talented people leave eventbrite because of poor management
3. no innovation - the product has not changed at all since inception
4. decisions are made out of thin air and not based on any facts and numbers - i have witnessed that on so many occasions
5. no opportunities for career development and nobody really cares about developing talent
6. lack of communication and SO MUCH Politics - people do not communicate directly in this company to the point they are passive aggressive; some people are so touchy feely ; all this makes it impossible to get things done

Thought I'd dealt with difficult situations before and could always succeed.  I thrive in challenging situations.  But this place is beyond difficult and challenging.  It's just out-right impossible.  Upper-management has illogical expectations, constantly changing their minds on how they want the processes to be handle.  Kind of just running the Finance teams by trial-and-error.  Very difficult to work for with the blame-game mentality.

Company is a little disorganized
Policies and procedures are changed very frequently, so it's sometimes hard to keep up
Management is not always aligned on policies, but team leads are given near-absolute authority"
303,Eventbrite,I love this place!,2016-08-19,5.0,Software Quality Assurance Engineer,"- Strong culture of learning and development
- Amazing talent
- Nice people
- Focus on sustainable business practices
- Leaders are very transparent 
- Great employee perks",None! But there is a 5 word minimum for this field... so I'm typing typing typing...
304,Eventbrite,A Great Choice,2016-08-18,5.0,Manager,"Eventbrite is a forward thinking company.  Having worked for some very large organizations throughout my career, I can say that what makes Eventbrite unique is that it has the established processes and leadership structures in place that feel like a big corporation, but the culture, ethos, and workplace are still very rooted in the fun and exciting startup mentality.  With cutting edge benefits like free daily lunch, all you can eat snacks (lots of choices), and a ""take the time you need"" PTO policy, Eventbrite has positioned itself to be a unique employer.","At times, the startup mentality can clash with the need for corporate-like processes, creating a push-pull for resources."
305,Eventbrite,Great Work/Life Balance,2016-08-16,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I'd heard people talk about the idea of work/life balance...but had never worked anywhere where it was a reality. But people here truly do have lives outside of work and management understands/encourages that. People leave early when they need to or WFH if necessary - and while it doesn't seem like people abuse it, they do seem to actually use the unlimited vacation policy. Not to say people aren't hard working and there definitely are the occasional late nights, but it's not an environment of sticking around late just to be seen at your desk late.

For the most part, the people are smart, motivated and ""cool"" which makes for a nice working environment. Plus good office perks!","While I do feel like the company is moving in the right direction, it feels a bit disorganized. Less than ideal communication/alignment between departments leads to what feels like constant strategy/direction changes. 

Pay is not great, not are the raises."
306,Eventbrite,5+ years and going strong!,2016-08-16,5.0,Content Strategist,"• People
• Fast-paced work environment (never a dull day)
• Benefits
• Perks (catered meals, snacks, juice bar, etc.)
• Opportunities for professional development","The one con that comes to mind is the disconnect between offices/locations. While not necessary to interface with everyone in the company on a consistent basis, there are names I don't know and haven't heard before. Further, when meeting a ""new"" team member, it's not uncommon to learn they've been with the company for 6 months or more—which can be a bit awkward and embarrassing. As any company grows, this is expected (to not know every person in the organization), so it's only a minor issue and not one that weighs heavily on my decision to stick with the company."
307,Eventbrite,Customer Experience Review,2016-08-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits, exciting atmosphere, supportive leaders.","Lack of career growth, overzealous company culture, poor comp."
308,Eventbrite,Fun company overflowing with talent,2016-08-15,5.0,Marketing,"- Really talented and super friendly workforce
- Upper management really cares about its employees
- Lots of transparency
- Excellent career growth opportunities
- Good/Great perks (unlimited time-off, 7 meals a week, tech company office)
- Awesome learning opportunities (weekly subject matter expert chats, career advice, etc)
- They take their culture and values seriously
- Hiring is tough, but it ensures they let the best in the door","- The company is in profitability mode, so don't expect weekly company sponsored happy hours or extravagant off-sites. For most this might be par for the course, but coming from a company that was, admittedly, a little over the top with that stuff, Eventbrite just tends to be mindful about how they spend"
309,Eventbrite,Great culture with expected growth pains,2016-08-15,4.0,Customer Experience Associate,Incredible benefits. Promotions are given to those that deserve them. Compensation is fair. Opportunities for OT.,Pain points when trying to move into other areas of the company. Some have found it difficult to move laterally or vertically from their current positions.
310,Eventbrite,Excellent company to work for and one that cares about it's employees,2016-08-15,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"Some of the perks:  Excellent Benefits, Team Outings, Free Lunch, High Performance Culture, comfortable workspace, Wellness Benefit, Great coworkers.

 The management and executive staff truly values the employees and there is a constant importance placed on the overall well-being of employees. 

There is also importance placed on career progression and the company holds excellent learning/career development opportunities each month.","Very few, if any. You need to be able to adapt quickly to change, but that is only a con if you're not prepared for change! The pay isn't as much as I made at my previous employer, but the benefits make up for the lower wages."
311,Eventbrite,Outstanding company!,2016-08-14,5.0,Customer Experience Representative,"It has been an amazing experience to be a part of this company. The culture and work environment are awesome and everybody is extremely supportive of one another. I couldn't ask for a better work/life balance (in my position, you can work from home!) and the benefits are outstanding. Our leadership is fantastic and transparent about changes within the company. You feel like you are actually a part of something rather than just another employee.","The only thing that comes to mind, and I wouldn't necessarily call it a con since this is a growing company, but it would be great to have a clearer sense in regard to career growth and opportunities. I understand that with a company growing this quickly, changes happen frequently so it is difficult to really pinpoint a career path."
312,Eventbrite,Bringing People Together--the best people!,2016-08-14,5.0,Customer Experience Associate,"Fabulous people; great environment. 
Eventbrite exists to ""Bring People Together through the Experience of Live Events"". The amazing part is the company lives out its mission in the way they bring work teams together. It is a warm, welcoming, fun culture that encourages innovation and collaboration. For a tech company that allows employees to work remotely, Eventbrite is intentional about cultivating a fun, positive, high performance, high-relationship culture.","If you're not comfortable in an environment that is always evolving and constantly changing, Eventbrite would not be a good fit for you. 

Because it is a constantly evolving product and workplace, clear career tracks aren't immediately discernible."
313,Eventbrite,"Great company, great culture!",2016-08-12,5.0,Program Manager,"Eventbrite is a wonderful place to work. There is an overall culture of trust, openness and transparency that is truly unique for a company this size. Most individuals and teams are extremely collaborative and cross-functional dynamics are very strong. Benefits, perks and work/life balance are excellent. There is a great mix of small-company drive and energy and larger-company maturity.","Would be good to have clearer career growth opportunities. A few growing pains, but to be expected at this stage in the company's evolution."
314,Eventbrite,Wonderful People and Company,2016-08-11,5.0,Senior Field Operations Manager,"One of the best parts about working for Eventbrite is the people. You become friends with so many people you work with making your experience there that much greater.

The benefits are amazing, but nothing beats the flexibility and time off. 

The leadership completely trusts its employees to do their jobs, so there's no micro-managing.

There is great opportunity for growth and to acquire new skills if you make the effort.

It is fulfilling to be a part of a company that touches so many lives.","Cross-departmental communication can sometimes be weak.

There can sometimes be a lack of standardization of processes before implementing new products."
315,Eventbrite,So grateful to be a part of this team!,2016-08-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The culture here is amazing. Everyone is so supportive, welcoming, and talented! Leadership is phenomenal, and they do a fantastic job of not only encouraging you to be your best self, but also providing you with the organizational foundation to do so. The benefits are also top notch--Unlimited paid time off, catered lunches, wellness stipend, work from home option, and GREAT health care! This isn't just another job--the people here really care about Eventbrite's mission & core values, and they work hard to make sure the company is successful, sustainable, and always interesting!","There really aren't any negatives in my opinion. For Customer Experience roles, the work schedule might be less than ideal for some because support is 24/7, but it certainly isn't unmanageable by any means, and there is plenty of flexibility."
316,Eventbrite,"Positive culture, challenging work",2016-08-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Super smart, kind, and interesting coworkers. People always want to do better and generally want to be helpful.
- Work that helps people all over the world do cool things off the internet.
- Strong emphasis on culture beyond perks.
- Trusted with interesting, challenging work.","- Positive to a fault sometimes. You have to be likeable to make things happen.
- Top company priorities shift too often and aren't always communicated well. We try to do too many huge things at once and then not much happens."
317,Eventbrite,My Experience at Eventbrite,2016-08-10,5.0,Talent & Development Program Specialist,"I've been at Eventbrite for over 5 years and I've watched myself and my career develop and change as a direct result of working for a company that invests in its people. I trust Eventbrite to do the right thing by me, and I think that's invaluable to find in a company. 

- Eventbrite hires amazing people you WANT to work with
- I always look forward to coming to work 
- The culture is always evolving and changing in the best way possible
- Britelings are empowered to get s*** done
- We invest in our leaders and individual contributors growth
- There's a ton of internal mobility opportunities
- You have the flexibility to work from wherever you want
- Take the time you need is a real thing
- Leadership trusts that you'll do the right thing and provides an autonomous environment","As such a tenured employee, it's challenging to reach competitive compensation. You almost feel like you'd need to leave and come back in order to make what's competitive."
318,Eventbrite,Remote,2016-08-10,5.0,Software Engineer,"I've worked in tiny startups my entire engineering career, and was rather nervous entering into what I believe to be ""corporate"" status. My largest concern was getting lost in the shuffle, and my product not mattering to anybody nearly as much as it mattered to me. Our company, Queue, was acquired by Eventbrite because of our ability to build so much with such a small team (currently, 3 engineers).  The two attributes of Eventbrite, and the team surrounding the acquisition, was recognizing that and making sure we stayed relatively autonomous, yet still ""included"" (if that makes sense).

If you want the juice, here it is:
* Medical/Dental/Vision benefits are incredible, and the employer covers quite a large portion of dependent coverage as well
* Pay is adequate.  Not the most I've been offered in the city, but provides for a great quality of life while my partner is able to stay home and raise our child
* Catered lunches in the main offices (since we work remote, they add a lunch allowance) are always delicious
* Snacks, Red Bull, all the fuel you need throughout the day
* Top of the line hardware, I didn't have to haggle for extra RAM or CPU, I was just given the best and latest MBP upon arrival","There is a singular con (I've been working here for six months), and I don't believe it to be a fault of Eventbrite, but the fault of a company with any size: meetings. As I've stated before, I've worked in tiny companies.  To push an idea forward, somebody had to say something out loud. In a room of 10 people max, it always gets heard.  With a company of 300+ in one office you have to schedule a meeting. That meeting may not include all the people whose life you will touch with your decision, so more meetings are had. Decisions are, then, inherently slow."
319,Eventbrite,"Fantastic culture, world-class product, awesome employees, and room to improve",2016-08-10,4.0,,"• Transparency on company priorities, product roadmap and decisions, and our performance against them
• Supportive culture that encourages vulnerability and individuality
• Access and frequent interaction with senior leaders
• Culture of feedback and challenging the status quo
• Great perks - wellness stipend, daily catered lunch, ability to work from home, wonderful office snacks and drinks, fun events away from the office","• We've grown quickly and also change/pivot strategy quickly. These decisions affect our product and work and can be confusing for some (both Britelings and our customers).
• It doesn't seem like we always listen to feedback from our internal teams and external customers. While our product is always evolving, we still haven't made progress against many of our customers' pain points."
320,Eventbrite,Great Environment to work and grow with,2016-08-10,5.0,Security Engineer,"Great work life balance, good and helpful culture, people want to see you succeed and help each other a lot, very casual and friendly environment. Teams are small so you get to learn a lot!",Some growing pains as the company is still growing
321,Eventbrite,Super duper!,2016-08-10,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"* Everyone is really nice! - At first i was a little bit skeptical because the people seemed to nice, but it is genuine.
* Big but not to big - Eventbrite is big so you get the luxuries from that, but not to big that an individual can't make a difference / impact.
* Great Projects - Eventbrite is product focused so you get the build the things users need.","* Career progression after senior engineer level is unclear.
* Paternity leave period is shorter than other similar companies."
322,Eventbrite,Nashville Sales,2016-08-10,5.0,National Sales Director,"I started working at Eventbrite at the beginning of 2016. I had an amazing interview and onboarding experience and have really enjoyed working here as we build the Sales Team in Nashville. We are a performance-driven organization and have hit the ground running since our first team exited newhire training in April. We now have 4 Sales Teams in Nashville: SDRs, Small Business, Mid Market and Customer Success - which means there are plenty of opportunities to grow your career as the business continues to grow. In addition, we are highly customer-centric and celebrate our organizers' success with their events. Finally, Eventbrite emphasizes a great culture and we have a lot of fun while we work hard. There are tons of learning opportunities, team-building events, and opportunities for every-day fun on the rows.",I can't think of any...
323,Eventbrite,Senior Software Engineer,2016-08-10,5.0,Senior Software Developer,"Eventbrite has provided great opportunities for grown in the directions that I am most interested in. I work with, mentor and am mentored by some of the most intelligent people that I have every worked with.",We're growing fast and moving into new cities and new offices. Sometimes we feel the pressure of  distributed teams. There are certain ways that I would like to contribute that are made difficult by the distributed nature of our teams.
324,Eventbrite,Come work with the best Nashville has to offer!,2016-08-10,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The culture at Eventbrite is amazing. Friendly people, excellent work environment, great perks, and the location is great, right near downtown in Cummins Station. The work we do lets people share meaningful experiences with their friends and families.",Sometimes we have too many meetings.
325,Eventbrite,Great place to work and grow,2016-08-10,5.0,Engineering Manager,"For me it starts with a great product, bringing people together for live events. I've gotten to understand and experience what putting on a good live event means and exposure to music, art, food that I wouldn't have otherwise.

Eventbrite has a people oriented culture. Cannot stress enough how much of a difference this makes in the day to day. There are offices around the globe with interesting and friendly coworkers pushing towards the same goal.

I've been able to grow in both the technical and personal. It definitely feels like a family of people pushing each other to give their best and make sure we are achieving both professional and personal goals. There are big challenges at significant scale on the engineering side and the best part about it all really is the team that comes together to solve them.","The company has grown out of it's true start up roots. There are processes and plans to follow, not too much and not too little for my taste but it's not the wild west anymore."
326,Eventbrite,"Great people, great mission, great execution",2016-08-09,5.0,Director of Engineering,"I get the opportunity to work on innovative solutions with super smart people who are fun to be around. Difficult employees or negative interactions are almost non-existent. Leadership team is superior, as are the engineers I work with every day. Love that we have built a global engineering team.

Company is having success, and I get to learn and have fun every day. Hard to ask for much more than that. I also feel that my contributions are valued.","Our target markets are very broad, so we have a ton of surface area to cover. Huge opportunity, but also stressful to try to do all of it. Still, I'm glad we do a few too many things rather than a few too few. I think the breadth of our offering is a big reason we are successful where competitors fail."
327,Eventbrite,"Dead brand and direction, High turnover, Blameshifting, No Meritocracy",2016-06-27,1.0,Product Manager,"A real 10-4 job, flexibility to work from home many days since product roadmaps aren't compelling or aggressive","Eventbrite was an admired brand in '08-'10 full of Stanford grads but many have since moved on and replaced by folks from dying brands like eBay and Twitter. Ticketing/e-commerce is now commoditized SAAS and the company's ""strategic"" projects has failed to deliver any differentiation. Both Product and Strategy teams have abandoned the marketplace mission as they struggle to make Eventbrite a destination page for event discovery. Instead the team executes multi-year efforts on refreshing the look and feel of the website to occupy time and without substantial metrics impact. The Engineering team moves at glacial speeds and mostly comes from other events-oriented SAAS companies (read: never worked at pedigree like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc). This breads an engineering culture that lacks real processes or documentation. The ""bench strength"" has never worked on large-scale services at aforementioned firms and thus many of its services/experiences have broken under larger loads. This lack of know-how also creates a fear of touching legacy code, building hack upon hack. Recent acquisitions have built off-shore engineering centers making it even harder to develop. With compensation well below market rate and and unknown equity value, more subpar talent is recruited. Meritocracy doesn't exist and only those that are willing to endure the poor culture eventually get promoted after 3+ yrs or brown-nosing."
328,Eventbrite,Great place to work despite scattered leadership,2016-06-24,4.0,,I absolutely loved my job because of the exciting problems my team tackled. The perks are great and the people are even better. There are some truly incredible employees at Eventbrite! I would absolutely recommend Eventbrite to a friend.,"- Everyone in the office knows what you're talking about when you say ""the shiny new thing"". Senior leadership seems pitted against each other and the employees are forced to shift gears whenever one of them comes out on top. One day it's mobile, the next day it could be Eventbrite hair care products (you can never predict it). 

- Nepotism seems like a problem you'd never encounter in your adult life, but it's a reality at Eventbrite. I've seen someone placed in a position that they were not qualified to handle. I've seen a different person repeatedly make big promises, sink a ton of money into them, and have nothing to show for it. It's difficult to ignore the relationships they have with executives and how those relationships influence what's expected of them. At the end of the day, they'll still be employed and the projects swept under the rug. This subject was only discussed behind closed doors, but was a huge distraction and had a negative impact on the morale of many of my coworkers. Middle management would never surface it in fear for their own standing, which I completely understand."
329,Eventbrite,Amazing Place to Work,2016-06-16,5.0,Account Executive,"Fantastic place to work. Incredible opportunity, lots of support and training, and a management team that cares and is vested in our success. I feel so fortunate to work with such high integrity, smart people, who are passionate and supportive. Such a fabulous place to work and grow my career. I can't imagine being anywhere else!!!

331,Eventbrite,"Lots of room to grow, excellent leadership",2016-05-04,5.0,Software Engineer,"This company has had a lot of thought and energy invested into making it a place people want to work.  The leadership team is intentionally and remarkably transparent. For example, we have a weekly open Q&A session with the CEO, in which surprisingly pointed and difficult questions are asked by employees and answered with grace and intelligence.

Every part of the company seems populated by competent, motivated, and intelligent people. On the engineering side, I've had the privilege to work with colleagues I respect and admire. Feedback is part of the development cycle, and these same people are generally willing to jump in and take a look at work to suggest improvements, best practices, and architecture.  Things get improved constantly because developers have the motivation and leeway to make changes when they see a problem.

An astoundingly good daily lunch, snacks, lots of office events that are actually fun, and a great healthcare plan are some notable perks.","The original application was created in the mid aughts, and like many companies that have been around for a while, there are ugly parts of the codebase.

We use a small number of in-house tools which have dominant open source alternatives.  Mastering these tools has taught some valuable core concepts, but ultimately knowing how to use them will not be a transferable skill."
332,Eventbrite,Software Engineer,2016-05-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Colleagues are smart, down-to-earth, and helpful. Really supportive atmosphere for newer engineers who are willing to ask for help - everyone is happy to answer questions and take time to go over new concepts. Ego does not get in the way. Management is available and transparent. Remote employees are first-class citizens. Great benefits. Family-friendly office culture is reflected both in company policy and actions of employees up and down the corporate ladder.","Navigating the time difference with colleagues working 10-6 in SF creates some logistical hurdles.

There's a good mix of employees from various backgrounds (both professionally and personally) and they tend to be bright, friendly, and incredibly interesting.

Those objectives are sound and responsible in the current business climate.","There's a lot of stagnation. Come here for the experience and the name.

We have weekly ""safe space"" code labs for those new to programming, as well as weekly talks on front end or general eng topics and an engineering book club (with reimbursement). We also have a strong pair programming culture and the leadership actively encourages this.
- Make it happen culture: If you have a great idea, you're encouraged to go and get support for it, you don't have to jump through a bunch of hoops to implement it. 
- Belief in talent: If you're talented and have potential, but maybe not experience, Eventbrite will give you the opportunities you need to get where you want to go, and will take a chance on you. So many people have moved roles and teams here because of this part of our culture. 
- The people: It is refreshing to come to work and have teammates that genuinely are happy to be here. We have a range of personalities that makes it interesting to come to work every day. Plus, our Male:Female ratio is one of the best in tech, especially in Engineering, and this helps create a supportive, safe, encouraging environment for everyone.
- Good benefits: free lunch 4x, breakfast 1x, dinner 2x per week. Lots of snacks, juice bar, nap room, normal healthcare options, transit stipend, wellness stipend, unlimited time off, and a great location!","- Product team needs higher expectations and more resources. Some PMs are wonderful, but others have too much on their plate and cannot provide adequate support to their teams. 
- As we scale, we're starting to become a little more corporate with some processes. This is not always a bad thing, as it helps us become more efficient, but sometimes the result is a loss of customer-focus."

The perks (fully covered health care, food, unlimited PTO, etc. ) are competitive though the salaries are far from it. Communication amongst peers is casual and friendly, most of the teams spend time together outside of the office which is a plus.",Leadership plays favorites in a way that undervalues other team members. Salaries are unacceptably low. It seems that every quarter there's a new person favorited at the expense of other team members. We're told that if we want to make more money we should sell more (which is a fairly antiquated rationale - though we do all understand we're there to bring in revenue for the business) but then opportunities are taken away from us for the benefit of new or individual team members. This is felt across the board.

I've been here for almost 5 years now and it has only gotten better over time. The work is interesting, the people are great, and the work-life balance actually lets you have a life.
One particular thing I love about working here is that our companyis aligned with helping all of our customers - both organizers and consumers. We're not like other companies who rely on selling your data to advertisers; we benefit when our event organizers put on great events and when our consumers find awesome events to attend.","In my time here, I think one of the consequences of the fantastic people we hire is that everyone is _too_ nice, and it's hard to give and receive critical feedback."

But below that surface, there's an incredibly rich diversity of A+ talent in this company.  Rarely do you find a place where you come in and have a challenging but incredibly fun day and leave the office slightly better at your craft than when you came in.  If you are going to spend 80% of your waking hours working in tech, you can't find a better place than Eventbrite.",The commute can be long if you live outside the city.

The culture emphasizes collaboration, honesty and day-to-day fun. It's a brand you can be proud of too; who doesn't appreciate the fact that Eventbrite democratized the ticketing industry and has collected the world's largest online treasure trove of live events?","Location is optimized for BART riders and anyone living in the city. If you live on the peninsula and need to take the train, it is a 20-minute walk from the station."
348,Eventbrite,Customer Service Team Review,2016-02-17,2.0,Client Services Representative,We have the ability to work from home but the office is also really great. My co-workers are the best and the team leads are amazing as well. I love the values of the company and feel that executive leadership has a great strategy and genuinely care about the employees. The benefits can't be beat! This makes me want to bring my best to work every day.,"Upper management in customer service lacks good communication and they are very reactive. They make a lot of changes with little thought to how it affects the team or their morale. Sometimes, they'll make a big change then take our feedback and backtrack on the change instead of bringing us into the picture earlier on which could avoid a lot of issues. When the office opened there was a lot of talk about never becoming a call center and about career growth.  We've definitely moved more toward a call center mentality though. The value of work-life balance doesn't seem to be a priority anymore unfortunately."
349,Eventbrite,"Not perfect, but the best place I've worked",2016-02-11,4.0,User Experience Architect,"Eventbrite is comprised of talented, ambitious people who are genuine and pleasant to be around. The product and purpose of the company is impactful on the quality of people's lives, and provides a meaningful focus for day-to-day work. As the company has grown, so too have the employees, not only in headcount, but also in individual professional advancement.","As a mid-sized company, it is still maturing and trying to find its cultural and operational footing as it emerges from its ""startup"" phase. As en employee, there are opportunities for professional growth, but they are not always clearly mapped out, nor are roles always very well defined."
350,Eventbrite,"Autonomy and Support, Grown Up Style",2016-02-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Eventbrite rewards capability with autonomy and collaboration with tremendous support from the team. I am routinely surprised by how much initiative people show and help they offer on things I am working on. The company is also very accepting of developing into new areas and supportive of employees who want to explore new roles.,"Our focus on driving efficiency and making the business able to fund itself have restricted headcount growth in recent quarters, but despite the environment we are accelerating hiring because of the progress we have made, albeit at more modest levels than what the Valley typically does. So this is not the place to come if you believe success is measured by how big the team is or your career goals include managing lots of people."

353,Eventbrite,Great place to work everyday!,2015-12-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free cooked lunch, unlimited healthy snacks, lots of natural light, amazing office with vibrant colors and a great use of space where there are no back seats, positive energy people, a place you are excited to go to everyday, best entry level, transparent communication with CEOs and entire executive staff, you feel involved in decisions and have constant opportunities to voices opinions and questions.","None so far, it is still a startup so there are of course changes but they all seem to be positive changes and for the best of the company and employees."
354,Eventbrite,Great company for engineers who want growth & learning,2015-12-14,5.0,Software Engineer,"I have worked at many companies, small & big, but never anything like EventBrite. This is the greatest company for engineers who want to learn, grow, and collaborate with others. They have a team of engineers who are really smart but at the same time very personable. There are some very experienced people working alongside Hackbright or new college grads; they have little work areas setup where a group can congregate and do some pairing together. The culture at EventBrite seems to fit the individual; if you're the type who wants to work alone, that's fine, but if you need help, just ask for it. I haven't met a single person I would hesitate to work with. We have 2 remote engineering teams in Mendoza and Nashville, both of these teams are great and easy to work with. To break up the work we host meetups, have beer on tap, clap when we are excited about something, and give out gnome awards. The office in San Francisco is very cool, we have an open work environment, but I also love going into the big Library (no talking allowed) for some quiet work time.","Like any company transitioning from a small startup to a mid-size company (EventBrite has been around 10 years now) it is experiencing some growing pains. I don't think this is very alarming, compared to early stage startups."

Not only that, but our product is awesome and we are all inspired by the work we do.",Not in the best area of San Fran
357,Eventbrite,INCREDIBLE team and company,2015-12-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"From the moment I started interviewing with Eventbrite, my experience has been nothing but great. 99% of people who work here are bright, warm and thoughtful - everyone works very hard but there is definitely a work/life balance most times. I constantly talk about the culture here to my friends and most of them are dying to work here.

I've had a few other jobs before and haven't come across such a solid team or workplace until I worked here. There is a balance of everything you'd want in a workplace: fair management, open work environment, flexible work schedule, delicious lunch, dogs everywhere you look...I can go on and on.",There was a bit of turnover over the past few months but in my opinion that will happen at most mid-size startups. Would also be nice to have a 401k plan with a matching benefit.
358,Eventbrite,Dream Team,2015-12-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Could be talking regarding the pros all day, but I will summarize in a nutshell, Eventbrite soon became part of my life , where I am part of the dream team , with professionals with above-average level , real stars that all work day strongly to shine more and more , and all freedom we have to put into practice our ideas and confiaça to always develop the best.","I was thinking but did not find anything as negative , just like warning 'll let the freedom we have to work and behave within the company, this for a great ally , more can also be something if you do not know enjoy slow you down."

Best aspect is the focus on continued education.  They truly want you to grow, and provide and environment in which you can.","It's a very competitive industry, and some might say broken.

As the company evolved there were a lot of opportunities that arose. If you are driven and dedicated you can go far.,"There is a general lack of direction and accountability. The company grew really rapidly and there are some fundamental issues that need solving. Very reactive environment. It would be beneficial to pause, solve for current infrastructural issues, then start planning for the future instead of chasing after the next shiny ball without fixing anything. Leadership is not unified and getting people to adopt to core processes is a challenge."

The perks are great, especially the ""take the time you need"" vacation policy.",Company needs more cross-functional leadership to drive forward.  Technical leadership from the early days have moved on and there is a gap of knowledge between old and new systems.  It's stuck in a growth phase right now where each department is working mostly in silos.

Benefits are great, wish pay was a little higher, but it's somewhat balanced out by the options which isn't common in Nashville.","From my perspective, there are very few cons. Communication with the home office in San Francisco can sometimes be a challenge due to the time zone difference, and the fact that people there tend to come in late (and work late). That sometimes means that it can be 10/11am before any other engineers are available for discussions."
375,Eventbrite,The best place I've ever worked,2015-04-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Eventbrite is a people-first company, and it's the only employer I've had where I've felt TRULY cared for. Beyond the ""tech benefits"" of the meals, smoothies, yoga, massages, manicures, etc, it is an incredibly supportive and open work culture. 

Leadership takes time for both small and large group meetings where tough topics are discussed with transparency and input is genuinely solicited. Work-life balance is celebrated and most people leave my department by 5:30pm (amazing!), but that's in part because everyone works incredibly hard - and smart - all day. That expectation of hard work is part of what I love about Eventbrite, because the people are motivated, high achievers who are used to accepting nothing but success. I LOVE my co-workers and even on the most stressful days I am happy to be in the office with them.","In general, there is a sentiment that salaries/bonuses are low compared to other tech companies. There is also not a 401k match (yet). However, stipends for transportation, wellness, great team offsite events and free meals do help."

The leadership and management layers are both incredibly transparent, which I also value quite a bit. My peers are almost always will to help out wherever they can. I really enjoy that we don't have everything figured out yet, as that means there is a lot of possibility to make big impact for the business.","We're in our ""teenager phase"" of being a small, private start-up. We're around 500 employees so we don't quite have that scrappy, know everyone's name feel, but we don't have all of the benefits of a more mature company (more standardized procedures and tools, etc).

379,Eventbrite,"Good for junior staff looking to get experience, others might want to think twice.",2015-04-04,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Founders and management were all really cool and approachable.
- Vacation policy was pretty awesome (possibly the best perk there)
- Engineering mostly moved at a pretty good pace compared to other companies.
- Engineering leadership were smart and qualified for their jobs (which is always nice).","- The business domain of online ticketing isn't as cool in 2015 as it was when Eventbrite was founded and Eventbrite is no longer a startup or a disruptor. Eventbrite is a peacetime company now. For me, this was a con.
- Probably the most frugal company in all of San Francisco. If you're used to dual Apple monitors and frequent company outings, this isn't the place for you.
- Lots of major Kool-aid drinkers across the entire company.
- Python and Django as the hammer to every nail.
- Some engineering teams would frequently shoot themselves in the foot by hiring very junior staff that required LOTS of training during periods where resources were insanely stretched thin. Which is great for the Jr staff, but bad for employees that have equity in the company. 
- Architecture was the concern of an oligarchy called the ""architecture team"". Do you have experience with software design and SOAs? Too bad if you're not on that team.
- ""No"" as the knee-jerk reaction to most requests asked of Ops. Which is common to most companies, but worth mentioning that Eventbrite Ops is no different."

391,Eventbrite,Truly wonderful company to work for - especially for new moms,2014-08-25,5.0,"Associate Manager, Customer Service","Eventbrite is the most genuinely ""people first"" company I've ever worked for. From the top down there's a huge emphasis on hiring the right people and investing in them to keep them around for a long time. It's the first job I've had where I can picture my career growth very long term, and plan to be here for as long as I can. 

The totally unique amazing thing they have (that I've never heard of another company, let along tech company) having is such amazing support for new moms. They were great about supporting my maternity leave and transition back and, this is the kicker, they have the most amazing ""Mom Rooms"" ever. There are two rooms that both have hospital grade pumps (!!!) that they give you personal parts for. There's a fridge, a cushy arm chair, and basically everything you need to be a breastfeeding and working Mom. It's out of control awesome. It's made the challenge of breastfeeding while working full time much easier, and made me much less nervous to come back. 

There are a lot of other great perks (great catering, a smoothy bar with two vitamixes, yoga and massage). A lot of other tech companies have these but I feel like the over riding difference is the clear investment in employee wellness and work life balance.","The only thing to mention is that salaries are a shade lower than some similar tech companies. I can say pretty confidently that the benefits, perks, and flexibility compensate almost entirely for the difference."

I also love that there is open communication from the top as well as across teams.","In working from home, I sometimes feel disconnected.  We do have team meetings where we come together, but there is something to be said for in-office bonding as well.  This is also a very young company, and by that I mean that most of the people here are young, including leadership.

They drive employees and while sometimes we have to bring them back to reality, its the visionaries (not the rational ppl out there) that go big.  The new office is really nice and convenient to get to, I never have to think about what to eat (even if the food isn't always what I would pick....) and if there is something you need (resource, equipment, etc) to get your job done better/faster/etc. you can get it.  Its nice not to have effectiveness limited by tight budget of limited cash flows.  I also appreciate the transparency and tone of leadership towards the rest of the company.  Kevin and Julia are completely approachable and WANT to hear what the employees (at any level) have to say.","This is a real company with big goals and huge initiatives on tight timelines, ie means there is a lot of work to get done and not a lot of time to do it.  Just because this is a shiny happy start-up that treats people well, employees or potential employees need to know while people certainly play hard around here, working hard until your job is ""done"" is the expectation (ie this is not a 9-5 gig).  This is not truly a con, however, i think its important to point out that the perception of a startup always being ""fun fun fun"" is not the reality.  This is still a job and it is still work people!"
400,Eventbrite,"Enjoyed working for Google, but LOVE working for Eventbrite even more!",2014-08-15,5.0,Data Analyst,"I've been at the company, full time, for several years - here goes:

Transparency - I love how everything is communicated to the employees and how often updates are sent out. This manifests in company all hands meetings, emails, exposure to Kevin (CEO) and Julia (President) since they sit at a regular table on the main floor like all other employees, and even a ""heart to hartz"" where you can ask them any question about the company, goals, etc.

Leadership - Management is pretty awesome and the board, executive staff, and VPs are all very smart and make great decisions. Also doesnt hurt that Julia reaaaaaally cares about people and office morale and makes sure that ""wellness"" is a top company priority. 

Equity/company success - I believe the company will do really well as it scales internationally and across many verticals. Its pretty nice to have equity in a soon-to-IPO company that will be massively successful. 

Growth opportunities - People move around all the time. If you're a hard worker you can jump to other positions either by moving teams, or being promoted. Its awesome how Eventbrite helps its employees do what they love.

Perks - free food/snacks/beer, dogs in office, massage, yoga, acupuncture, nap room, games room, tons of offsites, opportunities to join groups for sports or similar interests, great medical/dental, wellness and transportation stipend, unlimited vacation days via a ""take the time you need"" approach, and best of all - SMART PEOPLE that are humble and fun to work with (yes, I hang out with my team outside of work because I enjoy their company!)","I've been at the company for several years and have seen how people who underperform get fired (which is fair to do), but the manner in which its communicated to employees/team members can be done better."
401,Eventbrite,New Part-Time CSR Employee in Nashville,2014-08-15,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"The people, the culture, the product, ALL THE THINGS. The hiring process was very efficient and they did not waste time asking the same questions different ways, repeatedly. They really know who they are looking for and seek them out. Persnoally,  I feel really at home here and everyone is very warm and supportive. Their transparency really makes you feel like you're WITH them all the way. Also, there are snacks.","Office is a bit small for so much rapid growth (but as we can work from home, that isn't so bad!) at the new Nashville location, parking at hotel (for training) and outside the office (only a few allotted spots) might get a bit difficult/expensive."
402,Eventbrite,Great Company! Growing but Priorities are right!,2014-08-15,4.0,Customer Service Representative,"If you are looking for a company that values it's people and the growth of it's employees this is it. If you are looking for a company that is willing to empower you with all the tools needed to make a difference in the customers world this is it. If you are looking for a company that really stands true to it's spoken values then this is it. 

It is a young company with so much growth potential and it is growing into a Love Brand quickly.",My only fear is that it will begin to take shape to that of Apple. As a former employee I saw a company that strived for excellence but forgot what it meant to take care of it's employees! Many people left Apple to be apart of Eventbrite because our Founders understand that if the employees are well cared for then they will care for the customers and it will come naturally!
403,Eventbrite,So thankful for the opportunity to work at Eventbrite!,2014-08-15,5.0,Client Services Representative,"-High value placed on giving feedback

-Great communication across all offices
-Thorough training","-It's a fast growing company, so salaries haven't quite caught up to the growth yet, but that's true of most successful startups"
404,Eventbrite,The most genuine coworkers and supportive environment that I've ever encountered.,2014-08-15,5.0,Software Engineer,"* Colleagues are supportive and always willing to help you learn a new skill or contribute their expertise to a project. People are not territorial or competitive at all. There is team spirit in the truest sense (not just as a catchphrase).
* Everyone is genuinely friendly and cares about you as a person. I've made ""real life"" friends with many of the people I've worked with. Going to work is actually fun! At the same time, there is absolutely no forced socialization or expectation that you need to ""fit in"" -- as a general rule everyone is very accepting and welcoming.
* The degree of transparency is very high -- founders have weekly chats with the entire company where any question can be asked and will be answered. There is a minimum of office politics.
* Good work-life balance: unlimited PTO, managers encourage work life balance and there isn't a culture of staying in the office until midnight.

I've worked at 3 different companies before this, and can honestly say that Eventbrite is my favorite by far.","Compensation tends to be on the modest side, although in line with industry standards. Also balanced out by the fact that we get unlimited PTO, good work life balance, etc -- versus other places with higher compensation but a cutthroat work culture."
405,Eventbrite,"Inspiring vision, fun culture and smart people",2014-08-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"While the company has been around for 8 years, it's still run like a startup. People are expected to take calculated risks and rewarded for the learnings that come from them.  Having a founder focus on resourcing and fueling the culture is fantastic, and something that is felt across the company.  The vision is crystal clear, and inspiring to the Britelings.","We need to look for more ways for leaders and aspiring leaders to grow into leadership and executive roles. The company is very thin at the top, which can have advantages, but is also limiting for senior employees looking to grow."
406,Eventbrite,Empowering and Inspiring,2014-08-15,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Britelings are continuously empowered and inspired to make their visions happen. Whether you want to create a crazy and wacky marketing campaign or find new ways to bring the Britelings together outside of work, there is no one stopping you. If it's successful, you're recognized. If it fails, you learn from it and are encouraged to share those learnings with your team.",I currently have no cons.

These ideas are honored and have impacted the business, which is extremely rewarding.  The transparency is unlike any place I've worked before and our cofounders are always accessible.  We're building a wonderful product that is inline with the success of our customers.  Most importantly, I have the absolute pleasure of working with incredibly smart people who are the best at what they do.",No 401K was matching in place.
408,Eventbrite,Incredible company that cares about its employees!,2014-08-15,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"I am so excited that Eventbrite chose Nashville as their second US location.  They hire incredible people who are a blast to work with, and the benefits are outstanding (at least for those of us coming from outside of the tech world).  I look forward to growing with the company and seeing, specifically, how Nashville's office continues to evolve.","Honestly, I don't have any cons yet."
409,Eventbrite,Ownership,2014-08-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,This company encourages the 'make it happen' spirit by providing ownership in the product that you make. There isn't tons of bureaucratic red tape as many of the executive are down to earth and available.,"As any other growing company, scaling the product to meet the needs of the world are always a challenge. Adapting can cause uneasiness, leading to attrition."
410,Eventbrite,An amazing place to be mission-driven and grow your career,2014-08-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"A clear vision and strong mission is conveyed by the leaders and that permeates the entire team.  The culture is one of the most authentically strong cultures I've ever seen or heard of in this industry.

As Eventbrite grows, we are constantly facing new challenges and it is encouraging to see all employees pulling together to come up with innovate solutions.","Some departments are becoming more ""corporate"" as they grow, but that comes with the territory as Eventbrite continues to grow. Compensation could be higher but the perks offer a good trade-off."
414,Eventbrite,A big company that still hold onto it's humility,2014-08-15,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"It's great being able to work with a company that hasn't grown to large that they forget who's important in the day to day functions of the business. Eventbrite has a great culture of independence and encourages employees to be unique. However, they actually make you feel welcome.",They don't have a 401-K matching plan yet; but I can understand as they're still growing. Hopefully the new Nashville office can grow to a size that allows those who don't want to work from the option. Sign-up lists aren't very inviting.
415,Eventbrite,BEST company around!,2014-08-15,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"Eventbrite really brings to life the ""Make it Happen Spirit!"" Believe me, this is not your average company! Kevin & Julia are truly passionate about their customers and employees alike.

419,Eventbrite,Amazing company to work for,2014-05-13,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Atmosphere-  You just can't beat the startup atmosphere at a very successful, well funded, and growing company.  It's contagious and makes you want to do all you can for the company.

Sales Organization-  The sales organization is structured for success and they do whatever is needed to help you succeed.  Everyone here is excited to jump on the phone and make deals happen.  As I mentioned before, it is very contagious.  Fun and interesting weekly contest with great incentives to keep everyone engaged.

Sales Management - Open to any and all ideas and in my short time here and I am already seeing my ideas being executed.  Makes me want to be constantly coming up with more.

Food: free lunch four days a weeks, breakfast twice a week, and dinner twice a week.  Many different kinds of drinks to choose from along with beer on tap and plenty of happy hour events

Office: We just moved into an amazing office downtown.  My desk has a view of the city.  The office is open and has many cool breakout areas.  Stand up desks are also available.  The stadium seating room is very cool and the conference rooms are different and unique.  Ping pong, video games, etc

Technology:  Having great technology make my job selling easier.",No President's Club but I think we will get there.

As the company grows, leadership is getting really good at structuring career progression for its employees. In the year that I have been here, I've seen and experienced these changes first hand and it's been awesome. The company values and responds well to all feedback, which should encourage employees to speak up and work for what they want. Tons of growth potential and the roles are lined up to launch people forward and to the top.

423,Eventbrite,Senior Account Executive,2014-05-07,3.0,Senior Account Executive,Great company. Great culture.  Company will be successful.,"Career Progression:
In sales there is no real career progression. As you advance, the quota gets larger, commission rates decrease, and the prospect quality / deal sizes stay the same. 

Leadership:
In the past year, the leadership has shifted the culture in Sales. It's gone from a very entrepreneurial environment to a heavily micro-managed team. I've got this as a con, as only a certain type of sales persona enjoys being micro-managed. 

Commission:
If you do decide to go to Eventbrite, be ready to reconcile every paycheck, as they are still ironing out tracking deals. Every month, my commission came in short and had to be corrected.  I surfaced the issue and was told to keep reconciling until they got a better handle on tracking. Hopefully this has been corrected."
424,Eventbrite,All Smiles At Eventbrite,2014-04-22,4.0,Account Executive,Eventbrite has a lot of great training resources.  The Sales Team especially puts in a lot of extra effort to provide training tools and one of one time to really understand how to be successful in the role.,Eventbrite is very ambitious when it comes to going after new markets.

- Lots of dynamic, challenging work to tackle which can help keep things fresh and new
- Given lots of autonomy to go after opportunities and drive decisions
- Smart people who have fun, are passionate about the business, and who work really hard","- Primarily young management team lacking big company experience to facilitate growth to the next level
- Limited upward mobility for middle management and real focus on employee career growth
- Lower end of compensation for market - they like to sell the dream to get you in
- Culture, while super fun, up beat and friendly outwardly, discourages confrontation causing management to often skirt around issues instead of being direct and upfront"

Plus, we genuinely love our product and are proud of the work that we get to put out!","I don't really have any negatives to add.  The only one that comes to mind is that a lot of managers are first time managers, so there can be some bumps in the road; however, there is ongoing growth, training and education, which helps strengthen their skills."
436,Eventbrite,Intelligent colleagues + awesome product = my dream job,2013-12-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everyone who works at Eventbrite most likely had to meet with one of the co-founders as part of the interview process, so you know that you working with very talented individuals.

The product and vision are great and you can feel the love from the customers.  And who doesn't want to fix the fees disaster that is live event ticketing?","The company is a strange combination of a startup and a wannabe public company - low pay and loose structure of a startup but inflexibility and bureaucratic slowdowns of a large company.
