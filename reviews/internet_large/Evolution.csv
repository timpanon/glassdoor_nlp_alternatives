- Modern office, modern tools to work with","Everything I mentioned in the pros, is unfortunately really case dependent. The company at this point is quite fragmented in identity, culture etc, so your experience will be dependent on which organization, which location and which team you are going to join into. Management is quite stiff and ignorant to obvious changes and issues and  micromanaging. Compenation and benefit package is quite good, but there is no annual bonus or stock options. Some benefits are not applying for everyone - even if it would be logical (hybrid work, temporary working from abroad) , just for a certain group of employees."

NOTHING, 
NOTHING","Basically, they never listen to employees. 
Whenever we gave the feedback, They ignored. 
HR team doesn’t do their jobs properly so my ex colleagues are struggling with work. 
Insane schedule and no new people. 
I don’t understand why they don’t close tables. 
It’s insane to run the 24hours  table with 12 people. 
People can not be happy with this situation. 
I sent an email how bad they are before I left this insane company, nothing is changed. 
They don’t also care about people’s mental health from rude players. 
I think they close the chat function if they don’t listen to employees. (They have no ability to control the situation. They just say do not spam rude button) 
There must be reasons to press rude button several times, however, they say we should stop pressing. 
And the manager doesn’t do her job as well. ( I have no idea how she could be a manager) 
Another bad thing is that they don’t pay night allowance. Whenever they need someone for a foreign table, they always activate Asian employees’  schedule. It’s because they don’t say “no” 
I don’t really understand why people who only do baccarat  should go and cover for blackjack tables . 
When we don’t have the enough speed or evaluation, we can not get the bonus which we are supposed to get.

You would say this happens everywhere, but nowhere is so welcomed and integrated as a custom like there, where people like to take pride in doing nothing, having zero skills, but faking hard work and expecting blind loyalty from their subordinates. If you don't act like them they will do their best to give you a very hard time, not to mention the amount of lies. You can always bet whatever they are saying is untrue. 
I will say, there are also good souls, hard workers that give their best to make things better, but often get infected with the sick mentality around them. You usually realize what happened only once you get away from such a poisonous atmosphere.  Meanwhile, you accept injustice as ""this is how things go here"". I'll always be grateful to those who did their best, but the rest, which unfortunately is most of the company, just a bunch of snakes waiting for you to lower you guard.

The job is rather easy, a lot of breaks (but not all the time) so basically you work 6hrs, 5hrs and a half... and 2h - 2h30m break without staying over the program and the best part is that you don't have to deal with actual, physic customers in front of you which is less stressful that it would be in a normal casino. I really love my job, THOUGH there CAN be some improvements!","The company is quite different from what I've seen in other countries. I'm from Romania and the salary is a bit unfair like it is in, for example, Riga, UK. Sooo... Evo is in Romania for about 2 years and I think the salaries can be greatly improved and also the management should be a little bit more loose and relaxed! A new bonus system has been approved, but now it's very difficult to make your bonus, almost impossible (especially for the new comers) so I think that the areas of improvement would be: 1. The salary (make it bigger, more fair), 2. The managers should be more relaxed (no offence), 3. The work conditions should be greatly improved as well :), 4. More activities, 5.
