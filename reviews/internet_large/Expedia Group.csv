24,Expedia Group,leadership disconnected from reality,2022-03-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are some amazing people who are unfortunately buried in the org chart at Expedia. Underneath the executive level turmoil and politics, at the heart of the company, there is good work being done through collaboration and relationships. Commitment to the company's success is strong even under trying circumstances.","Executives are so far out of touch with reality that it's laughable. Expectations are high performance, high output, but compensation is not aligned with those expectations. And somehow executives are surprised (and complain at all company meetings) when people leave the company for offers that are more than double the pay for the same or less work. A compelling corporate vision is great, but a vision doesn't pay the bills or send kids to college. 

For those who care less about compensation, their great ideas and long-term strategies are shuffled through so many layers of organizational cruft and politics that the intended value or the idea itself gets lost in the bureaucracy. The supposed goal is to ""move with speed"", but employees can only do that if they're working on an exec's pet project, and even then everyone and their dad has to sit through a million meetings, whittle the idea down so much that it becomes meaningless, and then sign off on a pretty PowerPoint before actual work can happen.

This is also an unhealthy and toxic organization where leaders behave like toddlers throwing tantrums. It's unfortunate that the most senior executives in the company have placed their trust in leaders who yell at people, slam fists on tables, point blame, and otherwise demonstrate their lack of EQ. It's no wonder so many people are ""voting with their feet"" and leaving the company."

37,Expedia Group,Perspective from a Fraud Investigator II,2022-03-27,3.0,Fraud Investigator,"I do believe Expedia is as good a company to work for as we can reasonably expect in this capitalist hellscape. Pay is decent, there are good benefits, and like most Seattle-based tech companies, there are considerable additional perks/stipends.","The Fraud team used to be a very desirable team to be on within the company. The pay bump was respectable and while the work was challenging, it was generally known that the employees doing it were respected and felt appreciated and up to the task.

I don't know what exactly has happened to trigger it, but that sentiment has changed drastically in recent years.

Where the Fraud department would once see numerous internal candidates for open positions, that well has dried up. I believe that's due in large part to word getting passed around about the very strict metrics analysts (now investigators) are expected to meet. In addition to these difficulties attracting new hires, attrition appears to be quite high in the department.

Reviewing 10-12 bookings per hour at a 98% accuracy rate is simply not sustainable. Your staff are dying inside trying to meet these expectations while staying engaged enough from working in a production queue day in and day out. The ones who don't care enough to try find corners to cut. The ones who continue to hold themselves to a higher standard of work ethic just burn themselves out because it's futile and never ending and unappreciated. There is a hyper focus on mistakes and none at all on victories unless someone is fortunate enough to stumble into a way to recover millions. And even then, all hands meetings will never acknowledge Fraud analysts.

For a technology company, the systems in the department are archaic and function poorly and unpredictably. The teams responsible for repairing and improving those systems are very unresponsive, largely because they're also working on bigger and more important projects throughout the company, leaving Fraud to limp along with subpar technology.

In bullheaded efforts to save money, this once stellar example of a Fraud team has had tools and subscriptions gradually stripped away until now nearly all research is done only via free open source web searches. People in the industry will recognize this for the shortsighted and huge handicap that it is. Since so many of Fraud leadership don't have real Fraud experience, it is seen simply as collateral damage on a path to management excellence in improving the bottom line.

While analysts /investigators understand that the insistance upon returning to the office is coming from the very top of the company, there remains a great sense of dissatisfaction and betrayal. I have no doubt that the numbers of analysts already seen leaving the department will steadily increase once the return to office occurs (even with the paltry compromise of this hybrid schedule.)"

- Compassionate CEO (the current one), with some clear views on where we need to be within society has a company and as individuals.","- Disorganisation and politics at the highest level trickle down to teams.
- Constant Re-orgs.
- HR treats an employee as a number, expect nothing more and nothing less. Avoid interactions at all costs in case you have a problem (health etc etc), normally it will make things worse. If your direct supervisor has been in the company for some time he will advise you the same, if it's not a serious health problem for example.
- The corporate health insurance is a horrible policy, stay clear of it.
- The policy to Hybrid work, mandatory 50% of time you are expected to work from the office."

- Very limited opportunities for growth. Despite receiving accolades for my performance for years, I (and others) have received wishy-washy answers about career growth, opportunities for improvement/progression, and ways to get to the next level. I think even Amazon has career conversations embedded in their culture that need to happen regularly. It's frustrating, and frankly a bit shocking, how bad EG is at this."

109,Expedia Group,Loved by job but frustrated by how political (hard left) the company has become and forces down your throat,2022-03-02,3.0,Senior Manager,"Incredible manager
Good compensation
Challenged and excited by role and opportunity","-Mandating vaccines in order to return to office and increasing insurance premiums in US for employees who don't receive. CEO has stated there is no 'scientific' evidence vaccines are not safe which could not be ANY further from the truth. Unreal how they are playing this but willing to take no responsibility if something were to happen to you. I personally know multiple people with vaccine injuries including 2 who have died. We talk so much about being inclusive until you don't agree with leadership--then you can fend for yourself.
-We have a politically correct ""I &D"" organisation within the company for everything--has become really distracting and am finding it's taking away from productivity and overcomer mindsets (encourages victim mentality).
-Always feels like we're on the back foot. Really basic things that are horrific traveler or partner experiences get backlogged and take years to fix.
-Forcing a hybrid model for return to office in the name of collaboration. Would love for the exec team to trust managers to know what amount of in person collaboration is needed for their team and just hold us accountable for results. My team is phone based. Our productivity increased 2.5x since going home, and I am really concerned with how we are going to keep that up with 2-3 days in office a week. What we have to gain by that many days in the office will not offset what we will lose in productivity in speaking to partners.
-Massive bench of awesome leaders in Dir and Sr Dir roles but unlike many other tech companies, we're unwilling to hire for exec roles in anything but our regional HQs. We're going to lose incredible talent due to inflexibility."

They are now implementing more regular rotation opportunities for top performers where you work temporarily in a different department which can be an interesting way to learn new skills.","The basic work can be repetitive and is very metric based with an emphasis on speedy and accurate logical reasoning. There will be pressure to perform. Doing it well is difficult and requires skilled mastery of many tools, ability to research and in general is very challenging considering the level of seniority and compensation is not particularly high. Much less intelligence is required for many higher paying jobs. Basically they are expecting Sherlock Holmes on a fairly moderate salary. If you enjoy logic and deduction, ( I personally even in my spare time enjoy reading detective stories and reading what's going on with scams and cybercrime stuff) this can be a positive thing. For people who don't enjoy or are not talented at that, it can be stressful and feel unfair when you make a mistake."

Organization tries to simplify operations but ends up creating way more layers, tools and barriers to getting the job done. Used to be a place where relationships were important, but now a computer just tells you what to do. High turnover also means people who are/were subject matter experts are not available to answer questions, making it difficult to work.

Projects are held up for months because of executive infighting and jostling for promotions. Every new exec wants to make their mark, so inevitably they change course as soon as they take over.

You will be stuck in a hell of endless migrations. Expedia Group thinks it is like Google, a tech innovator with problems so complex that only they can solve them. This means almost everything is built in-house, even the things EG has no business building like CI/CD software. If EG was a search engine, it would be Ask Jeeves.

The good engineers either move on to better businesses or get bogged down trying to unpick decades of awful legacy. 

If you have a good idea that follows modern best practices don't expect it to see the light of day. You will be told that that particular thing should belong to some other central EG team and that we just have to wait for them to finish making it. Which will never happen. They will get 45% through the project, realise it's trash and then start all over. 

That said, a broken clock is right twice a day. Sometimes EG will make a sane decision like switching to Spinnaker over their custom, piece of garbage in-house CI/CD tool. But they'll ruin it by making one team the gatekeeper to the entire platform and not allow innovation from any other teams.

EG is a company that used to talk about ""inner-sourcing"" everything, but that got brushed under the rug and now you're expected to ""keep in your lane""."

An absolutely mental target of 6 hires per month in a first quarter when majority of other companies would still have you onboarding. The 4/6 hires I have achieved every month in my first 6 months, weren't even acknowledged let alone praised or somehow congratulated for.

It's weird - after leaving I couldn't stop thinking that I wasn't good enough and it was somehow my fault. Having worked for a year in a top 5 company, I've realised how badly I was mismanaged at Expedia, be it grilled for whatever I said on the phone or in meetings, punished for the tiniest mistakes like it's the end of the world - all hidden under the ""performance and feedback culture"".

It seems like the apprenticeship program only exists so that they look diverse and progressive rather than actually BE diverse and progressive. Other apprentices and I have voiced our concerns several times but it just they are neatly bushed under the carpet as they don't want to admit that their program doesn't work. My manager has told me that they do not have time for me even when they have to fill out important documents that help me achieve my qualification.

Managers also get upset when you don't work to the same standard and speed as their senior staff who have been working at Expedia for 5+ years which is confusing as the whole point in this apprenticeship is that you're coming in with no experience and learning on the Job as well as studying. I don't understand who my first attempt at building my first application by myself for real world use could be done exactly the same way and speed as someone who has been there for nearly a decade."

At the same time, frequent 'cultural sensitivity training' which achieves absolutely nothing, other than to make the men in the office obsessed with the idea that all women are diversity hires.

-Lots of benefits offered, almost too many to completely take advantage of or know inside and out to know completely what your getting or take advantage of it all. Best in the area I've had so far.
-Everyone for the most part enjoyed the work atmosphere prior to COVID, and there used to be lots of perks including Happy Hours, Team outings, swag, etc that we haven't seen since COVID.","-Constant re-organizing. Some managers are great, others not so much. A LOT OF FAVORITISM across the departments. Very little chance for people to really climb up the ladder unless you know someone. Hiring process is poor on feedback to both internals and externals. Updates in the hiring process for internals are not provided as promised. Internals declined for a job are given no direction, and just default messages from management when feedback is requested. COVID also has limited many prior andvancement opportunities.
-Gaps left by people leaving are not being filled or are olnly being filled by temps. Very hard to get hired onto. As a temp your contract can be exteneded for up to a full year even if your manager begs to get you hired on there is a ton of red tape! Once hired on they often do not increase pay above $16/hr unless your hired onto an evening shift with differential, or to a position above entry level.
-Lack of appreciation and acknowledgment from the company, unless you are in a highly visible role. Yearly raises are small and often around 2% which is under the average of 3-5%.
-Many legacy systems companywide that are in flux to be replaced allowing for many roles to become obsolete over the last couple years, and going forward as well many positions will be replaced by automation programs. 
-Many work programs offerred such as mentoring and ways to advance your career, but no assitance to get employees that are in ""24-hr depts"" or ""Necessary Operations"" time to access them. Constant quarterly reviews, and 1:1s that act as fluff waste more time than being productive to an employee's growth & development. No assisstance in finding better positions within the company if your current position is not a good fit.
-Lots of push for Inclusion & Diversity, however very few POC or women in positions other than at entry level in the MO location. No focus on helping those in minority groups excel as far as internal employees even when they've reached out to HR or upper management.
-No work life balance taken into consideration for families with children when it comes to shift bids in depts where shifts are required. Tenure & Metrics are main drivers for shifts. Deptarments with shift bids do not rotate enough.
-For a travel company that could allow people to work from anywhere in the world and be happy, they fail. We've all been working from home since the pandemic started, and they are implimenting a mandatory hybrid schedule as come mid-January despite a new variant in COVID surging around us, but expect the vaccination requirement to put us at ease.
-Metrics are not always accurate between managers, and employee dashbaords causing a ""black box"" effect. Managers are not being transparent with the employees as to their place within the team only where they are with the required metrics which only promotes micromanaging. Woork is very transactional and instead of wanting high accuracy more transactions worked seems to be better.
-The bookings worked int he FRAUD department are not worked in a feasable order, management is more concerned on working on the programs versus getting them to filter appropraitely. Bookings should be worked by TTE, but are often worked by booking date which results in many bookings we review being past check in. Also too many programs are used to review bookings, they say 2022 this will change, hopefully so.
-The Springfield office is the least paid attention to office in the country! Worldwide all of the other offices have many varying perks and the facility needs renovations updates and perks that are comparable to others."

332,Expedia Group,"Constant Change, Underwhelming Leadership",2021-11-26,3.0,Marketing Manager,"There are plenty of wonderful people working at Expedia. They care about their work, and they treat each other well. And (at least in 2021) the work-life-balance is still prioritized to keep people motivated. 

There is a lot of ownership of work here, at least if you have a manager that empowers it. That means you get to decide what you do and how you do it, without constant micromanagement. 

The benefits are fabulous, and all the perks of working for a travel company are excellent (when it's not a pandemic).","Looking at some recent reviews, I'm very surprised the company is being scored so highly. There are some major issues within the business as a whole, and forums like Blind have our scores far lower than other tech brands. It's interesting to me that Glassdoor scores have been so high, as it doesn't reflect what I've seen or heard in other forums.

Expedia deals with so much tech debt, which is compounded (perhaps caused?) by middle managers who've been allowed to sit over fiefdoms for years. It makes forward momentum so difficult, and it's present in nearly every team across the business. 

Credit where it's due - leaders who've been entrenched at Expedia for 15+ years are being removed left and right, and are being replaced with external candidates. But that brings culture shift issues with it, and all the problems that come when people are thrust into changing professional environments.

Perhaps most frustrating of all is the business's inability to evolve for the future. Expedia will always be something of a middle-man between hotels and customers, but the company built a better mousetrap decades ago that allowed it to thrive as a premier OTA (at least domestically). I'm not sure there's been any innovation here since the inception of the company, and the business feels like a dinosaur that's surviving because it's so big... not because they offer anything technically compelling for the end user. 

Leadership's latest ""innovation"" is to consolidate all of Expedia's brands. But that's just a reshuffle. This company desperately needs true reinvention to thrive this decade, and personally I don't see it happening."

Lateral moves within the company are encouraged but no change to salary allowed even if you have years of great experience which feels counter-intuitive & more likely to make strong employees jump ship to another company which ironically is exactly what the company doesn't want happening.

- Cool location in Angel and very social company. A lot of restaurants/bars outside
- Some people are very friendly! You will definitely make some friends there","- Huge workload that gets bigger and bigger overtime, however headcounts will not increase so you end up taking the hit
- Due to the attitude of some senior managers (Directors to SVP Level), bullying has been normalised within the Sales team and this has spread to other departments closely working with them
- At some point your workload just becomes impossible so management will find ways to make you leave and they will just hire new people instead so the circle can continue
- At the same time, those managers will get promoted, so E4B just becomes more and more toxic as we speak. If you have a family or are a care taker, be prepared to leave in stress 24/7 and never really enjoy your life inside or outside work...
- On top of this, the pay is low. They advertise themselves as a Tech company but will not match the Tech industry salary. Bonus is gone since COVID hit too...

I used to feel comfortable saying 'hi' and speaking up in meetings with C-level leadership. It now feels like we are minions/cogs in the machine to them.
- Managers are more focused on metrics over people. Yet, don't even know how to action the metrics.
- My manager even admitted how toxic our team is and yet he's not given the bandwidth to actually remedy.
- Management doesn't listen to feedback in All-Hands
- When bringing up issues via All-Hands Q&A, the only response leadership says lately is ""bring it up to your manager"".
- New Campus is frustrating to get to and work isn't flexible (despite them thinking it is) so be expected to go in. 
- Nepotism; director hired on their best friend considered as a double promotion. This was into an area they have no prior experience in. The person is not doing anything that was expected so we basically lost a full resource we were expecting to have with this hire.
- Attrition; I can't go a day without seeing someone leaving the company either on LinkedIn or a 'goodbye' email.
- Micro-management and no compassion; during the height of the pandemic, I had ER visits for my sick pet. Instead of receiving compassion, my director asked me how I was going to be available if questions arise. 
- Inclusion isn't there or lacking. We can only focus on one marginalized group at a time just to meet hiring metrics. Zero intersectionality or desire from majority of employees to learn about diversity and inclusion."

Hiring has become a challenge for the company. 
HR recruiters themselves have been leaving. 
Processes are extremely slow. One part of HR doesn't know whats going on in the other part, and that makes employees suffer at times. 
Senior management has been involved in lot of politics and good teams end up suffering. In order to contain attrition in US, they end up moving most of the critical work to US/ Europe teams only, while India teams are left with maintenance work.
Most of the senior management is finding jobs and are just waiting for the right opportunity to get out.

Because I don't have a formal degree, I would not even be considered for positions that I have earned here.

In addition, I still get my full vacation leave for the year and accrued sick time.

Expedia also pays for me to have a travel agent license which allows me special discounts when I travel. They also have a reimbursement for both fitness and","When I started as a front line Fraud Analyst, the department seemed to foster more of a creative environment.

Diversity and inclusion policy was insufficient and very US-geared and did not make sense in a Canadian context."

The company seems to be ok only for managers, which get promoted every few months and for Technical engineers where the lowest levels are set as high as managers in the salary range. Everyone below that is treated as a replaceable drone.
Supervisors are either overworked by their managers or seem to be doing nothing but the minimum.
Potential gets wasted with robotic trainings, thinking is not promoted or thought as a good thing, just reaching a number at the end of the month is all that matters, even if you cheat your stats to get it!
Knowing an extra language is actually a nightmare of never ending asks of help, which is never rewarded, and it makes English speakers an elite that barely helps but asks a lot of other analysts. 
And all of that even before covid hit. Now, it's a little bit worse, the lack of promotions has made everyone over competitive, there is barely any teamwork among the analysts, the team feels very distant and divided."

Lack of direction"
525,Expedia Group,Toxic And Politicized Environment,2021-09-11,1.0,Senior Manager,Free food and Cab facility.,"There are several cons with this company because of their leadership and management. I have worked with Expedia Group gurgaon over 4.5 years in NOC. Here is my thoughts 
1. LACK OF LEADERSHIP: Till date, I am failed to understand are some people in NOC relatives of the Owner of the company because there is no reason for them to keep them in NOC. 
2. BUSINESS LOSS: Outages are uncontrable, lack of clarity, highly sensitive environment with no backup or redundancy plan, Buy costly technologies but handover to inefficient managers. Highly demanding and stressful environment. Though some higher people enjoy reimbursements of their personal bills in the name of team lunch / dinners.
3. INTERNAL POLITICS AND WORST ETHICS: Inside the promotions are not based on performance or work you carry. It is totally depend on how much time one spend in cafeteria building their personal relationships at the cost of company. Offer some free drinks to foreign leaders take them on free luxury trips, offer everything they want specifically that feed their lust and a promotion to a rank of manager or leaders is for sure. There are many people across expedia who are worst performers but become manager just for that reason. 
4. LACK OF COMMUNICATIONS: Maximum communications in the company is with the immediate boss who usually are threatening employees to cost his job if says against him. Sr leaders or directors do not talk to their skip level employees to burst the politics bubble and works only on decades old FEEDBACK system. People are frustrated as no one is there to hear them. All good employees either wish to leave or already left.
5. SINKING SHIP: Whatever is told by leadership in fansy magazines but the reality of wrapping up most of Expedia businesses are due to internal leadership problems than external factors like COVID or travel industry. 
6. CARRIER DEATH: Its a clear carrier death as Expedia uses latest technology by putting old people same like buying a Ferrari and running at Maruti 800 style."
526,Expedia Group,Great company to work for,2021-09-11,5.0,Instructional Designer,"Great benefits, great culture, great CEO, great offices",Compensation could be a bit higher for some roles but they are working on it
527,Expedia Group,"Disappointing, though expected, end to my Expedia tenure",2021-09-10,2.0,Reporting & Analysis Manager,"Pros? OK here are a few. First, fitness reimbursement. I got quite some fitness gears using the reimbursement for both me and my family members. Second, there is parental leave, 10+ weeks for father and a new baby cash bonus. Third, mostly friendly colleagues. There are some disrespectful folks but the majority are friendly.","Here come the cons. 
1. The product, or expedia.com. It is really subpar. They lack many features that are common online. For one, they don't have a shopping cart on the site, meaning if you want to make multiple purchase, you would have to go through the shopping funnel multiple times. For another, they don't support free form search. You would have to pick the type of item you want to buy, and then enter the location you are going, and date. You cannot just enter ""flight from Boston to London"" like you can on google. 
2. The competition. With google rolling out it's own travel product and directing traffic directly to hotel or flight carrier site and bypassing Expedia, I just don't see how Expedia can compete. Plus, Expedia lack a strong value proposition to persuade visitors to book on expedia.com instead of hotel or carrier site. Why book on expedia.com when I can just book on fourseasons.com? 
3. The pandemic. It's Fall 2021 already and the coronavirus is still around, at least in United States. As long as the pandemic is still around or people still fear it, Expedia will never recover. 
4. Employees. While most are friendly and professional, there are just too many people in the company, and frankly, some are really incompetent. This might have changed now since Peter Kern has been downsizing the company, laying off employees, merging teams, and selling off assets. On the other hand, some so called managers or directors are just not smart enough. My first manager was great, smart, dedicated, gave me room to work on stuff. My last manager was just totally a low person, does not know the business well, have no idea in the area she's responsible for, and was rude and disrespectful. And she was promoted by her manager, who is another incompetent person that cannot even speak English well. 
5. Compensation. If you've heard Expedia pays low, it is true. My next job after Expedia pays me substantially higher. Substantially! This has a negative impact on talent acquisition and retention as well. Over the years I've seen so many ex-colleagues going to amzn, msft, fb, and other companies. I rarely see folks coming to Expedia from those companies. People don't consider Expedia as a tier one tech company because Expedia just does not pay tier one money."

If a stakeholder is angry or frustrated, we immediately jump into action, take back our recommendation, and fix it to their liking. We have to grin and bear it, not argue our point, and push our expertise to the side. We are looked at as a department where you can place your order and expect it done quickly despite reality.

The London office is stunning too.","A lot of changes, some of which could have been avoided quite easily (e.g. renaming the account management team something different every few months, even if not much changes in terms of what the team does/who it comprises of), it confused both tenured and new colleagues alike. Also, I feel a lot of what middle management were doing was simply hovering over their subordinates, hoping they would bring results to make them look good as opposed to actually empowering and coaching their teams or picking up the phone to partners themselves.

It is hard to maintain a culture when many of the people in it are leaving to keep it around. Leadership will say to take care of yourselves but have a high demand to stay on track for multiple initiatives. It can be hard to feel OK taking the time off that you need for a mental break. Also, there is clear favoritism at the company. In the summer of 2020, design leadership announced that no one will be receiving promotions for mid-year.

The work process is very disorganized with weak project management. They don't stick to timelines or even have them and they don't deliver on time. It's a highly reactive environment that is also ultra political and not strong on planning. There are a lot of people who sit on the sidelines offering criticism and negativity who don't have a creative bone in their body. They don't do any of the strategic or creative thinking but they love to tear apart other peoples' work. It is very sad. They love to design in PowerPoint which is ludicrous at best.

2. Some perks like free food and cab at India office.

3. Great Work life balance and leave policy","1. Over last three+ four years in the organisation few things  have moved, competitors are doing better. 

2. Too many management layers there are so many managers, senior managers and directors with one or three directs.

3. Top down approach. Things are decided at top level, before covid, senior leadership used to go out on retreat to think about product. Junior folks are often excluded from planning and ideation.

4. Not smartest people to work with. Can't afford to hire FAANG talent. Can't even retail good talent. 

5. Pay is not competitive, Covid made situation worse. 

6. Expedia is not doing 'next' in travel. Vision is clear mission is not. For ex. local activities the area where Air B&B made huge progress is still flat here at Expedia.

7. Career progression is often difficult or unclear. 

8. Execution speed is slow. Look at checkout pages it's still the old page even after years where other pages and LOBs have already migrated to new design system."

Often you will get no requirements and then be asked for a date. Then when you push back they'll throw everything but the kitchen sink at you in terms of requirements.

- Benefits: wellness, travel, discounts etc.
- Very good work-life balance 
- very open culture, no hierarchy, it is easy to approach any team player up to C Levels
- ability to relocate
- social security: thanks to the workers' council in Germany you feel safe, even if the company is going through big challenges","- lack of innovation, the company takes years to introduce a simple feature, which the main competitor do overnight 
- work in market management teams has become extremely monotonous with the introduction of artificial intelligence to the processes, people are bored and not challenged, systems often give nonsense hints regarding what you should talk to the partner about
- internal systems allow a lot of room for cheating (point capture system), which gives often a benefit to some people and leaves others behind, depending on your luck and market allocation. At the end of the day, people get rewarded not for real work, but cheating, which is extremely demotivating to those, working hard. 
- there is not set-up career plan for you. Promotion opportunities in Germany are rare and all internal and external candidates have the same rights so that you really have to fight each time a new door opens, which leaves many people sitting there for 10-15 years on the same chair."

1008,Expedia Group,Work here if you don't care about compensation (SWE) and countless re-orgs & layoffs,2021-03-26,2.0,Software Engineer,"- A lot of women in engineering and other tech roles compared to a lot of other tech companies
- Good WLB depending on the team
- Ample opportunity to learn and grow- as long as you pick the right team
- Non-toxic environment unlike some other major tech companies
- Decent/standard benefits- health plans, 401k matching, sick leave, PTO","- Compensation is well below market for software engineers. It's a bit laughable, but many stay because of the more lax WLB and workplace environments. There are plenty of very smart engineers, but the messy code base and architecture could improve a lot by hiring top talent who are leaving for companies that pay way more.
- Not enough support given to junior level employees; They placed some freshies into completely wrong teams that are better suited for mid-levels and above. Then the juniors wonder why it's taking so long to get a promotion and switch teams very late after realizing that they were on a bad team
- Expedia's product is very complex and quite frankly the legacy code base is a huge mess. It causes many inefficiencies and difficulty debugging high priority issues. 
- Too many re-orgs in the couple of years that I worked there. Some of them seemed caused by underlying politics in upper management without a thought to the workers they impact
- Layoffs were handled terribly. There was literally no rhyme or reason for who got let go; A lot of very talented people who were there for many years were cut. Seems due to the fact that those people had high senior salaries and can be replaced with cheaper juniors
- Upper management is a mess. It's mentioned before many times on here, so check those for details.
- Expedia grew a lot over the last couple years behind faulty management and leadership; The chairman, Barry Diller, decided to blame the workers by ""trimming the fat"" with mass layoffs."

I feel respected, have a lot of autonomy, love my coworkers (who haven't left!) and have the flexibility I need in my life.

You have work & life balance,"Poor management, insecure managers with poor communication. You are threatened by managers with losing your job or treated unfairly when you raise your problems. They don't provide clear/realistic directions and don't help you when you ask assistance. You somehow find your way and they gey the credits over your work. If you can't find a solution, they blame you instead and show to upper management that they tried hard. Upper management ignored the situation even though they were aware.
Salaries were quite low comparing similar companies. The scope of the tasks were just increasing dramatically while salary was just the same."

1071,Expedia Group,Toxic Orgs,2021-03-08,2.0,Director,"It's a large organization, and I imagine some spots are better than others. And even through the pandemic it has managed to maintain its business foothold as #2 of online travel agent. Some managers try to do the right thing but it's not common.","The particular organization I was at has a toxic culture, probably because it's a cost center and an afterthought because most of the company is focusing on sales rather than post-sales. A certain Senior Director I reported to is the worst kind of leader: Will do anything to get his own promotion to VP due to his own insecurity that his peer have all risen and he has not. To gain executive visibility he'll make any promise that is asked of him and completely ignore the reality of his very stressed out organization. As a result the departure rate is super high, particularly the ones who are capable and can easily find jobs; but instead of focusing on recruiting to replenish, he has some high minded notion of what kind of person he wants on his team, and so hiring is severely lacking, which in turns drive more departure, and the organization falls further behind, which makes him less secure and more desperate, which means the viscous cycle worsens."

You will work and interact with (mostly) great people of different backgrounds and nationalities. The international mix is enjoyable and even addictive. You will make friends for life, even after you have resigned from Expedia.
Expedia has a few nice benefits: pension contribution (doubling of your own monthly contribution), meal vouchers, yearly wellness budget to spend on whatever you prefer.
If you are looking for a company with nice people that provides a stable monthly income for only 8 hours a day and you are not too ambitious then you should consider sending your CV.","Previous decennium Expedia was listed in the top 5 best employers world-wide until a number of years ago, yet unfortunately has been reduced to a below-average typical US-led corporation which is no longer interested in the concerns of its human capital.
Expedia's answer to any problem is to implement more corporate policies, processes, procedures, more restrictions and in particular more micro-management. You will be measured and monitored for your entire online activity. Only working cases is marked as productivity. The providing of training, mentoring, or learning about new processes or technologies are considered as non-productive activities. Experience, seniority and added value have a negative effect on your statistics. At the end of the day/month/year you are a number with performance statistics in some Excel. 
Management is not supportive but will remind you of your corporate duties and not to expect anything or question any decision making. The result is that many well-performing, knowledgeable, experienced employee have left the company annoyed and frustrated while other non-performing employees can remain in the company (as long as they produce the bare minimum of statistics). Expedia is not a knowledge-driven organisation that invites proactiveness or changes but instead a rigid corporation that rewards obedience and compliance."

Also Expedia is boasting about all its D&I initiatives yet black people are fleeing from the company like the plague. I interviewed for an internal role here and the blatant racism and bias that the hiring manager displayed was disgusting. It’s impossible to move up at this company if you are black. Please don’t waste your time coming here. I’ve applied to multiple positions at this company and I’ve interviewed a countless amount of times. Everything always ends up with the same outcome. They’re way too political. If you’re white though opportunities are at an abundance here."

Under the new CEO, the org is being sold for scraps. Vision is to turn Expedia into a nimble and agile org but the senior management is just incapable of delivering change. Most of the folks at Sr. Director/VP/SVP level have been around for donkeys years and moved up the org without any precedent of delivering impact. Those same leaders(?) are trying hard to reinvent themselves in this new org and they're using the same inefficient means (meetings, townhalls, Strategy sessions, State of the unions!???) without any execution!
Airbnb, Booking and Trip are stealing share across markets and target segments and unfortunately, its only a matter of time when cost cutting measures will not deliver any incremental impact. The employees see it too. The engagement and morale are unbelievably low and expedia branded CVs are floating around the job scene.

* Transparency into comp process is low

* Lots of ""high importance"" projects that numerous teams spend hours and hours on that go no where. Easy to identify project is bad early but unwillingness of management to move on 
* Lots and lots and lots of meetings 
* No big picture view. Eg, 5 step process where your team owns step #2 but no one knows what happens the rest of the steps. Not great from a process ownership or development perspective + lots of duplicate work across teams 
* Poor legacy processes and systems 
* Technical accounting issues all assessed at high levels and background/reasoning not communicated adequately to preparers, told to ""do this"" going forward but when you ask why your managers and directors they have no clue. Truly shocking for yours truly"

As a newcomer you will think this is such a cool and fun place to work, but the excitement eventually dies down once you start seeing clearly. Management is a joke and are horrible people managers. They only look out for themselves and everyone beneath them are disposable. Promotional opportunities are scarce and they give the illusion that everyone has a fair shot. In reality, management already know who they want in the next role and pit people against each other and watch them fight it out. People are promoted based on 80% on how much you suck up to management and 20% on actual competence. This is how New York ended up with a team of managers with a poorly run office with low morale. They are also working very hard on promoting diversity and inclusion recently, but don't be fooled. Look around the office, its really not that diverse."

Simple projects are getting over discussed with countless meetings creating huge overhead just to keep people busy and make non technical managers managing technical projects feel important.

Covid is not great for the industry and the group but it is a great chance to improve efficiency and streamline existing processes."

Work life balance was good before COVID. You will get to meet amazing colleagues along the way,"Managers have horrible coaching abilities and they will never put themselves into a vulnerable position to show that they don't know things. Their version of ""coaching"" means you go figure it out yourself and I'm just here to brag about it if you do a good job to other managers and their bosses. Mid to upper management politics has taken this company from a proactively solving COVID issues company to a stagnant bragging company that never gets things done.

Technology and innovation is slow moving and feedback rarely gets heard. Things that do get implemented, competitors have been doing for years. A move forward for Expedia is a catchup in the real world.

Growth is few and far between and lots of ""sucking up"" instead of ""true hard work"" will get you noticed. A true corporate experience."

1646,Expedia Group,Great Work Place!,2020-10-01,4.0,Market Associate,"1. Great benefit - care for employees
2. Good learning environment",not much career growth in moving up to higher position
1647,Expedia Group,Best benefit with some conflict.,2020-10-01,3.0,Market Associate,"Good work environment, friends, office, work station, company benefits. The company is flexible about working hours (8.00, 9.00 or 10.00 are fine), Good teamwork and support each other.","Communication skill is needed for all leader level. Leader teams didn't interpret communication to align with each other. So workflow and results are different in each region/ super-region (EMEA, APAC, etc.) So have to fine-tune and make alignment in the team."
1648,Expedia Group,Not a good company,2020-09-30,2.0,Market Associate,"1. decent salary
2. benefits: travel money, travel discount, meal vouchers, wellnes and fitnees money
3. nice offices
4. friendly employees
5. yearly bonuses around 10%","1. it is a call center - which is nothign bad, but they could tell it at the interview, do not know, why they are hiding it. They have specific targets, which you have to reached, which sometimes is not possible. You are calling the same hotel partner over and over again for the same stuff
2. Lack of communication - very bad in all aspect, misinformation, miscommunication in teams and in different departmens as well. 
3. everything is automatic: that means, the system is giving you everything, which sound good, BUT it is so annoying. So basically, what you are doing is: the system gives you a hotel, which you need to call and sell the products, the problem is, the system is giving you the same hotels over and over again, so you are calling the same hotel 5x per month with the same thing, the hotels partner are annoyed and pissed, but you can not do anything, because the system is telling you to do it. They have automatic dialing system, which means the system dials the number and call the hotel for you, when you do not do it yourself within the specific time frame, which was around 3 minutes. Good luck doing a business analysis preparation in 3 minutes. 
4. They do not really care, HOW YOU ACHIEVED your numbers - there were a lot of cheaters, which were kindy celebrated for achieving good results, but the ones who pointed the mistakes and cheating were not really favored. SAD
5. they prefer quantity over quality.
6. not really listening to the employees feedbacks - they do not really care, you have to have your number first, than you can talk 
7. salary - is decent, but be prepared, it will not rise. In my 2,5 years of working, I did not receive a salary rise. They give you a rise, because of inflation, so in summary, you will recieved the same amount of money. 
8. Yearly bonuse - honestly, you will get max. 3%, and I was doing good sales and did not received even 5%. Not sue, how much the cheaters received, but you get the idea."

Micro management, no respect for employees, they basically make one decision a day that makes the daily life of their employees worse. They will count how many emails and calls you make a day and give you always more work. They no longer replace employees who leave but delegate the tasks to others without consideration or salary raise. They justify everything with ""One team group first"", and if you raise your voice, you are being shown the door. What a horrific experience really!"

Use fake names on the phone when calling possible customers or hotels. Cant outright tell the hotel you suspect this is fraud, supposed to beat around the bush by saying ""we're experiencing a credit card processing issue"". Awkward conversations when calling potential fraudsters to try and get information from them to determine whether they are authorized cardholders or committing fraud. 

Metrics can be difficult to meet. Expect 85 a day, but that can be hard when you can't verify anything on the booking. The job isn't about verifying everything, but moreso judging the risk of a transaction, but they expect you to make a decision in roughly 3 minutes and move on. Then there's misfraud, when you let something fraudulent through, and reinstates, when you failed something you thought was fraud, but the customer successfully rebuttals. Both have such incredibly small margins of error, and will count against you even if the customer provided bad info initially. So they expect you to move fast and not make errors when dealing with barely any information on the bookings. Supposedly there's bonuses if you hit your metrics goals, but I never saw any. 

We kept losing access to fraud detection tools because the company was too cheap to pay for them, so stuff I learned during the training was already obsolete. 

Additional on-the-job training during Covid-19 was next to worthless. 30 minute to an hour video and a word document, then you're basically on our own."

Strategic direction is muddled, CEO says one thing and it gets interpreted poorly down the ranks. So much churn and poor decision making.

- The people I worked with were generally excellent and the work stimulating.

- I felt encouraged to participate in process improvements and generally engage in the way my team did its job","- Initial training is highly abbreviated to the point of being incomplete; ongoing training for established agents for new tools/processes could also be skimpy or non-existent beyond updating reference/knowledge resources. Those knowledge resources were not particularly well-optimized for search, use, and error correction. A lot of gaps were left to be filled by posting basic questions to the relevant internal comms channels. Depending on the particular workflow, the result seemed to be a wide variation in agent capability and partner/customer experience. 

- The internal recruiting process, in my experience, was frustrating to the point of being a disincentive to trying in the first place. Interviews sometimes didn't follow the company's own internal guidelines for relevant questions/formats. Follow-up could either lag by months or not occur at all.

- Compensation was at the low end for similar roles in my area"

1745,Expedia Group,"bureaucracy, large hierarchy of managers",2020-08-22,2.0,Software Development Engineer II,"- benefits, salary
- technology stack in some teams
- rotation opportunity","- bias
- judgemental managers: they keep watching you
- long hierarchy of LTs and managers, every 1 person out of 20 is director. SDEs are 7-8 deep long from CEO.
- if you know people, you get opportunities. even the external hackathon (IATA) opportunities are networking based 
- SDEs can be seen praising the managers, because of this bias and favouritism. 
- Managers can say - this is 2 hour job, why is it taking long.
- Because of this you will find unnecessary tech without design considerations, and new people get busy justifying it, or removing it. It took 1 month for a person to add cache, and 1.5 years for people after to discuss to remove it because it is not solving problem. Nevertheless the person who added in 1 month got promoted.
- speed matters while work, not quality in many teams, some managers are real badass.
- no firing for LTs because they are like government, they do decisions.
- keep LT hierarchy simple. Remove unnecessary roles in LTs. I've 5 people who are interested to know my status in LTs. One wants to start AB test, another wants to talk to external directors if I have any question. Keep it developer driven culture not LT driven."

It fosters a feeling of trust and collaboration between employees. Throughout my time there, I felt that the way my managers treated their directs was one of utmost respect and deep care. If something is going wrong, you will be given feedback and advice very quickly so you can adjust whatever needs to be adjusted.
As a result, the people I have worked with oftentimes mirror the way they are treated by their managers and everyone will go out of their way to help you succeed and make your journey a pleasant one.
People tend to be well-versed and engineers are definitely not the stereotypical reclusive programmers we've heard countless jokes on.","The biggest downside I can think of is the lack of innovation and how risk averse the company has become. Unless it's coming from the ground up, teams can end up working on some very minor tasks that are neither disruptive nor truly valuable for the business. If you have a team that promotes innovation and a manager that is willing to push it upward, then you will have a great time otherwise you may end up being bored and unmotivated.
In my opinion, the company is clearly not innovating enough and is losing its standing but instead of trying to tackle this, upper management has been reshuffling organizations around in countless reorgs it's become dizzying."

When things are going well management allows you to spread your wings and discover new skillsets. You definitely have to be pro-active on making things happen and not rely on HR or your Manager.","Management tends to be constantly changing course leaving contributors scrambling with little warning. There is a clear line between Management & Contributors. And as publically traded company you are at the mercy of the bottom line. No matter how much you contribute or how stellar your yearly reviews are. In a world where remote teams are common, there are areas where this is not accepted...especially in Customer Experience."

Travel benefits.","Manager capability and competency varied. In my final few years with the company I worked under meek, tactical managers who didn't bring vision or enthusiasm to their roles.

You learn a lot, because you have to find the answers by yourself.","The management is most of the time useless, trying to justify their position with useless meetings, labs or shadowings. 

Micro Management is like the colleague that you don't like, always next to you and disturbing you for nothing. 

They invested an insane amount of money in a new version of Salesforce which does not work properly. 

They call it ''The brain''. Even my 5yo brother is smarter.

When you need help or when you want to report a bug - ''Create a ticket''.
And it takes sometimes more than 1 month to get a feedback.

Because the quantity is their priority, people are cheating to be in the lights and the management does not care ! 

During the year, they tell you that your position, your title has changed and you have to deal with it or two options :

1/ Harassment and threats
2/ You can take the door

They already fired 3000 peoples a few weeks ago and because of the Covid-19 they want us to work 4 days instead of 5, for 80% of our salary, while they raised around 3B $ last week.

Everyone has a different salary, even if you have the same position.
When you ask why, no answer. Oh yes >> You can leave.

Still interested by the position ? Think twice."

Benefits are great (1 yr Maternity) and the office is really laid back with free drinks and beers once a month,"In Finance the director+ level is really poor. Younger staff will not learn anything from their mangers and are essentially left to themselves learning on their own or if lucky with other inexperienced/junior staff. As a result business processes do not improve and deteriorate over time. The directors I have seen are best described as ""followers"" not ""leaders"". Many managers are unable/unwilling to make decisions regarding issues, projects or processes. They tend to wait for others to make decisions for them and rarely offer an opinion. Really not a good place for a junior person to start and learn something.  Most people leave for the same reasons: jobs tend to be very dull (copy/paste, pivot, publish, repeat), poor career prospect and poor middle management team. Good people don't stay. There are better finance teams out there."

Company feels like it's in the ""Ballmer years"" - following, not innovating.  Leadership has shown a ""little brother"" complex in its concern about competing for talent with other tech leaders in the Puget Sound area, leading to some questionable and costly decisions at inopportune times."

A lot of high-level hirings from outside w/o industry experience and with personal goals above company's and interests of their teams spoil a lot of things.

Little to no growth opportunities if you are based outside of major offices, relocation is highly dependent on passport you have.

Company wants to align workflow, tools and approaches to max not taking local specificity and peculiarities into account. Trusting algorithms is a must even when data sources are at question, market knowledge and expertise has lost its value - you just need to execute."

- Employee benefits including subsidized healthcare, wellness / fitness, personal travel allowance, etc.
- Close-knit, cohesive teams despite often being geographically disperse
- Work/life balance is supported, particularly for virtual employees
- Lives and breathes a 'performance pays' culture under its new leadership. Be prepared to work extremely hard just to get a modest target bonus. This is a company only interested in attracting and retaining THE top talent.","- Inconsistent approach to investment. Unwilling to spend in some critical areas but will blow millions in purchasing poor 'off the shelf' products or spend years binding resources developing in-house solutions.
- At times very political. If you're not 'in the club', it can be very difficult to shape and influence business critical goals. Similarly with internal career progression where popularity rather than skill seems to govern internal staff movements.
- I became increasingly dissatisfied with the 'do more, with less' mentality. Positions in my team were never backfilled once vacated.
- Annual pay reviews and increases are out of step with market competition, barely keep pace with inflation.
- HR and Payroll teams are terrible. Unresponsive to requests for assistance, poor communicators. Didn't follow through with promises made during redundancy process.
- Employee Engagement ('Rate Your Stay') is a tick-the-box exercise each year. 
- Recruitment process is arduous due to the Talent team being perenially understaffed. As a candidate, you will pretty have have to get a referral from an existing staff member to even get a look-in. As a Hiring Manager, the process of backfilling a role or securing a new role takes months when it shouldn't."

2. you could literally wake up and find yourself working with a different team as a result of reorg (happened to me)
3. not financially safe given the latest layoff wave (happened before COVID-19)
4. although they advertise for the ""work-life balance"" benefit, the Chairman makes public remarks that the company has ""all-life-no-work"" situation. it makes you feel unvalued.

The board is completely out of touch and ill-equipped to lead a diverse (aka, not 70+ year old, white men) workforce. 12% of the company was laid off with little communication or consideration of the impact on employee morale. With no plans to replace the CEO, the impact of COVID-19 on the travel industry combined with chaotic, inconsistent leadership has left Expedia, once renowned for its stellar culture, in a stressed, overworked state."

1939,Expedia Group,Substantial Decline,2020-03-21,2.0,Software Developer,The benefits package is really good.    My co-workers are wonderful and I'm lucky enough to have an excellent manager.   They are flexible about WFH and commute options.,They don't walk their corporate values talk and haven't for a long time.  Comp is way below market rate.   Bonus is contingent on number success variables so we'd gotten our full bonus 1 time in 5 years.  Bloated levels of upper/senior management with high salaries and no productivity.  These folk weren't laid off when high performing ICs were cut instead.  Calls for management to explain themselves in terms of protecting their own were totally disregarded which has only sapped post-layoff morale even more.

It has become immensely more bureaucratic in recent years.  Lots of top down decision making has led to more internal politics where saying “yes” and “how high/fast” is valued over critical thought.  Just make sure you deliver a winning test at all cost, including playing with the numbers if necessary.  This has limited true innovation leading to the site and core platform falling behind.

- Disorganization. It's almost impossible sometimes to figure out who owns what, or to get a straight answer to a question. Sometimes you have three different bosses who all have a different idea of what you should be doing.
- Shortsightedness. If it can't produce results in less than a quarter, management thinks it isn't worth doing. Meanwhile, the company is slowly sinking.
- Career progression. What a a joke. Qualified people wait years for an overdue promotion, while no-talent suck-ups are given big titles where they do nothing but ""partner"" all day. Most people have to get lucky and work on a project that impresses someone four levels up.

- The job itself is quite repetitive and monotonous, even if you discover gaps or glitches in the system, there's almost no way to achieve any improvements on any level.
- The company's digital marketing know-how is probably way behind industry standards, therefore even if you do your best, localization won't have many impacts on your market's growth

- Benefits/ Travel credit: you have to cover your trips in advance and they'd reimburse the amount later on, but only if you book your trips on Expedia brands which leaves you with no cheap traveling opportunities at all, not to mention that your credit barely covers more than a weekend trip (it's about 500 USD)

Fun work environment. Lots of parties, lunches and events with fun people. 

Decent pay, but not industry leading at all.

Great benefits, fitness credits, insurance etc are all good. PTO is generous for tenured employees.

There are professional development programs available if you want to develop more skill sets.","A lot of hostility by hotel partners toward the company. Makes it difficult to have a productive conversation. Completing a “sale” often had minimal effects on your KPIs, and led to questioning what you were actually doing. So much of the job is automated that it can get boring. 

Work can be very repetitive. If you’re not a die-hard sales person, this job isn’t for you. Hotel contacts you work for are often busy, leading to entire days where you can’t reach anyone over the phone. It was described by recruiters as being way more analytical and data driven, and not salesy at all. In reality, I was worried that I was losing skills and falling behind due to lack of learning or stimulation. 
Upward mobility is hard past the associate level, despite messaging.  

Promotion is entirely based on favoritism or scarcity of upper level positions. A lot of folks at Market Manager or above were put there when the org was smaller, did not necessarily earn their title. Managers insistent that promotion is based on ethereal qualities that are hard to qualify, when in reality promotions only happen when there’s a vacancy.

The excellent benefits and work balance create complacency on certain teams, it was frustrating to see coworkers on their phones or social media for entire days barely doing work. Due to high turnover, a lot of mediocre employees were hired, which was demotivating to existing employees. It certainly made me question my own worth and qualifications.

People and company hidding many things from the employees. You have to be drunk in order to survive with the presure and the rythm and the requests from your managers. If you are good at something you have to hide it or else you are going to stay at the same position for years.  People just work there because of the insurance and the salary . Only managers will come and write here nice reviews. I would do the same if i would sit on a meeting room for million of hours doing nothing.  I dont want to forget to mention the amazing end of the year review where you are forced to spend many hours out of work to create it in order for it to be formal for your manager and not to be true as it should be.  Bonus is the amazing thing on this company. If your manager likes you you will get amazing boost even if you dont meet all the requirements . Your bonus will be amazing  all you have to do is say yes on everything. If you meet your targets and your goals you will never receive the bonus you are supposed to earn :) . Play smart if you need some additional money .

The environment is low stress, since there is very little pressure around deadlines or deliverables (which is a double-edged  sword, see below).","Expedia's real corporate philosophy is cheapness. Corners are cut everywhere: projects are overly ambitious in scope and then absurdly underfunded and under-resourced, compensation is non-competitive (especially in the Seattle market), licenses and contracts are negotiated down to levels that can't possibly be sustainable for partners and vendors. Hardware is often ancient; the laptop that I was issued had a label on it that proclaimed it was Windows 7 compatible.

- Easy to move up if you're willing to relocate
- Good job if you like talking to people on the phone a lot","- Incredibly boring job that doesn't make you feel any level of fulfillment. You'll spend 9-5 calling hotels and begging them for the best rates and room availability. There's not much strategy outside of that.
- Lots of recent changes that have made the role even more robotic than it was before. Leadership has removed team leadership positions that previously would allow market associates to gain more experience in other areas such as finance or marketing. Now, they only want you to focus on contacting as many hotels as possible. Quantity > quality.
- Very difficult to move up if you're unwilling to relocate. If you don't want to relocate, it's practically seniority-based so you better hope a few people above you leave! (pretty common since there is high turnover in market management)
- Not challenging at all, and you won't develop really any technical skills. On most days I'd think ""I can't believe I went to college to be doing THIS.""

2172,Expedia Group,Great company to work for... if you're in the right department.,2019-09-16,4.0,Engagement Specialist,"I was able to work at Expedia for 3 years. I started out as a contractor in one department then was able to make my way into a permanent position in another department. I will list out below about the positives of working here.

-Work/Life balance is fantastic for a corporation. I feel like the Expedia as a whole cares about their employees and wants to make sure they can actually have a life outside of work. Over-time, at least in my positions, was never a thing. If you couldn't finish your work, you just come back to it the next day without sweating it. 

-Benefits are solid. Starting out of the gate, you get 15 days of PTO plus 2 floating holidays. You also have 401k, health insurance options, health and wellness reimbursements up to $600 bucks and a bit of travel reimbursements. They are also willing to match up to 6% of what you invest for 401k. If you happen to work at HQ, they also provide an onsite health clinic and gym for employees. 

-Flexible schedules - I started my day at 6am every day just to be able to beat out traffic and was out of the office generally at 2-2:30pm.

-They work hard on making sure everyone feels welcome and included no matter race or culture. They put an effort into having company events for a wide variety of different holidays. 

-Managers that you can relate with. I had excellent managers that actually care about how you are doing and want to know what is going on in your personal life to better accommodate you in the office.

-They do want to retain people when they can. If you do your job well as a contractor, there is a good chance that they are looking to make you into a permanent employee, unlike companies like Amazon that will work people hard for 3-6 months then toss them out like office trash.","Depending on what department you get into, it can affect how you work and how you might feel about your job.

-Some departments love using time trackers such as the Omni tool to keep tabs of what their employees are doing during the day. Upper management will say that they don't micromanage until they force your direct manager to sit down and talk about your numbers to find out how you can be 'more efficient' even if you already have good numbers.

-Upper management will sometimes blatantly ignore what is being said among their employees. If big changes are made to the department, they rather stay the course even if it's burning out their workforce, just to say that something is working even though it isn't.

-There isn't much room for advancement. Managers/leads tend to stay in the company for a long time, so those who are below them will hit a point where they can't advance and compensation ends up not being enough. 

-If you don't use all your PTO in the year, it's gone. There is no rollover for PTO but there is for sick time. Managers do make sure to mention this to their employees pretty often throughout the year but there should be some rollover. 

-The HR department is an absolute wreck. First off, you would think a corporation of this size should have a physical department on-site at HQ. Every one of them is remote, which makes it extremely difficult to get anything done in a timely manner. When you have something pressing to talk to HR about, you can expect it to be anywhere from 2-5 days of waiting. Yep, DAYS!!! It's infuriating when you are trying to be time conscious and they don't seem to give a damn.

-If you are applying for a job, don't expect to hear back from them anytime soon. Expect on average about 50+ days to hear back from them, even if it is just to send a rejection."

2201,Expedia Group,Going downhill,2019-09-03,3.0,Software Engineer,"Getting the chance to work with some really smart people, more casual and easy-going work environment and dress code than most companies.","This used to be a fun and creative company with a start up like culture, especially in engineering. No more! Unfortunately, under the new management (after Dara Khosrowshahi left) Expedia is fast turning into another boring corporation. This used to be a place where people had fun at work and enjoyed themselves. Right now it's a lonely place where people are hiding behind their headphones like at so many other companies. 

Mark Orkestrom seems to be a promotional CEO and even his laughter seems rehearsed. Personally, I don't trust much of what he says. A lot of the inspirational leaders like Aman Bhutani have been leaving in droves and have been replaced with careerists who try their best to make people work harder and harder. This leaves less time to work smart, be creative and come up with new ideas.

The company has been on a path to centralisation and unification which actively discourages trying new things and forces everyone to use the same tools and methodologies. On top of this you have the long term Expedia problems with company cult-like culture, active promotion of certain social and political views and constant re-organisations. The turnover is extremely high, to the point that there is not much stability at all. Getting a promotion is very difficult when your manager changes every year, sometimes even twice a year.

Last but not least benefits have been cut, for example the health care provider was replaced with one offering less benefits and encouragement for healthier lifestyle. 
Loyal employees are not really rewarded for sticking with the company. The 3 extra days leave people used to get after 5 years of loyal service have been scrapped. Personally I got a promotion without any salary increase at all. As a result a lot of loyal employees have been packing their bags in the last year or two.

No wonder the company is no longer anywhere near the best places to work in the UK on Glassdoor ,a list it used to top. Even worse, I feel that with the current management team Expedia as a place to work is heading only one way - down!"

They provide good benefits and a nice downtown office. I absolutely loved this company and this job before a particular person came into their management position. I was passionate about the business and excited for what was next.","I had my work/life balance privileges ""suspended"" for 2 months (eligible after 6 months, I received at 8 months with the company). She allowed other employees on our team who had been working here for less than 6 months to work from home and leave early for things such as hair appointments, while denying every request I made in this regard. These instances were a huge deterrent to me, and my confidence level plummeted, as I was being treated obviously differently than my peers.

I had many meetings with my manager about the management and feedback style that works best for me, as well as what I respond best to as an employee. She continued to disregard my requests and only notify me of mistakes and shortcomings, never an encouragement nor a thank you. The continuous negativity towards me took a real toll on my morale as an employee.
 
My manager's way of ""coaching"" me was to reiterate that me working for Expedia was like “trying to fit a round peg in a square hole” and that it would be “very mature” of me to decide that this job isn’t for me. In my opinion, because of someone who’s role is to grow and develop a team of people, I felt extremely discouraged and almost pushed out. I felt marginalized, disrespected, and discouraged by my manager almost every single day, and this took a sincere toll on my confidence and self-respect."

They have lied, stolen and even messed up our paychecks while stating “I did it myself, I know it’s right!”  Then FINALLY looking at our numbers and realizing that most people were under paid by up to $800!! That came from top HI managers (who for years have proven that they can’t manage.) SLIMY to say the least.  Have not received a base pay raise EVER.  Now that the syphon our commission- might has well work fast food (no offense to hard, honest workers anywhere).   No support, never see a manager, who are all bitter anyway, unskilled training, only good if you’re are liked by a few at the top.  Really is a total disaster- run away fast!!

Underperforming managers are not given support - this can damage the reputation of the entire team and harm individual chances of promotion.

There were also cool but unreliable fringe benefits, which is what makes them fringe benefits vs reliable everyday benefits; like Seahawks marching band would party at our offices when it was Superbowl and USA Today covered it. One year, my division of the company had a fancy Christmas lunch at a hotel. But it was just that one year out of more than five I worked there. 

It was like startup hustle energy everyday so when I left Expedia to work at a real start up, I was well prepared.","HR was non-existent for staff or only there to serve corrupt management. 

A lot of secrecy about little projects and worry about corporate espionage that would probably never really happen. 

People brought dogs and kids into the office often, even though we did not welcome kids outside of holiday events, and dogs were banned in our building. 

The company distributed an annual bonus that was not pegged to your performance but to how well the company did as a whole in the last year. One year our CEO got a bonus that literally broke world records for how much a CEO could make in a year, but the rest of us at Expedia got really small annual bonuses and we were told it was because ""the company underperformed."" It was implied that we caused the underperformance.

I found bags of what appeared to be cocaine at least 2 times in conference rooms my team had scheduled. 

My manager accused me of having affairs with a teammate but did not give same accusations to the teammate I was supposedly having affair with. They did this repeatedly for years and HR was aware but didn't care."

Analysts are on LinkedIn and can provide you an insight on how it is on the floor. Trust has been lost in senior management and analysts are no longer working special projects, but all analysts are working like they are FA I's. There is a push to meet booking volume so extreme changes were made in people's work schedules and their work load to make them all do the same thing no matter their level.

Career advancement is non existent. No more special projects to work on. Recognition and awards are no longer handed out.

There have been some recent promotions within the department, that those that were promoted were told they could keep their favorable schedules instead of giving those schedules to the seasoned analysts who have been there longer. Not sure why this decision was made, but it has caused the morale in the team sink even further. There is no trust that you can end up with a better schedule now. Feels like favoritism."

Depending on where you work, you can truly be in the hospitality business, working with hoteliers and being part of that culture - which is amazing and fun. Also Expedia is a truly global company and most tech teams are distributed across the world, so it gives most people an opportunity to travel to meet with the rest of the team.","John Kim created an amazing product culture, a true brain. However, ever since he moved internally to lead HomeAway (a subsidiary), Expedia has lost its way. There is little accountability and rigor applied to product management, giving product managers few role models to emulate. The prioritization has also moved away from being data-driven to opinion-based, a change that reflects the approach of the newer leadership team."
2343,Expedia Group,A mixed bag and a lot of wasted potential,2019-05-02,2.0,Lodge Associate In Prague,"-Good entry level employer, especially for expats in Prague and relatively unskilled people.

-Good salaries on average, but this varies a lot depending on your position and and, eventually, to the involved market.

- Being a worldwide company it can eventually offer many chances to travel and to grow inside it. Especially the fact that there are offices in basically all the major cities in the world is an interesting plus.

-Wide array of benefits, some of which are quite good.

-Great office infrastructure, international and overall young environment, and depending on the team you can build very good relationships with your coworkers. The company in general pushes a lot of activities in order to get the employees to get along together.

-The Prague office is an important place in EMEA for the company, many departments are located here and one could potentially take many paths. 

-Being proactive in terms of tasks and career direction can greatly change your daily life at work.

-Very dynamic environment, always something new to learn.

-Decent work/life balance. Regular office hours, some departments have weekend shifts, but all pretty regular.","-While constantly updating the entry salaries for new hires, the management struggles at adjusting previous ones, creating embarrassing situations in which the gap between fresh new hires and much more experienced employees is much lower than it should. They ""regularly"" adjust it, but the current politics about it creates a lot of easily avoidable frustration.

-The company gives you many occasions to give your opinions about the management, the company in general, and sometimes about future relevant changes in the working policy. Unfortunately though some episodes showed that, when it's convenient to the management and despite what's being told you, your opinions are worthless.
Although there's been a considerable staff turnover in the management since when I started working there, said episodes created dangerous precedents. Some decisions show a less than crystalline attitude towards the ""lower ranks"", with some not indifferent changes being only partially explained to you unless you actively inquire about them. 

-The cooperation between departments leaves a lot of room for improvement, especially when it comes to collaborating with the in market departments. 

-The trainings are very hit and miss in terms of how good your preparation at the end. Their importance is also quite relative because, depending on the necessities of the team you're working for, you might be requested to cover some tasks that go beyond your role.

-While them changing keeps things quite fresh all the times, the procedures are often pointlessly complicated, needing for some apparently banal tasks the involvement of multiple departments (which often leads to stretching of the timeframe), and many systems which are clunky, outdated, and not integrated with each other.

-Being a good team member is a double-edged sword, because you might ending up receiving extra tasks to cover issues created by other departments. To put it short, instead of fixing the issue at the source, they tend to overload competent workers because it's safer and easier.

-The career chances at the Prague office have drastically been reduced in some departments in the course of the last year because of some highly questionable changes in the hiring and promoting politics, generating an aggravating sense of stagnation for long-staying employees.
The recruitment teams are also sometimes very lackluster and sloppy in their processes.

-While quite extensive, the list of benefits could easily drop some of the most useless ones and try to get on the level with some of the most competitive in the market, and the company is honestly quite stingy when it comes to pay extras."

It's a well-known fact inside the company that a few individuals have benefited greatly from being part of a tightly knit group within which fast track to promotion is guaranteed, regardless of merit.
- As a corollary to the above, independent-minded yet highly capable individuals will be kept at bay from any career progression. This is an untold rule that everyone is aware of, and such individuals, therefore, tend to leave.
- The company is currently struggling to keep its place in the highly competitive online travel market and not able to think creatively. Management is risk-averse and will not commit to daring initiatives that would be necessary if Expedia were to become the market leader once again.
- More specifically, as per the previous point: for senior directors and above, the key to survival is to not commit publicly to ambitious initiatives and rather let subordinates make the first step. These managers take credit if an initiative pans out, and distribute the blame if it doesn't. 
- The move to Bellevue will place the company in a difficult position, as most employees live on the East Side and are quite unhappy about the situation.

Work life balance varies by organization but generally supportive of giving and taking as needed.
Culture varies drastically from team to team, so pick carefully. B2B is super favorable right now  with growth and lots of leadership support.","For the past 1.5 years company has been ""tightening"" belt and making tough calls in many organizations. Hard to keep morale up in this situation. We're missing the big top-line growth days. 
Some organizations have little cliques of like-minded leaders. Diversity of thought isn't as readily accepted as you might think.
Poor leadership at the higher levels is not being addressed quickly enough. Although attrition rates may be at or below industry norms, they seem to be increasing YoY at least in some organizations.
Feels like a bit of a downward slope of late."

All the big wigs making decisions are concentrated in one office, which leads to awful communication and planning with other offices. New ideas that relate to travelling at large but are not directly, explicitly linked to selling more hotels are seen as unproductive and pushed aside, counter to the guiding principles the CEO likes to talk about so much."

Expedia is stable and the risk of company failure is very, very low.  Layoffs are also not likely outside of very specific instances involving handfulls of people.
Management avoids terminating FTEs, to the point of keeping low performers.
There are many benefits not found at many other companies.
Management and senior ICs get to travel internationally a lot.","Expedia is not a Technology company.  It says it wants to be, but it is a Travel company first, controlled by the Product organization.
Conversion, and related KPI's, are more important than anything else.
Expedia's technical management, from fist line managers to VPs, are often not technical and have no programming experience.  No one at that level talks about ""Big O"", Algorithms, Data Structures or other CS concepts.
Monolithic thinking permeates architect and management thinking.
Most ideas and all decisions are top-down.  People are told what to do.  Problems are solved at the executive level and dictated into the organizations.
Expedia Group is really many separate businesses, each with a separate and different culture, tech stack, standards and processes.  Silos, and the walls they create, are everywhere.
Social Justice programs are promoted by everyone in management, and speaking out against them is just not done by anyone.  There is no debate or discussion.
Strong technical leaders are not embraced by the leadership community, and leave.  Most strong developers leave for more challenging and fast paced companies.  If you want to learn from great technologists, Expedia is not the place."

There also has been a clear trend back to headquarters in Seattle for key decision making which is a watch-out depending on what you are looking for.  Also it is probably best to be a specialist vs a generalist due to the centralisation of these functions. A watchout to those not in HQ is that now in the global work process you can have meetings early Mornings or late at nights and need to be careful to balance this.

- Updated technology and tools.","Only applies to Vietnam: the lean technology/startup culture, however, isn't translated to the regional level. The regional office is operated like a hierarchy with communication going down through 3-4 levels leading to an incredible excess of deficiency.  Politics and favoritism play a significant role in one's success forcing employees to have to play along with the leader's agenda in order to get recognized. Local management is incapable of building the team's capabilities on the core functions of their jobs, much less developing employees to grow in other advanced areas of their careers. While Expedia builds industry-leading products and provides industry-leading solutions, the politics depreciate the value of the company and discourage employees from doing things differently to their own strength."

Looks like company  has taken all new paths to achieve success as compared to its stragies followed until 2017 and there seems to be no clear strategy in place finally. The successful CEO (Dara K.) moved out and the new leadership is yet to bring goods. Companys stock price is dropping by some margin everyday. From 150s its now $111 and so running losses. Its not just this, bur the Company havent been able to respect talented people who worked with complete commitment, dedication and focus for all those past years. Infact, they showed them the exit route. They should look to re-hire brilliant minds back in all the departments. There is no work ethics. People are more interested in playing political games instead of just focussing on work. People making alliances to cause downfall of others. There is a lot of work to be done to bring the company back to top otherwise downfall is inevitable. SO think twice thrice before you join Expedia today and measure pros/cons carefully.

The entire place is a hivemind that convinces you that the horrible culture is worth it.  That going into work and planning on this person hating you today while you fix this thing and then by fixing it it'll make this person angry because you helped that person before you helped them is normal.

They have their own gang and lot of reach will expel you, upper management does not care at all. I have seen people who cannot write 10 lines of code becoming Tech Leads and most foolish guys become manager with lots of Ego. No sensitivity for female employees. If you are more dumb but have contacts then you can become director/senior director. Cost of promotion is getting liquor to your boss from army canteen or taking him his family on a vacation on your own expense. No value for talent at all."

2592,Expedia Group,Worst job of my life,2018-10-02,1.0,Loding Partner Associate,Free beverages. A generous voucher which you can use for a sports membership.  A good referral programme but based on my experience I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy.,"Work and training: the training itself was ok but there was no time to practice with a mentor before going live, which I think is tantamount before anyone starts working independently in a team like this.  

The work itself had the potential for being interesting and rewarding and there were growth opportunities; however, with the chronic staffing issue, it felt like working in a sweatshop with constant pressure to take phone calls even though there was more than enough offline work to do which was equally important. If you are new and need to ask questions all the time, it’s very frustrating if you cannot work at your own pace until you get the hang of things. I will not compromise the quality of my work but this expectation from the supervisors put undue severe pressure on me.  

The internal communication between teams needs a LOT of improvement. The tools are needlessly complicated and user-unfriendly and teams often do not share the same tools, meaning the one hand literally does not know what the other is doing.

The clients were amazing and the highlight of my day


Staffing: during my short time there (six weeks) two colleagues left and one gave his notice and at least three others told me that they would quit if they had another job lined up.  This was in a team of 20. It was a revolving door with staff. That should have been sending alarm bells off.  On any given day up to 20% of the team was not there (day off, sick, nobody seemed to ever know). Meanwhile, other teams were OVER-staffed! When I spoke to upper management about this, it was acknowledged that our team is one of the last ones to be grappling with the staffing issue. Some warning from management would have been appreciated as in retrospect the salary offered was not nearly enough to compensate for the workload and level of stress when I know that other colleagues in other language teams literally had no work!!!

Working with the client: I do not know why but Expedia chose to see the clients as being guilty until proven innocent. The level of mistrust shocked me. Our supervisors instructed us to push back repeatedly to the hotels even when they were clearly in the right. I witnessed so many instances where the “facts” in our tools were outright lies and conflicted with what the hotels were telling us e.g. claims from Expedia that the hotel waived the fees whereby their policy was not to do so.  Is this how you build trust with a client?  

So many processes could have been simplified—thereby improving customer satisfaction, if only we trusted the customer. So much for being an American company where that value is normally one of the most important rules to follow. 

I suppose at the end of the day, it's all about numbers and profits. However, there was such resistance to change. I lost count of the number of times I heard: ""We cannot change that process"" or “That’s simply the way it is going to be”. You can only hear that so many times before you get numb. To be able to survive in this kind of environment, you basically have to become robotic. 

I came to this company with so much hope and high expectations. Never has a company disappointed me as much as Expedia."

2. Good colleagues
3. Some work travel to see clients or visit offices in Missouri/Seattle depending on your role
4. Good office location with lots of cafes and shops near by","1. Low salary for London. This gets much worse over time due to the point 3 below.

2. EPS management likes ""buying""/hiring more people to grow their teams in numbers and bring in ""fresh blood"" (even though most of employees have been in the company at most 2-3 years!). Decisions about the need for the new hires are made quickly and there are a lot of open positions as a result of that. Most of us were hired for this reason. 

3. Unfortunately, the biggest drawback is that once you join there is no career progression as there is no concept of ""building""/developing the existing talent. There is a very limited number of promotions and no clear path for career progression for most of roles. You do not know what you need to do to qualify for a promotion. Majority of employees in the whole company are stuck and share the same ""seniority"" level. 

*All of these directly impact your work morale, professional competency and financials(!!) over time. *

4. Once it becomes clear to you that the management is not open to support you in your career path, then a conversation about looking for a job with another brand might be brought up. Although it is not redundancy as such, it is definitely not the outcome you would have hoped for when you originally joined this employer.

5.  The old-fashioned culture of machismo."

I've been at Expedia in the Chicago office less than 6-months, and I've already been encouraged to try new things and bring new ways of thinking to my role and team. I feel the company has been really receptive to it and willing to take risks so long as we learn from them. And while we are part of a larger organization, the small team structure allows us to operate with all the benefits of a ""startup-like"" atmosphere: scrappiness, working together, and a can-do attitude.",- There are some complexities to any large organization

The regional and middle level leaders have some kind of attitude problem which you'll notice from there bossy communications. 

They may poke in jokes how important it is to be in-aligned with their opinions. They favor people who use to node yes in their opinions. Managers skip scrum and 1:1 meetings 70% of the time. 

Expedia India has 3 round of interviews - one with dev & two with management. This shows how management is manipulating processes."

HR couldn't care less too. There's a 3rd party resource who are supposed to get reports from employees in anonymous ways, but even they don't do anything, they just tell HR, which is equally conniving with harasssment from managers. Retaliation is the law. There's no career expectations if you work in Latin America, although they tell you differently when you are hired. They lie. All the time.

Overall not a great place to work. Local Managers are incapable and creating the environment that will go against the company.","I worked with Expedia NOC in Gurgaon for more than 2 years. My experience with this company was worst specifically to NOC. Never ever had a work life balance everyday we extended our shifts just to save our jobs, after the recent change in Management style situation became worst as some of the individuals who were promoted to the level of manager without having even a basic management skills and even worst in their previous performance are just doing threat management. Everyday they give threat to the junior employee with the name of Sr. Leadership that if they don't do this or that (which they personally want) they will be ""Asked to leave"" as leadership given clear instructions to these managers “Fire anyone” they want. Making personal comments on gender, race, religion are very often. A junior level employee pass through several rounds of interview but to be a manager you just need to take some specific directors to leisure trips like Agra / Jaipur / local sightseeing to Delhi on your personal expense and you will be a manager. Work ethics is almost NIL. When someone from leadership pay a visit from USA these managers start threatening to junior employees that not to say anything against them otherwise they will be fired and also make sure leaders do not get time to meet junior employees. Female employees feel insecure and mostly offended by making personal comments. Overall I had a worst time working with this department and I would recommend to ignore Expedia in your carrier path."

Indian middle management is full of politicians, they are spoiling the essence of a tech company. 
There is zero product focus, coding standards are depleting everyday and non tech management promotes people who write crappy code and do the flattery.

Very few teams working on technically valued work, most of the serious work is being  done by US teams and india is becoming a back office. There is no innovation happening in india because of the talent being hired here. 

Too much politics for anyone who wants to focus on work, if you want to be promoted you need to have good connections with the politicians."

Innovative, fast paced, passionate, great benefits and a lot of opportunities. This is not the case if you are part of the EMEA HR team.","EMEA HR teams do not look after their team members in any capacity. The culture over the past 3 years has changed dramatically from one of passion, care, interest and optimism, to one of hard nosed, lacking in empathy and generally very cold and aggressive. This comes from the top down which means it is a very hard aspect to change. 
Opportunities that are open to the team member in the wider business are not on offer for HR members. Pay is substantially lower than the market rate. A lot of work is put in from the leadership to ensure that salaries are kept low. Something the HR team actively worked against in the rest of the business.
EMEA HR offers absolutely no flexibility around work/life balance and if you  are considering becoming a parent you will not want to be a part of this company. 
The leadership team operate with no transparency and difficult conversations or tough topics are silenced to death. If you raise an issue, you will either be stonewalled or penalised in terms of your future career in the business.  
As long as you do as you are told - there are no problems but if you question any aspect of how things are run in HR and why different rules apply to the wider business, you will find yourself an outcast very quickly. 
This company pays a lot of lip service to being an attractive employer and is the first to talk about diversity, women in leadership etc - none of these things are reality in the EMEA HR teams ."

Overall, though, this is a company that cares about its employees and offers a relaxed workplace where the quality of your work is priority #1. Being such a large company with so many diverse teams, there are a lot of opportunities to grow your career here, which is also a plus (as long your manger is supportive!)","By and large, no equity compensation (Until you're at Director level and above)

-First 3 levels are nearly the same and require similar set of skills  (Market Associate, Associate Market Manager and market manager), if you can do one of them, you can probably do all of them, apply for a higher position.

-Personal development is very limited, work on yourself by yourself

Lots of needless pressure to live up to the impression you gave at allll those interviews. The pressure gets worse as time goes on. 

This company has no interest in diversity or supporting women, carers, basically anyone with a life outside of work. 

My advice:  Take your job ad/description, and throw it in the trash. It will bear no relevance to what you end up doing there, so go with an open mind. This place is all about speed - don’t let people push you just because they’re the loudest in the room. Stand by your principles and demand a certain quality of work."

 There are a lot of departments and I hope they are different from the Fraud team.","Leadership,.
Lazy , rude and unprofessional management.
You see all over Expedia about transparency, but the leadership on my floor still does not know what that means.
Fraud team from the whole Expedia in Bellevue has a PM shift. Employees that work on PM shift are treated by ERS like ghosts. All the team parties, recognitions lunches to celebrate whatever, happen on AM shift, meaning that the employees from PM never enjoy anything , like they don't even exist. 
No chance to grow in your career. Most of the big companies like to incentive the employees to move on, to grow. Management should not be allowed to be at the same position for more than 3-5 years it should rotate. Do you know why? After few years at the same position, doing the same thing, the person automatically become lazy thinking that already know everything and won't put extra energy to innovate the business. With
rotation, you will always get people with new energy, new vision for the business, new ideas, etc. 
The opportunity to grow is so bad, that there is a manager doing the same thing for over 10 years ( just a reminder that is not even the most high level manager), and few employees doing the same job also for over 10 years. How they didn't become even a supervisor???
Also, the lack of the leadership is amazing. 
Expedia wants to talk about team work and helping each other, but the manager doesn't even look to your face. Totally rude! How do you expect a good feedback from an employee having a manager that started on a team, worked with for about few weeks and NEVER introduce himself? Ignored the employees for a few weeks until he finally decided to introduce himself.
I can't say for the whole Expedia since I have been only in one team, I am referring about the Fraud team.
The environment is soooo negative that it drags you down too.
To be honest I should not even say leadership since there are no real leaders at the team.
The tools to work!!!! What is that??? Internet extremely slow.
Before working at Expedia, I was very excited , but after few months and getting to known the company, to better say my team, I was very disappointed. 
There are no support for the employees complete the job.
For example, Fraud requires people that speak different languages, and it is always and issue.
We simple asked for the company provide Rosetta Stone for free to the employees since the job requires different languages, but they don't want to spend the money with that.
Language in this team is necessary and provision few Rosetta Stone to the employees to be able to learn at least the basic of the other languages, it will make. Huge difference.
This is on thing that I will also give as an example for management rotation. If the manager knows that different  languages in his department is crucial, why the manager never provided the Rosetta Stone to help the employees at least learn the basic to help their job and the business."

I have faith that the leadership is steering the company in the right direction and investing in the right areas.

You get to be part of an industry-leading company while work-life balance is still achievable in the Market Associate position.","There aren't too many cons about working at Expedia. There are less career opportunities for moving up in the company and less benefits in Canada compared to in the States, but still in line with many other related companies."
3144,Expedia Group,ok but getting worse with growth,2017-06-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,great benefits and great travel culture,with growth we lose the nice culture especially in the LPS area
3145,Expedia Group,very bad political environment,2017-06-18,1.0,Market Associate,Good pay and benefits. if you speak 3 or 4 languages then you can move to many places.,"The company is a dinosaur who is playing catch up with booking.com, they copy a lot of booking com but they claim that they are better.  You get paid more than the average industry but gonna make you work twice as much, there is a reason their work force is way smaller in comparison to the competition. 
A lot of managers who happened to be there when Expedia first expanded into their market, no leadership skills. 
The company has a disease called meetings for the sake of meetings, almost 8 hours out of 40 week is wasted on meetings and calls. A lot of bragging takes place at these meetings about achievements that never happened cause there is no way to measure it. 
lots of politics and it is very  very very hard to move up once you inside the company. better reapply and wait for the right role for you, so never downgrade for the sake of working for a big name.

last thing never trust the HR department, first they don't exist and if you raise an issue they will come after you and it doesn't matter if you are right."
3146,Expedia Group,Floor Supervisor,2017-06-16,4.0,Supervisor,Strong supervision from department manager.,Too much of being micromanaged.

Competitive benefits, competitive salary, good (but not awesome) travel perks.

People in engineering, at least, are able to move among teams to expand experience and influence.

Good focus on inclusion and diversity and gender balance (though still has a ways to go in senior and engineering roles).  Perfect score on HRC's corporate equality index.","Lots of bureaucracy, institutional roadblocks and bottlenecks.  Often frustrates efforts and slows things down.  Company hasn't yet figured out how to be both large and fast.

While many middle managers are great, some are terrible -- seem to be pushed around instead of pushed out.

It's a global company, so depending on your team and who you interact with, you may need to be very ""flexible"" on your work hours.  Some people/teams have great work-life balance, others do not."

The best part of this organisation is the Top management which have a vision and are constantly driving the company towards the new heights. This is one place where you can actually find a balance between work and life. HR policies are great and so are the perks. I guess no other company can even match the perks provided by the company. Overall a great workplace. Many regret after leaving the organisation.,Not much. Just the middle management is not that potent enough.

- L&D courses 
- Good stepping stone into industry as you make connections with many hotels
- Colleagues
- Standardised global way of doing things so you can talk to someone on the other side of the world and they'd know your exact problem","- Not much diversity in the job role so you’ll get bored quickly. You're pretty much stuck doing rate parity checks every day and not much else. 
- Micro managed having weekly meetings on your numbers and why you're not hitting them. You had to cc in a Market Manager in every email you sent. 
- The role is not very autonomous – not able to think for yourself, just do as you’re told. 
- Director is not a very good leader - he has claimed a meeting room as his own office in an open plan floor, ‘leading’ his team from there. 
- Overall culture favours outgoing and outspoken individuals. Takes them longer to recognise talent in quieter and analytical types. 
- Lots of favouritism and if you're not one of the favourites, then your chances of moving up the ladder or getting recognised will not come."

A company for losers, who are industry rejects, who cant get a job elsewhere.","Pay is below wayyyy avg.  Example:market rate is 200K, expedia pays 125k. Middle management is extremely heavy. More managers than developers.
The tech stack is a joke and outdated.  Every 5-8 people team has a incompetent director who are yes-men to their bosses. The team morale is low and keep missing deliveries. The teams are composed on incompetent industry rejects. There is no company wide initiative to build tools which help everyday dev work , like build systems deployment systems, there is no capacity planning. Company gets hacked breached by intruders as the  security of the network is very weak. The expedia website goes down and remains downs for hours. The management does not care about customer experience and does not refund customers who are eligible to get refund (Like cancellations, bad experience),Company looses bookings and customers are not even refunded. People who give glorious review are paid reviews. The employees are paid by $100 gift cards to give glorious reviews. 

Please dont work for them. Doing a minimum wage job is better than working at expedia. Anyway pay is also similar to min wag job.  This company will not exist in business in 5-6 years."

Recruitment process is totally corrupt, they don't hire people on the basis of merit rather they take people with connections or  those who can offer a good amount of money ( yes you read it right ) Recruiters in general are very arrogant they think of themselves as gods.

Recently introduced open talent policy( internal employees are allowed to move to different teams ) is  not being followed at all, recruiters will not even consider you, unless you lick their feet.

To much growth is pushing expedia india to its own coffin, just like any other company which kinda settles down in india expedia is hiring low cost low quality people and it is being promoted by top bosses and the useless HR dept"

- Decent benefits including travel and wellness reimbursement, travel discounts, standard 401k matching, good vacation policy, healthcare, and matching charitable donations
- ""Test and Learn"" culture makes data the main driving force for product decisions","- Generally poor middle management and heavy politics at management levels
- Some engineering teams have bad ratios of technical product managers/engineering managers to developers that create too much overhead and slow initiatives down
- Very unclear promotion paths and requirements. This causes a clash between the diversity initiatives and the meritocracy that the company preaches and can lead to a sentiment of unfairness during promotion cycles.
- Overall average engineering quality with some exceptions. Unable to maintain solid talent from leaving to other companies in the area (seems like Amazon is becoming a top destination)
- Expedia advertises itself as a tech company, but the culture of average compensation makes the company lag behind tech companies in the area.
- Constantly playing catch-up to competitors which creates less opportunities to pursue features that innovate or distinguish Expedia in the market
- Some product decisions feel short-sighted. Just because the conversion numbers are good does not mean it is good in the long run."

I had an immature manager who openly condescended and demeaned employees on my team in their presence. Frequent management churn killed employees' ability to be promoted. No clear direction or path to promotion, even when I repeatedly asked multiple levels of management (three levels up from me). Tons of secrecy. Managers rarely welcome new people who have joined the team nor do they thank outgoing staff--I think to try and cover up the turnover rate, unless they're just that incompetent. No concern for standard software practices like measure code coverage or sizing story cards according to story points (often confusing story points for number of days it will take to complete a story instead). Employees at all levels are generally unconcerned about their incompetence and even proud of what they don't know. In one meeting I was in my peers who were all making six figures joked about not wanting to add two double-digit numbers together because ""who does math, right?"" Finally, and this should be a bigger deal: why does the CEO of Expedia make more money than any of the CEO's of Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, etc? Come on! That doesn't make sense.

By the way, as someone has pointed out in a review, mediocracy is the word to define how leaders choose their employees. Apparently they don't like people who think ahead because it makes easier not to get confronted. Tech culture is not fostered at all. It's impossible to get promoted or move ahead because they won't even consider your potential, especially when the HR is conniving and get their ways to manipulate applications to open positions. It's impossible to get a decent position in other country, despite they love to say the contrary out loud to us. Home office is a taboo. 20 somethings with no experience at all struggling to lead their teams."

It's also a fairly political environment where people pay too much attention to their political posture.

Friendly coworkers

The company is very charity-friendly","Bad Management - Managers are clueless about the technology, and don't care about technical debt. They will push the team to produce more and more content and the code-base suffers. They tend to hire people who are under-qualified and keep them around.

Low Salary - almost anywhere else will pay more.

Nepotism determines promotions - go to lunch with your boss if you want a promotion

Women get more advantages than men. They are more likely to be promoted and given raises even if their work doesn't validate it. Under-qualified women get hired over qualified men. Women who make mistakes are not reprimanded as hard as men who do, and often men take the blame for women's mistakes. Expedia has a 50/50 policy where their goal is have an equal number of men and women at all positions. Since it's currently tipped towards men's favor, their way of accomplishing this goal is very sexist and hurts teams.

The code base is terrible. It's build on layers of ancient technology and making serious changes to the architecture is impossible due to the size of the problem and because management doesn't care. There is 20 year old code still operating fundamental services. Both the domain and client layers of the site are poorly written all around the site.

The site itself isn't aging well. The design looks dated and the site is too big to update it. It's also very slow. Consumers will find better alternatives elsewhere.

If Google decides to build a checkout system for their travel services, Expedia will have a hard time maintaining their position (which is currently only on top because Expedia Inc buys its competitors). Compare flights.google.com to Expedia and the difference is immediately clear.

You won't be learning new skills and improving as a developer much. The company cares about employees who know a lot about Expedia, not about development. Most of what you learn is going to be about how to navigate the terrible code, convoluted architecture, and poor practices."

As Area mgr, it encourages to grow within your role and to share this spirit accross your direct reports and peers to make sure comfort zone is usually crossed as a tool of continues growth and mentoring.","In my particular case, and I'm sure this is just the exception to the rule, my manager contributed to make me feel isolated by not providing support on a daily basis. I had the perception of being out of her golden circle probably built in the past 12 years She's been in that postition. Of course, no room for contributing with outside the box ideas (again, something unusual at Expedia). The atmosphere in the office was as a group of servants just thinking on sucking up the boss rather than a team struggling for achiving the best results. My personal reward is the nr of notes and calls received from other employees supporting me and feeling bad about my leave."

People may smile at you but the underlying culture is very toxic with constant backstabbing. There is not enough work and people constantly fight each other to get the piece of work to do. Most of technologies Expedia is using is very ancient. Employees constantly talk about how Expedia is better than big name companies like Amazon and Microsoft when in fact, Expedia compensation and benefits are below average.

The tech/IT desk is terrible at what they do and pretty transparently sexist. Expect to have to google your problems. For a huge company that on-boards a lot of people regularly, the on-boarding process was ridiculously bad. Documentation isn't up-to-date.

- The pay is alright and the bonus helps fill in the gap, but even more positions and employees are below the market average for the Seattle area.  There are also a fair amount of other, actually useful, perks for employees.
- There is a good amount of things outside of work you can help with and volunteer for.  They also offering a decent matching program for donation and volunteering.","- The biggest issue is the lowering standards for employees.  There are a lot of smart people working at Expedia, but those people have started to leave due to boredom and better offers elsewhere. Their replacements are considerably worse.
- Very low hiring standards, there are a lot of smart people out there looking for a new job, but it seems like they are no longer getting hired here, probably because of the below average wages.  Also, actually fire bad employees, do not let them keep doing nothing and dragging down other people's morale. 
- Reorgs happen way too often and, in most cases, for no real purpose.  They just happen, something changes, and the waters of who is doing what just gets murkier.
- Most of the Middle and Upper Management are not the smartest and it makes working for them really hard.  They seem to say stuff that is a complete opposite of the employees below them, the ones doing the actual jobs.
- HQ in Bellevue is massively over capacity, most people have a four foots desk that is barely big enough for two monitors and a laptop.  But, yet we are still three years out from moving into our new building we have had for over a year.
- So much wasted money, we have so many areas where five things are doing the work that one thing could do.  A prime example are the applications and tools used within Expedia.  Why do we need so many things that all do the same thing."

I've seen many very talented people giving up on Expedia just because they had no opportunities to grow, no support from their managers or simply because (quite openly) they were not the right fit from the PERSONAL point of view of the team leader. HR politics despite the size of the company are still very poor and in many cases decisions are made based on a personal opinion of a manager. Hcom and EAN have recently started addressing some of this gaps but the GMM (market management team) stays very much behind. It's a shame.

Expedia, offers employees Cliff vesting. Simply put, you need to work for them for two years or more, or your 401k, stocks etc, are not realized, aka, you get nothing. 

Those decent companies, appreciate employees ' everyday work. They don't play this trick to 'cash out' from employees. They sincerely share the benefit with everyone on a monthly basis, because they consider employees as human beings, who have responsibilities to feed their families. 

In Expedia, it seems only executives are considered human being. They have a different rule towards those people. 

Some have noted that, because of the fact in Expedia the attrition rate is high, they always have tons of jobs open - I am afraid this is true. 

If you do not want your career suffer, be very careful when you join."

5. Best senior manager I have ever seen. Great leader who care and concern about employees. And one who walk the talk.","1. Racism issue in the team and the manager want to address it. Believe it or not, I was told to accept it. Ended up continuously bullied by those people who stayed with the team longer.
2. Micro-managing. Restrict your toilet time. Working in shift with 11 hours, is already not happy. Added to that, you only get mere 15 minutes break each 5 hours of work, and not more than 10 mins a day at the toilet. Spending a bit more time in the loo will raise the awareness of the manager and be ready to get emailed or be addressed in 1 on 1. Even if you are late to office a min, you are doom.
3. All tickets replied have to be reviewed by QA, which is fine, but manager will address and magnify every concerns raised by QA. As much as I agree with providing best customer satisfaction, over-magnifying small mistakes every single week will not help in building up analyst confidence in replying tickets.
4. Hidden technical knowledge. Seniors have their own group of knowledge sharing, tier 2 has their own group as well. That to be said, you will never gain any new knowledge other than that from KBs, or sharepoint. UNLESS you have some really kind seniors who are willing to share information with you.
5. Pay is lower than average. Well, it get compensated by great company benefits. So it's really up to you to see if it's a pro or con."

However if you would appreciate some push to make you a better worker, maybe consider working somewhere else."
3393,Expedia Group,Amazing company,2016-10-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Expedia is a great company to work for. It is an incredibly inspiring and forward thinking environment. Employees are highly valued and our benefit structure reflects that. Development and progression are taken seriously and there is plenty of opportunity in this space.,"The size of the company means it can sometimes be a little tricky to find the correct process/point of contact, but there is a fantastic intranet in place for support and everyone is super friendly."
3394,Expedia Group,Disappointing experience,2016-10-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work life balance, there is a solid range of benefits too, such as insurance subsidy, gym etc. Overall the salary is on the average side, as compared to similar firms in Switzerland.","Lack of job opportunities in the Geneva office makes a whole lot of people change teams and move to London, or quit Expedia entirely. On the odd occasion that there is an opportunity for a manager to become a director, or an analyst to become a manager 9/10 times management will hire externally and make empty promises to a given employee that they will be promoted within the next few months. To add to that there is a rampant favouritism, where most of the new hires are brought in by the hiring managers from their previous companies, or are relatives of someone they know (both of the largest teams in Geneva are managed by one married couple, no joke)."

3401,Expedia Group,Sinking ship. Adapt or fail!,2016-10-11,3.0,,"Talented people, good travel benefits.","So much churn. A company trying to work within an agile environment and failing miserably. The managers make all the final decisions and don't trust the employees doing the work who have the experience to make decisions. Morale is low, and sinking. A lot of desperation after some losses and big acquisitions. There are so many ways people can book travel. Expedia needs to adapt to the consumer of today or they are gonna quickly be a relic."

It's fast paced, so your day goes quickly.","Horrible open space environment. It's so distracting, I can't get my work done. There are some groups that are quiet but not many. There's no regard if you are working on a project, with all the noise and chatter. The meeting room space is difficult to obtain and the AV equipment doesn't work 1/2 the time. There are very little travel benefits for being the worlds largest online company. It's definitely a tech driven company. Opinions of seasoned travel people, is grossly overlooked. It all depends on what department you work for. Significant re-alignment in recent months."

3406,Expedia Group,Great company with amazing benefits,2016-10-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Fast growing company who treats its staff really well with lots of benefits on travel and well being,Large company so difficult to follow all that is going on and get the bigger picture at times
3407,Expedia Group,Not worth it,2016-10-09,3.0,,Used to be good a while ago.,"Typically Donald Trump company/mentality. Management has 0 respect for employees and no appreciation no matter what. Exploitment level is high. Get hired for one duty, end up in the end doing all the duties because it's cheap labor. Everything it's seen as replaceable and no solutions are found inside team problems. If something it's not working problem it's solved easily by firing ppl not by investing in them or help them improve because mangers are afraid that they will loose their position and it's always better to blame someone else in order to hide the lack of talent, vision and mess.

Company offers almost no opportunities regarding internal promotions. Ppl are stuck in the same position for years and years.

As in terms of flexibility the policy is: get sick at work and die sick at work. 

In terms of future improvement strategy the company is preparing to take in students because they have even lesser rights and you can do with them whatever you want. Increase revenue to the maximum by hiring an 18 year old kid for almost no salary and the same job as a full time. If he has expectations or complains then fire him and bring another one because there are plenty of students that have a hard life and can be exploited using an illusion.

Overall it's not worth it."

I work with some great people and I look forward to coming to work every day.,"Open office seating is a disaster and causes people to be way less productive with the constant distractions and interruptions of people sitting on top of each other.    People come to work sick and get everyone around them sick.    Company leadership has stated that managers need to be more flexible about working from home/remotely but some group VPs stubbornly refuse to allow it.   Salaries, while good, are behind what other like companies in the area offer - retaining employees in an expensive housing market is going to be harder to scale if they don't re-examine compensation."

However, even your dream job can turn into a nightmare if you find that you have given it your all and your day to day is more stressful than enjoyable… and lack of respect and inciting fear is a daily occurrence.     

Awful management and toxic work environment.  Upper management are not connected with their team and they aren't held accountable for their actions, so they just don't know how to run a department.  They're all trying to tear each other down to get ahead and be the ""teacher's pet"" and it turned into an exhausting and stressful environment.   They're pushing women to be in charge, but the women executives that I worked around were the absolute bad people.  Back stabbing and two-faced, but when we’d get on conference calls, sweet as pie.  Is this a job or HIGH SCHOOL??  All the travel and free food in the world wouldn't be enough to make me ever go back there again!   

My first few months of working there, they sent me on four trips to different Expedia offices, which had zero to do with my actual job and duties.  For example, I went on a sales training for an entire week.  I met some great people, but it was a waste of a week.  When I got back, I was expected to do my own job (which I was still learning) and when I didn't do my job perfectly because of the trips that they sent me on, I was given a verbal warning!  What a joke.  I went to happy hours and dinners with my coworkers only to find out that they just did what the manager said because they were scared to cross that person in fear of getting written up or losing their job.   That’s NOT ok!   My boss was either always traveling or always working from home, so I had to basically train myself on the ins and outs of the company and what my boss required… yes, like a mind reader.  Hey, don't get me wrong, I loved traveling to cities that I had never been, but the position was a joke.  The title was one thing, but the job was a hodgepodge of duties they threw together (maybe because no one else wanted to do it).  I was working for one department, but I was doing everything from Accounting to marketing!  So bizarre!    I left there a few years ago and I have never been happier.   Now I know what a job is supposed to be like… and that a bigger [company] doesn’t always mean better!"

3484,Expedia Group,"Caustic, overly political - reputation in Seattle is deserved",2016-08-11,1.0,Director,A lot of opportunities as the processes are often manual and immature for a company of Expedia's size.  The C-level staff are visionary and thought leaders. There is a lot of passion among the staff and innovation is happening.  I entered the company with a lot of hope and optimism.  You present an environment with amazing opportunity.,"As others have shared there is often an undertow of unhealthy political focus in the company - to the point of being caustic.  There is a focus on doing the right things but due to the politics and unrealistic expectations placed upon the line leadership and staff the improvements are mutated and often incomplete.  

Enterprise class processes and frameworks are often bypassed or ignored in the interest of immediacy.  However the consequences of the technical debt that manifests much later are not acknowledged or accounted for.  The get it done attitude is amazing however a lot of rework and just plain terrible design result in an often fractured foundation with which the house is built upon.  This type of behavior is not anything new in the world of software development and if often a conscious decision however the leadership has to have enough wisdom to fully embrace the fact that rework and longer term active support of those decisions will need to eventually be corrected.  

The office space is incredibly cramped.  While the new office in Seattle has some promise the trade off will be the terrible commute."

3486,Expedia Group,I've worked for better and I've worked for worse,2016-08-11,3.0,,"* Above average pay
* great offices with free drinks etc
* lots of training
* good perks
* great tech supplies
* a (mostly) non patronizing environment. Management screaming at employees is not the norm here
* the experience can change vastly dependent on what manager you find yourself under though 
* oppurtunities to move to other offices","* Hard work and not allot of work/life balance - endless emails and very long hours needed to get your job done. I've Never worked so hard in my life. 
* Diluted focus - There are hard targets which are already challenging but they throw so many things other interim targets into the works (no doubt for someone above to justify their position) such as extra reports, meetings and projects. you are often running around like a headless chicken trying to do everything that you have no time to do your actual job and achieve nothing. They need to give the workers very simple objectives and then leave them be to do the actual work. thats how the needle moves 
* lots of lots of Politics - as mentioned in other reviews there are too many people trying to impress vs doing their actual job and they get all the recognition/promotions whilst the hard workers pick up their slack and go unrecognized. 
* fair bit of favoritism - with the same people getting all the recognition all the time. This can become very demotivating after a while. It's less about how hard you work and more about how much people may like you 
* lots of bad middle managers - People are promoted who might be good performers but are terrible people managers. I've seen some atrocious ones who are toxic micro managers or do no work at all (spend all their time on 'famils'/holidays or doing personal stuff all day at work) and take credit for their staff's work. They create the highest turn over. After the lengthy Interview and training cycle it's so sad to see so many great staff go because of these bad managers. 
* far too many meetings, too much talk with little action and too many upper managers trying to justify their existence but creating useless extra work/projects for the workers below. Let's stop talking about it and actually implement it. This does seem to be getting better though 
* communication frustrations that I'm sure come with any large company - so many departments/Alias's and no one wants to be accountable."

Really good opportunity for interns -- some with no previous experience come in and land a good job with a well known company.  Additionally, if you have a good manager, there are opportunities to grow and chose different roles.  Lots of drinks, beer in the office (kegs even).  Lots of food from events.   Fast paced and overall good people that are a pleasure to work with.  Decent pay.  They are growing fast, have multiple offices and a choice of Macbook or PC.   The new office in Seattle will be a stunning campus.","Some departments are more toxic then others.  There is existence of cronyism, politics and gossip.  it is the first place I clearly witnessed pushing people out (making it miserable experience for individuals they wanted to leave).  Remarkably, some less productive employees stay on board for years and float through the days.  They do promote within, as per other review some of the managers do not have previous manager experience or were promoted when at Expedia to manager and sometimes director, having held much lower positions at previous companies.  This of course can go either way - some seem well warranted others can be more perplexing.   The new office in Seattle will result in a horrendous commute and won't help rent supply/demand = cost."

To become  or be promoted into a position  managing people there is seemingly no requirement for management skills or experience.  If you have a good manager the experience can be different.
Big company can mean ridgity.  Expedia prides itself on moving fast, but my experience was that a lot of important stuff never got down due to ever growing pipelines and changing priorities
There's a lot of work being done by people trying to prove their worth and get noticed rather than what's actually going to drive the business.

During the 2+ years there, I have seen like 8 upper management (director or above) folks left just within our department.  Whenever superb talents are leaving for other companies, that tells a lot about the culture of this organization.  I've talked to bunch of directors, ones left and new ones, and you can tell there's no sense of cohesion and consistent vision within the company.  Every director brings their own individual goals without listening to the folks who have worked here for more than 5 years or more to preserve the company culture and benefits of the past.  As a result, employees morals are super low and people and ideas are in and out of the door like flying squad.

They tend to look for quantities instead of qualities and low employee autonomy which somehow drag to a mentally/physically tired status.   Low flexibility on working hours  whereas few of my teammates work till mid-night at home but still claimed to be late when arrive office at 9:30am.  Particular teams follow their manager's working hours (12 hrs/day) because their managers encourage the long hour style as equal to hard working.     Overall is quite a micro-management style on every aspect , like a 'Tiger-mom' style.    We do not mind the work-loads, but need to be result oriented and serve the purpose efficiently."

The size of the company, the diversity of its business units and the speed of execution creates an opportunity to work on numerous projects and receive immediate feedback.  Most people are collaborative and are passionate about building products that improve the travel experience for customers.","Every company has organizations that run counter to the cultural norm.  Local Expert is one of those groups inside Expedia.  The desire to win has created a culture where the ends justify the means.  Employees are publically shamed and belittled in an effort to create urgency.  Work is micromanaged and second guessed while communication is poor and decisions are made with little transparency.  Ideas that do not fit with leadership’s preconceived assumptions are devalued.  Performance goals are often based on opinion rather than data and are subject to change making it difficult to measure your accomplishments.  The result of this environment is widespread mistrust, a lack of loyalty to the organization and an unwillingness to try new things or take risks to avoid negative consequences.  Career development is rarely discussed and employees are given little support when seeking new opportunities.  If you really want to work at Expedia (because overall it’s a great company) and Local Expert is your foot in the door then have a thick skin, understand the environment you are joining and take every opportunity to network with colleagues in other groups which are more aligned to the overall corporate culture."

3635,Expedia Group,A staggering truth,2016-03-12,4.0,Software Engineer,"This review is really about something that every job applicant at Expedia should know. Apart from that, yes, everything else about Expedia is top notch, including pay, benefits etc.","As much as I would like to say that Expedia Montreal is one of the best places to work at, it gives me much displeasure to say that you should think twice before joining. Here's why:

- One of the key things to retain top talent in any company is to promote deserving people and keep them motivated by praising them. Expedia truly fails to do that. I have been working here more than a few years and every one of those years I have seen a majority of the wrong people being promoted. As sad as that might be, the upper management is truly agnostic to this fact. Expedia (at least the Montreal office), promotes people who clearly don't make the mark. This is not to say that those people aren't talented, rather getting promoted here only depends upon which product you are working on/how much of visibility you have even if you don't deliver any results. Since it's a small (and a remote) office, you know what everyone is working on and how talented they are etc. and when you hear about someone being promoted, you wonder if this is a joke. 
It's a shame that a company with such an awesome culture and great benefits disappoints in this area."

Lots of locations to work at.","Poor managerial skills. Leadership is overworked, so they're usually too busy to lead or manage so they defer everything to ""leads"".  Leads are NEVER available because they're at the busiest of desks and prioritize their positions as concierge over their positions as leads (I would too).  
Scheduling is awful! You can't supplement your income with a secondary job because management requires that you're available ""anytime anywhere"" plus having 1-3 on-call shifts any given day of the week.  Which means, you can't even plan laundry, gym, etc. 

Training is 6 weeks!  So, you earn $12.50/hour before you earn commission.  That drops you far below the poverty level!  You're expected to drive all across the island just to shadow other employees.  

There is no sales training. 

Minimal technical training. 

There is no Operating Procedures manual so you don't ever have a reliable source of information.

There are no team incentives.  It is nice to feel like an independent contractor at times, but I think all of us would do better with some element of team thinking introduced to our network.

3802,Expedia Group,"Work harder, longer, faster",2015-10-29,4.0,Senior Project Manager,You will rub shoulders with some of the best professionals in OTA from around the world. They have great momentum on diversity and are continuing to make improvements at the higher ranks too. Solid senior management. The compensation is good. Without question Expedia is a great company.,"Lot's of first time managers and program managers. A culture of allowing these new managers to run amok. These new managers run the spectrum from retaliators to those who duck and cover using their team as human shields. Directors are disrespected and undermined by these middle managers and Dara and his ""A"" team seem to be oblivious to it. The senior management for Networking, datacenter and the PMO has cycled out about every three years.

The Priceline group has eaten Expedia's lunch everywhere except in the U.S. and seems like Expedia's international teams are treated like redheaded stepchildren. Their projects and initiatives constantly get bumped and deprioritized in favor of state side stuff. I would have thought now is the time to challenge priceline and booking for international dominance.

The engineers are ridden mercilessly by command and control program managers. Shouting matches and finger pointing are common. Program Managers have no issue pushing these guys under a bus even though they regularly pull 60 hour weeks to meet a deadline the PM pulled out of their... hat. The PMO  encouraged PM's to contradict/challenge the SME's on the technical details of the solution as if they know better than the engineers.

The PMO is a mess. Good senior management but completely ineffective program managers and managers of PM's who believe the only way to run a project is via command and control. Not the most effective launch of a PMO."
3803,Expedia Group,"Industry Leader (+), too many politics (-), needs to diversify revenue streams",2015-10-26,3.0,Anonymous Employee,There's nothing better than working for an industry leader filled with smart travel people.  I worked in sales/account management (Market Management) on the hotels side.,"As I grew with the company, I found too many politics at management level. I felt the review/promotion process worked in a vacuum and saw many very talented/passionate people leave.  This puts a burden on the rest of the team both financially and with morale.  The manager review process needs a complete overhaul.  LPS rewards people who work to live.  Work life balance is tough to achieve and seemingly a requirement to rise in the ranks. 

Additionally, internal hotel business strategies lean too much towards customers and shareholders.  MMs are put in a tough spot with hotels.  Need to invest more in smoothing out internal operations (onboarding & hotel customer support) and developing tools and initiatives that will improve hotel relations (less focused on discounting).  It feels too much like hotels are forced to work with Expedia.  They generally don't enjoy it."

3814,Expedia Group,Very disappointed,2015-10-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"1) Company culture: most people are very fun to work with. There is good energy in the office, making going to work enjoyable.

2) Benefits: travel, PTO, healthcare, and 401K are better than average.","The general practices of middle/lower management on the operations side are very archaic and inefficient. To reiterate some of what has already been said, they are power hungry. Their focus is on getting and keeping their titles, but not actually doing the managerial work or developing a strong team. Common practice is to hire under-qualified employees and then keep them on even if they are underperforming, causing more work for the stronger team members, and bringing down morale. Occasionally, a talented person will slip in through the cracks, but then s/he will be heavily depended on to keep things moving and even fix the mistakes caused by the ""manager"". Management looks for seat fillers who do what they're told and nothing more, and satisfy their ego and superiority complex. Expectations are so low it has actually made me sick to my stomach.

Don't even think about a promotion or a transfer based on meritocracy. It's about sucking up to the right person and playing to their ego. Very incompetent people get promoted or moved just because they know someone and they take credit for other people's work.

They're very big on rhetoric and inaction. You'll be told from the interview stage that there are career development opportunities and you'll have regular meetings to discuss career performance. That won't happen; not even if you are proactive about it. Instead, you'll spend 20 minutes talking about upcoming travel, or an hour listening to the manager repeat himself for the second or third time because the poor performers didn't listen or take notes the first time. All time that could have been better spent having a brief meeting about performance and development.

They're cheap when it comes to compensation."

- Company culture in general is good. 
- Compensation is good","This is specific to software development positions in the company.

Tech doesn't seem to be in the company's DNA. Many outdated technologies are used. Experimenting with new technologies comes with a lot of push back. Main focus is on delivering things, it doesn't matter if the technology used is old or inefficient. As long the solution works, it is acceptable.

Any activity that is engineering related but may not directly impact business, like code refactoring, code reviews, etc. aren't encouraged and given low priority.  

In the company, the culture is business-driving-tech, not tech-driving-business. At times business requirements are finalized without considering tech at all. There's a big gap between business and tech people. Also, non-technical managers managing engineering teams adds to the problem.

As a company Expedia may be doing very well. But I wouldn't recommend it to people who want to grow as software developers. Innovation in software development activities is very slow. Chances are high that a developer may get stuck in some mundane tasks and not get involved in any innovative thinking."

Some teams are doing cutting edge work.,"If you are a techie in high demand at other companies, think twice and consider carefully if you are thinking of joining Expedia. The company is heavily product driven, to the point where everything (including quality) can take a back seat to delivering business features. There is immense pressure to deliver, and that has had predictable results on the state of the code base over the years. On teams running services, the constant on-call can take a toll. It is an environment with very little luxury of any slack or time to spare to experiment, refactor, etc. On top of that, inefficient processes that make it hard to do your job also have to be dealt with. Every couple of months, engineering has to come to the product leaders and give an accounting of how resources are deployed and re-negotiate the development work. This develops a political environment with the resulting predictable behavior from various parties. Overall, the environment is not for everyone, although some can certainly thrive in it."

Partner management done well.,"Top leaders-middle layer-employees structure is more like 20-60-20. The company is a money making machine for top management And the HUGE crowd of middle management. They are like 80% of the company. A typical place where only non management staffs do the real work to build the products. Many managers are slackers. 

Top leaders are inspirational speakers. They make you trust, admire them so much, but when it comes to Feedback, Deliver, management is the only one who is giving Feedback, and employees are the only ones who do delivering. 

The company is also a former Washington Mutual 'mafia' occupied place. WaMus are very exclusive, causing an awkward situation where you are not welcome to be part of it, neither you can have a different voice. Awkward. 

Juniors, consider yourself warned, unless you want to become a useless person who is only good at politics, do not join. Your managers speak about you as such : do not tell these kids that they can get more salary somewhere else or they will all leave.

Biggest pros: 

Majority of Executive Leadership truly cares about their employees and encourages growth both professionally and personally. 

Compensation is very competitive taking into account work / life balance. Sure, you could probably make more money elsewhere but the other non-tangibles far outweigh that minor detail. If I wanted to work 80 hours a week and burn out in a year, there are other places in the greater Puget Sound to do that. 

Vacation, Sick Time and Travel Benefits: As I've been around a long while, I have 5 weeks of paid vacation + holidays + sick time. It's not micro-managed like other companies. You just need to make sure your boss and team know dates you'll be out. Bottom line is, routinely get your work done and no one is going to bother you if you want/need to take a mental break. Also, we have ""Leisure Travel Reimbursement"" which means depending on how long you work here, Expedia will reimburse you for a portion of your Leisure Travel. Just book on an Expedia Inc. owned site, take your trip and when you get back, submit a receipt / copy of your itinerary and BAM... extra $$ in your account soon! Also, coupons! 10-20% off of various travel products, a website where you pay for your hotel what Expedia pays for your hotel etc!

Health Care etc. Fantastic benefits plans to choose from and currently, we have a contract with Qliance with a health care office downstairs in the Bellevue HQ Building which makes routine Doctors appointments super convenient. Oh.. did I mention if you do go there, that co-pays are covered? So there's that!

We have all the basics as well: 401K, Employee Stock Purchase Plan and a host of various corporate discounts from Software to Hardware to Travel related discounts through a multitude of partners. 

In 2018... a new corporate campus in Seattle and from what I've seen... WOW is it going to be amazing!",For those living in the south end (South King and Pierce County) it's a commute... a long commute - but you do have options for carpool and mass transit if the position you are in afford you the option of a set schedule every day.

I was hyped as an expert and thrust into a position that was not really understood to my leadership. Then, after a nice bonus and a raise, let go 4 days shy of my 6 month probationary period. My leader barely lead, he didn't grow my experience, he left me to my own education and learning and the other teams that I tried reaching out to didn't have time or want to make it for me. While they seemed to not be doing anything at all, I was thrust into a position of negativity and doubt.

4014,Expedia Group,Executive's actions speak louder than words,2015-04-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Travel is fun and exciting,"Executives at Expedia have launched a campaign to ""hire more female leaders"", but they continue to fail to see that female leaders already exist in the company. Over the last 5 months the emails touting promotions of over 25 males only listed 1 female.  I personally know at least a dozen women who have outperformed several of the promoted men and go unrecognized. Look at the number of female C level, VP's and Sr. Directors in the IT organization - it is a fact that Expedia discriminates. 
From what I've seen in the years I have been there, men get promoted based on the buddy system and not necessarily performance.  Women are looked over time and time again. As a female, if you'd like to work here, just realize you can only rise to a certain level as you will be working for a company who will never see you as a leader no matter what you accomplish nor recognize your worth.  I worked for many years at Boeing where I though chauvinism couldn't get any worse. While there as a software engineer, I was asked to make copies for the male dominated group and even go get donuts and coffee for meetings. Well, Expedia beats Boeing times 100 easily.  At Expedia, we've had 5 offsite meeting in the group I am in over the past 2 years.  Each time one of the 4 women (out of 20 men) are asked to bring the paper, charts, pens, sticky notes and make the room reservations.  We are all equals or even more senior to some of the men that attend. None of the men have ever been asked to help organize an offsite."

Many of my co-workers were some of the nicest people I've ever met.","The company's CEO is foreign and it seems that some of his expectations for employees borders on a sweat shop mentality. There was a nice bonus system when I started but by the time I left, the structure had been changed in such a way that making a monthly bonus was all but impossible.  Also, while the company started people out a little higher than normal for the area, the yearly raises were quite modest.  Call volume seemed to increase to the point where an employee didn't have as much as three seconds between constant phone calls.  The company rolled two separate deparmental job functions into one, attempting to get twice as much work out of each employee while providing no reward.  There was such an emphasis on metrics, that good management was impossible.

People who were promoted were not usually the brightest, the most deserving or the ones who had been there the longest. They were more likely the ones who went out drinking with in-crowd.

As a travel company, this company was busiest on holidays so anyone who values holidays with family will be disappointed here."

4037,Expedia Group,Great attitudes and Environment,2015-03-11,4.0,Sales Agent,"Expedia focuses the majority of their energy on fostering a positive work environment. They know they are a call center and that call centers can get very boring and repetitive, so they work hard at keeping everyone in good spirits and they try their best to make it a fun work day. The supervisors are the true Rock Stars. Expedia brings in vendors from all across North America (Primarily Mexico and Orlando) to teach the employees about their specific resorts and these vendors will typically give away free trips, which is nice. They treat their entry level employees with respect and they understand that without the soldiers on the phones the company wouldn't be able to operate. They do offer the best benefit package than I have seen anywhere else. Very affordable health insurance across the board as well as things like fitness reimbursement, travel reimbursement, discounts at local and national businesses, and others. The fringe benefits of working in the travel industry are second to none. Discounted hotel rates for family and friends, and great discounts for yourself.","Communication channels from upper management to middle management and then middle to the employees is essentially non existent. While I was working there they underwent massive changes in their pay structure (making it harder to hit commission and then getting paid less when you do hit) and to their call process. These are massive changes and completely changes the atmosphere of the work place. The floor didn't receive these changes very well because they after a 3-4 week training on the old process, they tried to run you through a 4-5 hour crash course on the new process and expected you to completely change the way you talk to the customers. Due to these changes many of their top performing tenured agents left for other jobs. They do say they only promote within which might be true at other locations, but it was not evident at the Springfield location."

People regularly disappeared after 5pm and you would just never see them again.  Because everyone was afraid- in an effort to protect themselves- there was constant tattling, a sense of attendance taking in meetings, people reporting your linkedin actions if they suggested you might be looking for another job.  We also held not so secret reviews 2x a year where all managers participated in a meeting where we went around and said ways in which each employee had failed to perform in a given year.  And the communication style across the entire department was 'whispered secrets'- things were rarely announced-- they were just 'trickled down' which meant communicating one:one- creating the feeling that you were sharing a secret vs. communicating relevant information so people could better do their jobs.  Negative, heartless, tight-fisted, ineffective, secretive with the lower ranks so afraid that on their best day- 'unfriendly' would be the kindest word to describe the team."

For someone who likes change and becomes interested in a new challenge after a period of time, it's great to be able to migrate within an organization rather than starting over elsewhere.  Talent and experience is rewarded with opportunity.  Competitive salary and benefits and leadership commitment to being better year over year.","Due to the multiple brands represented, sometimes there are subcultures within the organization.  That can be invigorating and enjoyable, but also a challenge because it can sometimes make success more of a challenge.  You need more feedback from more stakeholders and sometimes driving alignment across different brands within the group can be time-consuming."
4090,Expedia Group,Enjoyable time working with a balanced company,2015-01-23,5.0,Software Engineer In Test,"Working with a leader in travel, a huge industry, it's enjoyable to see your work change the travel space, and the impact quickly.
The compensation is good (salary+benefits) and for the US, you start with more vacation than most companies and go up from there (15+ days)
There is also a healthy work-life balance.  Most days you can leave work at the door, and the door has sunlight still on it.","Expedia is not a small company and sometimes you can feel it.  There is also an existing product, so it's hard to do something really different, but if you are creative you can make it work.  Expedia is evolving, but I'm sure someone from a startup would find it naturally slow."

They hire smart, forward thinking individuals who want the same balance in their work and life. This company is growing and you would blossom with it.","This company is still young and growing quickly so the organization lacks slightly. I would say because of this dramatic growth, the Peter Principal applies here which means that people are promoted not necessarily because they deserve it, but because they were the most senior to do the job."
4095,Expedia Group,Great benefits and sense of achievement,2015-01-21,4.0,Concierge,"The management team take great care of us to ensure we have the necessary experience with our products to sell them to guests.  My supervisor is very flexible to work with my requests for switching days, as long as I provide a few weeks notice, which suits me fine.  I get a great sense of job satisfaction when I make a guest's day better.","There can be confusing communication, where a manager seems to contradict themselves within a few days of laying out what's expected.  Often my team are scheduled an 11pm end-of-day followed by a 6:45am start the following day, which can leave you feeling fatigued and unable to perform your best."

Clear goals are established with a focus on making sure employees are always feeling good. There is a clear growth line for moving up within the organization. Every day is a pleasure to be here.,It is difficult to identify any drawbacks to the current operations. The constant change and turnover can be exhausting as people move up in the ranks.

The focus on overall impact instead of rewarding individual heroics leads to very strong collaboration and interpersonal relationships.,"Expedia is quite a complex company that has been formed out of many acquisitions over the last 10 years, and there are still a lot of seams and inconsistencies that are not obvious when first joining.   However, this also makes it feel much more of a large start-up experience, with a focus on making quick progress with limited resources, as opposed to every project having to be approved by multiple levels and being 100% perfect on launch."

You can out perform in every metric you can control and still make less than other worker performing at a lower level and earn a worse shift than others doing less.

Seniority means nothing within the company at any point making it hard to maintain long term employees

Shifts are few and far between with very little opportunity to change to better one after long terms of service.

They manipulate numbers to avoid paying rightfully earned commissions 

Management only acknowledges basic math when it supports a point they try to convey."

-Nice, young and international evironment;","-Managers don't really care about your personal skills, you are just one among hundreds puppets, and we are not allowed to improve the performance of the company due ridicolous restrictions, and this is not really ""customer service"" friendly; sometimes we give a very poor service.
-Keep hiring people from outside, make current employees in a bad mood, and it affects the performance. 
Look inside your company, there are a lot of good people, which qualities are completely ignored by managers.
Without a solid possibility of professional growth, everybody will leave within one year, if not less.
-Promotion of equality is of the point of the company and of the Labor Code. Well, keep rejecting it without reasons meanwhile other people are allowed to go on holidays for two weeks during the high season, it's not really equality. 
Another point that affects employees mood and perfomance as well.
- Traning was fine when managed by people that have worked as agents, they know how it is the job on the platform, and can give practical ad real examples. 
-Localization is inefficient. Europe is far from US culture.
- They pretend flexibility from the employee but their rules are too stricht, it means: if you arrive 1 minute later, it's a big issue. You if get a call after 6, then you may work 20 minutes after 6, without getting paid, and nobody will notice it.
-Some people are constantly in queue work, meanwhile others work for them as well.
If there is a lunch schedule EVERYBODY should respect it, othewise there is no reason to call it team.

I've never worked for a place where you openly talk about applying for a different position with your team and management. Everyone supports growth and supports each other in their career advancements.","It's a global company with offices all over the world, so communication is definitely lacking. The three distinct operations departments (financial, supplier, and customer) all have completely different leadership and do not communicate efficiently, yet they all effect each other in big ways. The technology we use is definitely lacking. The systems we use were not built for the travel industry, and we keep patching them to make them work. I keep hearing about big company growth but the emphasis on not increasing head count, but there is no way our current systems will support that effort.

They have a great idea in theory, but is executed poorly.  Strategy and direction is always vague from upper management or unrealistic.  They push for numbers and goals, micro manage on every little detail, but don't understand what the actual process entails, and that negotiations are a delicate endeavor that take time and trust to develop."

4191,Expedia Group,Lucky to be part of the team!!!!,2015-01-14,5.0,Expedia Local Expert,"I can say this is one of the best employers to work for. I was hired, and 2 years later moved out of the area for a relationship, but when it didn't work out I was able to get my dream job back. Expedia has been one of the factors that contributes to my quality of life everyday. I would recommend it to anybody....actually I do. I am very lucky to work for this company.",There are no cons that I can speak of. I would fire their benefits management company Aon Hewitt for good.

I enjoy that we have TV's dispersed around the office, there are very few limitations on computer use save from using social media during business hours.  I like that we can tailor our sales pitches to accommodate our unique personalities. The benefits are fantastic.  We are given adequate work space and our computers are not outdated.  Tools are fairly easy to navigate once you get that hang of them.  I do like how management adjusts EO to be available during slow times and tries to adjust sales/conversions to match needs so that the employees may have the best chance at succeeding and making money because that is why we are all here.","I wish the software was updated to be more user friendly.  I feel that commission could be higher.  I do not care for the hours or the shift bidding formula in place. I had really terrific hours and ended up with hours that don't allow me to participate in the activities or even see my family for that matter, which is quite disappointing and has really taken a toll on my family life. The office temperature is extremely cold.  The training could be more efficient.  I do not care for the fact that there are not enough desks for each employee to have their own space.  I feel the problem should have been addressed and taken care of prior to shift bidding and enough spaces provided."

I am able to work from home as needed and my start time is flexible from 7 to 10am. The CEO is easily accessible and the after hour events here are ridiculously a blast.

The office is pretty empty by 6 pm.  Good benefits.,"I expected the politicking to be better than other employers where you're rewarded for how well you can promote yourself rather than actual work accomplished.  I was assured that the formal review process isn't a big deal and people just all work together against common goals choosing the best technology.  Unfortunately I was in for some big surprises.
At Expedia project related metrics are ignored to promote oneself or put down other honest hard workers.  Many levels of management buy into this game and HR is often involved in telling employees what they have done wrong.  There is no feedback loop.  I've seen many cases where no notice or interaction was given that complaints were being made.  One day you're fine the next day you're on a chopping list.  And once you find out it's too late. 
Entire teams have stolen credit for work they didn't do and have also shifted the blame for their own mistakes.  Senior management is acquiescent of these practices.
Bellevue headquarters suffers from over crowding.  The bull pens went from bad to worse when 20-30 people wasn't dense enough more walls were knocked down to accommodate up to 80.  Even directors lost their offices.  This indicates the value Expedia places on employees."

Bellevue office is the least innovative office compared to all other locations, which is upsetting, since it is our HQ. 
Slowly moving away from cubicles to bench seating, which makes the Bellevue location even more cramped.
The culture reminds me of a corporate environment trying to be a dot com.  We are a .Com, let's let our hair down a bit!"

You never see anyone in a suit, there are free snacks / refreshments, great work life balance, awesome after-hours events.

Specifically for Engineers: rather than mandating the use of existing technology and processes, teams are instead encouraged to experiment with the new, assimilate what is found to work well, and share their newfound knowledge with others.

Also, I've been glad to find more gender-diverse engineering teams than I've seen at other companies.","If you're looking for your manager to tell you what to do every day and give you a big raise for doing only that, then this probably isn't the place for you.

As with any office, there are examples of political decision-making, etc. but I've found these to be the exception rather than the norm."

Though each team/dept. encourages to move up in career ladder, the tricky system does not allow to be equally compensated. I mean to say that if they hire a external candidate the compensation is much better than moving within the system. HR & compensation policy must be reviewed to help employee move up."

Very flexible hours which is nice if you need to go to an appointment or just need to get out of the office.,"Promotions are confusing, it is seems as though they are based more on how well the person ""fits"" within the group rather than their contributions or time working here. Sometimes the management seems jointed. Depending on the level of management you talk with about a project, you might get a different answer/instructions on how to go about completing the task. Lots of relaying of information from the source, sometimes feels like the telephone game. Also, you never know if you are doing a good job, management only seems to check up on you when you are doing something wrong. There is no positive feed back."
4213,Expedia Group,All talk and no action,2015-01-13,1.0,Manager,"Benefits are very good with generous time off and travel discounts.
Some teams have a lot of flexibility in hours and working from home options.","There's very little room for upward mobility.  Most people in the Director positions would never be able to hold similar positions at other companies.  Most Directors have NO knowledge of the job or industry and are little more than babysitters for their Teams who do all the work.   There's no consistency across departments or teams... one you'll find allows flexible hours and work from home, while others are very rigid.

The company is in constant turmoil over whether we're a Travel company or a Technology company, and thus we don't do either very well.  Resources are spread very thin and nothing gets fixed quickly.   Everyone always has an excuse as to why they can't get to your project.

Annual pay increases are almost an insult.  It's easier to quit and be rehired to gain more money than to stay onboard and expect fair pay for fair work."

There are many other great benefits to working at Expedia but these are just the ones that I use and know about. There is room for advancement if you outshine your peers and work hard.","I have worked here almost 2 years and I really dont have anything negative to say. The only thing close to being negative about this company is it can be hard to get a foot in the door, I was a contractor for 18 months before being hired full time.

4226,Expedia Group,Great high-performing and engaging culture. Ever-changing  in a fast-paced innovative and culturally rich environment!,2014-12-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I work with the smartest people I've ever come across in 18 years, and I used to be surrounded by PhDs in a Healthcare company! But the incredibly high brain function and business acumen are balanced with great values and integrity, and most importantly a sense of humour and FUN! It's the first company in 15 years I finally feel that I contribute, be a leader, but still be respected and appreciated for who I am - and I've worked in quite a few Fortune 100 companies. In a nutshell Expedia has done more than tick the following boxes that were key Values & Principles for me:
-Strong business growth strategy & outlook
-""Gets"" that innovation, creativity, risk-taking & investment are at the heart of competitive edge, acts on it at pace and doesn't dilly-dally on decision-making. JFDI! 
-Deals with poor performers and recognizes the strong ones. A high-performing culture that changes at-pace isn't for everyone. 
-Balances strong business oriented decisions with the human element, not at the cost of it. Decision-making is as inclusive as it can be in a high-pace environment.
-People are super smart, fun to work with, always happy to help each other out and share best practices.
-Incredible diversity: race, nationality, background, orientation, religion, experience, all bring a richness of perspective to the decision-making","- There's politics like everywhere else, and if you don't take the time to figure out your stakeholder and how to manage them, you pretty doomed anywhere you go, really... Here you do need high emotional intelligence to figure it out quickly, because things move at lightning pace!!
- I think people (incorrectly) associate a high-performing driven culture with being ""male-dominated"". Yes it's a driven & high-performing culture, but there's flexibility here, and as woman I do feel that my colleagues genuinely judge me on my deliverables & contribution, not ""face-time"" or where I do my work. I chose the global responsibility & exposure and I get that this choice comes with the weird hours. It's definitely about working harder, not smarter. I've admittedly done crazy hours since I joined but I love the work and the people so much it's hard to clock-watch!
-While there's a strong desire to continuously improve, some of the learnings get lost with it because it does happen such pace... But this is so minor it's almost not worth mentioning...
-And then there's the Flexible benefits and incredible travel discounts!"

4235,Expedia Group,One of the Worst Options in Prague,2014-12-08,1.0,Lodging Support Services Agent,Salary + benefits package. They are much higher than market range for this position.,"- total mess on administrative level. Some departments have been working without clear supervision in long-term periods;
- trainings were provided by US trainers, who has never worked at the positions they preparing for; they are not familiar with company internal processes and policies; 
- moreover, trainers being sent from US, they have no idea about European cultures and Europe in general
- the same story is with performance evaluation which is held from US and not aligned to European specifics
- no possibility to get vacation days (especially Fridays and Mondays are restricted by internal policy)
- no flexibility on time schedule (if you get late for even a few seconds you will get a notice, if you will do this systematically you will get fired). The same with leaving, even on Fridays evening when people usually travel. Think twice before putting yourself in a jail
- low corporate culture / etiquette (skipping the details, relations within Prague department are not hold on the business level, but rather in unappropriated teenage style)
- no personal appreciation for entry-level positions from any higher-level employees; no coaching in a friendly and acceptable manner. Even employment contracts weren't signed in an appropriate way, but were left at the reception to be picked up and signed
- not many possibilities for career growth. Hiring for entry level candidates with a school education they don't allow them to grow to higher positions, requiring university degree. No assistance with relocation to branches in other companies (and in Prague they have positions almost only in one department
- and if you leave you will need to fight with company to get a reference letter, cause their policy is to not provide it"

Travel company so cool benefits related to that.","It's hard to pinpoint all the issues with this organization.  I don't know where this company is headed.  It's the market leader in its space so I think that lends itself to solid financial numbers but internally, this company does not have clear direction and leadership.  Constant changes with little transparency which leads to a lack of trust and confidence in leadership and strategy.  Not to say there aren't smart people but its a large company that seems to not be able to get out of its own way and causes its own internal issues.  I'm assuming mergers and acquisitions don't help, especially if the work hasn't been put in to make it all gel.  

The culture?  There is no culture.  It claims its an internet/technology company but there is no sense of culture and direction.  Remember, ""culture eats strategy for lunch"", and if that's the case, then the long term outlook for this company ain't so good."

This is a great place for fostering a test and learn environment which always leads to more learnings, whether they fail or not. The work life balance is awesome, you are not forced/expected to work on the weekends but always have the option. There are a lot of affinity/diversity groups to get involved with and the charitable programs are fantastic. Expedia employees really care about their surrounding areas and it shows with all the events they have. Most teams work well together and seem to all follow the same vision which is great for improving collaboration throughout the company and across the globe. There are always a lot of projects to get involved in which in turn help build skill set. I can definitely see myself being here for a few years to come and would recommend this company to a friend.",Sometimes it seems we move too fast and and could work on being more transparent.

Look forward to coming to work and engaging with teammates - especially sharing recent adventures. Free drinks - occasional snacks. Work-life balance is awesome! Seen several people get promoted across the org as well. All Hands / Town Halls seem genuine and are energetic. Philanthropy (i.e Day of Caring, various affiliated orgs, etc.) and affinity group opportunities are abundant.","Only been here a few months, but noticed some teams play favorites and can be difficult to work with. Several organizational changes in the few months I've been here - don't think it has to do with budget concerns, but it can seem like a revolving door. Hit and miss with managers who know how to help their reports advance. No outlined growth path could see people with potential, but not self advocating get left behind. Onboarding could be improved."

4262,Expedia Group,TPM,2014-11-12,5.0,Technical Product Manager,"0. Great benefits.
1. Great people. Everybody I've had to work with is very smart. Committed. Wants to move forward.
2. Great headquarters.
3. Salaries within industry. And WA state does not have income task. A matching salary in any other state should be a lot higher if I want to receive the same paycheck.
4. You choose your own growth path: individual contributor, manager, principal, etc. Independently of the title, you can shape your own success.
5. Great communication from CEO. He has a blog and we can ask him any question we want. And he answers! Never before had a CEO delivered on his ""open communication"" promise before.
6. Open communication of where the company is going, what's happening at every level.
7. Free soda, sparkling water, milk.
8. Lots of events: halloween contest, Xmas party for all the company, parties within groups in the company.
9. Did I say really smart people? Granted, not every single person. But the majority.
10. Particular groups of interest that you can join and attend depending on what you want to do.
11. Great technology to work with. It's not the latest but only a little tiny bit behind.
12. I can ask for whatever I want to be able to work better: ergonomic desks, monitors, mice, keyboards.
13. You have the choice of a PC or a Mac.
14. Work/Life balance is fantastic! Here I work over the weekend because I want to finish something. Not because I have to. It's not expected that I reply to an email over the weekend.
15. We are strongly encouraged (and I believe it's almost mandatory), to take all the vacation. FANTASTIC! I haven't seen this in another company.
16. Possibility to work in other cities where there are offices.","1. That it's not the 100% of people the ones committed to make it work. 
2. Relationships are very important here. What about delivery and facts? Not really. It's more about negotiation.
3. Workspace is really tight. I have a desk and two tiny drawers. I don't mind the open space but I'd like to have more than two drawers and a desk a little bit wider."
4263,Expedia Group,"Work Hard, Play hard",2014-11-12,5.0,Software Development Engineer I,"The team I work on tries very hard to maintain a healthy work/life balance. The number of hours you work per week are not as important as meeting your commitments. This means that there is not pressure from management to log heavy hours outside of a typical business day. The company overall seems like a place that encourages a fun, social environment with frequent company events. The work is interesting and I was able to jump right in with my own product that I am responsible for. Compensation is competitive and good benefits.","There can be some bureaucratic red tape that slows down progress, but for the most part it seems to be a necessary evil with a company of this size. It does not bog down production too much."

Interesting work, especially if you like travel
Autonomy in your role.
Marketing has fun and interesting people to work with","Mid-level management has more mediocre people than superstars.
Organizational decisions are driven by relationships and people's personal feelings as opposed to org design principles. Can be frustrating to deal with. 
Unobjective performance review process that can make pay rise and bonus decisions seem arbitrary.
Company doesn't focus on customer experience or service, just maximizing transactions from customers. Works well in the short-term but doesn't take a long term view"

4271,Expedia Group,Finally a company that supports the work of software developers,2014-11-07,5.0,Software Development Engineer II,"I've worked for Expedia for four months. My most important criteria when selecting a company during my job search this past year was a company that gets it. I mean a company that understands software engineering best practices and doesn't just pay lip service to them. I'm so sick right now of the general industry where ""management agile"" totally misses the point of the principles of Lean and XP when it comes to building software that works for the customer and whose creation isn't mired in bureaucratic processes which make it miss the point. Thankfully Expedia gets it! They make working on their software a pleasant experience. While the team I'm on isn't perfect, they do understand what's important to the customer and care about working with high face-to-face communication and collaboration. The tools and processes in place are state-of-the-art and the complexity at scale is managed very well. All around I am impressed by the entire operation and glad to work here. The benefits, pay, and work/life balance (which is extremely good) are all just icing on the cake.","There have been very few cons. I would characterize this as the best job I've ever had. There are still improvements that can be made. I feel that estimation is not well-understood or executed as well as it could be right now in my team. I also think that there could be more stringent filtering of user stories into the sprint. Sometimes we get stories that aren't well groomed, do not have well-defined acceptance criteria, or that are missing key sign-offs from collaborating teams. Most notably, the highly cramped space given to employees (essentially you get a four foot by two foot desk and a rolling set of drawers in an open area crammed up next to your co-workers) is a con that needs to be addressed soon before it becomes a bigger issue."

4278,Expedia Group,"Really nice people, messed up management",2014-11-06,4.0,Senior Program Manager,"Everyone I've met here is sincerely nice. They help one another instead of throwing them under buses. I've not heard people complain about one another behind each other's backs either, even people who have been let go. The bar is set realistically on performance. You can choose to bust your bottom for a promo and be rewarded, or you can put in moderate effort and still get by OK. Projects are not thrust upon you, you are allowed to push back and have some autonomy. 
They are dedicated to charity in a very deep way. It's really impressive how much time and energy is devoted to non profit and charity events.","They haven't really decided if they are a tech company or a travel company. Hence, tech people may not be used to the politics of cross-brand initiatives. They are NOT customer centric in the least. Nor are they developer centric. They seem to be lost in the weeds, but have been addressing this lately with the ouster of the previous CTO. They seem to want to be more customer centric, and Dara proclaimed that Expedia is a travel company at the last all hands, so I guess that's the goal."

Travel benefits are good (not excellent though).","Too many things happening at the same time, a lot of streamlining of processes required. A lot of work is done manually and can be automated. Working virtually, with most of the key stakeholders, and team members in another location can make someone's learning curve a bit longer."
4283,Expedia Group,Expedia First Impressions,2014-11-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company size allows for great work-life balance.  Company culture is one of minimal fires and planned business.  Company maturity allows for groundbreaking and impactful development of tools to change how business is done.  Great opportunities for career growth.

Charitable matching, 401k, and ESPP offerings are exceptional.  Travel perks are also a nice add, as is the fitness reimbursement benefit.","There is little structure, which some may find invigorating such as myself.  Biggest gripes are the lower than market average wellness benefit packages which cost more than local competitors (excluding MSFT because they are an anomaly in this space) and coverage is far less.  Lack of broad based equity plan also a drawback."
4284,Expedia Group,Great place to work - full of opportunities,2014-11-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Strong growth in this space means that there are consistently opportunities to learn new things and take on additional responsibilities.

At Expedia, I've been happy with all three. My coworkers are fun, competent, and have a decent work ethic. The projects are technically challenging and relevant to the company. And the engineering department I work in is well-run, fast-moving, and the values are all in the right place.","It's a large company. Large companies with legacy codebases come with a set of challenges that many people will not enjoy. I think these challenges are kept to a minimum at Expedia, but they are still there. This is not a startup."

There is always some kind of staff event or BBQ, very sociable place to work. Offices are very modern and trendy. Xbox's, table football etc.
Some good benefits and discounts on travel.","High turnover, I saw many people come and go in my time and a lot of unjust sackings. Heard a lot of people were let go because their ""boss didn't like them"". This happened quite a lot if the persons face didn't fit. 

Unfortunately because of the nice environment and the laid back atmosphere you had a lot of dead weight in the company, people who were happy to just sit back for the ride. I met quite a lot of people who either did nothing or didn't really know what they were doing, they'd just been there for a long time. Came in late, long lunches, left early and didn't really do anything whilst they were there.

The atmosphere although good to work in, produced a lack of urgency, not something I was used to and found to be quite frustrating when you needed something done.

Also the London office is too reliant on the Bellevue office, they need to break away, take more control and be more autonomous."

Very male-oriented culture  (Male employees progress, women don't. I've seen comments about this in a few reviews here. There are programmes that in theory offer additional support for women, but they feel like 'lip service' only.)
Poor leadership and infighting between directors"
4297,Expedia Group,Poor management,2014-10-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Make your CV or resume look better.,"You just have to be a doll and listen to your owner. These superiors are telling everyone be part of the team, but they manage you as a group - a Hierarchy group. Your advise or suggestion will not be accept, because you are not in that ""level"". I couldn't find the value or direction in my department as the management only telling you to follow the instruction. No questioning and follow the instruction blindly as they only expect you to do what you had been told. I do not see any short term or long term plan in my department. You might have a chance to know the department plan, only you get informed by someone from the other department. These superiors do not trust you and doubt on your working ability times to times and as the same time they are not willing to share anything with you."
4298,Expedia Group,Not the same,2014-10-07,1.0,Senior Developer Analyst,I worked for Expedia for 6 years. They use to be the company portrayed in the video but no longer. They are squeezing everyone from every angel now. They are losing market share and have a ton of competition from other startups doing it better and cheaper.,Management is now profit driven and they ignore the employees there is no joy left in this company. Shrinking the corporate offices... used to be 3 people per row now it's 4-5. They are no longer the advocate for the employees they once claimed to be. I've left recently for a more friendly and less hostel environment. Most of my friends there have left since the re-org and internal culture shift.

Most people here are exceedingly interested in travel itself and most have an obsession with either finding the best deals or travel hacking. The benefits are great as well... Discounts, travel reimbursements and working with bright colleagues across the world make it a great place to meet interesting people across the globe.","Constant re-orgs both in London and in the Bellevue office prevent any really innovative work from being done. This also brings about a lot of political backstabbing and gesturing. I don't think I've ever worked in a place where people gesture for the work but never do anything about it. It's more about territory building than it is about actually getting things done. Insecure and inadequate senior managers abound, brought upward more because of who they know then what they know, and more so being at the right place at the right time than actually being qualified or actually knowing enough to derive strategies to lead their teams. No clear goals and poorly formed incentives drive poor performance and lack of interest to innovate and help the business actually move forward."
4302,Expedia Group,Expedia,2014-09-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits, and the leading company in it's space.  Global presence allowed for global work environment, interactions with other companies and cultures is nice.","Being a part of the technology delivery arms of the company was difficult.  Shifting directions, priorities and a trend towards a lot of good-old boy networking for job growth.  Silos created by management left growth to favorites, usually those dragged in with them from their past orgs."
4303,Expedia Group,Great broad education in the travel industry,2014-09-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Most supervisors believe in their employees ""moving up the ladder"" and provides great support to do so. Promoting from within HAPPENS as long as employees are able to get through the natural challenges of working in a call center i.e. headache-inducing customers.","Turnover rate is higher than it should be due to previous inconsistencies in training which has been improving.

It is expensive to run a massive website like Expedia's, and Expedia leaves a lot of operational money on the table due to an amazing lack of standardization where it matters, a decidedly cheap attitude to technical and device obsolescence, and a glaring lack of attention to staff capacity & group coordination."
4306,Expedia Group,"Great company, great benefits, great team!",2014-09-21,4.0,Account Manager,"Large company with several offices throughout the world and great opportunities to grow.

Gym reimbursement, silly celebrations of calendar days, like national hot dog day. The cruise department get perks from the industry , not air team. Looking to just get back on your feet for 6 months or a year this is the place. Paid training. The company makes so much money, you'll always have a job if you can survive unraveling destroyed travel itineraries using GDS. Sups are helpful and fair.","Prepare yourself for training class. 6 weeks paid, thank goodness. 15 programs to learn. Training class spends more time on non-sense about customer service (which many hired already have years of experience)  rather than the actual difficulty of the Sabre and Amadeus complex PNR issues and how to fix it. I left an airline and air GDS can take years to master. No call center experience.... tough it out bro.  Expectations change each week, it'll make your head spin and slow you down. After a year or more you'll be good. Take advice only from the leads. They are good but overwhelmed. Above all....It's a job, people!

4308,Expedia Group,"Multi-cultural, multi-disciplinary, diverse and exciting - but not much support for encouraging a good work/life balance",2014-09-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Expedia is the most fascinating and diverse place I've worked, my daily work brings me into contact with employees all over the world from whom I have learned (and am still learning every day) so much about the world we live in, about how people buy travel, and learning new skills from many different specialist in many different areas. The culture is friendly and helpful - you feel like you can approach anyone, even senior management, and find out whatever you need to know. Generally, the work ethic and atmosphere serves to encourage and develop you and those around you.","Things change frequently with the org structure - a reflection of the changing and challenging market, but also a 'no let up' approach from management. This, coupled with working with people all around the globe can lead to burn out if you're not careful - taking calls from ridiculously early in the morning to very late at night, just to be able to get that bit of information you're after in order to keep afloat in the job. Upper management may not look out for you on that score - so personal resilience is key in order to look out for yourself yet still manage to drive the results necessary in your role. There's an underlying feeling of 'don't expect to be able to move to part-time hours and expect to keep your career prospects' - could be particularly challenging if you are a new mum."

Despite the company trying really hard to maintain its great value, local HR in Hong Kong has ruined it all. HR has made the working environment and local culture suxks.

4317,Expedia Group,Bureaucracy leading to missed opportunities,2014-09-05,3.0,Senior Manager,"The company does a good job of recruiting bright people (70-80% are top notch. The rest can be quite poor, but this is due to the working model. Smart people decide, ""tools"" execute). Relative to most employers they treat employees quite well, though they don't stack up as well against top-tier technology companies.
Offices in Bellevue and London are top notch. Very pleasant physical workplaces.","-Promotions seem tilted towards ex-consultant heavy strategy groups.
-Entire teams made for ""strategy"" made up of ex-consultants that don't actually add much to the business. The operating model seems to be to reduce the highly skilled, highly educated other functions to be their tools.
-Bureaucracy runs rampant. Simple things take days and this prevents valuable, value-added work from being done.
-Enough already with the powerpoint and long-term plans. These sound good on paper but have become nothing more than an echo chamber and an excuse to keep loads of people in meeting rooms for hours each day. Pick a strategy, execute on it. There's no need to make such detailed plans when you are just guessing"
4318,Expedia Group,A bad place to work,2014-09-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Travel is a fun industry and there is constant change.,There is a cult of management turnaround and disrespect for employees. The CEO is unethical in his treatment of leadership and the company is disrespectful towards diverse talent
4319,Expedia Group,A company with a real buzz... but perhaps not the best employer for women,2014-09-01,4.0,Mid-Level Manager,"You'll never have a boring day at Expedia - the company is extremely agile and there is always more work than there are hours in the day. If you want a job where you can relax safely within your comfort zone, this isn't the right employer for you - but if you thrive on change and enjoy new challenges, you'll love Expedia. 

Leadership is generally good and seems to make a real effort to keep staff up to date on developments and strategy. There are a lot of type A personalities, so be prepared for a degree of competition and infighting - but in 99% of cases, this drives the business forward and helps to create the buzz that makes Expedia so successful. 

The company is also one of the most diverse I have ever worked for. A typical meeting will be attended by staff from 5-6 countries, all with competely different backgrounds. The diversity means that you can pretty much be yourself in the workplace  - everyone is different and accepts difference in others!

Pay and benefits are both very generous - there is a flexible benefits system where you can choose what to spend your 'benefits allowance' on, so benefits are tailored to individual needs. This is fabulous.","Within the Retail organisation, there is a distinct lack of women in senior positions. There are plenty of fabulous, ambitious women in the business, but I feel that many of them are sidelined during pregnancy or forgotten about while on maternity leave. This really has to change - I don't think that leadership is fully aware, yet it is a frequent topic of conversation among female staff. 

Another concern is the fact that most staff feel that the one sure way to get promoted is to socialise with the leadership team. It seems wrong that only those who party hard with that group are considered for promotion, while others are overlooked. This also puts women at a disadvantage - those with young families or longer-than-average commutes struggle to join in. 

Training could be better - there are not too many opportunities for mid-level managers to enhance their skills."
4320,Expedia Group,Great company for starters,2014-08-27,3.0,Lodging Operations Agent,"Company have one of the best benefits, pretty good training systems and great working environment.",One of the big challenges working at Expedia is that the employees rotation specially at the call Center area are huge. Leadership in that department are very week and low desire for support new hires. Compensation is one of lower considering the size of the company and personal growth incentive in the company are none. You have to manipulate people inside to get moved to better position even if you have a pretty good experience in any department inside over there you still have to manipulate people inside to get promoted.

I was asked to do quantity - the quality being the worse I've ever seen. The management was terrible, people were arrogant and the opportunity of evolving non-existing. Processes are too strict and have to be followed in every single case even though it is often absurd.
Employement conditions are terrible - my contract was a trick for getting the most of it without any respect, my binomes were employed in Manilla, had to work at night in a cellar. I was made redundant because Expedia decided to relocate to Greece, offering half of my salary to unskilled people (I was hired for doing French content, they hired non native French there), for working in terrible conditions (non air con, 10h work per day, 15min lunch break, etc.)."

I haven't come across any office bullies or anyone who's into being an spiteful/rude for the sake of it so far, which makes getting through the day fairly easy. The fact I can have my headphones in unless making phone calls helps, too.","When you work on content it can be frustrating that the company ethos is pretty fixed on the use of technology. Try to get some variation into the work you're doing or you'll hear every tick and tock from your watch. The main problem, though, is that anyone on a normal contract has to leave for at least 6 weeks after 2 years of continuous employment with the company. I think it's some sort of workaround for them to avoid having to give people full employees' rights, but whatever the reason they've lost a lot of good people because of it."

It's a friendly place to be and it's easy to take an afternoon off for errands and catch up later. There is greater diversity of people from cultures, backgrounds, experience, and interests than anywhere I've worked too.

4396,Expedia Group,Keep your friends close and your enemies closer,2014-05-16,2.0,Systems Engineer II,Lots of free coffee and soda. The building is nice and near lots of great places to have lunch. Liberal leave and work from home policy depending on the team you are with.  Lots of smart people and a chance to work at global company.,Lots of bloated middle management with little or no leadership skills. The teams succeed in spite of the lack of leadership. Rampant pettiness and backstabbing across various teams. You are rewarded for who you know and not how hard you work. Upper management is always looking to offshore your job so if you don't kiss a lot of butt you're out. Turnover of upper leadership was also very high with confusing messages with each new director.

We also have a great program in which we can opt in to buy stock at a discount. Most work areas are fairly flexible-- people aren't butts in seats, and can manage their work hours as needed. We sell travel, so I feel good about the product-- we're really helping to connect the world. Also, our employees love travel, so they tend to be a cool group with global interests.","No formal work from home or work remotely policies. It's becoming increasing difficult to even interview for jobs that are a level up, so if you want to advance your career in terms of promotions you'll likely have to hop companies.
Pay is very good for a travel company, but typically much less than a comparable job at other Seattle tech companies. (work/ life balance *might* make up for this when compared to some companies.)
Only higher levels get stocks as part of bonus."

4404,Expedia Group,Fun and flexible,2014-05-15,5.0,IT Leader,"The company is really a fun place to work and embraces a great work life balance.  They actually pay you extra when you are booking vacation travel!  Vacation policy and travel benefits are generous. Pay is average or slightly above.  Flexibility for ""working your way"" is provided whether it be flexible work schedules or bringing your own device.  I have made many close friendships here and it seems like the best people tend to stay which also keeps me here.  Great location for the HQ in Bellevue WA tons of great places to gather and eat and Seattle is only 20 minutes across the lake.  Best place I have ever worked.",I honestly look forward to coming in each day and I can't think of anything meaningful to note as a dissatisfaction.  I really wish that we had a gym in the building but there are two that are within a block so it's tough for me to fault them for that.  They put in a health clinic instead of a gym which is nice but I guess I would have preferred a gym.  You also need to pay for parking in the building and it isn't cheap BUT they do offer free travel benefits to encourage employees to use public transportation which is nice.
4405,Expedia Group,"It's a company of refugees, but that's not a bad thing.",2014-05-15,4.0,Senior Manager,"Everyone here is basically a refugee from Amazon, Microsoft, or Google. They've come  here for the great benefits and work/life balance. I never get an email after 5pm or on the weekends, I never work more than 40 hours a week and I'm not expected to. They force you to take your vacations, it's pretty awesome.","Our dev teams are second rate because we don't give them equity or pay the going rate. It's hard to hire quality people when you can't pay them what they'd make anywhere else, and you can't be a cutting edge technology company if you don't hire quality people. 

Very few women in leadership roles. The company is committed to improving this, but they are way behind the times."
4406,Expedia Group,Expedia takes good care of their employees and strategically understands their business very well.,2014-05-15,5.0,Senior Partner Marketing Manager,"The benefits (insurance, travel reimbursement, etc.) are fantastic, the travel discounts are great as well, the people who work here seem to be pretty sharp intelligent people.",I wish there was more training. It seems like the most recent re-org has caused a lack of continuity on and between teams.
4407,Expedia Group,Great company to work for,2014-05-15,5.0,Media Producer,"I've really enjoyed my time here. PTO is excellent (I just started my 4th year, so I get 22 days this year), and so are the rest of the benefits. Everyone is so laid back and the office culture is very good. I desire to stay with Expedia for a very long time.","I feel like it's hard to move up, and I wish I were paid more.

4409,Expedia Group,I am a manager in Analytics.,2014-05-15,4.0,Analytics Manager,"The building is great, the hours are flexible and the people are very nice.  If you are actively engaged, anything you want to learn about the company you can learn, and they are very open about the company's performance.  Vacation and benefits policies are great, and being a vacation company, they are very understanding about time off and outside interests.  It's a culture focused on ""what you contribute and deliver"", not ""how many hours you work"".","Training and development, while talked about, is sometimes lacking.  People are willing to support you, but development is secondary and self-serve.  Similarly with diversity, the company is definitely supportive but not necessarily proactive( the strong women initiatives are the exception).  Compensation is decent but not generous enough for high performers to retain top talent.  Expedia seems to often lose employees to higher paychecks and gain employees through better work-life balance."

Great opportunity to network and meet new people. Opportunity for internal advancements.","It is a large company and everyone will have a different experience based on the group you work in. My group is fairly small and diverse with various travel backgrounds. The leadership team is young and does not always value the experience of those with years and depth of knowledge which is frustrating. Advancements tend to be given to those that have personal relationships with leaderships vs based on tried, true knowledge and experience."

This results in lots of change in leadership team members and difficulty maintaining momentum and strategic focus / direction. Play politics become more important because you have to plan for being positioned correctly for the next re-org. Compensation is good but not great, due to the big competitors for Seattle employees -- Amazon and Microsoft -- having more employee-friendly philosophies toward comp, especially granting stock option to a wider segment of staff members, not just for more senior roles."

Expect a re-org every time a new Sr. Director walks in (every 2 years). Employee recognition is hollow. Micro-management is also common with little trust in SMEs. Individual thinking is discouraged. I have witnessed backstabbing and in-fighting. There is no encouragement for teams to work together - it is usually dictation. Not much opportunity to travel with a limited travel budget.

Travel Benefits
Its always exciting to be part of Travel Industry and see how people travel
Its big corporation but you can get higher ups attention if you have great idea and willing to put effort to market the idea","I joined Expedia about 7 years ago and I was thrilled to be part of such a dynamic travel environment. I really pushed myself on daily basis to learn something new on the job. After 3 months or so , I became really good at my Job and It was very limited in Scope. It took lot of time to get things done but its all to do with Business needs and requirements rather than technological challenges.

I was in that role for 3 Years and I moved to different team hoping new team would provide opportunity to learn and acquire new technical skills. That role didn't provide any opportunity for learning and acquiring new skills. After a year or so, moved to different team and re-org happened and moved to another team.

All these years , My technical skills eroded and I have to really dig deeper to keep abreast with whats going on in the industry. Its shame that full time job doesn't provide opportunity for you to innovate and acquire skill you want. 

If you are looking for a role where you want work-life balance and don't care about learning , its great place.
You just need to good at getting along with mediocre people. Middle managers and directors have no clue whatsoever about leadership and motivating and leading the team. They are there because they get paid.
You don't see lot of passion among employees. 

Our CEO could be the reason for this culture. In past 10 years, nothing has dramatically changed how Expedia operates. Its very limited in terms of search and book.
Still you do your constrained search of  ""where , when and what "". If you are just planning a trip and thinking about going somewhere cheap and doing some fun activities , you still got to use google.

Expedia is 10 Billion dollar company and our CEO is key factor for increasing the company value. But I don't think anyone focuses on travelers experience and passionate about changing how travelers shop and book. Majority of the focus is on tactical operations. How can we improve this feature, that feature, so we keep the shoppers on the page and book.

One thing I was truly disappointed is showing ads on website. When you ask the question, what value does the ads provide for travelers. Most of the times its distraction. You click on a ad you are interested and spend few more minutes to complete what you wanted to do. Expedia created ads team and they generate high return on investment. Again when you ask the question, Does that truly enhance the travel experience?. 

End of the day, its 10 Billion dollar corporation . The focus is on generating more revenue. 
If you want passionate job and you want to be part of learning and improving community , please don't even consider it.  
If you want good work life balance and OK with maintaining status quo , this could be great fit.
Good luck on your choices."

4469,Expedia Group,"Great place to work, good benefits, average comp",2014-02-24,5.0,Technical Product Manager,"Work-life balance is very good. 40hr weeks are pretty standard, with the occasional longer hours if needed. In the right group/org, the PM role can be highly visible - regularly presenting to CEO, EVPs, etc. Benefits are great, travel discounts are not nearly as good as outsiders might think, but they do exist. Environment is very collaborative - people are always willing to help. They ditched the old review system (ratings, stack-ranking, etc. - all gone). New system in much more geared towards personal growth and open dialog between you and your manager.

Management in my current org is receptive to comments/complaints. They genuinely care about their employees, their workload and their careers. 

Most coworkers are quite intelligent, and the work is challenging and rewarding. Despite my lengthier ""Cons"" list, I'm pleased with my work here and won't soon be leaving. Compensation would be the only thing that could foreseeably make me leave.","Had a bit of a bait-and-switch hiring experience. Interviewed and received an offer for a Sr level position. Verbal offer accepted. Written offer was for lvl 2 - just below Sr. - and about 5k less salary (and 5% less bonus potential), but received signing bonus instead.

Started in the core technology group. Position wasn't exactly as I was lead to believe. Was bored within 4 months. Was able to transfer to the engineering org in a much more highly visible role, and have been significantly happier. There is definitely some variance between the different orgs. 

Organization is very matrix'ed - devs report to dev leads, to dev mgrs, to dev directors. Because of this, there appears to be good career path for engineers. Not so much for PMs, which tend to report to Directors/Sr Directors. There are basically 3 levels of the various PM flavors. Level 2, Sr, and Principle. The only real differences (on paper) are the scale of project and/or products you support. As a PM, a promotion depends on getting that one highly visible project/program to run (this is in addition to your daily responsibilities). If you knock it out of the park near review time, you'll probably get the promotion.

Since the org is matrix'ed, PMs don't get direct reports. Almost never. In fact, PMs don't have as much power as I'm used to in previous jobs. If the team you manage doesn't care for a particular decision, they'll just complain up their chain of command.

Salary lags behind other local tech leaders. About 5% behind MS for same title, and appears to lag significantly compared to Google, Amazon and others. Though work-life balance can make up for some of the difference. Stock/equity is hard to come by, especially compared to the competition mentioned above. Cash and equity bonuses do happen, but not nearly at the level of AmaGoogleSoft. Merit increases barely keep pace with inflation."

""Leadership"" team is checked-out, they don't care about the employees, regularly no show for one on ones or reschedule only to not show up for that one either. 
Changes are made with little employee feedback.
Morale is horrible and the only communication that you see from the current manager is when he has another new policy to implement to further make this department mirror a call center. 
Coming to work and doing your job is not rewarded, to be rewarded you must send out constant over-communication and suck up to the manager as much as possible. You should also plan a lot of useless meetings that do not accomplish anything. 
Job is coded as salaried, leadership wont bat at eye if you decide to stay late, but if you need to leave early, come in late, or go to an appt during the day, you may find that they want you to make it up somehow. 
Salary is low, they compare their pay to Amazon which is similar but the Amazon employees receive OT and have more traditional hours. 
Tools are constantly becoming obsolete, department won't spend the money to get new tools to enable us to be more accurate in our jobs.

This might sound like a common complaint in big companies, but, with Expedia, it really affected a lot of us in the worst way.

The ability to expand your horizons into different departments is outstanding as long as you take the time to network with others. 

The Executive Leadership Team has a blue sky vision for the company as a whole and they are dependent on the mid-level management to uphold the values and accomplish the tasks. I've found that most management I've worked with are not micro-managers unless they are forced to be (slackers not doing their jobs)!. 

The benefits packages are very competitive. At my tenure, I've got 5 weeks of vacation + leisure travel reimbursement and discounts on hotel reservations. With your IATAN Card, you can also get flight discounts through special airline programs. The opportunity to travel + reimbursement is amazing.

From a personal development standpoint, they have online classes offered free of charge, college tuition reimbursement, classes for all levels of management and developmental goal setting as part of your mid-year and year-end reviews.","Being in Bellevue, the commute is heavy if you live anywhere but on the east side. I live in the South End near Puyallup / Tacoma and while housing is MUCH more affordable, the hour to hour-and-ahalf commute is brutal unless you have a carpool buddy.

There is no formalized mentoring program, the career is 100% in your hands.  Unless you are lucky, you probably won't have anyone that will help you develop your skills, or move to the next step in your career.  There is a lack of female leadership on the VP level."

OK culture.

As a working mother I feel unfairly scrutinized when I need to take my children to the doctor even when there's never been a question of the quality and timeliness of work. I've been told that ""people"" have noticed that I'm not here on the rare occasions that I need to tend to something during working hours. I'm salary so it's not like I'm skipping out on hours and then claiming them. On other teams I had really great flexibility and that was a strength of the management. I've gone from working from home 1-4 days a week to not at all because you need to keep up appearances for management.  You're made to feel untrustworthy and like you're slacking. 

I've been here over 5 years and a few years ago HR had a new policy to hire everyone in at the middle of their salary range while leaving everyone that was already here where they were. So I was managing people that were making only $500 less than me a year. If I was to be hired now I would be making $20,000 more a year and that's really difficult to stomach. I continually think about leaving.

Obvious favoritism from management."
4669,Expedia Group,Lots of Re-Organizations and Turnover,2012-09-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Vacation benefits, medical, relaxed environment.  The employees are friendly and have varied backgrounds.","From my experience it can be difficult to work for Expedia and not feel like a guest rather than an employee.  Turnover seems to be massive at this company and a lot of people seem to leave at about the two-year mark.  There are frequent senior leadership changes which causes attrition in the ranks.  New leaders often end up re-organizing entire groups which forces some people out of 
work.  You can be very happy and well-suited to the job you were hired for and then suddenly come to work one day to find that you are on a new team with a different manager.  This new team may have different expectations and work which you are not as suited for.  I'd already been through a few re-orgs and then one day I came to work to find HR giving a few of us our walking papers due to yet another impending re-organization.  They didn't give us the option of looking for other jobs internally, they simply took our badges and walked us out of the building which was very cold, in my opinion.    

I've worked for many large companies and can honestly say that there are more re-organizations
and employee turnover at Expedia than i've ever seen.  I understand that re-orgs are a part of corporate life, but this was ridiculous.  Be aware of this for anyone re-locating from a long distance to join this company."

4676,Expedia Group,"Good, could be great if it sorted fragmented management",2012-09-13,3.0,Marketing Manager,"It is a very friendly company with good compensation and benefits.  It has a sensible work/life balance approach and allows employees to work flexibly.  The company is successful and has money in the bank so the offices are modern, light, pleasant and you get free drinks etc.  There are a lot of smart people and the European marketing team is well managed and led.","The company goes through US centric/local centric swings but at its heart it is US centric.  Several of the senior US management team are basically venture capitalists/consultants there to look after the financial interests of the majority shareholder and therefore there is a lot of short termism. The US management team are not great leaders- the European management team is on the whole ok.  The main frustration with Expedia is that it seems to constantly seek to fragment its teams further, basically so that it can measure them all as ""channels"" on a spreadsheet and apply a rudimentary short term approach to figure out which is making the most money.  This leads to duplication of effort and a lot of decisions that should get taken don't as there is a lack of ownership.  If Expedia could be more joined up it would be dangerous.  But that likely won't happen under the current ownership in my view. There is a very flat structure, so unless you feel happy selling your soul to be part of the small inner circle that runs the business, it will probably be a two or three year gig.  If you have no qualms about that- and there are plenty who have done well by doing so- you'll enjoy it."

Opportunities to travel.","A fantastic brand to have on your CV, but that's where it ends.

If you are driven by results, don't expect to change or deliver anything here. Unless the CEO thinks its a good idea it will never happen, one of the major reasons that the companies market share and revenues in Europe are in such rapid decline. Because nobody dares question his 'leadership' the culture is one of blame and suspicion, with senior management constantly looking for  someone to point the finger at.

Expedia is a great stepping stone, but don't be fooled into thinking this will be a long term career move. Its a volatile, high pressure environment with extremely high staff turnover, the resultant is constant course correct and a new 'strategy' every few months. Expect to see a re-structure and senior leadership change every six months or so.

The company invests little to nothing in staff development, and the general attitude towards staff is unsupportive and aggressive. Overall the business is incredibly political and bureaucratic. Leadership are all desperately trying to protect their own small corners of the empire and deflect the CEO's gaze onto someone else, so expect little support. Senior management will happily throw you under a bus if it takes the spot light off them for just a moment."

4712,Expedia Group,Solid company with great people,2012-06-23,4.0,Program Manager II,"I waited nearly a full year to write this review to make sure I could provide feedback without rose colored glasses.

In gernal, I love working at Expedia.  Expedia has a good work life balance.  Most individual contributors on the tech side work around nine to ten hours a day.  On average the work force is younger, friendly, and intelligent.  It is rare to find a team that isn't open to new suggestions or unwilling to try and find creative solutions.  It is also possible to work from home occassionally if needed.

The travel discounts for full time employees are great.  If you love travel and technology, the tech side of Expedia is a great fit.  If you don't want to travel, you'll miss out on some of the best perks.","Like any company, there are those teams which are the exception to the rule.  My advise to potential candidates is to ask how many weekends the team works on average each month.  Most teams don't work any weekends, and the teams with severe issues freqently work long hours and weekends.  The pay scale is not as high as Amazon, and slighly behind Microsoft.

There is also the odd manager who puts himself ahead of the team, but movement between teams is fairly straight forward."

4744,Expedia Group,Give them a few years...,2012-01-07,3.0,,"Nice people, decent pay, good benefits, nice building in down-town Bellevue with lots of good restaurants around, quite a bit of ""morale budget"" get spent.","Right now (2011) it seems that Expedia as a whole (meaning many brands under Expedia Inc.) is struggling with direction and leadership. I believe Expedia will likely be a good place to work again in the future but right now, most people that I know would like to leave due to massive re-orgs, lack of leadership and lack of company direction. However, most people I know also feel that Expedia has good things to offer employees and would consider working there again in the future after the dust settles. 

Cons: Major leadership issues that trickle down to the lowest levels. Terrible cubicles with zero privacy."
