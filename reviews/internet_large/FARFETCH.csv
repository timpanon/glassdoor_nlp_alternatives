Plus, we as Software Engineers get to play with the latest ""toys"": .Net Core, Kotlin, Cassandra, Mongo, Kafka, Kubernetes...","The company has grown very fast and there are growing pains. Sometimes the internal systems Software Engineers use to do their work may be unavailable for a short period. As many of these are built by Farfetch itself, this is a normal part of growth. This happens once every few months, but if you become frustrated with even the smallest issues, you may want to look elsewhere.

Due to the size and complexity of the company, you need to open tickets to be able to access new systems for instance -- again, this is understandable but if you feel strongly against internal ticketing systems you need to target a much smaller company.

Ah yes, and you don't (yet) get to pick and choose your laptop. We're getting closer, and new joiners may be lucky, but this isn't a full-fledged reality yet.

Bullying in the work place 

Lisbon, farfetch
Team inclusion does not exist , company shows you lots of beautiful videos and fancy office decor but other than that the people do not exist.
I was in team of 4 for my language, the communication was 0, if you ask for help it seems like they are doing a favor to you. I had to learn alone the “Customer Service”. Sometimes I was even left alone during lunch time , because we had to switch (so we used to go 2, and then 2) . No, this way I received all the calls me.
Other then that, the rest of the team does not even speak with you .
I had to fight against bullying in my place of work from my own colleagues and team member.

I never in my life have been spoken to like I was in this position. I am called the B word by a customer or two or three every other day and this is coming from someone with a high customer satisfaction score. When you have a bad customer, you don't just get off the phone with them and be done. You will more than likely be stuck with that customer for 1-2 weeks. You cannot just get up and use the restroom either, you get two 15 min breaks in your day to do so. If this company had a better clientele, customer service would be so much easier. You are literally better off working at a fast food restaurant, you will get paid more and you can use the restroom. No one deserves to be cursed out everyday by rude customers. No one deserves to be cursed out because you cannot give them a promo code or free shipping, this will be your day to day. The only thing you will be doing is talking to customer's on the phone, there is no variety in this position. I worked retail and this is the worst job I ever had."

We basically got no benifits whatsoever, not even health insurance, no paid sick leave...even if you have an annual leave day you do not get paid the full amount. The salary was very low, sometime they would not even give you the correct amount of salary, and then would say ""we are only people, we make mistakes"" and then you had to wait for a month for them to adjust it. They pretend to have all these amazing values and great work enviroment - please do not fall for that, it's so far from the truth. The workers are treated like nothing but numbers by the supervisors who do not untersand that wokers are still human. We endured verbal abuse by customers over the phone every day, but nobody cared about that, the company refused to protect us from anything, not even stalkers that female workers had to deal with. They will also most likely give u a temporary contract, so you will be shaking every day becuase they can fire you whenever they please - they only need to give you 1 week notice.

* Salary. The prices in Lisbon are quite high and the salary, (while OK by Portuguese IT standards) barely allows saving.

Generally speaking (not Farfetch-related), if you're an expat planning to move to Lisbon, make sure you understand well the budget constraints. Also, if you have a partner that isn't in an IT-field, take into account the possibility that finding any other job will be extremely hard."

503,FARFETCH,My favorite job in 25 years,2020-03-30,5.0,Workforce Specialist,"With how large and complex the operation is, there is always something new and exciting to work on, there are always challenges to figure out. The majority of decisions are made with the company values in mind which are a great guiding light that have helped the company maintain it's culture and pace of growth. Our CEO says ""culture eats strategy for breakfast."" The company and it's leaders actually listen to the feedback that is provided in the biannual employee surveys and regularly implement programs around that feedback. I've been here 4 years and I've seen so many improvements; compensation (both in wages and stock), time off (increase in base time off and addition of paid volunteer time off), development, a month long sabbatical available to employees who've been here 5 years, metro benefits, etc. Every year things gets better. I've seen people leave the company unhappy with the state of affairs only to regret the decision soon after when they realize how different Farfetch is from most companies. Several have returned for this reason. The average age of employees does skew younger so they may lack the perspective that comes with the experience of working for many different companies. Those who do tend to be delighted when they learn how different Farfetch actually is and that it's not just buzzword recruiting tactics. The hiring choices that are being made at managerial and executive levels and the acquisitions that have been made all speak to the long term plan our CEO has developed. 
The office is amazing - I love coming in to work every day. The views from my desk, the lunch tables, the meeting rooms are all amazing. Office Management is very responsive to needs. 
I've had the opportunity to work, on a regular basis, with people in offices in at least 6 different countries. Truly the most global company I've ever worked for.","1. The pace of growth is at times difficult to keep up with (but that's also part of the appeal). If you like working for a company where you can just come in and do your job and punch out, you might last but you certainly won't grow. Promotions and department transfers are competitive, as they should be - tenure alone will get you nowhere which some people have a hard time accepting.  
2. Way too many emails. As with most companies, cross department communication is a challenge which some departments seem to have addressed with more and more emails. I could easily spend 30% of my day reading and responding to emails so one needs to develop a personal strategy for this. I'm not sure how to get around this, though. Slack certainly hasn't helped as that's just another channel one needs to manage, and that takes up more precious time. 
3. Some of the technology we use that was developed in-house is buggy and the pace of development/improvement on that front is lacking. I understand that there is limited budget and tons of different priorities, but I don't think all the departments have the same customer in mind. Thankfully this seems to be improving, albeit rather slowly. 

Not really a con since in some cases it would be impossible, but worth mentioning; some development opportunities only exist in UK or Portugal. I've seen numerous people move from their home country to London or Portugal to take the next step, but that's not an option for some. Working here will certainly prepare you for the next step in your career, though."

Still, the market offers more.","WFH is a lie. You need to have a good reason to stay at home, otherwise management requires you to be there, even if you don't produce at all. Corona virus isn't enough for management to close the office. You can work from home, but they keep telling everyone that you have to work and it is not vacation time. If you think people don't work just fire them, don't make the others suffer just because you hired below par developers.
Every other known IT company closed the office, only Farfetch didn't."

No actions on the back of customer survey.
Absent management at best, otherwise inept and on occasion abusive.

Seriously, the office is often empty. I have never even seen most of them or heard what they wanted us to do. Most important meetings are cancelled without an explanation or people just don’t show up.
The people who show up, I generally don’t know who they are or why they are here.

The company objectives are apparently “customer satisfaction” and “profit”. Farfetch measures neither. I’ve asked the team who could do that but their team lead just quit.
I’ve flagged abusive managers to HR who did nothing. Wrote detailed feedback, with people who could testify, still nothing. It’s not really hard to tell: they generally yell at their team on video conference while they are in the open space. When I asked about it a couple of months later, they refused to address it and just walked out.

Like most of my peers, I’m still there, trying to find a job elsewhere but I’m not in the office most the time because I go to interviews. But no one seems to care that I’m not there. Everyone else is probably interviewing too."

- Poor career progression. There is no clear path to promotion. HR and managers do not care about hiring you at a fair level, but rather getting the most overqualified person they can to get their job done. Most analysts are constantly looking for a way out.
- On a day to day level, job can be very mundane. There is a plethora of data issues that prevent intellectual and insightful data analysis, and the lack of focus at management level does not enable exciting long-term projects for analysts
- Compensation is low, no bonus  in 2018 due to overly ambitious targets that were missed, and the stock is not worth much

533,FARFETCH,Think twice before accept an offer,2019-12-18,1.0,Software Engineer,"- Nice office
- Good people working there
- Meals and equipment
- Technology stack","- Low salaries;
- High employees turnover:
	I saw very unhappy people working there. This is the first place I have seen people wanting to leave the company before completing three months. And there are a lot o people that are just waiting the best opportunity to leave and a lot that already left the company.
- People don't want to grow their career there:
	There are a lot of people who don't want to get a leadership position because they don't want to follow a toxic leadership way. And those who accept the challenge will begin to get sad because they will need to do a lot of things that they disagree, just to follow this pattern.
- Micro management: 
	Good luck in your first team. In some teams, you will need the approval of the ""owner(s)"" of the code to do a simple if;
- Bad code review: 
	The ""owner(s)"" of the code will make you refactor the name of a variable/method at least 3 times, with a more ""meaningful name"";
- Not clear definition of done: 
	The Jira Cards only have a Title;
- Not agile: 
	There are teams that think that having an agile coach will not help the team in anything;
- Not clear evaluation: 
	The way they evaluate your work is not objective. Sometimes they will use a behavior as a bad thing, while other times they will say that the same behavior is required for your position. Also, they will check your Git for measure your performance but without informing you before, so no matter if you talked about something, if it is not reflected on your Git, is like you didn't do it at all.
- Ignore your knowledge 
	Your previous knowledge is nothing at Farfetch. You will need to be shaped based on the Team's way. Don't try to think too much, because they have already thought in all cases;
- Doing the same thing trying to solve the same problem, expecting to have a different result: 
	You will usually see a red pipelines during all sprint, and the solution will be just ""fixing"" the pipeline.
- They use feedback against you:
	If you give a feedback, be prepared that can be used against you.
- Don't try to change the team:
	There are a lot of people who failed in the process to change the team. Some of those with ""hidden"" reasons.
- They use threat against you: 
	If you make a suggestion to improve a team's process, you will be threaded with this suggestion, and you will get the blame if something goes wrong with your suggestion. Your suggestion will be a law from then, and you must be the only person responsible to make the new suggestion work.
- Management will not say that they are wrong: 
	Everything was your fault. Managers think that they are perfect.
- No transparency on employees contracts: 
	There are kind of contracts in Portugal. Also, there are hidden contracts that you will need to sign on your first day;
- No transparency with salaries: 
	There are difference between salaries, based on the same position and responsibilities. Besides, if you think the bonus as a part of your salary, think it twice. There are some hidden rules to give you a bonus;
- No transparency with benefits: 
	The stocks rules aren't clear. Some people with the same salary will get the less stocks than the others;
- Bad understanding of Farfetch's values (Todos Juntos): 
	Some managers think ""Todos Juntos"" as the team only. They will say that they are cleaning live and the other teams only do mistakes. 
- Bad understanding of Farfetch's values (Be Human):
	Some managers think ""Be Human"" is to create a ""family"" at Farfetch, on which everybody do every single thing together. If you don't want something like this, you are wrong.

559,FARFETCH,"Poor management, paints a false image of itself",2019-08-14,1.0,,Generally good work life balance. Exposure to fashion industry,"Farfetch is a joke. The company paints itself as an innovative tech company when it's a creaking, manual company with an unclear strategy and led by incompetent management

1. Strategy: Not sure the company has one, other than to, 'take the lion's share of growth in luxury fashion.' that's an objective not a strategy.  Different departments chase different objectives, often conflicting. Now that the company is public, it's chasing short term KPIs rather than investing a sustainable business model . Diff execs have different visions of what FF should be, resulting in a mess of an organisation that unsuccessfully tries to do too much 

The company is clearly chasing top-line growth through flashy M&A, but their path to profitability is unclear, let alone their ability to integrate these acquisitions

2. Leadership: Poor. Leadership sets the objectives, culture and expectations for the business. The leaders here don't do much leading as they are simply too busy trying to get by and blame the company's poor performance on others.  None of the leadership team have the credentials to be leading such an organisation. They should be middle management at best. 

3. Operations: to call this company a tech company would be like calling Boris Johnson handsome. The company doesn't have the right access to tech resources, talent or innovation to deliver on its promises. 

4. Career growth: given there's so much firefighting I don't believe FF offers much in the way of career development. Promotions are arbitrary and based on whether people like you. I particularly feel for the junior people who are not being trained or developed and getting paid peanuts as well. Salaries are all over the place for the same level, and VERY LOW, especially if you consider the tanking stock prices and cancelled bonus. 

Staff turnover is incredibly high, reflecting the poor opportunities in this place."
560,FARFETCH,"Incompetent management, ZERO strategy",2019-08-14,1.0,Anonymous,I like the office space and decor. Some of my peers were very enjoyable to work with - the casual atmosphere brewed team camaraderie (although this depends on the team).,"Farfetch is a company filled with executives and upper level managers who have no idea what they are doing. Many of them are young, arrogant, lack experience, and are only hired based on network or CV brand names (educational institutions, management consultancies) rather than how skilled they are or their measured results from achievements at previous companies. Many of these people could greatly benefit from working in established companies at a lower level, and learning from industry mentors who have gathered far more knowledge. Most crucially, many of these people don't understand their core customers, their behaviour, and the fashion industry. I have worked in several different companies, but this is far and wide the most toxic work environment I have ever encountered. Politicking is widespread and executives engage in a never ending blame game where different divisions throw responsibility of poor results on each other. The consequences of the above are that progress on any project is slow if nonexistent. Most of the companies resources are thrown at addressing the same question week after week: what's causing decelerating sales? Rather than actually committing resources to initiatives that will solve these challenges & promote profitable long term growth, execs order department heads to order their teams to investigate these questions and come up with an answer so that their department isn't blamed that week (and therefore doesn't have to address it with a long-term solution). No one thinks about how each department's (usually conflicting) strategies (marketing, supply, ops, product etc.) all impact each other, which ultimately impacts the customer experience. Working at Farfetch is therefore akin to condemning yourself to Sisyphus' fate. In addition to all that, the pay is poor - it's aligned with fashion salaries NOT tech salaries. People work very hard as well - working weekends and late nights is not uncommon. Promotions are not based on achievements - rather they are based on whether or not you are a flight risk or if you worked at a fancy management consultancy or if you went to an Ivy League. Finally, the financial outlook of this company is truly questionable - every aspect of their core business is under pressure so I struggle to see a way to scale profitable growth without considerable investment decisions being made (and I don't mean showy & irrelevant M&A activity... I mean actual operational decisions). This company needs to make some hard decisions about where to invest their resources and where to sacrifice because they have not yet mastered their core business. Unfortunately no one is willing to do that.... especially not at the top."

-Beautiful & brand new office in Downtown Los Angeles","-Little to zero opportunity for growth/career advancement when starting at the bottom as a Customer Service Advisor. 
-This place of work is the perfect fit for someone who is only looking to pay their rent and have a little bit leftover.
-This job will consume and drain you of any leftover energy to pursue other endeavors as this position requires you to rotate between three different schedules (8-5, 9-6, 11-8) and require you to also work weekends and sometimes overtime.
-Simply put, there is just much more work than there are employees so this department will constantly be scrambling to fill the position just to get the work done.
-Be aware that there is no such thing as seniority in this department at Farfetch. 
You can dedicate two years of your working life here and you will still be on the same level as the new hires who have been there for two weeks. 
-Turnover rate is extremely high.
I have worked multiple customer service positions, from bank corporations to retail furniture to now luxury retail and can confirm this is the worst case I've seen.
-There is no recognition and/or appreciation for those who choose to stay despite the hostile environment.
-Morale is so low in this department yet management still finds it okay to micromanage and push their employees to meet quotas or else risk losing their job.
-At the end of the day, you will still have a job so my advice is, do not kill yourself by pushing to meet their minimum requirements. Just relax and do what you can.

You will meet many talented people and managers and opposed to the reputation of the fashion industry make friends easily. The team spirit is great and there is a sense of belonging.

the business takes an active approach in keeping employees happy and motivated (work from home options, flexitime, breakfast, good benefits, social events).","The salaries are not shockingly low, but could be higher compared to other tech  businesses of that size.

It seems difficult and lengthy to get a pay rise or promotion but it’s certainly not impossible and hard work seems to the rewarded.

Be aware you might not survive the onbording if you don't play along. Happend before. 
If you pass that, you have to deal with the TLs. 

Team leaders are totally clueless, but walk like stars just because they work for farfetch. This is specially the case if they on board since the beginning. Once there was downtime that went for 2-3, some TL that was next to us had the nerve to ask what was going on, after 3 hours. 

You have to deal with superficial people and share fake love otherwise you get marked, and will get fired. You can be the best on your team. It really doesn't matter at all. So be prepared for that.

Oportunities to grow are pretty non existent, so don't even think about that. Unless you willing to go the extra mile. See previous point.

Other additional caveat might be the system itself. Just poor and slughish. For an IT company, kinda impressive. Also in high season you will be non stop on the phone with just 1min wrap up time after a call like it was farfetch 2008. Manageable, but totally non sense.

Great employee discount for first purchase.,"Again located in the heart of downtown la which means heavy traffic volume. High turnover, unstable schedules, leadership is not informed of policies and will be quick to shift the blame on associates. Focused more on numbers than quality. High stress with very low pay. But everybody wears designer so you would never know."
633,FARFETCH,Good perks,2019-01-31,3.0,Software Engineer,"Farfetch is a good company overall. Software development are divided by clusters, each cluster has a manager and it is divided in some business units. Each business unit has a manager and smaller development teams with a line manager (dev team leader), a QA guy, and around 4 developers. Cluster manager and business unit manager are open to new ideas to improve development processes to fill existing gaps in daily work. In case you do not feel comfortable with working with your team you can discuss with those managers and move to another team if available or change your current position (from dev to QA, QA to PO, PO to Dev  etc). If you change job position will be assigned to a junior level in order to have time to learn new tasks. Human resources is kind of small for a company with more than 1 thousand employees but they manage to help you in some areas. Farfetch borrows an amount to sponsor your relocation to other country if needed and help you providing documents for work permit. Dev teams can touch each others code without too many restrictions and your dev team lead can approve pull requests from external dev teams. Tuesdays and Fridays you have free lunch. All days you have free fruits, bread, soup, coffee, cappuccino and so on. Visual Studio license provides you some time limited free courses on Pluralsight, Linkedin learning, etc. Farfetch also offers you to choose between Coursera and Udemy to take long-term courses. There are some benefits as game room, nap room, yoga and dance classes, gym discounts, learning vouchers, but I am not aware of how they work. Farfetch also offers free buses to / from office in specific hours such as 8:20, 8:30 and 18:15.
Around Lionesa there are 3 or 4 restaurants where you can have lunch, but some can take too much time time to prepare your meal since there are employees from other companies nearby having lunch in the same time. Farfetch has parking for employees. Company offers some parties during the year and Tech talks to keep employees up-to-date to tech trends, products, initiatives, etc. 
Once you are hired you have an amazing onboarding training to get to know company history, organization, and main areas. Company offers voucher for buying goods from its e-commerce site.","Some agile teams have controlling people as team leader and her/his favorite workmates who are aligned with the same ideas. There is no much room for innovation or creativity because projects are already in production environment and architecture has already been defined previously by architects or previous team leaders. 

There isn't no privacy in Agile assessments and 360 feedback tools. Team evaluation is carried out every three months to map team members behavior are not so private, so you could get exposed if you disagree with other team members and colleagues will know which comments you have made. Comments in feedbacks are public to others and this could bring some trouble if you say what you think. 

Also every month team leaders conduct one one one meetings compelling you to talk how you feel about yourself, leadership and team members which could make you feel uncomfortable sometimes. Company monitors actively your mood. 

Company keeps hiring developers but does not hire staff for dealing with IT and infrastructure issues, so developers must be doing some continuous delivery configuration tasks for deployment and monitoring applications to check if they are offline or failing. Company expects that you deal with tech support for applications and also change source code from other teams, which could cause unintended behaviors. 

As a developer company expects you to write all automation tests which is actually a role of QA specialists along with Product owners. 

Technical onboarding is not planned in some teams so when you don't have proper training and pair programming, you could struggle to understand pieces of current applications and how they fit together. 

Some teams take too many weeks to approve a merge request and your submitted code could be outdated fast. 

Often your opinions could be considered wrong from team members perspective. So it's hard to feel part of the team when your opinions and alternatives are not considered. You somehow feel disrespected with some immature behavior of some team members. You feel like working in industrial era. Just glueing things and code. 

Some teams have routines of lunch and have a snacks in specific hours which does not seem spontaneous and natural. If you choose your own timing for those things they would think you do not want to integrate the team and hang out with them. So you are not totally free to choose your lunch time since there are routines in some teams. 

Lastly you can feel harassed with complains about not paying too much attention to all the noise propagated by email, instant messaging, daily meeting and retrospectives. 

The open space is disruptive with lots of distractions. Some people keep watching and controlling what you are doing and disruptions make it hard to focus on something from start to finish."

The environment is so informal and relaxed that often some people get carried away and turn the open space into something like nursery school, not respecting those who are trying to focus on what they are supposed to be doing.

Not the highest salary but you do get a lot of perks, like bonuses, insurance, food, work from home, parties, etc.
Good overall environment in your day to day work.
When you're starting they do a good job on passing the idea that you're in a different company with good values, good work environment and a lot of respect from people, etc.
You get to know a lot of great people.
A good starting point to learn a lot on the software development process.
The CEO seems very commited to make the company a great place for employees, knowing that that will be reflected on the company's results.","This is a company for ""yes men"".
If someone asks if you can do something in X amount of time always say you can, even if you know it can't be done. When you miss the deadline you can always say that something not planned came up.
A few of the people you get to know are not that good, and I'm going so far as to say they are psychopaths, using the clinical term.
Had a coworker who frequently distorted  words or outright lied to my lead about my performance. He also had a really bad attitude when working in a team, yelling in the most simple situations.
Since that coworker and my lead were college friends his behaviour was being masked by my lead.
Every six months we get a performance review were we give/get feedback to/from our coworkers. I was ready to give feedback about his yelling and overall behaviour but, just before the feedbacks, I had a meeting with my lead were he told me that my evaluation was going to be two grades below my coworker's grade. That was his way of saying, if you give negative feedback about him you're only harming yourself. Not surprisingly my coworker had the highest grade on the performance review.
Other feedbacks mention this and the previous example is just to reinforce it, performance reviews are friendship based and so are promotions.
This completely undermines the company's aspirations tho get good talent.
The Personal Development Plan is a waste of time."

651,FARFETCH,Do not recommend,2018-11-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Good for young professionals or with little experience,"1. HR / is questionable. They let supervisors with no recruiting or cv screening experience basically hiring whoever they want. They seem to obstacle internal career progression. Considering the people hired in my team, I question their experience in selecting and choosing the right candidates. Promotions look like friendly based.  Had to chase them to get a reply on a candidacy. The process has been quite stressful.

2. Leadership / I worked with a supervisor who proved to have no related experience and being incompetent on many different aspects of the role. Unfair divisions of the tasks among team members with the same role lasted for months and months. Despite having reported the situation together with mismanagement evidence and despite the consequences my department experienced at large in many occasions, no real action had been taken to improve the situation. Personal friends joined the team as freelancers with no translation experience causing consequences that affected the quality of the projects and their management. 

The team lack of a structure able to evaluate the job of the supervisors for the foreign languages they don't speak. No investiment in those team members who prove to work harder and better. Are they able to recognize them? Do they care?

3. Communication among the teams is very poor and the todos juntos value happened to be vital in my experience. The collaborative approach of more competent supervisors literally saved the situation several times.

- Some great people to know and work with.
- The Digital Production business unit is really world class.
- The CEO is a crazy visionary, always pushing the business forward.","- Overall, really bad managers and leaders, with a few remarkable exceptions.
- Almost all bad managers don't have the required soft, and even hard, skills to perform their job. A waste of money.
- Almost all bad managers play favorites and take credit for their team's accomplishments on a regular basis. Politics rules.
- The technology department used to be agile a long while ago, but the bad managers killed it completely, being CI and CD the only exceptions.
- Today, the technology department builds tech products using traditional and old-school project management techniques, employing a large number of managers of course. Products and Projects don't combine, do they?
- Engineering completely dominates Product: a really bad sign of what agile became in the last years. A real worldwide case study.  
- The technology department structure has too many levels, too many silos, too many managers, too many projects running in parallel, and too much politics. In one word: over-engineered. 
- The aren't almost no opportunities for career advancement once you are onboard. The personal development plan is a joke, as it always had a bad design and the bad managers always abused it. In short: a 4 months/year waste of everyone's time, and a huge source of stress for all. A shame.
- The HR department is just for hiring and firing basically. In one word: they are the bad managers' secretaries."

- Really bad middle to top management: either inexperienced or ""very old school"" (read: control & command), usually very bad listeners or completely powerless, being most of them arrogant and/or control freak. 
- Highly hierarchical structure with lots of levels, lots of silos, and with a very top-down command & control culture.
- How does a company value its own Values? They do not count for promotions, raises, bonus or whatever. Zero.
- The only thing that counts for your career development is how well you manage the office politics, or the position you got on the career ladder when you were hired in the first place (the higher the better).

- The salaries for managerial positions are reasonable and there is a good bonus program in place.
- In general good benefits package.","- The company is heavily invested in promoting a ""cool culture"" that will make it desirable for the outside world/future employees but when it comes to people who are already in the company they frequently become easily replaceable and are pushed out.
- A lot of promises are made regarding career prospects but are rarely kept.
- Investment in internal talent has been decreasing in lieu of hiring senior people from big companies."

798,FARFETCH,"A culture-less company of wannabe fashionistas, the money's decent though",2016-01-27,2.0,Designer,"- Pay Well
- Beautiful new London Office
- Free trips to Portugal","- Severe management issues. Farfetch has evidently struggled with rapid growth, putting people into management positions who really shouldn't be there. Thus many of the 'managers' I encountered simply couldn't manage. 
- Lack of Company culture. This is why I decided to leave - Farfetch think they have this great startup culture when in reality it is simply a part of the corporate machine. Coming from a true startup, I was sold this startup dream. In reality the office was dead quiet with no atmosphere, I was chastised for looking at Facebook once every 2 hours, and everyone treated one free beer on a friday like jesus himself was offering wine to the masses.
- Farfetch is a tech company, not a fashion company. The majority of the people I met thought they were in the fashion world and felt they were god's gift to the world with their eclectic fashion sense. In reality this doesn't translate at all well to tech. You end up with a company of people dressing in ridiculous attire who don't have a clue about their job because they're only there for the free discount.
- The old guard are in control. Joining as a new hire, there is an immediate air of ""them vs. us"". Of those that have been there since Farfetch was small, vs. those of us who have joined in the new wave of hires. That old guard believe they are superior in everywhere and HR & the high-uppers appeared to give them much lee-way. They would socialise in their own circles, and us new hires forced to socialise in our own circles. This certainly contributed to the lack of culture. There was no team mentality but a strict hierarchy borne through this social separation - this all created a toxic atmosphere."

802,FARFETCH,"Interesting company, but not a place to stay long term",2015-10-08,3.0,Customer Service Representative,"Casual environment, innovative structure and ""start up"" mentality, snacks/family lunch.

Farfetch was a good place to work right out of college. It's a laid back office with a really unique business structure. The office is what you'd expect from a fashion office in LA, and there's some amazing product that comes in to get photographed in the studio.","Not much for advancement, terrible pay/benefits. It's just not worth staying at a company that pays so little. Also, Customer Service was forced to work on a lot of holidays and weekends in the office, when this type of work could really be done remotely. It's one thing to expect a certain level of dedication when employees are being compensated well, but you can't expect people to dedicate late nights, holidays and weekends when you pay next to nothing."
803,FARFETCH,One of the Best,2015-10-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Having over 10 years experience working for digital companies I can safely say that Farfetch has been one of the best. It's grown very quickly the last few years but the business still has that ""Start-up"" culture maintained throughout which is fantastic to see. They make a real effort trying to understand what employees want and offer a great deal of support in the form of training sessions, courses and conferences. Lots of nice perks too!",The company has struggled to manage the number of new employees and actual desk space which has been frustrating for many at times.
804,FARFETCH,Great Place to work,2015-08-31,5.0,QA Engineer,"Great environment, nice office and very nice and helpful people.
Everyone is concerned with you as a person and with your career expectations.
You can see that the company is really concerned with the well being of their employees.",Some managers in some departments do not have the capacity for managing people.
805,FARFETCH,This Place Rules!!!! Brush off the haters!!,2015-07-10,5.0,,"The company is growing so fast, it's great to be a part of rapid change and improvement.","We need a bigger office! We have hired so many people, that we are all out of room!"
806,FARFETCH,Stay far far away,2015-07-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,1) Some managers do worry about whether you're happy and try to keep you motivated;,"1) Compensation - Salaries are ridiculous. They will pay you miserably with the promise that raises are big and frequent.
Don't fall for these lies. I had great performance reviews and got raises but the raises were pathetic. Salaries are low throughout all departments. Many people are just waiting to cash out stock options to then go find a better job.
And now that the company is becoming more well known and are more people are wanting to get a job there, they are taking advantage of that to cut the salaries of new hires even further.

2) Career Path - no clear trajectory. No structure within roles. Absent managers.

3) Work environment - this is the worst part in my opinion. Many people behave like they are in kindergarten and senior managers are either clueless or simply do not care
This leads to a toxic, back stabbing environment. Racist and homophobic comments are rampant. Some of these comments even come from senior managers.

4) Young and arrogant managers who have no clue about how to manage people.

5) ""I'm always busy"" type of culture, even if busy checking facebook. Sad old trick - by appearing busy they will be left alone and  people will believe they’re doing a great job.

6) The IT team (which is based in Portugal) is slow, frustrating to work with and noncooperative. This leads to constant delays, inability to make plans and frequent technical problems.

7) Bullying behavior unfortunately can and has become a reality."
807,FARFETCH,Feel you can be at the top of the game.,2015-06-28,5.0,Senior UI Developer,"This is an amazing company to be at this moment. On the development department we are working on a worldwide platform being used all over the world. It's a challenge and you know you have to be developing with the greatest techniques and with the best professionals.

The environment is amazing, people are amazing and you feel you are in the perfect place to learn and evolve. You have freedom and decision power, people trust your work and the way people develop and do their work. 

The company culture is the best I've ever seen and an example for most companies. In a small country like Portugal this is a company so great that you feel you're working at Silicon Valley.

The benefits for me should be normal worldwide and on any company, health insurance, gym, personal learning program and a lot of goodies and surprises.","The pain of growing is the downside. So many people getting in the company at this tim you don't have time to keep it up and pass the company culture and values to everyone. It's gonna be a great challenge to keep the culture company. 

Senior management has to grow and delegate more on other people. Growing so fast means you have to trust even more.

We have problems like any other company in the world, the difference is that we want to solve them."
808,FARFETCH,Customer representative,2014-12-18,1.0,,"Low salary, compensation, no motivation to move on, without good system and equipment","good people to work with, nice environment"
809,FARFETCH,"Inspirational company, great senior management, a refreshing attitude in the fashion industry.",2014-12-09,4.0,Writer,"Farfetch is an incredible company with a truly inspiring senior management team. It's rare to be pushed and nurtured as much as they do here. 

Going from a small company to a large one, I've seen a lot of changes and I'm proud to have been a part of  this company's growth. 

The benefits & bonus system is great, with everything from life insurance to corporate gym rates. 

The fashion industry is notoriously negative: Farfetch is a total exception! It is a digital company in the luxury market and is how all fashion companies should be. The power behind online fashion lies with developers and tech teams, and the Dev team at Farfetch is one of the most inspirational I've ever met.","When a company grows, there are always problems. Sometimes communication fails between the international offices and higher management.

There are negative people who have been brought on in high positions and they are dampening the company values. Senior management doesn't see this as the company is so big now. 1 bad apple can ruin the whole lot. 

There are certain positions in the company that are underpaid in comparison to competitors. This needs to be addressed or they will lose people who they could nurture and keep in the company longer term."
