3,Fanatics,"Great People, Terrible Culture",2022-03-30,1.0,Designer,"• Great people.
• Attractive building amenities.
• In a city with nice weather.","• The city is Tampa, so the pay can't match the rent.
• Low pay unless you're in management. Then bonuses increase from 5% to 10% and goes higher after that.
• Impossible to get a raise, just 3% merit increases yearly. Not enough to cover inflation.
• Managment tells everyone looking for a raise the same story, that they're talking with HR on raises, but no one seems to get a raise.
• There is no hierarchy in design, you're either a designer, or a manager. Therefore, no way to increase your pay structure.
• No room for growth in design.
• Chaotic work flow.
• Design team is burnt out.
• Used ""communication"" as an excuse to end remote work, when communication has been terrible since this companies inception.
• Ended remote work when the vast majority of employees wanted to continue remote work.
• VPs and executives have no clue what's going below their level, so they don't know how to improve our jobs.
• Its 2022 and they have us using macs from 2015 that crash while working.
• Terrible slow VPN. Our servers crawl while on our VPN"

Yeah it was that bad. This was by far the most stressful design job I have ever had in my life. The managers love to micromanage you, and have zero respect for your time. They would often schedule meetings during lunch hours or close to end of day forcing you to stay late. I was harassed on several occasions to work more than the standard 8 hours just because they did as well, regardless of whether or not I met my deadlines (and I always did). The environment was toxic AF, if someone took a well-deserved vacation, management would make snide remarks about them being irresponsible. There were several occasions where I almost walked out because of sheer stress and frustration. When I was finally free of this place I literally showed actual signs of medical PTSD and it took months to recover some semblance of normalcy. I have never been happier to be let go from a job in my life."

The company is doing really well and growing fast. The work is interesting and challenging.,"Pay “merit increases” once per year are not keeping up with the rising cost of living. The hours are not sustainable. 60-70 hour work weeks. Inability to retain talent. The culture actually sucks. You will be expected to answer requests immediately, be it 6am or 7pm. You will be scheduled for at least 5 hours of meetings per day, with half hour blocks here and there to try to do actual work during. You will be expected to add on to your regular 60 hour week an extra 3-5 hours to mentor and develop your team. Additionally you need to spend time on your own growth to stay in a “growth mindset”. If you are a parent you will never see your kids. Leadership talks about family being what matters, but there is no work life balance. Lastly, once you are in, there isn’t much opportunity for promotion from within."

Recruiters lie. Cheat and steal. Also they have unsafe roller chair competitions in the office 

Leaders claim “$20 an hour is unbelievable for overnight in OH” when they make $80,000/$90,000 a year. Unbelievable $20 an hour X 2080 hours = $41,600 without taxes.

Very structured progression plan to progress and move within the company
Use new technology
Allows you to bring ideas to the table on what other technology would benefit a certain project or future improvement
flexible on working times
very relaxed management team
expect results but dont micromanage
Employee welfare is massive and the manchester HR and management function couldnt do anymore to support everyone
laid back dress code","More alignment needed for the US, India and Manchester functions. Mostly operating in Silos which can massively slow things down when it comes to access, permissions or handovers

Have to be more accommodating for the US teams which means meetings can be as late as 8/9pm which is accounted for in later starts or getting the time back. But if its back to back meetings it could turn out to be a long day

benefits packages arent fair at all. Our colleagues in america get far more of a benefit package. The package on offer at Manchester includes medical insurance and dental cover along with bike2work but its in no way a comparison so some of the other tech companies within and around Manchester.
More could be done on prioritising workloads and deliverables so that things get put into project plans and an order in which to complete. This is currently being rolled out in my department but at a company level this could be massively beneficial to keeping employees happy and not a whoever shouts loudest gets their requirements finished first"
131,Fanatics,Fast Paced,2021-07-12,3.0,Supervisor,Good people in many departments especially on the operations floor and tech teams. Pay is competitive compared to similar industries. The day goes by super fast.,Attrition is awful. This is probably due to the fact that there are very limited opportunities for growth if you don't know the right people. Planning is poor due to the fact that management has a great insight about the business but lacks the technical knowledge of the equipment used and its real capabilities/limitations. Very limited strategy to maximize/optimize production. Very little interest in learning about these strategies or implementing them in the future.

I expressed from the start I wasn't interested in being on support, I don't like it and I don't handle interruptions well. I got shoehorned into support anyway, even after expressing for months and months that I wasn't interested in doing it. Management's feedback didn't match actual understanding of performance.
Manager, by his own admission, admitted he doesn't like confrontational conversations and tends to just ""go with the flow"" when put in that situation. His report frequently would countermand him, and I was expected to follow both.
Quite frequently, my manager would beat me to responding to an incoming support request by mere seconds, yet I was accused of being ""not visible,"" even though I would respond to him and tell him I was also available.

317,Fanatics,Best Software Engineering Job I Have Had To Date; Bar None,2019-10-20,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Company growing. Bigly.

Great compensation, some of the best in Jacksonville, FL - and other locations I have been told.

Feels like a functioning meritocracy which is super rare. Notice I say functioning and not ""claimed"" because I have seen it in action directly and in-directly.

Good individualized feedback from your direct supervisor. Lot's of 1-on-1s to get in complaints and to receive them as well. You are given the opportunity to change when there is a problem, grow when its necessary, or just be told you are crushing it.

The work is usually fun, exciting, and often times, cutting edge. You feel like you make a difference, whatever its is you are working on.

Lot's of good modern benefits, DTO being the best. Real and usable DTO. Options to work remote are always available but you are encouraged to work in office for collaborative reasons. Everything seems to be at the discretion of your manager though, so some managers don't have any issue with remote work but the position itself will rarely be considered full-time remote.","We have potential for an annual purge every year... whether this is good or bad... it affects a company's reputation and makes local hiring more difficult. A potential hire will always think twice knowing that they could be laid off in a year.

Those familiar with cutting edge tech, know that it can be a pain in the butt to utilize. Company needs more tech cohesion and less tribal knowledge - this unfortunately means that West Coast Fanatics will need to relinquish a little tech direction control, i.e. let other facets take charge of some frameworks/things or co-develop.

That advice, I feel sounds solid, but there in lies the problem. There is a disparity in treatment between West Coast and Other / East Coast. Make no mistake, the high tech praise spotlight is spent 68% (or whatever % it is) of the time on San Mateo. Simple to say, it is just not equal to it's shine on the other branches, however, it really isn't the end of the world. There are incredibly capable people on the West Coast, it just feels sometimes that they forget the East Coast is just as capable. In a sense, you feel like the B-Team to their A-Team.

All that being said, the company's motto right now is ""One Fanatics"" so they are responding to feedback and criticisms internally - which in itself, feels good. Most companies probably would not care, right?"

•	Four managers in the last five years have held this position. 
•	The position they recruited and hired me for does not exist. My job description was changed after two months of employment. 
•	Members of the management team, including directors, warned me about other members of the leadership team; to “watch my back” or certain people would ruin my career if I wasn’t careful.  
•	I’ve been pulled aside privately several times and told not to share my ideas in front of senior leadership or contribute the conversation. Later, I was criticized for not speaking up in meetings.
•	A few directors have spent a lot of time with senior leadership trying to devalue me and damage my reputation.  I’ve learned to document everything and follow up in written form for proof.
•	One of my direct reports was coded incorrectly in the pay system and did not receive their merit increase. It took senior leadership and HR 2 months to fix it.
•	The culture is like a reality TV show. Drama is highly encouraged or created by upper leadership positions. It’s common to receive feedback from senior leadership about team members that is inaccurate, exaggerated or just not true. 
I noticed a lot of negative reviews mentioning a toxic work environment and I couldn’t agree more. ""Watch your back"" is the best advice I've received.  For career driven, intelligent professionals, I would suggest looking elsewhere. Coming to Fanatics is my biggest regret and a career setback."

Within a year they recruited fanatically and then had to let go most of these people putting many lives into turmoil without remorse.

- Communication across teams who are dependent on eachother is weak and usually saved for the week before giant projects are supposed to go live, and consist of decisions and questions that should have been broadcast months before.
- Management training is non existent and shows in the amount of micro managing and poor morale on the Jacksonville tech teams.

Strong Leadership: C-level & VP-level","They have some good mottoes, like every company in the valley does, but when executing, these mottoes is poorly understood. Here are some common ones:
""We move fast."" - They focus on finishing things right and no one will take a step back and think about what's the right thing to do.
""We are a lean team."" - If you did not bow at every word of your boss they will for sure get rid of you. Your own idea will definitely be discouraged.
""We care about business impact."" - in sacrifice of personal growth and long term investment in technology.
""We strive to meet the goals."" - because they are struggling to meet their goals so day-to-day operations will be tedious and you will soon have burnout.
""We are committed to deliverables."" - This means being mediocre is required and middle managers will create explosive hacky projects hard to maintain.
""We are one of the most innovative retail companies."" - Well, compared to Sears, and JCPenny.
""We are a tech company."" - Pure joke.

This company has everything a mediocre company has and everyone secretly knows something is wrong but chooses not to make ripples. It is certainly not for anyone who is ambitious and capable since you will soon feel discouraged, demeaned and unfulfilled.
When I join the company, I was so excited about working here and to be honest, there are still some great teams to work with, but I soon found the work philosophy in my team is poisonous and every time I tried argue what's good for the company, I died a little from inside. I eventually quit when I found my efforts to fix it was pointless."

The place started of great but has gone so down hill. Management are awful and make you feel on edge. They look at the floor when talking to you. The pay is shocking for the amount of work you are expected to do. Staff are bullied by managers. Never ever get any good feed back. Get no incentives.

You can walk around the office and find people watching youtube, looking at Facebook, online shopping while other people drown. Favoritism is shown towards certain people. Job descriptions aren't laid out. Buyers do the jobs of the planners 95% of the time, while they do whatever they want. Some bosses are micromanages, they will come over to your desk multiple times throughout the day to make sure you are there and working. This company is not loyal at all to employees who have worked there for a long time, if you aren't a favorite your time and hard work with the company won't matter. Upper management has no idea what is going on. Managers talk negatively about their employees, which leads into the office being like high school. People can get away with anything here. If you don't do something you are supposed to, you won't get in trouble. You won't see promotions or raises for working hard, but if you're good at sucking up you will see one.

There aren’t many layers of management which helps as far as escalating ideas or issues to people who can help. 

DTO does allow for flexibility to take days off.","Salaried/hourly employees are treated as a commodities and not people. It’s almost an unspoken rule for upper management to have been in the military and you will be treated as you’d expect to be by former military officers, as a grunt.

Turnover is very high making the lives of those left behind. Average tenure here has to be well under two years. Teams will have well over half of them turnover each year with upper management changes on top of that as well. Not uncommon to have several new managers throughout a year due to turnover.
   - In order to save money most of these opening will not be filled until Q4 if at all meaning your off peak that they advertise as a time to recoup and use your DTO Is spent doing 2-3 jobs at once making taking a vacation very tough. It’s a strategy they openly employ each year.

Training/Development. There is none. If you are coming from a different role/industry or trying to start your career do not expect much in the way of training. There’s no formal process in place and most people are too busy to help for long. This issue is made worse by how many people are hired during Q4 when current employees are at their busiest. Many people spend the first 3-4 months with little guidance or help and later on discover they have many blind spots in their skills as they were never properly shown the spectrum of their responsibilities. 

Work life balance. The flexibility provided by DTO is nice but work life balance is a struggle. While the employee handbook lists 6 holidays you will end up working most of them. Many people who were here when DTO was rolled out did not switch off PTO as they felt it was the only guarantee to time off at this company. I don’t know almost anyone who has taken off more than 5-10 days this year with DTO. Many places allow 14 days PTO anyway."

483,Fanatics,One of the best places I've ever worked,2017-10-03,5.0,Software Engineer,"Whenever people ask me what I like about working at Fanatics during interviews and such, I have a ready answer: the company cares about its people. For a short period I was unhappy with my role and the team I was on. I voiced that, and they found me something that was a better fit, rather than saying ""tough beans, do it or find something else."" Also, we have lots of employees in Florida. During the recent hurricanes, the message to those employees was ""take care of yourself and your family, and take care of work when those are done.""

I've never had another job where I really felt like my bosses have my best interest in mind. I feel like in general in the modern day you can't. I do here. They're looking for opportunities to help me grow and advance in my career.

From a tech perspective, it's an exciting time to be here as it feels like a startup, but we're not worried about where our next round of funding is coming from.

The work culture is very much ""get your work done."" The expectation is 40 hrs/wk, and I've literally had a manager say ""you should take more time off."" There's a real understanding here that people do their best work when they're not burnt out.

Finally, we have several layers of management, but it feels very flat. The CTO will book 1-1s with you if you need/want it. The culture, at least in the tech department, is great in that way.","On the flip side of that positive note, it sometimes feels like a startup combined with a bureaucracy. There are lots of tools we have to use because a higher up says so but those teams are agile and the tools are not fully developed, etc."

487,Fanatics,DO NOT WORK HERE!,2017-09-05,2.0,Information Technology,Fanatics Inc. as a COMPANY is amazing. The culture and casual dress code is comparable to Google and Facebook.,"The middle and upper management are driving this company in the ground, and that is not an understatement! The middle/upper management only hire and promote people that they know or that kiss their behind. They do not promote based off of skill, intelligence, and seniority. Thus, a lot of highly qualified people are doing menial tasks; and adversely there are a lot of inexperienced people in great positions. The tier-1 Enterprise experience looks very great on your resume. Therefore a lot of great workers use this company as the stepping-stone to bigger companies. 

If you are going to work here, MAKE SURE YOU DO YOUR OWN MARKET RESEARCH ON THE SALARY RANGES FOR YOUR AREA! THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. Fanatics will pimp you if they can. For example, a SharePoint administrator easily makes over $100,000. Fanatics will find someone with SharePoint administrator experience, hire them as a lower job title like ""System Analyst"" (which pays at most $65,000) and then pay them a lesser salary while getting them to do specialty work. They will not pay you what you are worth. The human resources know this, however they do nothing about it.

Another bad issue at this company is they hire smart, lazy people. Everyone wants to get paid top salaries for not doing their job. The middle management does not hold their departments accountable for their work. When an issue of severity arises everyone will point the finger at each other instead of taking ownership and do their job.

Fanatics constantly lies to their employees and doesn't value their people. They will promise you the world and under-deliver every time. Whatever they promise you in your interview, GET IT IN WRITING FROM THE MANAGER BEFORE YOU ACCEPT THE OFFER. Whatever duties they want you to perform get that in writing also. Fanatics will under hire people just to save money on the back end, and work their teams to death on a bare-bones budget. Get the highest salary you can fresh out the gate because you will more than likely not get a raise for years.

Fanatics has no direction. Every work day is chaos because the company has grown so fast in such a short time. So, expect the middle management to change direction and focus multiple times a month. 

If you are going to work here, please do your research. I would only recommend working here for no more than 5 years and then moving on to a more organized company. There are much better companies out there than the circus called Fanatics."

489,Fanatics,"Growing Fast, Improving Slow",2017-08-30,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"As the company continues acquisitions, it is growing by leaps and bounds. There is prestige in working for the Number One Fan Brand in the world. The owner and the CEO have made strategic moves that have increased the operational growth and added legitimate business lines aligned with the desires of its customer base. This company is 2nd to none in committing to high-quality and valuable merchandise while providing a stellar customer experience. Notable improvement in aligning key leaders to oversee business units and internal operations both sensibly and structurally bring hope for continued improvement and review of the needs of not just the customers, but those of us contributing to its growth and success. The VOA boards are great and provide a means for all employees to provide feedback to the leadership about all aspects of their work environment bar none.","Though the buzz word is transparency, there is a need for continued improvement in communication to every contributor and not just the privileged few.  All of the CEO communications should be shared with every person within the Fanatics umbrella and not just those with an internal email address. 
There seems to be little hope for internal advancement and no communication about internal opportunities unless you look on the website. My friend said they post them but not where I work. That said, even if you're interested in interviewing for an internal position, one must be gifted approval from their supervisor. If it's outside of the scope of what the employee was hired to do, the supervisor (and that supervisor is someone who didn't hire you and doesn't know your work history) has the ability to deny your opportunity to interview. This practice appears to promote favoritism. Why can't the recruiters look at applications and make determinations as if I'm trying to come in as a new hire? Additionally, as a company promoting a team environment under #OneFanatics, why is there such a lack of consistency in policy application? Location to location the rules lack consistency and are applied haphazardly. One place can have music and another can not?  
There is a high turnover rate amongst the leadership rung. When the job requirement says ""Adaptable to change"", it undoubtedly speaks to every employee in constant flux thanks to the philosophical and personal motivations of its leadership which is ever-changing. 
There is no tuition reimbursement program and only training for newly hired employees so they can do their jobs. They got more training than I did when I came in but that is a pro for us old-timers because they are coming in with some knowledge about how to accomplish their goals."

The culture is ""work hard play hard"" but that's seems to mean work 9 hour days and don't take a lunch or move from your desk ever. There is tons of work and it all seems last minute because no one actually works on a schedule. No room for growth unless you want to take another job and get relocated, but then I took this job and now I'm getting relocated.

Having three days off is a plus. Alot of room for growth.,Working every weekend.   The point system is the only flaw. If you have so  many points you do not get a raise. No air conditioning in the building. Humidity sometimes bring the tempature up to the early 100's. Human resources in this particular building needs improvements. They pick and choose favorites.

Sports industry
International company that continues to grow and flourish
Promoted quickly
Ability to create product that thousands will wear with pride","Average retail complaints, lots of misprioritization, more reactive than proactive
Outdated systems, inefficient processes.  Management insists that systems and processes aren't an issue, yet you spend half your time battling the restraints of the systems and processes.  The other half of your job is working to help make every other department's job easier.  
Instead of management being a coach and developing our ideas and trusting a buyer's instinct they dictate what and how much you should buy.
Paid way below industry standards.  Salary is as much as an assistant at other companies and less than a manager at JCREW at the outlet mall, yet you manage the entire e-com catalog for a major professional sports league.  On a positive note, you get to watch ESPN during the day.
Growth and career path are pretty stagnant once you reach Buyer/Planner level.
Hours range from 40 -?  You are expected to have e-mail on your phone and reply  on nights, early mornings and weekends.  Can you call it vacation if you have to pack your laptop?
Coworkers are passionate and enthusiastic about the sports and the apparel industry.  Secret opportunities and department culture causes them to be more of your competition than an actual teammate."

If you are looking to work for an exciting rapidly evolving company, where employees have a direct impact on the bottom line and overall company performance, I cannot recommend a better place.","Since the business is relatively young and growing so quickly, you won’t find the same systems and processes that you might at other organizations.

Unprofessional behavior by managers.
Power plays.
Job responsibilities are stripped after they are earned to get out of increasing your pay 
Unnecessary processes are changed on a weekly basis, delaying progress and you are at fault for not keeping up.
Managers can be vindictive and berating to employees.
You will be afraid to ask managers about what is going on in the company out of fear of losing your job.
You will be hired on as seasonal and kept that way for at least a year so they can get out of paying you for benefits and Paid time off. Oh, and then you may get let go and called back months later to return to a fresh new hell.
Favoritism is rampant.
You are policed even on your breaks by circling managers.
Micromanaged and knit picked to no end.
Yearly and Quarterly evaluations are a farce if and when they do happen.
You will in no way be properly compensated compared to others in the rest of the work force.
There is vague and limited communication from upper management, asking too many questions can lead to negative feed back and possibly loss of employment."

I have had to train a full-time lead both years to take over my job. No one in upper management has the time of day to talk with you about your concerns.

I absolutely love it! The benefits are employee focused to give us the best benefits possible; one of the big draws for me was the pregnancy/disability and baby bonding benefit. The company is very pro work/life balance, but to be honest in working here you don't feel tired at the end of the day. It's more of a feeling of accomplishment and team unity. Personally speaking my manager is wonderful; she's focused on my job and more specifically my tasks/projects. Unlike prior managers I've had, she's the right balance of personable and job focused. Coming from other companies in the Bay Area that had a very low PTO accrual for newly hired employees, I was very impressed with the PTO accrual. Compensation is more than fair and considerate, which is why Fanatics has more than earned my commitment and loyalty for a lifetime.","If you understand the concept that 'no job is perfect' and that 'if you find a job you love you'll never work a day in your life' there simply are no cons at Fanatics, just opportunities and people who are open to listening and open to change which is a win-win."

556,Fanatics,Great company to learn and grow,2016-08-24,4.0,,"I have been working at Fanatics for close to a year.

1. Process:  The objective of having a “Process” is to operate things in a smooth and streamlined manner. I have witnessed that in many companies, process ends up becoming a hindrance in achieving the goals, leading to decrease in productivity. However, Fanatics stands out by having processes that are simple, straight and streamlined. 

2. Culture: The culture here is pretty cool. We get the right amount of workload which helps maintain a good work-life balance. Fanatics has teams built with the right set of attitude, which has been a challenge in many other companies. People whom I have met here are fun to work with, at the same time, have been very supportive in all the endeavors that we undertake. 

3. Learning: There is no dearth for learning at Fanatics. Use of many open source tools have pretty much enhanced my technical skill set. The challenges we are trying to solve are constantly widening my views on the business aspect. Given the spectrum of expertise here, I am learning the best practices of developing and delivering software solutions to address the market needs. I have been able to handle complex challenges effectively, with the support rendered by my peers. 

Overall, this is a great company to learn and grow, especially for fresh grads willing to improve their technical skill set.",I do not see any cons as of now. The company is constantly working on its policies/benefits towards betterment of the employees.

570,Fanatics,Slow Changes Toward Improvement...patience,2016-07-06,3.0,Operations,"Casual dress code, Employee appreciation events: birthday, holidays, Open communication welcomed with whiteboards and pep rallies, Semi-annual pay increases for Level 1 = $1/year, Competitive benefits (medical/dental...etc), Communication seems to be better, FAN is great if you can be a part of that,  HR is better than ever, Support of volunteerism even if it's only the stuff HR or whoever chooses the cause is worthy","Points policy is inconsistent (I know people who work here were in a car wreck together and their points were excused but I'm stuck behind a wreck that's even on the news and my point isn't?)
No documented processes, Favoritism, Political and hard to communicate because HR is married to supervisors,  If you're not 'zon you will be gone, the feeling that we should grin and bare it even though we try to talk about our concerns but no one wants to do that because some who have power will just hold it against you anyway, employee handbook is wrong because we have to use PTO for holidays and the Ops Admins said that we have a different policy here but we haven't seen it in writing so we'll get pointed and not get paid for holidays even though it says we get the holiday and don't have to use PTO, not sure how I can move up because no one tells me"
571,Fanatics,The New Fanatics,2016-07-05,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The facts are, you can't please all the people all the time, and that there will always be specific cases where individual managers or employees aren't a great fit with the current culture. Read through the reviews of the company and you'll see both that the company used to be great and no longer is, and that the company used to be a disaster and is now on the path to being great. Perspective and fit matter. 

I fall into the camp that feels that the company is on the path to greatness. That's not to suggest there aren't big challenges, because there are. But the fundamental culture is shifting to one in which employees are respected, challenged, and empowered; planning goes beyond the next quarter; leadership sets a high bar; and creating a great place to work is a priority. 

Pros:
Passionate, experienced leadership team, focused on vision and culture
Openness to new ideas
Transparent with information
Building technology for the future while delivering current growth
High hiring bar
Dress code and snacks don't make this list -- if that's what you care most about, this may not be the company for you","Not enough dev bandwidth for ambitious agendas (definitely not unique)

580,Fanatics,Huge Potential- equally huge failure... repeatedly.,2016-04-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sports, sports gear, exciting playoff tracking, exciting growth opportunity (for the company anyway...)... 

Non-traditional retailer.","Work-Life balance is a joke, you will be asked to dig deeper and work harder and smarter when the reality is, the work you will end up doing should be split easily between you and likely 2 more people that will probably not be hired.

Non-traditional retailer- while it is also a plus bc you aren't constrained... it's also a huge negative because no one follows any kind of process that is consistent and will push the vendors/supply chain to provide better product, on time, that is the caliber of what fans want.

The disconnect between the corporate senior leadership teams, and the operations teams is an every widening gap that has become nasty and combative and has created a hostile work environment across divisions and throughout multiple Fanatics offices, warehouses and production facilities.  

The problems are pervasive and turnover will continue to be an issue as employees slowly but surely reach burnout and determine that risking homelessness and being unemployed is a better option than continuing to go to work only to feel unfulfilled, angry, stressed, degraded, demeaned and unappreciated."

584,Fanatics,What was once a place for a career is now just a stop over,2016-03-20,2.0,,"Growth potential for the company, due to the current deals they are inking with the leagues and pro teams, long term contracts (10+ years) ensures a continued steady revenue stream, which currently is $1B+. Flex hours, casual dress, and working in the sports world are nice. But thats where the pros stop.","Management, never available and never there for you. They are also nearly all in San Francisco, which is where the company sees their future, not Jacksonville. Aside from contracting most of the work out, they poach from eBay and Amazon. All new C-level members, who have pushed out the people under the original CEO, have brought in their own people. Which leaves no room for growth. They are trying to get the company ready to go public (main reason why all the new C-level people are here, cash out potential) so it's all about EBITA, so they are crunching everywhere...except for the $0.5M Super Bowl party the execs threw (employees not invited), they even had Wiz Khalifa performed."
585,Fanatics,Flavor of the day,2016-03-20,1.0,Account Manager,"Dress code, that's it.",Horrible management with 2 sets of rules. One for those they like and for those they don't. Problem is the have lost some very loyal associates.
586,Fanatics,"Constant chaos, major gaps in management, not true to their values",2016-03-15,2.0,SharePoint Architect,"The dress code is the biggest pro to working for Fanatics as you will notice from the many other reviews that mention it.  It is Google casual meaning that you can wear shorts and t-shirts.

If you are excited to hear about the CEO and other executives getting to hang out with professional athletes, then this company is for you.  The executives also occasionally get custom jerseys made for them, which is exciting as well.  When they are feeling very charitable, they give employees the cheapest shirts with the company brand on them.  You do, however, get an opportunity to buy higher quality shirts with the company logo.

There is a 30% discount on all merchandise, which is cool.","Unless you are chosen by the San Francisco management to work on new technology and ideas, there is no career path.  There is no training available for those that genuinely want to be a part of it.  There is no mentoring path.

The company lists as one of its values ""Missionaries not Mercenaries"", yet they hire contractors and temps just like any other company.  They do not reward loyalty.  They do not reward those that do everything they are asked to do.

The talk about One Team, yet the technology team operates with an entirely different set of collaboration tools than what is available to the rest of the company and they do not support the rest of the company when it comes to creating new solutions.  There is a growing disconnect between tech and the rest of the business and the same is happening between their Jacksonville and San Francisco offices.

There are massive gaps in leadership positions throughout the company.  This causes in gaps in communication of goals, priorities, and expectations.  It also leads to a lack of expertise in many different areas as the managers that are there don't have time to fill all of the open positions that exist.

In the three years I was with the company, I did not hear one single communication from the owner of the company.  The company exists solely to make him money and as far as the employees know, he takes no part or care in it.  It used to be a family owned business, but now it is simply a Silicon Valley start up that is located in Jacksonville.

The executives are mostly located in San Francisco and have no care for the city of Jacksonville.  They take no effort, as far as I could tell, in getting to know Jacksonville or its culture.  We get to hear about the various reasons that San Francisco is better than Jacksonville - apparently kale shakes are all the rave out there.

This doesn't belong as a pro or a con, but if you are a Microsoft engineer, Fanatics is moving away from all MS technology.

I was very excited to stay with the company and tried to do everything I could to be a part of the future.  I bought into the missionary culture and even passed up a couple of decent opportunities  elsewhere in order to try to give management time to calm the chaos and give me an opportunity doing something good for the company.  I wound up railroaded into work I did not want to do permanently and had no team to work with and was never given any assurance of a better future.  I finally decided not to pass up an opportunity that was thrown at me and I have left.

One final note.  EBITA.  It is the constant goal of the company at this point, which means they are always looking for ways to cut operational expenses.  That usually means operating with leaner teams.  There is no guarantee of stability at Fanatics.  Don't be a missionary."

I've seen a lot of dirty moves made in this company and that's where the no loyalty comes from. Once the Amazon people got here, they ran out pretty much everyone who had been here 5-10 even 15 years. If you didn't get ran out... then you got demoted from a manager to a team lead."

• Company revolves around the world of sports.

• Free bagels on Fridays, semi-frequent team outings, and catered lunch on Wednesdays to 'high-performing' (revenue) departments.

• It is the largest eCommerce company located in Jacksonville, FL, so comparatively, it's great place to work.

• If you have a high tolerance for passive-aggressive behavior, it's a great place to work and build a career.","• Uninspiring low salary, especially compared to industry averages. I now earn $17k more annually for the same job type, but with an exponentially smaller (manageable) portfolio of clients.

• Passive aggressive work-environment where chaos is the norm. The extremely fast-paced environment is not a symptom of the ""sports world"" but rather, it is the result of inexperienced management and immature policy.

• Horrible communication skills, despite having state of the art communication tools at disposal.

• Given incorrect job title that did not reflect my responsibility, ability, or workload compared to industry standards.

• HR repeatedly spelled my name wrong, even on my notice of termination. My badge repeatedly had the wrong job title/department printed on it.

• The title 'Manager' or 'Lead' is given out effortlessly to people that don't have any experience or skill in managing people. Just because you do well at your job or your department is meeting it's goals, doesn't mean you are qualified to be a manager or director.

• Most management below the executive team (middle management) lacks any prior experience managing. Instead of coaching employees for improvement, management resorts to formally writing up, making false accusations out of defense, or firing for personal conflicts or minor disagreements.

• Minimal, haphazard, unorganized training in entry level position. Forced to spend personal, unpaid time to learn several essential job functions.

• Workplace bullying, berating, belittling, alienation, and retaliation due to any disagreement with management is tolerated. HR continually sides with management, despite written proof of false allegations or proof of wrong doing.

• Lacking in any management training programs or code of conduct compliance training for those in positions of power.

• Lacking drug testing for employment, which allows for drug users to work at Fanatics. 

• Witnessed several managers smelling of alcohol on the job and incidents of employees appearing to be under the influence, which is a symptom of not requiring drug testing for employment.

• Most managers/directors suffer from what is known as 'bias blind spot.' They conveniently have the ability to spot  mistakes in others, especially when their own reputation is on the line, but lack the ability to spot mistakes of their own making.

• Cronyism, especially in middle management and employees that have been with the company since it was Football Fanatics.

• No positive feedback from manager or director, except for the first few weeks on the job, despite our department thriving. 

• In my first week at Fanatics, I witnessed a manager with pornography on his computer. Others witnessed it too and we complained about it to my director at the time. The manager was not even written up for it and he is still employed in the same position.

• I had evidence that one of my old managers was working directly with a key competitor, supplying assets/images for their website. When I presented the evidence to HR, it was ignored. The product images are still on the competitor's website and the manager is still working at Fanatics.

• Within a week of being written up for 'performance issues' I was fired. I was given no warning prior to my write up, had no clue I was being vetted for performance issues, and was not under the impression I was going to be fired. I supplied factual evidence that the performance issues were false, but the evidence was ignored. My manager lied to HR, claiming I did not report my work as asked and that I didn't make improvements.

• PTO was taken away, despite working from home on several occasions.

• I was not reimbursed for travel expenses I incurred for a business trip."

Uncompetitive pay in the field. Definite favoritism for certain employees. Impossible to move up unless you are a favorite. If you interview for different positions they don't contact you if you don't get the job. Say they have an open door policy but it's more like an open door to not be employed here. It takes way to long to get a yearly review and after that it takes months to get your raise. Raises are kept secret from you until you get your check, they don't even give you a ballpark estimate. There is a serious lack of communication throughout the company. Have a habit of hiring people who have no idea how to use Photoshop for editing images. Some managers are passive aggressive and rude. We are promised bonuses for making goal during peak but they don't say exactly what number we have to meet and therefore don't get the bonus. Yet management get bonuses for us meeting peak but we get a t-shirt. There is a drastic difference in how other departments are treated and us. Other departments actually get bonuses and free lunches every Wednesday that they can order off a menus while we occasionally get food that makes your stomach feel like lead and gives you serious heartburn. This department has the lowest allotted budget yet managers and team leads get flown frequently to different states with room and board paid for. Managers have little no experience with the programs used and have no experience managing any number of people. Computers and tools are not on par with the programs we run 24/7 on them and keep crashing breaking and all around prevent us from being able to do our job. They want you to come in even if there's hurricanes and flooding or smoke from fires that infiltrates the buildings.  IT is treated like we are or people are hired who don't know how to fix problems or our computer problems are ignored like fixing Photoshop, RAM etc. Oh yes and for a while there wasn't sure my manager was and who I reported to even if they weren't here to begin with. After exceeding expectations and meeting buyers demands time and time again didn't even get a dollar raise.

A lot of people in the comments below say that working in sports is a pro, but working here is more like working in an online retail operation that happens to sell sports merchandise. May be a beneficial environment to learn in if you're wanting to get into e-commerce.

- The Fort Lauderdale and San Francisco offices are nice

- Some years you receive an annual bonus","- Low salary (unless you're an exec)

- Pretty weak benefits and a poor HR team

- High burn out rates. Holiday shopping season is huge for the business, so you'll be working around the clock during November and December. Plus, you'll be working during every semi major sporting event. Even in off-peak season, the business is viewed through a very short-term lens and is managed as if in crisis mode.

- Extremely difficult to get promoted. The company prefers to hire VP's and managers from outside rather than promote from within. If you previously worked at eBay, you're golden, but otherwise, career development is minimal.

- It's less about sports than you think. If you're considering joining the company because you will get to ""work in sports,"" be aware that you will be working in online retail first and foremost.

- The company is siloed. Most everyone guards information from one another. It gets to be exhausting treating everything like a secret. Communication is usually terrible.

- Nobody knows who Fanatics is, so when you try to move on it's tough selling yourself to employers who have never heard of Fanatics.

- Beware the recent good reviews. I know firsthand many have been written to gloss up the company's ratings by managers desperate to attract talent."

664,Fanatics,Great environment to learn and grow professionally,2015-03-09,4.0,Marketing Manager,"PEOPLE and CULTURE
I worked with many intelligent and passionate people. There is never a dull moment when you combine sports and e-commerce. The fast-paced environment presents many opportunities to learn and exercise new skills. Many opportunities present themselves to peak performers with a high degree of emotional intelligence. Being proactive, working well with others, and over-delivering on expected results is key to succeeding. (If you have a tendency to feel entitled regardless of your contributions, this is not the place for you.) Transparency is important and good communication is emphasized.

TIME-OFF and WORKING REMOTELY
There is flexibility with individual schedules. As long as you're responsible for your output and results. You can usually work remotely when necessary, as long as you do not abuse the privilege. With the exception of certain times of the year (i.e. retail peak/holiday season), taking time off is never discouraged. Just make sure you are sensitive to possible conflicts and provide adequate notice in advance. (* Please note that I worked in the Marketing Department. Other areas of the business may have different requirements and expectations are always subject to change.)

BENEFITS
As you would expect from any established business...medical, vision, dental. 401k is also available and (at the time of this writing) company matching. Other benefits such as term-life, short term disability, etc. are available should you opt in for those.

OTHER PERKS
With major offices in San Francisco, Conshohocken (PA) and Jacksonville (FL), you may have the chance to travel occasionally. Each office has it's own culture, but in general, there are regular team-building outings and events across the organization. On Friday mornings in the Jacksonville office, bagels were always brought in from Panera.","A lot of significant change over the past few years. Integration of existing teams and corporate restructuring can be very challenging for anyone not open to constant change and making measurable contributions to improving operations and performance.

CULTURE
Varies from department to department. If this is important to you, use the interview process to get a feel for the culture of your specific department and its management. Due to the nature of the industry and the vertical, it can be easy to always be ""plugged in"". This is not an expectation so it's on you to maintain a good balance."

They found themselves in managerial roles because the company grew too soon and promoted people to positions based on years served.

There are some dynamic, down to earth, and professional people that work there. Location was NOT bad either commute was decent.","There is SIMPLY NO TRUST there @ all.  They simply DO NOT appreciate their employees in IT. Being that this is an eCommerce company its a 24/7 venture; you will spend even your days off working and NOT enjoying the Work/Home balance.  Egomaniacs, narcissistic, and just plain OLD JERKS are some of the folks in IT. NOT everyone is/was bad just the ones who simply made coming to work a struggle and my craft NOT fun anymore. To anyone looking for work @ Fanatics... research and ask about the turnover rate which is HIGH and its simple that they run this ship like close minded individuals and they don't value the input and voice of the employee.  The culprits of this behavior and lack of professionalism are the SEASONED employees who have been there a LONG time; they  are CANCERS that have Metastasized and if Upper Management wakes up and CLEANS house then the mentality will change and it can become a great environment to work.  Heed this WARNING and BEWARE... Fanatics is NOT who they say they ARE.
NO ADVANCE is there EITHER!!!! I left the company on MY OWN TERMS and have NOT looked back!"
690,Fanatics,Life sentence.,2014-06-23,1.0,Marketing,Just about the only positive about working here is the 30% discount and maybe the relaxed dress code. And I have a short commute.,"There is no trust here. Management does not seek the opinion of lower level workers. Putting in extra hours is required, but going above and beyond - thinking for yourself to improve your own performance and make a difference for the company - is either shrugged off or outright discouraged.

There is no opportunity to grow professionally, so the longer one stays with Fanatics, the harder it becomes to procure employment elsewhere. All I've done for four years is what I'm told. This is the only company I've ever worked for that sees value in that."

Just in time, as I've worked my butt off for over a decade to get where I'm at - square one. There's a huge blemish on my resume now, that I can't hide. 70 hour workweeks will net you a check similar to the ones you're used to. The amount of physical locations the company  has is a clear indication of the cohesiveness. They went out of their wait to show you everything you need to know! You just won't see it right away - it'll likely have a team logo on it. Management is absolutely superb at demonstrating their how incompetent they are. These are the most inept, floudering group of inbiciles I've ever come across.

If selling sports merchandise wasn't so lucrative, they'd have an amazing opportunity doing a reality show. No one would believe that this is a real functional company.","Fanatics, as a whole, is the most deceptive, abusive company I have ever worked for. The pay scale across the board is ridiculously low, unless you're in management. Customer service leads make more than I.T. leads, for example. Management has absolutely no idea what they are doing with anything. Every project that is attempted looks like a circus performed by the mentally challenged. No direction, no accountability, and absolutely no integrity. The lack of respect from anyone is this company runs deep. It shows, and has many examples in every department, and every level. They treat everyone as disposable, and those that have a little bit of clout, participate in a wang measuring contest daily. Watch out, or you'll quickly find yourself standing in the middle holding the ruler.

I could go on, but to be honest, it's exhausting. See for yourself if you'd like, but please have a backup plan."

Discount. 
Laid-back, but hard-working office environment","Of course, the pay isn't the greatest and the nights and weekend hours are long - but that is expected in the sports-related business and does not bother me at all. 

The only real con of this place is the room for advancement. Without a doubt, being promoted is definitely performance-based in certain departments but not in Marketing. It's a joke. Does not matter how good of a job you do or how bad of an employee you are, if you've been working in marketing for a few years, you'll be ""promoted"" just with everyone else who started at the same time as you. And this isn't a secret at all. Every employee in the department knows this. You're screwing over the employees who actually go above and beyond.

Why should I work hard if I'm not being rewarded for it? You're telling me the guy who watches movies on netflix all day long is getting promoted at the same time as me? This is the same guy who constantly comes in late and takes 2 hours lunch breaks. He does the bare minimum, but still gets a promotion. 

Great job taking care of the people who really care about growing the business!"

People do not even understand what they are supposed to even be doing in their positions.  Upper management is rude, career derailing, and unappreciative of the hard work you will put into your job at any time.  A work/life balance you want, this place is absolutely not build for it.  They will put you on a very low salary then have you work 60 or 70 hour work weeks with no weekends or a day after you travel off.  You really end up making like nine bucks an hour and it is really unprofessional how they set their pay structure up at this company.

Salaries differ dramatically and do not seem to be linked to performance in any way, but rather random selection. Employees can forget about paid time off and sick days, as they likely wont happen. The company is taking on too much, trying to create a monopoly where (it is being proven) that there shouldn't be one. This is forcing management to be more concerned with numbers and goals rather than employee well-being. The company also fails to utilize recent technologies such as computers.
