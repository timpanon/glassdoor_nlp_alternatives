Base them more on what the customer requires of the driver. We spend as much as an hour waiting to pick up products or shopping for the customer. Recently I took a delivery that required me to shop for them. This involved me waiting over a half hour for the goods to be delivered to me after personally placing the order for them and then drove a 20 mile round trip to a business in rush hour to deliver to the patron and they only tipped $4.00.

Then you lose early access to select your hours for the next week. If a favor has you running around for an hour and the customer decides to tip the minimum, you only get 4.10 for the whole thing. Or if you're running around and then they cancel due to lack or items or they change their mind, you dont get paid for the effort or trip. At all.

87,Favor,Not the place to climb the corporate ladder,2020-02-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The new HQ in Austin is very much a ""buzz-worthy"" office. 
- HEB stocks the kitchen. 
- There's plenty of good snacks and lunch provided some days. 
- HEB offers in-store discounts.","- The company has grown massively over the years and has lost most of it's ""start-up"" environment. Post HEB acquisition, many outside leaders were hired. The company tries to encourage the old start up culture, however the new hires are much older, more experienced and come from more corporate backgrounds. The new Favor hires, along with a shared office with HEB tech employees has led to mostly a corporate environment. 

- The amount of work volume is very high, and most roles are extremely demanding. The company pays at ""market rate"", however, the demand and expectations are much higher than those with similar titles else where - AKA the stress makes the compensation very much mediocre. The company continues to receive and address feedback about low pay but has never taken any action. 

- In addition to an increasingly corporate environment and disheartening compensation, the company is internally infamous for lacking in promotions. If you're looking at a role in support, do not expect to move out of support - it's nearly impossible. 

- The company very obviously plays favorites. It's very clear that you must be in the ""cool clique"" to get treated fairly. 

- Parking is horrendous. 


Overall: Great place to work if you're looking for employment in a tech environment in Austin. Not the place to coast on an easy-going role with fair pay. If you're looking to gain experience and climb the corporate ladder, please do not waste your time even looking at positions with Favor."

89,Favor,Kind of a joke.,2020-02-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Beautiful office, tons of food, decent perks, social events (if you like drinking).","This place is growing more delusional by the day. Strategy feels very disorganized and management turmoil is out in the open. The business is underperforming and it turns out that on-demand delivery is a broken, unethical business. Who knew! With competitors getting billions in funding, it's hard to believe that Favor can do anything to catch up - we pay drivers less, are understaffed in key areas, and support is in shambles. LOTS of turnover (voluntary and terminations), including at the leadership level...departures aren't announced and feel swept under the rug. Favoritism (no pun intended) runs rampant and the patriarchy is alive and well. If you're in, you're in. If you're not, go find another job. ""Culture,"" socialization, and team building are hugely based on alcohol consumption. There is no growth framework and no structured potential for earnings increases unless you're one of the lucky few. They'll expect you to be a martyr, ""fight like hell,"" and be available 24/7, but unless you're one of the fortunate ones, it's going to get you nowhere. Lots of empty promises and no guarantees. HR is really ineffective. The few people in place are very inexperienced and are too buddy-buddy with managers. It's hard to trust their motives and things just don't change. Don't get distracted by the beautiful office and partnership with H-E-B. This place is overcompensating, HARD."

96,Favor,Detailed Perspective from a Software Eng,2019-08-31,5.0,Software Engineer,"Post HEB-acquisition, Favor has been taking off like a rocket, and in my view, the fears of a corporate take over have been pretty unfounded. We now share a space with the HEB digital team in a really state-of-the-art tech hub.

You get great amenities (e.g. catered food everyday except Wednesdays). There are Friday beer events and workplace socials that a lot of people actually go to. Work environment is fantastic, and I personally know many engineers who worked their way into the team through hard work (e.g. started out as support and through a few role changes ended up in engineering); So, Favor is very conducive to horizontal and vertical career mobility from everything I've seen (and glancing at the Favors career page, it seems like they make a big point of this, but it really is true). In terms of the tech, the consumer clients (e.g. mobile and web apps) are built with modern stacks. Back-end is mostly in PHP (yuck, you can blame it on a decision made MANY years ago), but besides that we have a microservices architecture and development pipeline that are modern.

Favor makes a big deal about their values - and we have favor salutes, which basically means you can nominate some1 who you believes embodies a core value. And many of these nominees are recognized at the town halls and win prizes (yes, yes it is VERY gamified, but I honestly love it).","From a broader perspective, the vast majority of companies have problems focusing (actually Favor famously had to pull out of every state except of Texas many years back). Favor doesn't have that problem anymore, and has a rare sense of focus. But the thing is that Favor will likely ONLY be in Texas...well...maybe forever? From a tech company perspective, having only 1 market (albeit a BIG one) in our roadmap feels rather demoralizing?

Furthermore, while we are growing like crazy, it almost goes without saying we are in a VERY competitive space against Doordash and Uber Eats. They have MASSIVE, MASSIVE advantages of economies of scale and name recognition that a regional company like Favor doesn't have. Also, we are only to get diminishing returns as we start to 'saturate' Texas, even in the best-case scenario. While the short and medium term outlooks are bright, I'm not so sure about the long-term.

99,Favor,Extra or Supplemental Income,2019-04-27,3.0,Contractor/Delivery Driver,"Pros
Pick your hours you want to work
Cancel shift anytime
Easy way to make extra cash, not recommended as a full time job
Job is easy and should be fun if you're doing it right. 
Majority of customers tip well in my area. 

You make your money mainly from tips
You can have Favor reassigned if it is too far from you or a customer that you prefer not to work with again. 
You do receive a rating percentage when you reject Favors but saving gas and not driving across town is more important for me than a rating.

You do not have to wear the Favor Shirt, which can be a good thing because some food establishments workers do not like Favor because we are not allowed to tip the servers and this will affect how they treat you and how fast they prepare your food.

If you cancel your shift within 24 hours, you do not lose access to early scheduling. Scheduling hours fills up fast for guaranteed pay of $9 an hr. 

The amount you make in an hour depends on how many Favors you complete or on how much the customer tips you.

One you get a great routine going and learn all the tricks for a successful delivery. It's a great way to make extra money.","Cons
Some customers don't respond in a timely matter or at all and it's a challenge when trying to place their order.

Some customers will tip you only $2.0 and you basically just worked for free after you minus gas, mileage,  and your time. I always take note and do not deliver to that customer again. 

You pay for your own gas and not reimbursed for mileage. 

Customers are allowed to rate you. This hasn't been a problem for me but if you pick up the order from another driver and it's late, you get the bad rating,  not cool or fair. Favor needs to work on this format.

You are basically a contractor that work with Favor,  not an employee. You are responsible for 99 percent of everything, except paying for the order. Favor provides a company credit card.

You receive a 1099 during tax season. You will receive a form stating that you made all this money from Favor because the 1099 includes the cost of each Favor the customer paid and was delivered by you and not what you actually made for the day. 
This will influxuate your income substantially. You have to keep track of all your expenses so you don't end of owing on your taxes but you can write off what it cost you to deliver for Favor.
Example: I made $10, 000 working part time for Favor but received tax form stating I made $28, 000."

103,Favor,Fantastic company and engineering environment,2019-01-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've greatly enjoyed my time so far at Favor. The people and culture are genuinely great and do not come across as contrived. We're growing fast so it's a good mix of mature startup and SMB. The engineers as well as designers, product, and other technical people are all top notch. There's also a strong culture of encouraging personal growth and even lateral job movement. Despite the growth, the company is still very flat and there's little to no red tape. I greatly enjoy coming in to work every day due to my coworkers, leadership, and the projects I'm working on. Also, free food and Favors! Leadership does a good job of making sure everyone understands what we're doing as a company and why. Lots of planned social events. Cool big company perks like HEB partner benefits. Compensation is more than fair. Probably my favorite job I've ever had.

If you're deciding to interview or accept an offer here, I'd note that a lot of the more mixed reviews on Glassdoor are coming from contract runners (a la Uber drivers) who have a different view than a full-time employee.","Post-acquisition so there's no equity if you come on-board now. 401K match could be better, but there's a long  vesting HEB stock bonus that makes up for it if you plan on being at Favor for the long haul. Typical growing pains in terms of cramped office space, but we're moving this year. If you're a ladder climber, we're still too small to really have a ladder to climb. Great product and engineering, but we're not really saving lives or changing the world if that matters to you. No tuition reimbursement (rumored to be coming) and no other fringe benefits like donation matching or formal education budget."

115,Favor,Bike Zone Waste of Time & Energy,2018-07-17,1.0,Server/Bartender,Exercise in 100 degree weather,"Ultimately, the bike zone seems like a good idea. It's a small area where the most you might bike is three miles, in one direction. My average delivery time was about 34 minutes. However, I can't ever get on the schedule for that $9 minimum guarantee even when I log in at the exact moment the new schedule is released. So I'm on call a lot of time. I have stayed under the shade of a tree in a hot zone (where there are supposedly more Favors) for over an hour without anything but two favors that were cancelled immediately when they were sent to me. I have been given pizza orders. I have been assigned Favors where I have to bike two miles away, then two miles in another direction. I always accept them because the favors are really that sporadic. I'm not the fastest cyclist out there, but I go pretty fast. Even with communicating every step along the way to my clients, as well as adding various emojis and slang so that the millennials might understand, I averaged less than $6 an hour (roughly 6 favors per a 4 hour shift). From the amount of physical effort it takes to bike 4 hours in these hot summer temperatures, earning $20-$22 is simply not worth it. If you're looking for a part time job, try a temp agency or restaurant food runner/busser/expo that at least pays minimum wage inside an air conditioned building."

126,Favor,Great if you’re looking to be your own boss,2018-03-27,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Favor offers a flexible schedule and the ability to be your own “boss.” There’s no micromanagement at all. I’ve discovered new restaurants and new routes along the city as I ran favors. You get to choose your own schedule and work as little or as much as you want.,"I wouldn’t necessarily say this is a con, but there is a ton of driving involved. You don’t really realize the amount of driving you will do until you’re actually running favors.

It is extremely difficult to get on the schedule if you don’t have early access. Now I don’t even bother to try. I just run on demand. I have a 4.98 star rating and cant get on the schedule bc it’s full the next minute it comes out.

You have to accumulate a lot of hours to turn a profit after factoring gas, time and vehicle maintenance.

Sometimes orders can be vague and customers literally expect you to read their mind. So you end up asking a lot of questions. It really helps if you have previous experience as a server or some other customer based industry. Then you’ll know the right questions to ask, such as “how would you like your burger cooked?” Or “corn or flour tortillas?” 

It can be a challenge running favors downtown where parking is limited. I’ve found myself walking several blocks from parking to the destination to avoid pricy garage parking. This increases the favor run time and I’m rushing to keep the food from getting cold.

I get a cold “vibe” from some restaurant employees because they’re familiar with Favor and know they won’t recieve a tip from us/the Favor customer. I’ve pulled money out of my own pocket to tip on large orders because I’ve felt so bad leaving nothing on the tip knowing they took the time to gather the order correctly. 

Sometimes I’ve ran favors across town, just to recieve a $2.00 tip and $2.10 delivery fee. I feel like the minimum tip should be increased on favors that require the runner to drive across town from the restaurant to their home/business.

Because you are technically an “independent contractor.” You are not offered health insurance or any other type of benefits."

If someone think that flexibility is a pros?
But how about guarantes?
Yeah there are shifts but only couple of hours per day like 6, earning 9$per hour, making trips and so much effort that even clerk in heb earns the same sitting for the whole day.
And there is no glory after all, delivery person is just lowest cast, be servant or be damned.","- only working with shifts can guarantee 9$/h and this is real income

Runners are often looked down upon at restaurants because we can't tip the people serving our customers. In addition, the orders from customers are often vague, and you're left having to ask several questions on their preferences, and I often have instances where they are slow to answer. This serves a challenge when I'm at a busy restaurant with a line out the door behind me. Hours can also be hard to claim in smaller towns like San Marcos, because there's such a large amount of runners. It can also be tricky when you have little information about the restaurant, sometimes I may get an order during rush hour downtown, and I'm stuck spending extra time searching for parking, and causing it to take a much longer time."

If you're one of the people who is good at your job you'll be expected to carry others on your back. I was constantly told that I couldn't use my accrued time-off due to the fact that my department was constantly understaffed (even though others used theirs - I'm not even sure that that's legal???). Never got to use the accrued time, they refused to pay it out once I resigned. Terrible experience, mid-level management is a joke and senior managers are un-bothered and constantly out of the office, on vacation, or in the office playing drinking games and ignoring everyone else. Don't expect a promotion unless you are actively brown nosing. If you're actually talented/smart don't waste your time. If you love cat GIFs, avoiding urgent matters, and being a social justice warrior while on the clock this might be the place for you.

Looked like lots of potential but.......difficult to log hours due to too many runners logging on-too many calls for deliveries coming all at once from different parts of town-no easy way to skip an order-requires a text to support, often when on the way to another delivery, which requires pulling over, once you get that order reassigned, another one comes two seconds later, then another and another till you finally accept one-bad ratings due to the fact that you have to wait in line in some restaurants for half an hour to place an order and even if they take the order over the phone, you are often waiting half an hour or more, then have to drive across town to deliver, while simultaneously stopping to text support to reassign new orders till you finally take one that is across town, while you are still delivering the first order, then wait in line, wait for food, start delivery, etc., which results in poor tips and bad ratings so quite often, one delivery can take an hour or more and you will get the $2.10 rate and minimum $2.00 tip for a total of $4.10 for an hours worth of work. No consideration for miles travelled.   Other delivery jobs that use phone apps use the gps to tell where you are and assign you orders in the same area with a skip button of you can't get to them in time and the orders are usually ready when you get there, no waiting and you get paid by the mile so some deliveries pay as much as $7 to $14 and take no longer than twenty minutes to pick up and deliver and then you also get a tip but with Favor, you are bouncing from one of town to the other, while stopping every two minutes to either text support or place a phone order for the new delivery and texting the customer to let them know you will be on your way soon.  Little do they know that you will be finishing up the order you are on now and won't even get to their restaurant for twenty minutes and then you have to wait in line, order, etc.  A lot of work for little return in money."

You can even get started that same day. It's a fairly simply process, pretty much, picking up goods and delivering them. Application works great when you aren't ""DIS-FAVOR"", continue reading for more details.","I started as a runner and eventually ended up as a runner support representative. As part of the runner support team, it was hard dealing with runners who where consistently late starting their shifts and even some who would plain out not report to their scheduled shifts, which runners have total control of. Instead of using a write-up system, like you normally would find in similar organizations, to proactively deal with this type of counter productive behaviors, we took it to another level. As a prior runner support team member I  had the abilities to make any runner's life a LIVING HELL. The runners support team has access on the back end to manipulate many of the great features the application provides to runners to help them make money by doing their job as efficiently as possible. For example: we can change store phone numbers, locations of the nearest stores and even reroute orders to make it almost impossible for a runner to break even. We call this process, ""DIS-FAVOR"", I know it sounds cruel and wrong, but it is what we did to weed out the runners that we didn't want to work with. Some of the runners had it coming, but I admit some were great employees, who just didn't jive with our ""runner image"". We got rid of a lot of unattractive people like this. There were some instances that even weight, skin color and race was the primary reasons some runners were targeted. I was never ok with doing this, but it was how we did our jobs and there were a few others who felt the same and who eventually left the organization. I'm not trying to make excuses for my actions. I really just want to expose this activity in an effort to make it right. I'm truly sorry for my behavior. I regret not standing up for what I believed was right while I was employed there.

The guaranteed pay used to range from $9 per hour to $14 per hour, more during special events, now every hour is $9 guarantee... they sort of flood the market with Runners."
161,Favor,Positive Rec from Current Employee,2016-12-11,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"Very flexible, fun, great work environment, pay pretty good for work done. It is a fantastic job to have either part time or full time as long as you are aware that it is for a limited amount of time.","No health benefits, no upward advancement possible. It is not a job you can really make a meaningful career out of"
162,Favor,Scrappy = abusive,2016-12-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you're young and don't have a ton of experience or financial obligations, it's a decent place to get your feet wet or break into a new industry. Could be a good resume builder.. but be very careful before you sign any paperwork, don't let them make you sign a non-compete that keeps you from getting a decent job if you ever leave.
Sometimes you get free food and drinks.
Most of the mid-level people are super cool.","Be prepared to be overworked, underpaid and under appreciated and then told it's ""start up life"" ..even after you have continuously accepted an increasing workload with no additional compensation. The majority of the people working there are immature and inexperienced. Some people take their job title way too seriously and think they are better than others. Communication is seriously lacking, especially between HQ and remote markets."
163,Favor,Marketing,2016-12-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Fun branding. Runners make it fun.,Company is slowing down. Badly managed team and overall disorganized. People are unqualified to do their jobs.
164,Favor,Received less pay as a manager,2016-11-05,3.0,Community Manager,Okay benefits. free food here and there. i believe austin gets a bit more perks since they are HQ but i think those benefits should be offered to other employees.,"I was getting paid $58,000 as a former entry level support employee at my previous job. As a manager at Favor, I was getting paid only $47,000. And it's a hell of a lot more work. They want you to be available at all times and keep people from quitting and retention is drilled down your throat. For managing 1600 runners in your market, pay me a bit more. Let us work from home time to time. Not all the time, but I live 45 minutes away from the office and it's not necessarily needed to be in the office all the time."
165,Favor,"Fun culture, little room for advancement",2016-08-24,4.0,,"They bring in breakfast for you 3 days a week, lunch 2 days, and dinner on Wednesdays. The office is sweet. Unlimited snacks and sodas. Exciting culture because it's a growing company.","The parking situation isn't the best. Depending on who you know there, there's little room for advancement. Hourly employees aren't treated well vs. the salary employees."
166,Favor,Startup Culture,2016-07-01,4.0,,"Flexibility in working, remote work, stock options, pretty good health insurance package. Overall a good setup, but can definitely use some improvement.","Becoming increasingly corporatized, salary is low for workload. I get that it's a new company, but taking care of your employees should come first and foremost."
167,Favor,Great company full of awesome people!,2015-11-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Everyone is awesome and really believes in what they're doing.  It's fantastic to work with a group of people that aren't just working for the weekend.,Fast-paced startup life isn't for everyone!
168,Favor,Recommend Favor,2015-10-20,5.0,,"Very dynamic, fast paced and unpredictable environment of a startup.","Too fast paced. If you are slow, don't even think of applying."
169,Favor,Do not do this to yourself,2015-10-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's growing and will probably be the name to beat. That's it. If you have literally nothing else to do with your life, head on over.","The management DOES NOT care about you. You are disposable. Regardless of your position in the company, your value is only what they can squeeze out of you until they discard your empty husk."
