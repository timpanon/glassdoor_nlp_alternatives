They will also lure you into new roles and lock you down without being honest about what the role really is.  You get “used” as a vessel to push upper leadership personal motivations and accolades, while slowly being quieted down and eventually silenced.  .  It’s just a bunch of senior leaders trying to outshine each other and get their name on something even if it’s not best for the employees.  Will get overwhelming associate feedback in surveys about wanting to work remote and will only tell you about the one comment from someone who wants to be in the office and then try to gaslight you into believing it’s the majority opinion.  Leadership will “threaten” that you’re luck the President is giving you any flexibility because she would prefer not to and force you to give up all of your flexibility if you don’t agree to work in the office sometimes.  Kind of like “ you’re lucky to get anything.  Don’t push your luck or she will take all your toys away.  The culture was going in an amazing direction the past couple of years.

We take calls back to back and follow a strict schedule. If we don’t follow the schedule, then we get yelled at by our managers. I was in a post grad rotation program and our managers basically treat us like kids. It’s pretty cringey and not professional. I felt like I was still in high school going through this program and I don’t really feel much growth. I didn’t go through college just to be stuck in a call center role, getting berated by customers on the daily. I felt like I was lied to during the interview process, because they market this opportunity in such a different way. Just tell us straight up that this is a call center and not waste anyone’s time. Majority of the roles within the company are call center positions, so there’s no way getting off the phones. The one thing I don’t understand about this company, is that the pay is so bad, but people are still so enthusiastic about their job, getting yelled at by customers and being “customer obsessed.”It gives off cultish vibes.

Your ability to move within the organization is very high
Generally, the benefits are quite respectable, if not good.","Very low take-home compensation in relation to competitors -- after I moved business units the number of people I talked to who took pay cuts to work at Fidelity was surprising. A variety of reasons for taking the pay cut mind you -- family moves, future opportunities at the firm, disliking their current employer that much, etc.

A very notable alert if you evaluate and offer is that the Paid Time Off is a shared pool between vacation and sick time. You are required to reserve days in case you get sick. If you use too much of either you then have to ""purchase"" additional time. I come from the tech world historically, and this was incredibly surprising. I am not alone in not recognizing that this was the case prior to joining the firm. I, and others, just assumed that PTO was vacation only."

The job is incredibly reasonable and the pay is significantly above competition. If you can get a job offer from fidelity and you are working for another BD just take it. Upward mobility is real and they push it. If you are happy in your role you can stay in it without absurd changes in metrics.

there are a lot of people who have been with the company for decades and love it.","self paced training which basically teaches you the bare minimum. 
a lot of trial and error, you learn by making mistakes everyday. 
a lot of research while having time constraints 
its a lot of work. and it can take anywhere from 3 months to a year to stop feeling like a ball of anxious mess, 
theres a certain level of fear mongering that is used to make sure you do the job like they want you too. probably not best if you already struggle with anxiety. it will definitely kick it up a notch... a couple notches. 
they calculate more stats than you can even think of. these stats will be thrown at you daily and you will be asked to explain every bit if its out of the desired window. bonuses and pay increases depend on that. 
if any of these feel like pros to you then it may be the right fit for you."

For many roles, you will have great job security and be extremely well-compensated compared to other companies in the industry doing the same role.

I will say that they do have a vested interest in taking care of their associates and I do feel more valued than I would in other big-name companies.","-Does not sponsor you for licensing unless you are in a role that requires it.

Overall most of the cons can be applied to any big corporate organization.

-Job growth and ability to be promoted within is definitely there, but I have seen some people become stuck in their roles if they stay too long or do not develop skills to move onto the next position. 
- In addition, moving up to management can take quite a while. I have seen it happen within the company, but a large number (especially an overwhelming number of upper-level management) either left the company and came back or were recruited externally. However, this is something that can be seen in almost any company you go to. 

- From the above my experience with management has been great, but I know on some high-intensity teams (such as sales or fund management) can have more stressful managers, but I have not heard anything terrible to note.

540,Fidelity Investments,Great Company for the Ambitious and Energetic,2022-01-24,4.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,"Lots of pros! The pay, the perks, and the people are all great. Fidelity has tried really hard to support employees during COVID, through extra paid leave specifically coronavirus-related, counselor-finding services, fun activities and food provided for people who are willing to come back into the office part time during virus lulls.

Fidelity is also working hard on diversity-and-inclusion, and on making sure employees' voices are heard from the ground up. The company supports outside volunteer efforts and onsite environmental initiatives. You can feel good about working for a company that wants to do good, not just do well.","Most people are hired into Fidelity at this position. It's a pretty rigorous process, from submitting the application through multiple interviews. Once you're hired, there are two potential hurdles: first in learning the job then in doing the job.

Oh, the learning process! Even entirely online as it has been since the pandemic, it's kind of fun. There are get-to-know-you activities with your newbie group. But there is also a LOT of information to absorb, and it doesn't let up for months. First you learn the Fidelity systems, then you go through licensing training. You must pass the licensing exams to advance within the company. From hire, this all could take 4-6 months. Yes, they pay you the whole time. Once you're licensed, you alternate more Fidelity-specific classes with actual customer support for a few more months before you settle into full time on the phones. After a few more months of that, you may start applying within the company for new skills and new roles, your options being more self-directed.

So, the cons: the pace of learning is set to warp speed, be prepared! Realize that while you're learning you cost the company quite a bit. It's a lot of stress, but they'll want to push you as fast as they can get you to go. And once you're on the job, well, it depends. Some people like inbound phone customer service, or at least don't mind it. Fidelity customers are usually quite pleasant really. But especially in the busy months, from maybe November through tax season, they can spend more time on hold than they like, which makes them cranky. There will be constant pressure from Fidelity for you to make each call as brief as possible: they will measure both your customer satisfaction stats AND your calls per hour. It can be hard to balance the one against the other. And, this is the job: call after call after call. There are breaks, of course, from weekly team meetings to personal lunch and break time to refresher education. If you can continue in the inbound phones roles long enough, you can eventually get promoted out of it if you choose: perhaps 1-5 years, generally?"

577,Fidelity Investments,"Tech divisions lag the market in tooling, processes, comp, management, leadership, dev experience.",2022-01-19,3.0,Software Engineer,The benefits packages are fully-featured and health insurance is affordable. The best perk of Fidelity is the 7% 401k match and the 10% annual profit sharing; 17% contributions to your 401k overall each year. The work/life balance ends up being very reasonable - it would be uncommon to work a 45-hour workweek more than a few times a year. 40 hours is the very common norm.,"Fidelity does not use public cloud, which has many negative side-effects; they attempt to replicate that experience with older, internal tooling which dramatically slows developer velocity. For example, engineer's ability to access compute resources is blocked by request processes. Libraries are all subject to a security review which can take a small number of weeks if requested with priority, or many weeks without. Licenses are purchased by a remote requisitions team with a similarly slow resolution timeframe. Releases are produced manually, there is no continuous deployment. 

There is no universal devops/platform team, squads maintain their own services. 
This self-sufficiency produces isolation, practically and socially; process standards and tooling varies a fair amount between them. There is no architecture team or unified technical leadership group. Each squad has their own tech lead and that's it.

Pay for engineers lags the market, targeting approximately 80-100% of the market rate. There is no option to acquire equity. ""Chairman shares"" are offered to top performers, but those are simply 2-year vesting cash bonus - not actual equity. Anecdotally, the very talented engineers remain due to not knowing their own market value. 

The manager-to-report ratio can vary wildly, 50+:1 in some cases, offering virtually no manager facetime or development opportunities to members of those squads. The daily routine of managers and directors is primarily comprised of liaising with customers (other business units) rather than anything related to developing their engineering teams.

Because the tech groups service internal business units, customer requirements are often poorly defined, change frequently and are conveyed verbally to product managers over calls. Oftentimes a change will be reverted due to a customer's whim, not the functionality of the feature itself.

Leadership is adamant about working from the office and will not support remote work post-covid.

Leadership has frequent messaging about undergoing an agile transformation, yet none of the shortcomings described here are eligible for reevaluation. The remaining set of factors that can be changed are virtually meaningless in impact.

Talented top-level leadership want to lead other business units which are revenue centers (all are financial business units) rather than cost centers, so the tech groups end up with a steady rotation of SVPs (the head of the tech group, equivalent to a CEO elsewhere) every 1-2 years. 

In short, the engineer experience at Fidelity is stable, yet slow, uninspiring, and poorly-compensated when compared to the broader market."

-Shift allowance is lowest in the industry , 150 rs ? Really ? You work on sat and sun and get one day off , and that too for 150rs .
- Managers are biased in promotion and hikes, if you are close to manager, even without working you will get promoted, else you may need to wait for 10 years.
- HR never listen and managers never bother for well being, they don't do shift or work on weekend but want others to work 
- managers are biased as they know your salary ans regional bias is at best.
- salary is definately low compared to market but if you want to learn something and don't get outdated, never join here . In case you feel this company has better job security then you are wrong, here firing is called as VRS
- Rotations are insane and there is no policy to have check on this.
- Last but not the least,my reviews gets deleted often . They have a strong marketing team which puts all the fake reviews and have 4+ start rating here. Don't believe me ? Check the ratings for gurgaon branch ( we don't have one but advertising team just create dummy data to put good reviews )

I was asked or rather forced to leave the company and never got the chance of an exit interview. My Manager and even the HR were waiting upon my return after I had a surgery and didn't even bother to ask how was I doing. First thing they asked was, when are you leaving?

So you'll only be poor during your career and not also in a long retirement.","Fidelity wants Workplace Planning and Advice and its Workplace Planning Consultants to refer opportunities to the Investor Center. That's the job. Say whatever you need to get the referral and you'll advance in your career. Any personal ethos of Do what's Right will be compromised in WPA.

Salaries are within a range lower than competitors and there is little chance for promotion, especially if:

* You are in the wrong org. It's hard to get recognized in some roles, even if you excel.
* You are an older worker. After positive reviews, there are no rewards while younger coworkers within the same level and similar reviews get raises or shares.

Example: Requests for approved time off must be sent in 2 weeks in advance, otherwise time off is an occurrence. If you request time off in the two week advance time period, despite being an emergency request, it may count as an occurrence because Fidelity decides that they will be busy in that day and forces you to take an occurrence if you dare keep your emergency time off that you needed for a doctor visit. This place is all about being an employee revolving door like most call centers. They claim to be family centered business but you will see in time that is not true.

Inclusive culture is pushed (don't expect everyone to be that way, but at least they try to make it welcoming).
Better than minimum wage.
Opportunities for growth.","UNDERPAID! This role requires you to live within 100 miles of Fidelity, yet they do not pay enough for a person to afford to actually live by themselves near Fidelity which is absolutely shameful.
It is like being in a minimum wage job except with better pay (though, like I said, still underpaid). You get limited breaks, you are expected to clock in ten minutes early each day, it can be difficult to use your PTO. The customer's rate us on a 7 point scale, but the only acceptable score is 7 points. If you get rated a 6, that is considered failing.
This role is very challenging and directly customer facing. There is a lot of pressure because you are dealing with customer's money. Fidelity throws you right into it, I did not feel ready to be moving money for customer's on my own but you just gotta do it.
It is great that they sponsor you through the licensing process, but it is really easy to get burned out by their pace. Then, if you fail, prepare to be ""let go.""
It is a FINRA rule that licensed employees cannot work from home full time without an exception process that Fidelity is not interested in participating in (it would require them to inspect your home office so I can't blame them for not wanting to do that). We can WFH right now, but will be forced to go in at least part time once it is deemed safe.
Fidelity is really pushing for people to return to the office, lots of pressure to participate in ""connect weeks"" which is where you volunteer to go back to the office.
They send you a lot of free stuff but most of it is junk. Like cheapy backpacks/mugs/merch you didn't ask for. I am putting this as a con because even though it is nice to receive free things and in the moment it gets you feeling part of the group, this practice has to stop. It is not good for the planet to keep producing useless junk."

Decent pay, they raise salary slowly based on the current economy. Hasn't changed much for this role in the last 15 years from what I have seen. Good benefits for people with families and medical expenses.","I went through the hiring process three years ago with about 30 people. A bunch left during the first year. I've interviewed several times with a 20 to 1 ratio for applicants vs. positions offered. Everyone that stayed made a lateral move within the company. They changed positions but didn't get a bump in pay. A lot of promises and motivational meetings are given on career mobility, but most can't move anywhere easily. Climbing the ladder takes years. For most, it takes a lot of education, experience, and exceptional stats. I saw a guy with a CFP, 3 years of financial advisement experience, a degree in finance, and excellent testing/current role scores lose a job to a woman with 1-year furniture sales experience. He couldn't move out for a long time. I've seen that happen to several people where the promotions were not fair based on diversity hiring. Qualified people get passed up frequently for diverse applicants. I worked with several people that had multiple years of financial experience and a few that had MBA's that didn't move any easier than people in their 2nd year of college. Experience/education/certifications don't help very much. Lots of people apply for every job. If you're not at the top of performance, experience, diversity, education, and in some cases popularity, you don't have a great shot at moving around here."

-No over-time pay. Even if you could accrue your overtime and be able to leave some days a bit early would be better. Worth noting though that the amount of overtime you do isn't outrageous, maybe a couple hours a week.
-Pressure on employees to learn skills outside their day-to-day, i.e. take on additional training. This is a good idea but the company doesn't facilitate this learning, in that you're busy enough carrying out your day-to-day tasks that you simply don't have any time to devote to this training.

Too many big words and very less implementation

Abby Johnson attempting to create the cult called Fidelity is failing and outflow at the firm is coming. They’re anti-fiduciary approach will cost them majorly with the CFP Board.

 They take no feedback from employees with knowledge of this and other things that are unethical and would violate even Reg BI.

Recruiters will tell you that unless you have a CFA Level I upon graduation from an Ivy League school , or you can never be an analyst. After LinkedIn review this is not true, and I cross referenced who didn’t qualify for those “standards” I found those not from Ivy League had some nepotism within the company, generally at a VP or higher level 

This east coast bias here is incredible. Call centers everywhere else-with about 1/5 the pay of anyone in Massachusetts. 

I don’t recommend this firm to anyone. They’ll preach a holistic happy fun approach- the reality is nothing close. 

Abby Johnson just because you were born into the most successful mutual fund company- does not mean anyone should worship you the way it’s demanded from the top down. It’s actually pretty pathetic you feel the need to plaster your own quotes and face everywhere. 

Best of luck to all those who dare enter these jobs. Congratulations to those who’s dad bought them an Ivy League education and nepotistically raised the wealth differential in this country. Fidelity is the epitome."

1607,Fidelity Investments,They’ve been pretty good to me.,2021-07-29,4.0,Workplace Planning Consultant,"7% 1:1 company match on base plus bonuses. Contribute up to 50% of bonus to 401k & they will match up to 7% 1:1 there too.

Tuition reimbursement 90% if you pass your classes with a C. Masters degrees converged at 10k per year if you major in a relevant field.

Flexible time off without fear of reprisals.
Stay employed even in lean economic markets. 
Fathers get 3 months of parental leave for new borns.
Adoption services.
Concierge services for those who want to plan that special date or marriage proposal.

Paid child care by the firm on days they need you if come in if another sight is snowed by request. Discounts on other days at approved sites.

Night time Differential pay at 5% for folks who work past 6 PM. That increases to 20% for those who work past 8 PM of your eligible based compensation per hour. 

Christmas bonuses 2 to 3 times every five years. Usually 1 pay period awarded. There have been other types of incentive pay depending on call volume to encourage us to not cancel auto OT when applied awarded in cash, stock grants, one day off, Fidelity cash for merchandise, etc.

No weekend requirements for those supporting workplace roles. Personal investments roles may have weekend hours depending on the job.

More Telework is available due to Covid19.

Real career development exit here. Some managers are better at this than others. I’ve always felt that they’re pushing me to take up the next challenge. Even at times when I wasn’t ready to move up or just getting complacent.

Fun stuff at call centers. Choose any of these clubs: Women in Leadership, Aspire, FidVets, FinTech, President Circle, Leadership Summit, etc... they always have something going on for you to network and use to move on up. It’s up to you to hustle and play the game.

Pre Covid19 we had hot air balloon rides, dragon boat competitions, BBall breaks, volleyball teams, zombie nights for Halloween, BBQ competitions, ice cream socials, team outings, camping trips, visiting chefs at some sights, team potlucks, free food and I’m talking about the good stuff NOT pizza. You can definitely gain major weight at certain sites.

No worries because some sites have a full service gym w/ personal trainers, classes, and nutritionists.

 At Our sites we got the choice to take a walk and discuss our development plans or monthly business results around one of the many nature trails.","Bonus metrics change a lot.

Managers depending on the site location change a lot in the call centers for sure.
 
Will push you hard to keep up with the ever changing metrics in order to stay relevant if you want to get promoted. Only to hire a guy off the street to the branch with 6 months of car sales experience, no degrees in the field, and has to still get his S7 & 63.

You have a better chance of jumping a few slots to get to where you want if you work at Fidelity for 1-3 years. Quit; then work elsewhere for 1-2 years only to come back to Fidelity.

Serious issues at to many of the branches when it comes to hiring women, professionals with ascents, or they may serve in locations with above average demographics or immigrants without one person in the branch that can speak their language. These folks tend to have small to midsize size businesses. They horde cash and don’t have someone they trust to reach out to them. However, executive management is aware and working on making the hiring process better. I can tell that change is happening. It’s not HQ more so the mindset of the financial industry at the local levels. 

Management feedback for the interview process can be largely lackluster. Heard from other top performers that the feed back was non existent or borderline suspect. Being told to smile more during the interview or joke more at team meetings is NOT productive feedback for a job interview. Especially when they seem to selectively provide this to certain “types.”

Healthcare plan is average. Family plan is 3k high deductible. They do give you $1500 per year to your HSA to offset that high @-&:?:?’ Plan. Prescription med and co pays prices were higher for me than my previous employer.

Pay is actually lower than the national average for a license professional."

People can be so horrible on the phones, and you don't get the support you need for escalated customers. Lack of training for new hires makes job harder for current employees- lots of mistakes, misinformation, etc...

My major complaint about WPC is that people who play the game and burn through calls get promoted and those who spend time with clients don’t. You are not encouraged to spend time and plan with a client. You are supposed to get your tool clicks, uncover assets and send a referral to a branch. It has developed a culture of work 12 hour days to get your numbers, or cut corners. 


Also, they required mandatory overtime on Monday’s and Friday’s for over 6 months. Demanding total flexibility from all reps and continually asking for more, more, more. But good luck using your PTO. Some managers will act like you are stealing PTO hours from their own bank when you ask. The “COVID relief days” they offered were total BS as well. Their policy stated you could use it for anything that required “flexibility” during the pandemic. However, most managers would only let you take it if you were sick COVID."

* Leaders are sycophants, who love sycophants. Hence only sycophants move up. 
* Promotions happen not based on merit. But sycophant leaders choosing their favorite sycophants 
* When leaders move to a different organization they take these incapable sycophants with them - they together spoil the culture of the new team
* Good people are leaving. Many great leaders who build core systems from ground up are not rewarded. Sycophants who have no knowledge of product, business, or technology are constantly repelling them

They expect you to do the code development, do the testing that also manual and also do the UAT of the same code, there is no 2nd team eye to look into the code and if any things failed in the production you will be blamed. Only blame game works.
Outdated technologies used in most of the projects and most of the people have started their careers with fidelity will have more business knowledge and they will expect to know every business knowledge then technical skills.
And the feedback given to your manager on the portal is visible by manager and he can also see who had given the feedback, and you may get targeted because of that.
Some of the managers may ask you to look job outside saying you don't have business knowledge and your technical skills is not required.

Let your managers know and they'll help you get there.","If you are passive, you'll be stuck in the same role for years. There are opportunities out there, you just need to look for them. I started in Customer service, and that first year was definitely the hardest. I knew nothing and felt incompetent. After a year, once you begin to build your knowledge base, you can actually have meaningful conversations so I'd say stick with it. Entry level jobs usually feel exhausting and difficult.

You can learn a lot about the industry if you want to at this job. It give you the overturning to talk to a lot of different people.,It’s a matter of time until you burn out.

1758,Fidelity Investments,Fidelity Clients with $10MM waited for 50-200 minutes to speak to me and were never in a good mood,2021-07-04,1.0,High Net Worth Associate,I got paid on time,"This is, despite the description, a hard core call center job. But, because its Fidelity, the clients wait for 50-200 minutes or more to speak with you, they are, as you would expect, not happy by the time you speak with them. (These are the clients filling out your survey, and only PERFECT surveys count). The queue of clients to speak to is endless. Over time the bad attitudes and angry people yelling at me wore me down and I lost 15 lbs, because skinny anxious and depressed, and essentially sacrificed my personal self to chase my professional goal to move to a different job where the clients don't wait as long. However, the rhetoric and promise of changing jobs, the date keeps getting pushed back. Now they are refusing to do internal promotions, due to the egregious client hold times. This is a LOSING TEAM. Go join a winning team. 

If you don't live there already, you have to move to the city to WFH

No real team atmosphere

Clients yelling at you and disrespecting you.

In the words of management ""this is the bottom of the company""

In the words of my former manager ""this is the hardest year at the company, and this is the worst version of the hardest year at the company ever""

Except, this year is different, because the company is literally NOT PROMOTING the loyal employees who worked through the hell of December-March.

If you call Fidelity this upcoming December 2021, you will experience an unacceptable hold time of at least 70 minutes, and you will work with someone brand new and incompetent.

Since I joined, my class of 30 people, about 14 have quit or been fired for yelling back at clients, or failing their Finra exams.

Again, I cannot emphasize enough, this is a LOSING TEAM and the teflon-covered management give you lip-service about the future getting better, yet the carrot gets pushed farther and farther away.

Even in this terrible environment, when my peers got only 40% ""perfect surveys"" my record month was 91%.

I have been asking for help since January to get into a different role that fits my background and skillset.
Now, I have other companies offering me jobs that pay more than 2x the $48,000 at Fidelity.

Fidelity really invests in you by literally paying you to study for the first 9 months. 2-3 of those months are for studying for the SIE, Series 7 and Series 63. The rest of the time is learning Fidelity's training and the way they do things. In this time you might have to take some calls but its fairly easy. There is a lot of room for career advancement. You most likely won't stay in a position for longer than a year without some type of promotion.

2012,Fidelity Investments,Not Challenging Enough,2021-05-28,2.0,Investment Service Rep,"Great company culture, diverse, and friendly team members",The training for the investment management consultant position is very elongated and they make you do the work of a service rep that's not challenging and basically helping people change their passwords all day.

2032,Fidelity Investments,Benefits are the only reason I’m there,2021-05-25,3.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,"You won’t find a company with better benefits. We had an unprecedented busy year and the job sucked more than usual. The company responded with doing an overtime incentive program where you could earn not only time and half, but another $25 per hour on top. In addition, they are rolling out another bonus, on top of the performative bonus we already have, for those who simply passed their license exams within a certain time frame of their hire date. In addition, we get 18 days of PTO, paid holidays, and this year, we got 40 hours of COVID Relief Time.","The job itself is not fun and can be stressful. When we were busy, we would deal with angry clients every single call, and take about 4-6 calls and hour for 8 straight hours. It gets tiring and extremely repetitive.

Updates from superiors (CEO, etc.) multiple times a week.
Will pay for your licensing if you’re in a licensed role.
Pretty easy to get vacation days approved.","This is not a job for someone who can’t sit in the same chair, staring at the same computer screen for 8+ hours.
Working from home is miserable, but working in the office requires either weekly testing and tracking or the vaccine. 
I’ve never felt so lonely at a company, even though this is the biggest company I’ve ever worked for.
I barely even know my manager’s first name, that’s how disconnected everyone is.
I only lasted one month after I finished training because the job isn’t rewarding in the slightest.
Be prepared to get yelled at or called incompetent at least 5 times a day.
Don’t expect more than minimal support from any supervisor.
This position should pay much more than it actually does. 
During onboarding, they make it seem like you can move around as much as you want, as quickly as you want, and your manager will help you advance however they can, but that’s a joke.
By the end of my shift, I’m exhausted and can’t even build up the motivation to make dinner.
EVERYTHING is scheduled. You get two 15 minute breaks - one in the morning and one in the afternoon - and a 30 minute lunch, but you may not be eating lunch until hours after any normal lunch time should be scheduled. And you don’t get a say on that either."

High chance that you will be working with an outdated tech stack after LEAP. You may also be placed into an unfavorable role with little to no technical mentorship and with minimal transferrable skills.

They hire pleasant people
So many perks and benefits I literally cant fit it all on here.","Ever ask yourself ""How can I simultaneously destroy my career prospects and waste my expensive college degree?"" Well then , Fidelity Investments in Jacksonville has the perfect job for you! 

First, it's a call center people...through and through. You will talk to dozens of people on the phone. Every...single...day. Eventually, that ""ding!"" sound of a new call coming in will haunt your dreams. Most people don't last more than a year. You can either go the sales or service route. If you go service, there is very little room for advancement. In addition, if you move into whats called a ""High Net Worth"" service role, you will be responsible for a HUGE range of knowledge and actions without commensurate pay. One call could have you rushing to get a complex option trade placed within minutes of market close, while a pushy day trader berates you, and the next call could be spending an hour helping a 90 year old man reset his password as you bang your head on you desk asking ""I went to college for this?!"" If you go sales, then get used to working long, awkward hours and having your success defined in how many more calls you can take than the next guy/gal. 

The coupe de grace (ATTENTION ALL RECENT COLLEGE GRADS): None of the jobs they offer in Jacksonville are real finance jobs. They're just customer service/sales jobs parading as something fancier. Even the ""Financial Advisor"" roles are just sales, albeit well paying. Also, call center jobs are only marketable to other customer service careers. Having a call center job on your resume will actually HARM your chances of landing a job in world of ACTUAL finance. So, before you go thinking ""I'll just work here for a year or two to get something on my resume""....DON'T DO IT.

None of what I just said should reflect poorly on the company itself, because Fidelity is a great company in terms of culture, mission, and values. That's undeniable. The problem is very specific to the extent of their operations in Jacksonville being call center based and that these are very stressful and career-limiting work environments. Consider yourself warned!"

2480,Fidelity Investments,Good luck!,2021-03-19,1.0,Financial Representative,The people and how you can move up on the corporate ladder in this position,"I'm not a negative person but this topic makes me so angry so 

Compensation: The base pay (at least for my role) is way too low for what I do. 

Job: My job itself is manageable but stressful at times already. When people leave, they put that person's job on other people, with no raise or any acknowledgment of how the person's doing. The job you add on, you may not even be qualified for under in the industry. Also, they add on useless tasks to do (that other locations don't do) just for no reason at all. We have all of these tasks to do with no extra pay or help from higher management. The higher up people do not even know how to do the jobs we have which I can say from my experience here for sure.

Customers: some of the clients are absolutely absurd. they come in asking for things and you try to help them and give them caring honest answers and they dont care. it just adds on to the stress.

Company: During the pandemic they've put completely unrealistic protocols that do not make the clients happy (not being able to walk in places). Although I understand it's important to be safe during the pandemic, other companies allow it, so why not here? This just makes the clients very angry, more than already about their needs, and they go off on us service reps as if it is our fault. We take the heat. When we present it to a manager they do not care and tell us to try to resolve it more. If it escalates too much to a manager then they just blame the company and seem not to care. 

P.S. If you have a fidelity account and need help, do NOT call the service number because there is a 1% chance someone will answer in the first 10 minutes."

Transparently, my financial future will be dramatically and positively different because of my career at Fidelity. Very proud to tell others where I work!","The only con I have is that Fidelity is more focused on hiring externally than promoting from within. Much of this focus is due to recent cultural and economic events (i.e., 2020). From a business perspective, I understand the desire to capitalize on available and diverse talent but not at the risk of frustrating and overlooking your highly qualified and tenured associates. There is a simmering frustration among the ranks and will soon result in sizable attrition if not addressed. 

For example, I am the most credential and skilled associate of my team and keep getting overlooked for a particular role. The individuals that are being hired into this role are under credentialed and/or have less experience. It is the most frustrating thing in the world! For the first time in my tenure at Fidelity, I have started proactively looking outside the firm. It genuinely PAINS me to think I may have to join a competitor to advance my career and compensation."

The company does try and help managers improve, but it is still a challenge if you do not get a good one. Also, many departments can feel like a silo; you may not like the lack in variety of jobs in your business arm and it can sometime feel difficult to move to a different department if you have already established yourself in another one.

There is a focus on achieving certain metrics (ie. insurance, managed money) and there is no cumulative success - the clock starts over every quarter, which means there is limited upside potential for advisors at Fidelity.

There is a lot of room to grow and change to new roles within the company. I'm a white trans woman and never got misgendered once while at work (except occasionally by clients), no one treated me weird and I even got offered promotions and things.","The phones role is high stress, so an ability to separate work time from your personal time is vital. This is hard to do when everything is work from home. The licensing can be tough. There wasn't a lot of room for people with learning differences to get support during licensing. If you're not a good test taker and struggle to read all day and memorize information for an exam, you will have to advocate for yourself for the support you need."

We could be more of an industry leader in Diversity and Inclusion - some senior leaders have always been focused on this and are greatly admired throughout the firm. Generally speaking from an enterprise level, these topics are only addressed under media attention, though this level of attention has been increasing. compensation could be higher, but personally i feel is justified through their fantastic benefits. culture will vary based on business unit - some have more of a start up vibe, other units don't have that flexibility given the nature of their work."

I was able to learn some of the best agile practices like that of the Spotify model. Although most of the systems are marred with the wounds of the waterfall model, but it gives a picture of end-to-end development with various stages of testing like Integration and User acceptance. Their core architecture teams do most of the best work in the industry which drills into the whole organisation, which paves way for niche skill learnings down the chain.","Not much work comes to India Offices from the US. Best work is done in the US. Most of the work deals with a whole lot of bureaucracy, rather than rapid application development. The process are good, but this keeps the company slower than its competitors. Because of the loopholes in the way the company works, developer associates who start fresh here, tend to become clueless about their futures and in the long run, become irrelevant to even sustain in the IT industry. The company boasts the average stay of an employee here as 9-10 years, which I believe tells about the sorry state of the knowledge of the current employees besides the fantastic flexible laid-back environment of the workplaces inside. Big thing that has started the new breed to look for other careers or opportunities, they don't really pay well to the industry standards even after an employee has earned the best work review from the managers. Senior management is at the moment clueless as to their own set agendas and principles, allowing for some of the leaders leave the organisation."

Top of the line training for licensing should your role require it off the bat, or sometime down the line.

The workplace culture is excellent- every single manager I've had is excellent, and that's likely a result of trickle-down from *their* higher ups. Willingness to accomodate work from home is an excellent push, as long as you're okay with online training.","Certain products like the one I work with currently very much feel like they're on the backburner when it comes to updating resources, educating customers, etc. It makes a call with an insane hold time even more distressing, and just leads to more OT asks. I've had the term ""F for flexibility"" thrown around more times than I can count. Having covid PTO is great, but the distressing air of the call center floor makes associates feel almost guilty for not doing OT, nevermind taking days off during ""peak season"", which, since the pandemic, has been virtually every day.

2974,Fidelity Investments,Get your license and quit,2021-01-14,2.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,-Paid Training and licensing during first several months. Classes ar e very educational and they set you up to pass all the Series licenses,"-Absolutely no room for growth. They purposely have a system that keeps you stuck in the call center. My manager was there for 15 years and even he ended up leaving because he couldn't find a role outside of the call center. Fidelity Investments and the Fidelity call center might as well be two completely different companies. The only positions available to you are in sales or some other medial phone position. Managers either can't help you out or won't help you out. Like my headline says I would take the position, get the licenses and then start applying elsewhere.

3012,Fidelity Investments,BEWARE!!,2021-01-12,1.0,Anonymous,They allowed workers to work from home.,"Where do I start? I spent a decent amount of time working at Fidelity. Overall, I would say it’s not a great company to work for at all. From my observations, many people have gotten stuck in this company, and it’s drained the life/soul out of them. For starts, many full-time and contractors (Fidelity TalentSource) are underpaid for the amount of responsibility on them. Many people are very unhappy here, but their soul has been trapped here way too long. They don’t know how to leave; all they know to do is stay around and complain.

Racism is obvious in this company. After the murder of George Floyd and many others, there was a lot of lip service from upper-level leaders and money donated to non-profits, but the core of this company has not changed at all. It’s racist!

Human Resources and Recruiters for the most part are awful. I think this is one of the MANY reasons why they don’t attract quality candidates, let alone keep them exceptionally long. Speaking of that, turnover is HIGH.

The leadership is really what makes or breaks an organization. The leadership here is awful. I met with a Senior Leader about issues with a product that they oversaw, and they admitted it was problematic and had obvious issues. However, since our meeting nothing about the product has improved, it’s only gotten worst. Do companies think by ignoring constant issues/problems that they’re just going to float away?

I conclude by saying, proceed with caution. Don’t let the nice buildings, benefits, etc. fool you. Once you get in, you will soon realize it was a BIG mistake coming here. You deserve better in life, STAY AWAY!!"

Oftentimes running under a tight budget even though we're severely understaffed. They try to make up for the high turnover by hiring offshore contractors.

3027,Fidelity Investments,Little work/life balance,2021-01-11,2.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,"Great benefits (PTO, medical etc)","Good luck using your PTO- they don't approve time off if they deem themselves too busy, mandatory overtime in ""peak"" seasons (but they will require you to do it throughout the year), unrealistic expectations of calls taken per hour while trying to talk clients ""off the edge"". Promotions are based on your surveys you receive from clients and if your manager likes you- and alot of surveys are bad scores due to long wait times so it's an unfair scaling system."
3028,Fidelity Investments,"Amazing potential, great community, cares about culture fit!",2021-01-11,4.0,Software Engineer,"Honestly they care a TON about making sure you fit within the culture of the team/company. The technology community is really helpful and full of such a variety of people. There's good events, they invest in you as a person from internal onsite training, to in-house education platforms to big name course platforming tools (not even counting their benefits package, that's incredible, especially for families). You can really ""Blaze your own trail"" when it comes to your career and people will support you as much as they can. The connections you make there can/will extend far after you leave and most of their networks are very far reaching across other large companies (or even internally).

Additionally, work/life balance is AMAZING. Most managers (particularly technology, since call center workflows are different) will let you handle life because they know that it can be unpredictable, and will help you adjust however works for you (obviously within reason), whether that's having to leave somewhat early to pick up kids or have an extended lunch because of a crisis or appointment. There's a trust that you can develop with your team and manager that you can truly make the experience less stressful, and they're willing to work with you in whatever way they can.","If you're coming in as an entry-level technology role, make sure you get the best offer you can. They've historically paid under market even in their industry (though it's much closer these past 2 years) because of their benefits, but total comp is still somewhat lower than anticipated for their size. Depending on the team, it may be hard to rise up the ranks past a point due to too many managers, and organizations find it difficult to cut them, especially if they've been there a while. It's pretty hard to negotiate any pay change since raises only happen at the end of the year, and there's not a pay discussion until they're locked in."

In addition, having a 7% company match and profit sharing component in the 401(k) plan was a great benefit. They also encourage employees to develop their careers so your job is never at a standstill.","Since some jobs have you working in a contact center type of environment, there are a lot of months where call volume can be busy and it can be exhausting taking care of so many customers in a span of 9-11 hrs each day. In addition, you're set on a schedule (could be working an evening shift until further notice) and even though you might be working for a minimum of 8 hours, it can still be exhausting leaving the workplace at 8:30 pm closer to 9 pm on a Friday with hardly any other employees working with you during that time as well."

- Very low stress and hours requirements if you land in the ""right"" department.","- Career progression is extraordinarily political. I've seen multiple unqualified people get promoted because they spend all day assembling powerpoints and meetings despite having zero expertise or knowledge.
- Deadlines and accountability are non-existent in many departments. 25% of the people will do 75% of the work. I once had a (full-time) coworker complain that she never worked more than 32 hours in a week before when we asked her to stay late leading-up to a deadline.
- Company is risk-adverse to a fault. Rather than identifying short-term solutions to problems, they will have a five-year plan to eventually fix the problem. In the meantime... oh well.

The firm's true colors started to show once reps had to work from home. They don't care what your skillset is, what motivates you, and how well you can fit with another team. If your scorecard isn't green forget about moving up in the company.

There's a reason why people are sprinting to Robinhood, but the leadership refuses to acknowledge reality. Instead they spend the exit interview belittling their reps decisions to leave and it's not a good look."

Team-oriented culture usually means everyone looks and sounds identical. It is a private company, so they can run the business whatever way they want, without any pressure from the public in regards to diversity and inclusion. In interview, they often tell you that the median pay for FC is around 165k, with many earn above 200k. The base is about 45k, most people get paid around the base.

Between its low cost platform to invest and its fabulous benefits, Fidelity sets the bar high.","The only concern I have with Fidelity is that it doesn't do enough to root out managers with direct reports who violate its values. The lack in accountability of its managers isn't unique to Fidelity. Yet, it's disappointing considering it sincerely strives to standby things it espouses. Everyone knows who these bad actors and bad apples are. Members of their teams can't move away fast enough to other teams, departments, or companies. 

Though the company allows them to punish or push out struggling yet sincere frontline employees, it does little to recognize that these ineffective managers are better at managing up to their bosses than lifting up their teams. Just recently, I saw a manager who was recently promoted to an enviable post who has a seriously horrible reputation. He is a poster child of everything I mentioned and is one of the worst managers in the building."

This place is a burnout factory with over 80% of newly hired employees leaving within five years. Pay is very disappointing and company policy is to not give raises. If you want higher pay you have to be promoted and a hard year of work is rewarded with a high five and some kind words. This is true if you have excelled in your position for years.

All based on favoritism so all you gotta do is kiss their butt. If you apply in a phone call center, expect to stay there and rotate between different call centers for the rest of your life. Only opportunity they offer is different call centers. Two 15 minute breaks, one 30 min lunch and they choose when you take it. YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT AT EXACT TIMES . They recently made it so that you can take it 20 min before or after . Break feels like 5 mins and lunch is 10 min cause the lines are sooooo long in the cafe and it takes time to get your butt up off your prison cell and walk all the way over there sooo technically you got 5-10 mins to shove the food in the mouth. Easy to get burn outs and forces you to do OT or else you’ll look bad and lose that opportunity for progression. Flexibility my butt! they give you a list of unattractive hours that is available and you just gotta choose from it.

Just avoid applying for phone call centers unless it’s your last resort."

Great work life balance","They are the worst with their promotion metrics. I was performing in top 1% of the company 3 months I dropped 1 month and the used it as an excuse not to promote me up. If your a person of color as well there is no diversity at the the maagement level besides one woman of Asian heritage. Expect if you are white to be promoted even though you're not the most qualified for the role. Expect to be accused of being bad on the phone when you did everythign you did for a client yet they give you a bad rating for the 1 hour hold time they waited to talk to you, and the best part is then the company will use that against you to screw you out of your bonuses saying you didn't do a great job. Of course, there is no way to throw out the ones that that were just an upset customer and not your fault. We were told they didn't have money for raises then they cut their commissions and magically found a way to still give us a raise. They do not do any cost of living adustments so expect to live harsh while some people live comfortable in other states. So pretty much expect to be disregarded at this company they don't care about you."

3523,Fidelity Investments,Indifference and Abuse,2020-09-01,1.0,529 College Planning Specialist,I made some friendships while I was there. Everything related to my actual job was horrible.,"The upper management all sort of do there own things and have their own expectations, creating confusion throughout the company. I don't think Abby really has control over some of her subordinates. Site management changed every year that I was there, adding to the confusion. Team managers have entirely too much power and there is very little recourse given to appeal their decisions or seek redress of grievances when they act in an inappropriate manner. The pay is well below industry standards and while you are able to make lateral movements within the company, moving up is EXTREMELY difficult. Pay raises rarely keep up with inflation and while I was there our variable comp was changed making it impossible for anyone to meet the new standards. My pay went down a couple of thousand dollars per year as a result. HR is not responsive and negligent at times. I went an entire year without insurance because I was somehow disenrolled in the plan that I signed up for when I got hired on. HR knew that this mistake had happened and it was documented in their system, but they didn't do anything in time to correct the problem despite my contant pressuring them. The company became even less invested in its employees during my time, essentially turning from a somewhat tolerable work experience into just another high turnover, turn and burn call center."

Company politics.
Bullying and/ or ostracization by managers.
Company politics.
Managers allowing their favored subordinates to bully others, while swift retaliation awaits those that dare criticize their annointed ones, however justified.
Company politics.
Too many managers haven't a clue about the application(s) they're responsible for.
Company politics.
Too many managers that lack real leadership abilities.
Company politics.
Endless, unproductive, inescapable company politics.
Endless, unproductive office meetings.
Below average pay.
Uninspiring work; It's no surprise the results of their annual engagement survey are so poor.
Company politics.
Poor quality development, old tech.
Fidelity mandate bespoke everything, so expect restricted functionality, industry standard methodologies (such as Agile) to be bloated and incomprehensible and the inevitable compromises in the quality of your own work as a result.
The office atmosphere is more like a library than a workplace. 
Company politics.
Promotions based on factors other than merit.
Company politics.
Hiring based on factors other than merit.
Company politics.
Those with below average technical abilities are too often tolerated.

Did I mention the company politics? I only bring it up again because at Fidelity their brand of politics is continuously shoved under your nose and right in you face, so it's better you find out now if you can stomach it."

They've even redesigned their phone system in the midst of a pandemic to make sure that everyone takes every call and is talked out of their voice by Tuesday, but you better show up and sound cheerful for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday...or else.
The benefits in terms of insurance coverage is decent. On the surface their retirement plan looks good with all the match and profit sharing, but their vesting schedule is draconian and traps you working for them for YEARS before you would ever get to take any of their retirement contributions with you when you leave. And you will want to leave quickly.","Metrics. Matrices. Benchmarks. Expectations. Goals.
Forget Fidelity being a Finance company. Their business, what they do best, is perfecting the art of micromanagement. Think you've learned how to do your job effectively? Think again. Every few months they've designed or redesigned a new system for you to learn to use because it is NEW AND IMPROVED with many more reporting features to keep an eagle eye on every single insignificant facet of your job performance - all in the name of assigning a number and a statistic to what you do that they can then set the goal for just high enough that they can use your performance as a reason to short you on a bonus or deny you a raise.
And they have no sympathy for their front line workers being abused on the phones either. They cleared out their offices and sent everyone home in March, but everything else has been business as usual ever since. No changes in expectations even an inch even though everybody in the trenches has been putting up with 3-4x the work they were doing 100 days ago. No guaranteed bonuses. No time off availability. Overtime has been expected and mandatory from the beginning, otherwise you're labeled as ""not a team player"" and ""hurt your Fidelity Brand""

If you bite back, your managers will gaslight you into thinking that you are the problem, not the super bizarre environment that they have created.They will ask you, if you are only ""there for a paycheck?"" The answer is yes, because they're only ""there for metrics."" 

The environment is not collaborative, and they will use you up until you are done. They are not dumb. They know exactly what the average associate's shelf life is(a manager told me so), and they will coldly and callously move on.

3688,Fidelity Investments,"Good place to start right out of college, but rampant incompetence",2020-06-19,2.0,Software Engineer,"- There is a big focus and investment on education, training employees
- There is a strong focus on diversity and Employee Resource Groups
- Colleagues are friendly, managers treat their employees with respect and kindness.
- The company has a new talent pipeline in its internship program, and a great bootcamp program for new hires. The company's best employees come from this program.
- Embrace of Agile Scrum and Kanban
- Upper technical management is staffed by good, eager, and talented people that want to change things for the better.
- If you are a go-getter, there is much opportunity to make it up the ranks.","- Low technical talent: The company uses about 45% contractor workforce (even in the US). A lot of technical knowledge leaves company every year. Huge turnover rate in the technical ranks. Many of these contractors have low skills that do not match their resume.
- While it is good the company gives people low on experience a chance (sometimes the first chance of their career), the flip-side is that there are a lot of people that don't know what they are doing. Huge brain drain in the early 2000s at this company that the company never fully recovered from (many firms in the same industry experienced the same).
- Very incompetent teammates. ""Very"" with a capital ""V"". You have to constantly get on people just to get the work done that they promised to do. Sometimes takes weeks to find an administrator to grant access or turn a setting on. Sometimes requirements are completely misunderstood.
- Agile scrum meetings go on for too long. Oftentimes, over half a day is spent in meetings. The prevailing attitude at the company is that strictly adhering to Agile ceremonies will magically get the Sprint work done.
- Non-technical people are scrum masters (SMs): Although it is technically not a requirement, it is a bit of an obstacle to have non-technical people as SMs for Software Engineering work. Despite my 17 years of experience as a Software Engineer, I often found myself being contradicted by SMs with less than 5 years experience, and zero years as a Software Developer. Sadly, most (but not all) SMs have very little interest in understanding the the work they were SMing for.
- You ask a question, and people are either too busy to answer, or nobody knows the answer. Either way, You are basically on your own to figure things out"

Rising through the ranks can be difficult and incredibly frustrating as there is a lot of politics involved
You can go a lot farther doing mediocre work on side projects rather than outstanding work for your project team (which, by the way, typically has well-defined KPIs and revenue implications unlike the one-off side projects)
Possibly depends on business unit, but rarely feels like the work has substantial impact on society

- Work isn't challenging at all. You can coast and do nothing all day and slip through the cracks.","Software engineers at fidelity are very low on the totem pole, probably a step lower than call center employees if I had to guess. 

The compensation is insulting. I went to a competitor in asset management for the same role level and tripled my compensation. You could probably quadruple your compensation by going to amazon, google, etc. A senior software engineer with 10yrs of experience at fidelity makes less than an entry-level software engineer at JP morgan/bank of america/goldman sachs with no years of experience. Don't work here unless you are in asset management. Those are the only people who make any real money.

The tech is severely outdated. Some engineers were working in COBOL while I was there. Once again, this is insulting and shows that no effort is made by management to invest in good tech. 

Management makes it very clear that technologists provide negative value, we were even told this during out first week. ""You are a cost center"" -- I can't tell you how many times I've heard this. It's so obvious. Why do you think there are barely any technologists in the Boston HQ? Instead they're pushed to the basements of New Hampshire and Rhode Island.

Bonus is insulting too. Don't count on that. 

People brag about the generous 401k match but it doesn't kick in for 5 years. That is 5 years you could be working as a technologist at a competing asset manager making triple your compensation. 

My first week at Fidelity a manager told me that technologists are expendable because their job can just be outsourced. Ouch.

This company has no path forward. Mutual funds are a thing of the past now that low-fee ETFs have become so popular. And their brokerage is so outdated."

Good luck on getting a manager that you'll get along with, some of them don't care (looking at you Lauren, coming in at 11am and leaving at 3pm), and some are so obsessed with stats that they'll work your until you die. 

Oh you're putting in overtime? That's great, we're expecting you to, who cares if you don't have work/life balance. 

Stay away from this job if you can get anything else. Don't believe it when they tell you 'oh here is a Ping Pong table you get to use', or 'you can sit anywhere you'd like', because they're too cheap to build their own place, and they're overcrowding this office.

- Numerous business units offer a variety of lateral transfer opportunities
- Not one of the ""bad guys"" of the financial world
- ""Fidelity nice"": a culture heavily focused on comity and professional behavior
- Excellent compensation and benefits","- Probably the most hierarchical management culture I have ever experienced. Management evaluates ideas largely based on the pay grade of who submitted the idea.
- In the technology space, change is excruciatingly slow. Initiatives flow almost exclusively from the top down.
- Performance reviews are based solely on the feedback of your manager, so a poor relationship with your manager (or an indifferent manager) will doom your career.
- Underperforming employees tend to stick around in their current positions (making life difficult for their team members and customers) rather than being nudged into other roles."

The series 7 training is a joke. The trainers that we had were aweful. One used weird metaphors constantly to teach, and when he was told that his metaphors were confusing he would smile and use additional metaphors to explain the other ones. WTF.

You'll learn things such as front end, middle tier, and back end technologies. You are basically getting equipped for your future role within the company. You work closely with your manager and they'll try to find the best role for you. Ie, if you want to work more on front end(html/css/angular), they'll try to find the best role for you. 

Trust me, as a recent college graduate, this program is unreal. It truly is a gateway to success for your Software Engineering career. It helps you get your feet wet, and feel the least bit comfortable to get off to a good start. 

Here is a list of Pros:
- 401k match (7% at 100%) + ~10% profit sharing (Ie: its ultimately 17% 401k match)
- Student Loan Assistance (Up to $10,000) 
- Great networking along the way (You are in classrooms with recent graduates just like you. Great life long friendships and connections were made!)
- Learning Front End, Middle Tier, Back End Technologies (The general ones Fidelity uses.... and no, these aren't legacy software technologies)
- Learning coding concepts/design patterns",There aren't really any cons. You are getting paid to learn(say what?). It is what you make of the program.

There is no way to change things at a decent pace. In my role my manager knows there are issues with how things are run, our director is also aware of them, and the site GM has some knowledge. Each level agrees with our issues and agrees that present solutions make sense, but that they have no power or ability to do anything about it."

Their benefits are really good and affordable, and they have very generous PTO and 6 weeks paid paternity leave for men. I have read a lot of reviews about there being a lack of movement. I can honestly say that I could see that being an issue for some people. In my own experience Fidelity rewards being ambitious. A lot of people here have been in their role for a very long time and become jaded. Be ambitious,  take initiative, and it's not that hard to move up here. Comparitively there is a lot of opportunity here, if you miss out on that you have nobody to blame but yourself. Not to mention every manager I have met at fidelity seems to genuinely care about advancing your career. Quarterly comp is nice. Working from home is a other nice part if fidelity, but this also varies depending on your function.","The salary is the worst part. You get quarterly compensation which is nice and can be a lot depending on your function but they rarely budge on raising your base pay. This is used as an excuse to not raise your base pay when you move around. Also, this is a call center job so not specifically a con to fidelity but these type of jobs have their ups and downs."

4201,Fidelity Investments,good company to start with,2019-09-17,4.0,Senior DS,work is very flexible (can WFH),there were a few organizational changes in my first year
4202,Fidelity Investments,Emerging Leader Program,2019-09-17,3.0,"Associate, Emerging Leader Program","Fidelity at large is a good company to start your career in, there are great people at the firm always willing to lend a hand and offer career help and connections. Different from other financial services companies, Fidelity doesn't work its employees all day and night so you'll have a social life and get sleep.

I joined Fidelity after college as a part of the Emerging Leader Program - a new 18-month rotational program for college graduates based in New England.  The program pros are: 
- Exposure to senior leadership: many 1:1's with VP's, SVP's and executives once in a while
- Opportunity to travel: ad hoc and there is a trip ELP plans to tour the different Fidelity sites
 - Working new jobs/roles: you won't get bored for too long since you are rotating every few months 
- Comradery:  You do the program with other new college grads and you build a great comradery and makes the experience fun as well as gives you great new friends. 
- Connections: different from networking, you will meet great individuals along the path that will be sincerely great mentors, rotational managers, and friends at the firm.","Though the Emerging Leader Program was designed to allow liberal arts graduates to learn about financial services in an ""elite"" program, it has its severe downfalls and ultimately I do not recommend this program to anyone considering starting their career with ELP. My cons are as follows: 

- Commuting: for New England based associates, you are expected to travel to your assigned rotations in either RI, NH, or Boston. These assignments are chosen subjectively by your manager, and you do not know up until 3 or so weeks before your rotation begins. Though you can express interest in rotations that are based in Boston, NOTHING is ever certain or clear, you may be left surprised at your unsatisfying assignment. Not everyone in the program will get assigned a rotation that requires 2+ hours of driving so you may be a part of the unlucky few that is left to drive into the woods for a dark 4 months. You cannot log your miles driven so you do not get reimbursement for gas, the low compensation does not help  cushion the cost either.

- Rotation assignments:  The program  gives associates three 4-month long rotations in different business units within fidelity. If you have an interest in a certain group - finance, strategy, personal investing, etc. there is no certainty that you will be able to work with them as the rotations are assigned by topics - operations, product, and data analytics (which they don't even stick to half the time so it's unorganized). The way these are assigned are subjectively your manager who you share your interests with but they ultimately decide where you will go. You may be left unhappy and confused at what you are assigned and the lack of skills developed in 4 months. Management hammers into you to ""trust the process"" but I caution you not to. The lack of structure to how placements are assigned is the single biggest downfall of the program since final placement is correlated to the work experience you have or haven't been able to build in the past 18 months. 

- Compensation: the comp is way too low for an ""elite"" program and compared to similar programs at other firms!!

-  Diversity and Inclusion: though efforts are being made to advanced inclusion in the firm and program at wide, don't expect Fidelity to be as socially aware as your liberal arts college. You'll find people with similar social consciousness but as a firm they still have a ways to go - though sincere efforts are being made, culture changing is slow at a large firm. This lack of D&I inevitably trickles down to ELP management and the decisions made so enjoy :). 

I see the program thriving in 5-10 years when large structural changes have been made (which are being considered to be transparent). 

TO BE CLEAR - most of my feedback is for ELP and not Fidelity at large, there are great parts of the firm that are healthy and great career drivers that I would highly recommend."
4203,Fidelity Investments,Emerging Leader Program,2019-09-17,2.0,"Associate, Emerging Leader Program","***This review and ratings are oriented towards the Emerging Leader Program, not Fidelity as a firm.***

Meeting Executives: ELP presents several opportunities to meet executives across the firm, and we even have a team Q&A session with the CEO. At the end of the program, we report out a capstone project to all the executives, which is great visibility. 

Enterprise-Wide View: Since you are rotating in all different areas of Fidelity, you get a great view of how the firm functions as a whole. With the firm's initiative to work better as a collective unit (as opposed to silos), this is an opportunity that allows you to bring a lot of insights to different groups. 

Work-life Balance: I have never had an instance where I've had to work more than 40 hours in a week, and management is very flexible if you need to take time off during the day as long as you're getting your work done. Planning vacation is never an issue, management would never say you can't take a vacation or anything like that.","Compensation: Compensation is extremely low for the caliber of people they expect to hire for ELP. They told us they did 'comp' research and that we're in line with other liberal arts grads in the business sector, but for the amount of knowledge and commitment they are asking (jumping around different BUs and delivering business value straight away, commuting over 110 miles a day some months) we are grossly underpaid. Several of us have done research and know we can get at least 25% more at any other comparable role. They tell us that our amazing benefits make up for it, but I don't see many of us, right out of college, using home insurance benefits or ""College Success Planning."" Those of us holding out are hopeful that our final placement salaries will be a significant increase. 

Management: Management is not as up-to-par as would be expected for a program that recruits from elite liberal arts colleges. One of the managers has an online degree from a for-profit university and it shows- no critical thought, inability to understand and digest feedback without getting defensive, and has worked her way up using relationship skills without actually being qualified for her position in regard to merit. Her manager, an SVP, is too busy with her other initiatives and only seems to present herself at the ""fun"" opportunities - team-building sessions, orientation, etc. We as a cohort have no insight into what she is doing for the program or if feedback is being relayed up to her at all. Overall, the management team may be well intentioned but lacks clear direction and minimizes transparency in order to hide the fact that they don't really know what they're doing either. 

Rotations: While ELP may present itself as a cool opportunity to explore different functions, expect to be disappointed when finding out where you got placed. Rotations are based on ""business need,"" meaning that while you may express interest in a particular field, you may end up in a completely different field. Management will try to make it seem okay by pointing out the ""positives,"" but it doesn't address the fact that you may potentially waste four months doing something you have no interest in doing and you could've spent doing something that would actually bring some clarity to your career options. 

Final Placement: Placement after the program is supposed to be based the rotation that you matched the most with and enjoyed doing. However, some people get rotations that have no intention of hiring someone from ELP, and get stuck with getting placed in one of their rotations they didn't enjoy or have to scramble to network to see if there are any opportunities available outside of their rotations. Once that process is done and you have your options (assuming you have more than one option), you don't even know salary information until AFTER informally accepting the full-time position- we're supposed to not worry about salary and instead choose the placement option that best ""aligns"" with our career wants. After this informal acceptance, we then get the ""official"" offer letter and sign that. I've never heard of an instance where you don't know salary information before accepting a role, but like in many other cases where things in the program don't make sense, there is always a ""reason"" for the way things are. 

""Trust the Process"" : If I had a penny for every time I heard ""Trust the Process""...this is the term used by management as a palliative for the program's serious structural issues. Hate the rotation you're in? There's a reason why you got it, you just have to trust the process. Is your rotation not even close to what your career goals are? There's a reason for that, trust the process. If you ever hear this phrase, beware!"

You might have managers or trainers that have never been in your seat, or could not cut it so they transitioned. Makes it difficult to have them coach when they have not done it.

4251,Fidelity Investments,Not For Young Professionals,2019-08-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Biggest selling point they offer is their benefits (generous PTO, student loan reimbursement, 401k match, etc.)","I worked here full time for over three years and it was my first ""real job"" out of college.  Company has a very ""boy's club"" mentality. Most VPs, SVPs, Managers, etc. (in my experience and that I encountered) were men.  If you start here young and fresh out of college, I can almost guarantee you will want to leave after a couple years, but most likely sooner than that. The corporate environment is stifling. Position title means more here than the quality of the individual.  Fidelity's values and corporate policies will state otherwise, but that should only be taken at face value. You may luck out and end up having a great boss and senior leadership team, but from my experience, those are few and far between.  You are just a number here."

4254,Fidelity Investments,Fidelity,2019-08-21,4.0,Operations Manager,"Flexible, competitive,  great benefits and profit sharing.",Different business units can feel like you are working at a completely different company. Still plenty of improvement needs to be done around gender equality. Men are compensated at a higher rate than women and considered first for promotions.

4256,Fidelity Investments,Brokerage Associate Analyst Mutual Funds,2019-08-21,5.0,Associate Operations Analyst,"Get people and benefits, lots of pto",Not the best starting salary
4257,Fidelity Investments,Good Benefits but Unhealthy Bureaucracy,2019-08-21,4.0,Workplace Planning Consultant,Great company to work for if you want a stable income and slowly grow your income over time,if you're in sales your commissions are capped and they have one of the weirdest bonus structures ever.
4258,Fidelity Investments,"Difficult. When you work 401k on the floor, at least when I was there, it’s back to back.",2019-08-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits and amazing healthcare.
401k has a large portfolio, great matching and profit sharing if you are there for years. 
PTO and VTO,  FMLA
Maternity leave 6-7 months, Paternity leave about a month I think. 
Lots of OT for second shift.","Discriminates against pregnant women and then penalizes you and shames you for having to pee frequently. 
Gives too much VTO and doesn’t anticipate proper staffing to help cover 2nd shift at night. 
Pressures employees to do the impossible and demands perfection yet pays crap, and doesn’t even listen to their employees.
PTO can only be planned. They get angry if you have to take sick days. 
They don’t actually give credit to outstanding employees like they should. I was supposed to get a VOC award but the manager who took it never submitted it even after multiple requests. 
They refuse to change your schedule.
The company says they’re family friendly but they really aren’t. 
They force you to sign a sort of gag order which means you’re not allowed to tell incoming employees or potential employees how bad it is while you work there up to a year after you leave.

They expect you to do all of these ridiculous things during a call, jump through hoops in a quick and timely manner however also need to be able to connect with callers while being verbally abused. 
The work environment is a little toxic. Feels like high school. If you’re not in someone’s click then you’re alone. If you’re pregnant they do give you a generous maternity leave however they are prejudice against you if you’re pregnant or become so. I had to constantly get up and go to the bathroom and had severe vertigo, because of that I wasn’t taking calls which caused my stats to go down. I was constantly pulled aside and “coached”, a polite way of reprimanding, and told that I, a pregnant woman, needed to hold it till my breaks. When I called HR about it I was told other pregnant women were held to the same standards, yet my own sister in law was almost fired because of the same issues. Every pregnant woman I’ve known who worked this position quit because of the discrimination. Doing a lawsuit against the company would be pointless because they can just say I wasn’t adhering to my required stats and NH is an at will state.
Word to the wise, don’t plan on starting a family while working on the floor. They will use every excuse under the sun as to why you can’t transfer departments or grow in the company and why you can’t get a different shift. I was 1:30-9:30pm. After I got pregnant I needed to change my schedule because I couldn’t drive at night. But again I was denied. 
I left the company because my mental health tanked so low from verbally abusive callers and an employer who didn’t care about what was going on and from being isolated because it’s like high school, and I was refused a shift change that I desperately needed."
4259,Fidelity Investments,Would give 0 stars if possible,2019-08-20,1.0,Software Engineer,They have decent benefits and pay,"Where to begin...

- Management is just appalling at all levels. One of the managers said ""depression isn't an illness"", which just sums up their entire attitude
- People are placed in roles that may not suit them (or may not be what they applied for), and are just told to suck it up
- Office politics are a joke
- Bullying is ignored
- Employees are left to stagnate if they annoy the wrong person
- Really old tech, complicated systems, way too slow to upgrade
- Use a lot of obscure tech so it's hard to find solutions online
- WFH policy isn't clear, and some managers only allow seniors to WFH, while others allow anyone who's passed probation.
- People in senior positions just because they've been working there a long time, who have no business being that level at all
- All the interesting work is taken from Ireland and given to US teams
- Dublin offices are way out in Citywest, so not an ideal location
- Bad quality laptops with virtual desktops that keep crashing, meaning it can be impossible to get work done
- Everything is slowed down by pointless bureaucracy
- Terrible canteen with unhealthy food that's listed as healthy


Overall, your experience depends entirely on who your manager is. If you get stuck with a bad one (of which there are many), it's nearly impossible to escape from them without handing in your notice."

Fidelity wants to help you succeed and grow in your career!,"The Customer Relationship Advocate position itself is the most draining role at Fidelity Investments. It has the most turnover, not because of Fidelity, but because you are a customer service agent via call center that services over 10 types of accounts, and you’re a stock broker. You deal with about 50-70 clients a day and 90% of them do not understand their accounts and/or the stock market.

Upper management is not there to help build a profitable successful environment but make sure numbers on spread sheet are met. 95% of the people I worked with actively are unhappy with their current job and only stay so they can get their 5 year vesting. I’m truthfully dumbfounded at the lack of communication with management down to reps. I’m disappointed to say I wasted so much time at the company and missed valuable opportunity actually being able to advise build relationships. This company the last two years had tried to put a square peg into a round hole and has lost a lot of talented people. This will continue to be the trend because Fidelity is slow pace when it comes to change. Culture there was absolutely horrible with people just struggling through daily life and I hope those who read this can take this as a warning!

Recently they wasted 27 million dollars during adoption of third party vendor product. They could not identify until later stages it was not the product for their need. Such is the expertise of folks here. Clearing interview is easy here so no expertise at all. People who work here get stuck for long time not able to get out, since they do work here on developed legacy systems, which are like 10 years backward in the industry.
Central infrastructure team provides infra which are just wrappers over APIs like spring APIs or so which just make u useless upon using it. Since u won't know the actual technology since u just use the wrapper APIs . If you are very nice at pleasing management, then u get promotions and not based on the ability or work done.

I was an employee for over 12 years and always felt I was underpaid at the base salary.  They don’t seem interested in retaining hard working, SP rating employees who execute on the work.

They will tell you there is no “mandatory” overtime but there is and if you opt out of it you will get nasty messages. Bonuses are based off of call surveys which sometimes you will get a bad survey that wasn’t even from a call you took and there’s nothing you can do about it. Even if you move to another product you will still be overloaded with 401k calls. If you have to go to the bathroom and it’s not during a break or lunch it counts against you. If you don’t plan your days off at least a month in advanced it counts against you. There are more things that count against you then for you. The environment has gotten really bad lately and you can feel it when you walk in the door. Fidelity throws benefits at you but then doesn’t bother to check in on the call center.

4516,Fidelity Investments,Not a bad place to start off,2019-04-03,4.0,Retirement Planner Associate,"Flexibility: This entry-level position allows me the ability to set my own schedule. As long as I work 40 hours in a week and make a certain number of calls a day, I can show up at 7 AM or 10 AM. (This is uncommon throughout the company)

Time off: Fidelity starts at 18 days of paid time off per year.  After two years, it is bumped to 23. I love this. It's higher than what a lot of companies offer people with years of experience - at Fidelity it is standard. The negative, however, is that this PTO encompasses all personal time - you don't get any sick/personal/voluntary time off in addition to your PTO. (Excluding federal requirements, maternity, etc.)
Benefits: Fidelity will pay up to $10k in student loan debt over the course of 5 years ($2k a year, or $167 a month.) They'll also reimburse you (you pay up front) 90% of college tuition/coursework costs, up to $10k a year. I am taking advantage of both these programs.
Advancement: Fidelity is not a meritocracy and you cannot move up just by doing your job well and going home at 5. That being said, there is a 'Fidelity way' of doing things, it's pretty simple, and only requires a little bit of off the clock time. In addition, I've never met anyone that won't tell you what their job is or how they got there. Upper management is easily accessible and they often participate in career coaching or mentorship sessions/programs. 
401k benefits: After one year of service, Fidelity will match you dollar for dollar up to 7% of your paycheck. Also, profit sharing at year end can be 10% of your annual salary deposited one time to your 401k. (10+7= 17% of your salary for free to your 401k.) Benefits vest 20% a year for 5 years.","Pay: You'll get less in salary than at other financial services firms. Fidelity tries to compensate for this with their generous benefits programs. I don't have much experience to compare these to other firms. 
Networking: As mentioned above, networking is necessary to move up here. It doesn't come naturally to me, so I put it in the cons. It does require extra time and thought, and the company won't pay you to shadow other positions."

They were extreme micromanagers and very cliquey with each other.  They made it known who they favored and many deserving associates couldn't progress in their roles simply because they weren't favored.  You have to take your breaks and lunches at the exact times they schedule you for (which differed every day) and if you got stuck on a call and went on break late, it would negatively affect your numbers - which ultimately decided your bonus.  This place is a sweatshop.  You are expected to take non stop calls your entire shift.  There is no break in between calls so you aren't even left with time to make notes on the customers accounts you just spoke to - as soon as they hang up, another call immediately comes through with no choice to decline the call.  On average there is at least a 5-10 minute wait  for customers to get through to a representative.  Customers are already aggravated by the time you speak to them - it's like the company sets you up for failure.  They clearly need to hire more people for the role.  The turnover rate is so high because employees are so unhappy.  Glad I'm out of there."
4519,Fidelity Investments,Great company and culture,2019-04-02,5.0,Retirement Associate,"The team I worked in was small enough to where everyone knew each other and it felt like a group of friends/family.

You’ll be on the phones constantly with your breaks scheduled for you. You only get time off of the phones to be yelled at by your manager for stupid, minuscule details. Nothing you do will ever be good enough.  The constant barrage of awful customers on the phone and negative feedback from management will wear you down.  And trying to get a role off the phones?  Don’t even think about it!  You’re stuck with the stigma of being a call center employee. 
Bottom line - This place will suck the life out of you. The day I walked out was one of the best days of my life."

Don't get me wrong, the benefits are good: 7% 401(k) matching, 10% profit sharing, good quality of life (at 5PM on the spot the place is like a stampede,) and rarely do vacations get cancelled.","* Low pay. Fidelity's attractiveness comes from their retirement package but, at the end of the day, the base salary is comparatively low and it does NOT make up for the profit sharing or the additional 4% 401(k) matching contributions. I've been testing the market for a while and found out that I could easily be making 15-20% more (base salary) anywhere else. If you're considering getting a job here, be careful with the trade off because FI does NOT like, and rarely gives out, salary increases.

* Affirmative Action central. Whether you like it or not, there's a surplus of testosterone among Wall Street management levels. It's no secret. So FI has embarked in a program to even things out, which means that most of the people getting promoted as of lately are females and/or minorities. 

* Shady stuff going on. I've seen things that are outright a-legal. I can't say it was illegal because I was not privy to the final product but, having taken countless compliance classes (which you are required to take on an annual basis,) that we are exposed to this BS in such a in-your-face manner is really irritating.

* Management has ZERO people skills. There's a manager in our department that is well known to NOT like to work with other men (everybody knows this,) and he has zero men working with him. Instead of this raising a red flag, it is tolerated an even joked about as if it were... normal. In addition, when hired, I was told that the manager was looking for people to speak up in meetings... only to find out that they seems to promote the polar opposite. This seems to be ""The Norm"" at Fidelity: Say one thing, do another. There's... I don't know how to describe it... just a ""shady"" feel to the way they do business. I wouldn't be surprised if FI is in the news one day for having broken some kind of SEC rule soon. Case and point: A colleague of mine recently quit the company. His manager set up an exit interview to find out what the reasons for his departure were. They were in the conference room for 45 minutes and, according to my colleague, the manager did 95% of the talking. This is the kind of craziness you will be dealing with if you join FI."

4558,Fidelity Investments,The only review that matters,2019-03-17,1.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,"Beautiful campus
You don't take work home
Big name to add to your resume","Honestly there are a lot of cons. I'll start with pay. The pay is definitely below market value. It's a hot economy and Fidelity openly admits that it pays less because the compensation is weighed more towards benefits. The problem is the benefits here aren't all that great. For example it takes 5 years to get vested in your 401k and a year before you are eligible for any match from the company. This may have been more impressive a few years ago, but many companies will vest you day 1 or within the first year of employment along with a match. 

Career advancement is slim to none for new associates. They have a career center on campus to help provide options for career growth, but the positions just aren't very attractive (phone work and processing work for various business units) and the level of effort to get those jobs is the same as just applying and interviewing for an outside role. There are too many hoops to jump through to move up within the company and honestly most people are in entry level roles for years before they move onto something else. Do you want to guarantee that you make entry level pay for years in this economy?

The biggest con is definitely the work itself. I worked in a phone role in PI and it was without a doubt the worst professional experience I've ever had. Imagine having to describe something you hated day in and day out with a character limit. This is my dilemma. 

The job is ultimately a burnout job. You take 50-60 calls a day while processing requests in customer's accounts. There are numerous challenges whether it is explaining complex trading strategies to people, helping an 80 year old log into Fidelity.com and locating documents, telling a customer you cannot recommend specific stocks to them, calming down an angry customer cussing at you. It goes on and on. This isn't to mention challenges related to technology or hold times within departments. You're getting hit from all sides and will disappoint a lot of customers with Fidelity's policies (and lack of exceptions). The worst part of this job is knowing you did it and didn't build any meaningful experience to add to your resume. You never get to think for yourself or lead any sort of project since you're always on the assembly line.

I would advise strongly against working here."

Don't count on advancing unless you spend a lot of time networking with the people/ groups that you are looking to move into. 
Culture especially in the call center can be an issue. A lot of office politics and harassment issues that get swept under the rug by management.  Some are addressed appropriately (if HR gets involved) but there were numerous occasions I have seen management quietly sweep issues under the rug, discourage people from calling HR to protect other employees and things like people getting promoted after sleeping with their boss.

4741,Fidelity Investments,Associate Software Engineer (Leap Program),2018-12-09,2.0,Associate Software Engineer (Leap Program),"Good benefits (compared to other companies with the same base salary).
401k matches up to 7% of your salary.
Total compensation (bonus, profit sharing, retirement contributions) becomes high if you stay there for a long time (5+ years).
In general, difficult to get fired unless you really mess up.
There are established Leap communities to hang out with, where ever you are placed after completing the Leap Program.","Low base salary and total compensation for new graduates. If you don't plan on staying at Fidelity for at least 5 years, your total compensation would be better if you moved around companies or started your career at a different company.

Average software engineers. There are a few software engineers that perform above and beyond. There are several that plan to do the bare minimum and collect a paycheck. The technical interviews were not very hard, and the ability of the software engineers reflects this. This is not a great place for top (new grad) software engineers. It takes too much time (5 years) for the total compensation to be worth it.

Risk of disliking the business unit you are placed in after the Leap program. You don't get to talk directly with your after-placement manager, your Leap manager will place you after getting to know your interests and personality. I feel like 1 in 3 Leap graduates are not satisfied with their role after placement. With some bad luck, you can be placed in a business unit that offers no growth in useful technologies, no learning opportunities, and no help from senior engineers (my experience). Or with some good luck, you could be using the newest technologies with good mentors, and learning a lot. In general, they expect you to stay at least a year in your current business unit before moving, but you can tell within 6 months whether or not if the business unit and its progress are good enough for you. It is a huge gamble to enter the Leap program, knowing there is a decent chance the business unit you will be placed in will not be that worthwhile. It's up to you if you want to roll the dice. 

Emphasis on company loyalty. They tell you to focus on the ""product knowledge"",  which is useful to you only as long as you are working for Fidelity, but it's not great if you plan to leave Fidelity at any time in your life. They entice you with a total compensation that increases exponentially from 0 to 5 years. This means a below average total comp at 0 years and an above average total comp after 5 years. Many are promoted based on years of service. Even if you perform twice as well, you will not be promoted twice as quickly - it would be better for you to just switch jobs.

Slow moving technology. The company is slowly moving towards agile, cloud, and other new technologies, but change is extremely slow for financial companies. This means you might not be developing skills that are useful in your career the moment you leave Fidelity. Fidelity claims to be a technology company that specializes in finance, but improvements in technology are often hindered by business desires, such as excessive spending on contractors, and not enough spending on code refactoring and architecture improvements. Its not great for your career to be constantly one step behind everyone else."

4800,Fidelity Investments,It's who you know or who you are,2018-11-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great place in general, it meets my basic needs. Great company match, Great profit sharing program, if you work there long enough the pay becomes sufficient depending on your lifestyle. I've been here over a decade and would love to retire here but would love a true opportunity to advance.","There are so many people in one place that advancement becomes next to impossible unless you know the right people are of a specific group. My experience might not be everyone's. There are a ton of business units and opportunities but it seems most jobs that are posted appear to already have a specific type in mine if not a specific person already, but they go through the motions. When the company makes a push for something they are singularly focused, the push for millennials means you see tons of your people advancing which means older, tenured workers are relegated to associate roles. When the push is to empower women, there are networks, seminars and women helping women, sometimes to the detriment of males, especially if the manager is a woman (this is not a misogynist statement). My demographic, african-american male is the bottom rung of every category it seems. There are few leaders in my part of the country with no Sr. Level leaders that I am aware of on the national level? I've been searching the corporate hierarchy for years, while I don't have time to cycle through all 30-40K employees to try and find one that looks like me, it also shouldn't be that difficult if the company is truly as diverse as it thinks it is. I am not saying affirmative action is needed, I'm saying there has to be some qualified person of color (black) that can advance? I realize advancement is based on merit, but as previously stated merit is not the determining factor, it's who you know or your demographics in the vast majority of decisions. The company would rather invest time, effort, and energy in selecting and grooming a mentee that fits the bill than hiring a more experienced individual and doing the same. If you are over 40, black, male then you can work there, you just can't advance."

-Good benefits. 
-Very nice campus! 
-They don't hire for upper positions outside of the company.","-VERY VERY MICROMANAGED! Get ready to feel like you're in middle school.
-They don't really tell you in the interview that it's just a call center. 
-They do not pay enough nor do they negotiate salaries. Everyone starts off at $38k no matter your experience. So you will make the same as the recent college grad that started with you. 
-What they expect you to know and the quality of work they expect does not match the pay.
-Very very corporate! Management cares about you as a worker- not a person. They only care about you as long as it affects them. 
-If it's super busy, be ready to lose your voice. This is an inbound call center and the calls just come in. You're not picking up the phone. You get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. If you decide that your throat hurts or you have to use the bathroom outside of your two breaks, be ready to hear about how you violated the ""call avoidance policy"" which can eventually get you fired. 
-Even when you pass the series 7 & series 66, you only make 6-8 thousand more- which puts you at $44k-$46k.
-When you first start here, you have to work 12-8:30pm. This isn't a huge deal except for the fact that they make all the newer people work noon-8:30 but everyone else goes home at 5pm leaving you with not much support.
-Team leads WILL NOT take your 'angry customer' calls. They just tell you what to say - which only frustrates customers more. 
-You must have diabetes or low blood pressure to switch your lunch. 
-They don't hire for upper positions outside of the company. This is a pro and a con.  It's a con because these managers are being brought up from a system that has a lot of flaws but by that time, they've bought in to the things that need change whereas someone in upper management from the outside could see it a lot sooner and do something about it. 
-They do not believe in fun here. ""Fun"" means buying a pizza and juice that you can try to eat if it's slow in between calls or on your lunch."

4919,Fidelity Investments,Financial Adviser at Fidelity  = Churn and Burn,2018-09-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you work hard and you are smart you can make an attractive income in the Financial Adviser (Consultant) role. Company benefits are fantastic. Fidelity has a very respected and recognized brand. Largest 401k provider in the US, provides amazing cross selling opportunities.","There are many.

1) Financial Advisers have 300-1000 households to support and no real help to do so. The support staff is too inexperienced to do much more than help with some admin stuff and if they are good enough to actually help clients they move into a Financial Adviser role.

2) Your experience as an adviser can be made much worse by terrible managers who micro manage and have little knowledge of what you actually do.

3) Assuming 1 and 2 above, Financial Consultant role is too much of a grind to be a career. You either spend 2-5 years there and then move into management or you burn out and leave.

Advisers have 300-1000+ households and there is no meaningful compensation for retention of assets given the book sizes. ($40k year for a $200 mil managed money book? - book generates $1.5 - $2 mil annual revenue and you give the adviser $40k?)

Vast majority of your comp is tied to annual sales and what you have done in the past means nothing. Therefore clients that have a plan and 100% wallet share are undesirable.

Since company is so large and has so many clients they need to fill the chairs with advisers quickly. Many advisers are 20 and 30 somethings with little or no background in finance, they do the bare minimum for planning and only want to sell products and managed accounts. There is little incentive to really deliver a sound plan because that actually takes time and who has time with 1000 clients?

Overall - the reality is Fidelity is good for “mass affluent” financial help but they are too big and cookie cutter to truly help people with more than  $3-$5 mil. Due to size they have to reduce services to lowest common denominator to ensure consistency."

There is a reason for this.,The beauty covers the horrific harassment that is taking place in this company. There is a male manager that goes after women as his prey and tries to force them out of the company. The higher ups know about this and continually cover it up. I hope the owner reads this and goes to the Morrisville NC site to take a deeper look at all male managers. There are women managers that like to bully. This needs addressing as well. I would never recommend this company to anyone. As you see the beauty of the building it quickly deteriorates into a horrible reality that no woman should have to endure.

Oh! And if you have a meeting planned or your computer doesn’t feel up to the challenge of running for the day- that’s counts against you too!

It is very demoralizing to feel like you have done an amazing job and the customer was happy with your service, but Fidelity and there impossible metrics- not so much. 

4. You are expected to know everything! There is a chat where you can ask questions and get the help you need, just keep in mind it’s one person helping a team of over 25+ people at once!

A co worker went to the hospital and was told ""don't they have Wi-Fi?"". They tout being able to work from home and having a laptop as a benefit. Sadly it just enables the expectation that you are available at all hours.  Tasks are often assigned with no training and there is a high possibility that most management doesn't know how to do it. However you are held to perfectionist standards with exacting measure. My department was constantly reorganizing and for several days in a row no one was quite sure what their job parameters or management was. Needless to say many people are leaving and they are not filling their spots. The poor people left are taking on the slack. It is not uncommon to see long leaves of absence due to the stress this job puts on your body.

We were all told (by the president of a business unit) that pay would not be negatively affected by an operating model change. I know multiple people who's salaries were adjusted down.

Upper management is extremely patronizing. Though they attempt to cover it up there is very much a culture of ""Mommy/Daddy knows best"" when it comes to making decisions. This thought process is extremely embedded into culture there; so much so that despite a huge organizational change, my team's day-to-day work is still prioritized by a person who is two or three pay grades above my ""boss"". 

They also say that career mobility is something they encourage. In practice, getting in tough with internal hiring managers is laborious and conversations are often derailed by administrative interference. 

If you do work here, do your due diligence when vetting who you'll be working with. It's easy to get with people that drink the Kool-Aid."

Customer service is not actually the priority. They have no problem encouraging their employees to get off the phone quickly to get to the next call. You are punished if you don't take enough calls (if you work an 8 hour shift, and take less than 50 phone calls that day, that is considered not meeting your goal). Management will coach you to take more calls than breaths you take. They present all of this in a way that sounds advantageous to you, but in reality it is just another corporation out to make the most money for themselves, and risk the sanity of their employees for that. 
The expectations change almost weekly. It's impossible to keep up with them.
Management will make you feel like you suck at your job before acknowledging that the things they request are unrealistic. AKA taking 8-10 calls per hour just to get a little above the bare minimum on the bonus scale.
""Coaching"" is not really coaching. They aren't ""helping you grow"" they are basically reading from the most generic customer service model.

I am not just an individual that had a really negative experience, I still work there because I can't find anything that pays that well.

Fidelity tries to make it seem like their is ""a ton of career growth"", but really it is just customer service phone job after customer service phone job.

They move you around to different departments to make it seem like you are being ""promoted"", but really it is the same old crap.

I worked in the Stock Plan Service group in SLC, and was excited to find a career path I was interested in.... Only to find out that Fidelity's generous $10k per year tuition reimbursement policy doesn't apply to you getting THE ONE CERTIFICATION THAT IS 100% applicable to your job. 

You wanna know why? Because everyone who gets it leaves for way higher paying jobs elsewhere. Of course, Fidelity will never tell you that's the real reason.

As soon as I found that out, I started shooting my resume out to competitors in the industry. I easily received multiple offers, off the phone, for way more money. I suggest you do the same!

Oh, and Fidelity does this really cool thing called ""loans"". Basically they promote you to a higher position, give you more work and responsibility but don't pay you any more money. How generous of them, right?"

There isn't that much room for growing despite it being a finance company. The job itself is not finance related, so unless you develop your skills outside of work, you can't really move away from the call center.

Managers aren't that helpful. They will spend time trying to coach you on things that might not even matter, or might not even work. They will tell you they will look for opportunities for you, but you are on your own.

Required to stay at your role for 1 year.

Long term for vest/match to go through

Company values high metrics, regardless of how you handle your job. Good Metrics = good benefits, even if you don't do your job correctly

The new system you're learning will probably change again in 3-5 years. If a review for Fidelity is negative honestly they're probably in the wrong role.

If you’re a minority keep your head down and do your work. This company lies about everything and makes up their own rules that goes against their written policy. If you are faced with a discrepancy, chain of command does not help. Managers are very controlling and seek to sabotage careers if they could. Micromanagement is very real in this workplace, management will yell at you in front of others and back each other up to make you look “combative”. Constant changes, no resolutions for errors the company is making. So basically you’re taking the brunt of the heat from clients all day. The pay is horrible, the managers try to make it seem like your raise is a lot, when in reality at most the raises won’t raise you above the $40k threshold. The company isn’t for the best interest of the client don’t believe that I’ve seen so much where Fidelity does things to hurt the client more than help them. I can write a book about this place. Don’t waste your mental health here and it’s a lie if you think that upward mobility is possible.

It is nice to assocaite with other representatives when there is time (which is almost never).  Almost every one of my peers had a friendly personality which went a long ways on the bad days (which was most of them).  
-Management was reasonable and let me leave the phone position to an internal operations position before I had been working there one year.","-First of all, it is a call center job.  The title makes it sound fancier and in the interview they might make you think you are going to be doing a lot more things related to investments than you actually will.  Probably 80% of calls are password resets and simple financial transactions.
-Benefits are good as a percentage, but my base salary was so much lower than what I made after I left that 7%  401k match AND 10% profit sharing was less than 4.5% 401k match at my current company.  There are a lot of benefits that most people don't use that they use to justify how great the benefits are.  Like adoption assistance, tuition reimbursement, college loan assistance.  Just do the math with what you will use and how much you'll get with your salary.  Remember that your base salary grows exponentially with raises and your benefits grow based on that.  Lower base salary now = even lower base salary in 10 years.
-They say they pay for the CFA; they don't.  They specifically told me in the interview that they pay for CFA prep classes.  It also says that in the tuition reimbursement documentation.  There is one stipulation though.  It only qualifies if you take the class from an accredited university.  I don't know of any official universities that offer specific CFA review classes (you take the review classes to prepare for the test, not to get college credit).  I had a friend who took Kaplan review classes and then fought with them for months for the reimbursement and ended up just giving up.  I took and passed two CFA tests while there without a penny going towards the classes.  I don't know if they are intentially tricking people or if nobody knows enought about the CFA to know that the stipulation the put on it makes it null.
-The job itself is miserable.  So many metrics that you have to hit, fielding literally thousands or random questions and complaints.  Constant coaching (telling you what you do wrong).  One time I got ""feedback"" for saying ""no problem"" because ""problem"" is a negative word.  There were days when I would get up, take a shower, get dressed and then call in and go back to sleep because I just couldn't bring myself to go back there again. Some people were ok with it though.  Most, like me, were not.
-Schedules can be bad.  I worked every Saturday after I finished training until I left.  Other people got it much better and others got it much worse."

Often in areas where there aren’t many other good jobs. Upper management wants to do the right thing, but often dies in the middle.","My biggest issue is with middle management. If associates don’t want to go into sales, the only other option is management, which is often not a good fit. You’d have managers who just weren’t “people” people, who would be leading a team of 20+. Managers also have the ability to make or break your career. They control your pay, bonuses, reviews and even promotions. I don’t believe one (possibly inept) person should have control over basically your life. Favoritism runs rampant, which is awesome if you’re a favorite, sucks if you’re not. I had many managers, some who loved me and would mentor and promote me and sing my praises from the rooftop, and then others who gave me very low performance reviews (how is this possible?) 

They’re just SO HUGE with so many different business groups that people wouldn’t know what jobs are out there. Sales or management was all people knew, wish there was more transparency so people who aren’t fit for mgmt wouldn’t go into those roles. Upper management initiates also die at the middle management level due to their inertia and stubbornness."

5492,Fidelity Investments,Not for strong performers looking for a long-term stay,2018-01-19,2.0,Senior Quality Assurance Engineer,"There are two details worth noting before beginning my review.  First, every organization within Fidelity is siloed from the rest and even within an organization different departments can be run in a very different manner.  As such the experience can be wildly different depending on where you land.  Glassdoor will not let me post the name of my particular organization so all I can say is that we focused on workplace investing and I was a QA in the tech department.  My review is based on my placement.  Second, different levels within tech are ranked based on letter designations.  A TA is an entry-level engineer, TB is an engineer, and TC is a senior engineer.  TD is either a principal/lead engineer or a manager and every letter higher is a leadership position. 

1) Benefits and Initial Compensation
For those hired outside the company, the initial salary will typically fall around the market average plus any position at a TB level or above qualifies for a bonus.  The benefits are also very competitive.  The retirement package is practically unbeatable with a 7% match and 10% profit sharing contribution each year.  Health insurance rates were constantly creeping higher but were still reasonable and coverage was strong.  PTO was very generous for salaried employees.  There literally aren't enough desks for the employees so most people are allowed to work from home at least a few days a week.  There are also a handful of minor perks that you can enjoy like a small reimbursement for the purchase of fitness equipment or extra payments made towards existing student loans, up to $2000 a year for five years.

2) Campus
The main Durham campus has been extensively renovated over the years and for the most part is very nice.  Every floor follows the open-office concept which makes for a loud and exposed experience at a desk and the conference rooms have glass walls so privacy for meetings is sorely lacking.  Also, the stairways and back hallways have not been renovated and tend to smell like mouse traps thanks to a constant rodent problem.  However, the main spaces are well-lit and nicely decorated, desks are generally well-equipped, the front entrance makes a good first impression, parking is plentiful, the outdoor walking paths allow a chance for some fresh air, and there are certain on-site amenities that employees can use like a health clinic, tech support bar, cafeteria, and small gym.  Bear in mind that the latter two are not particularly cheap or well-equipped and are more for convenience than a cost-saving measure for employees.

3) The Employees
In the years that I worked here I met some wonderful people at the TA-TC level and a few at the TD level.  Even though I have left the company I still make an effort to stay in touch with these individuals and am glad to call them friends.","1) Long-Term Compensation
While the initial package can be competitive the generosity will deplete very rapidly over time.  Even in a good year strong performers were lucky to get a yearly raise over 2-2.5%.  Raises for promotions, at least from TB to a principal/lead level, were an embarrassing 5% plus the potential for an extra 5% to the bonus.  HR and leadership would constantly try to use bonuses as an excuse for low salaries by claiming that it could help hard workers make up for the difference in their declining salaries but due to fine print the bonuses rarely met the advertised amounts.  For example, a TB qualifies for ""up to"" a 15% bonus.  However, bonuses are paid from a special budget that typically gets funded 80-90% in a good year.  Bonuses are also based on performance and even a strong performer would typically get 80-90% approved while an average performer could get 50% or less.  This math means that even during a particularly strong year for the company  a top performer is likely to see their 15% bonus come in at around 8-10%.  In spite of all the articles Fidelity posts about how to convince one's boss to increase one's wages there is zero room for compromise here.  The typical excuse from management is that if they adjusted someone's salary it would only make that person happy for a few years before that person would fall behind the market and complain again so management is better off leaving people where they're at.  Meanwhile salaries are regularly adjusted for Leap hires leading to TAs and TBs making more than many TCs and TDs.  To put the compensation gap into further perspective, many top performers were making more than 20% under market value after 2-4 years at Fidelity.

2) Low Technical Innovation
Technology here tends to lag behind true tech companies by 5-10 years and most of the higher level staff don't keep up with the times which means that even when new tech is pushed it is usually done without proper planning or understanding.  QA has yet to adopt an effective strategy for automation, they are still primarily using expensive licensed products instead of moving towards open-source, and the majority of the QA staff has little to no practical experience with automation or development.  Dev only cares about pushing out as much new stuff as possible with no regard for design or long-term quality as shown by the complete lack of unit tests or acceptance criteria.  Focus areas that would seem to be up-to-date fall short.  The mobile apps for example have consistently scored ratings that are average at best and are prone to performance issues, bad design choices, and bugs.  Most of the projects claim to be agile but every single agile project that I worked on was just a waterfall project with agile terminology mixed in.  It was common to see 6-12+ month projects that claimed to be agile even though every proposed feature was committed to by management on day one with no input from the team.  Even with hot technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies Fidelity pretends to be paying close attention while remaining willfully blind behind the scenes.  This lack of innovation and understanding can have an impact on engineers besides making the projects boring or frustrating.  If you aren't making a personal effort on your own time to keep your skills sharp and instead rely on your job to provide this exposure then you will quickly find yourself falling far behind the market.

3) Leap
Leap is a program used to recruit college graduates.  Every single year hundreds of new, largely inexperienced TAs from across the nation are hired and put through one of the various tracks, software development for example, for six months in the Leap program before being placed in an organization.  The first two months are classroom training and the latter four are spent on a project.  Unfortunately Leap's training does nothing to prepare these associates for their career.  The classes are too generic and broad and instead of using in-house staff to help provide mentoring the Leap management hires external contractors with no experience in the company and sometimes little experience in the field.  Even in the rare cases that internal management or company representatives did lead a particular class session their talk was focused more on random Fidelity information like the makeup of the executive team or pictures of the various campuses instead of useful material for the particular track.  The projects meanwhile are throwaways that rarely serve any purpose beyond keeping the Leap participants busy.  The problems don't end with Leap graduation either.  Hundreds of TAs are being brought in yearly but the company will rarely need hundreds of new TBs or TCs each year and TD roles are incredibly rare so the result is that many engineers find little room to grow once they are placed in their organization.  The company refuses to release official numbers but the general consensus is that turnover among Leap grads within their first two years of placement is abysmal.

4) Politics
The only way you could find a more political workplace is if you went to work for Congress.  A strong performer would generally still get raises and could potentially work their way up to a TC level but for the most part recognition and job security were more about cozying up to leadership than going above and beyond in your job.  Talented engineers were constantly leaving because they were being passed over for promotions or opportunities in favor of poor talent that played into the politics.  The best example of politics would be the yearly review process.  Like most companies Fidelity forces employees to fill out a self-evaluation each year then go through an end-of-year review with their manager.  However, unlike most companies Fidelity uses a process called common judgement.  Months before employees can even fill out the evaluations all of the leadership, managers and above, go off for a few days to collectively decide the rankings and rewards for everyone.  As you can imagine this turns into more of a popularity contest.  If employee A did great work while employee B was average at best but B kissed the feet of more people in the room then B was likely to get a better review than A.  Ratings are also based on ridiculous factors like the time you've spent in your current position or whether the final results resembled a bell curve distribution.  Someone may be a strong performer but if the bell curve is skewing left or they haven't been in the role as long as others, even lower performers, they'll likely get an average rating.  It also means that the entire process of filling out self-evaluations is a farce.

5) Career Growth
Many of the employees at a TD level or above are lifers regardless of any value they may or may not add in their role.  Between this, politics, and the massive influx of TAs from Leap there is a bottleneck around the TC level.  Most associate engineers can get promoted to a TB level eventually but to get to a TC level is a mix of a waiting game and politics and to move above that is a matter of even more politics plus being lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.  Discussions with one'smanager on how to move up are met with excuses on top of excuses.  The most common claim is that an associate has to be performing at a given level for a certain undisclosed amount of time before being moved to said level which equates to strong employees doing work well above their pay grade without any reward for their efforts apart from an empty promise that if they keep it up eventually they may get promoted.  

6) Morale
While Fidelity likes to keep their inner workings private the fact is that they've been systematically laying off thousands of employees over the past two years.  One event back in the summer of last year in which hundreds of people were let go just a month after thousands of other employees voluntarily left managed to leak out to the media and made the news.  In another recent round 100% of leadership in a personal investments organization was forced to reapply for their jobs, 75% were kicked out, and the remaining 25% that got through didn't even receive a pay bump for being rehired.  The expectations for each department are not decreasing, if anything they're increasing, so those who survive a layoff are left with significantly more work to do.  Meanwhile, in spite of record profits continuing to pad the pockets of the millionaires and billionaires running the company the yearly raises and promotions for regular engineers have remained static.  Work/life balance has become a pipe dream.  If you keep your head down, only do the work assigned to you without signing up for anything else, and only perform at an average level you may manage a reasonable work/life balance but strong performers are increasingly expected to pick up any slack in their departments and do more without any reward in return.  It was common to see 1-2 engineers doing well over 75% of the work for their team while putting in nights, weekends, and holidays or vacation days.  Many strong engineers considered it a light week if they only had to do 60 hours.  Allocation was irrelevant.  You could be assigned 100% to one project but you would still expect you to take up additional project work under the table, usually under some false pretenses of being a volunteer activity in which you were forced to participate.  This was made even worse by the overload of meetings that many teams engaged in.  It was common for project members to spend 40-60% of their week in meetings, the vast majority of which added no value, but management would not consider the meetings when planning the project timeline so engineers would still have a full load of tasks to perform on top of the meetings.  Some managers engaged in morally questionable activities like cheating hourly employees out of overtime or trying to cheat former employees out of earned PTO days.  Also, a quick search online will review numerous lawsuits that have been filed against the company in recent years by current or former employees.  If you complain to HR they will either tell you that they aren't concerned with your thoughts or they'll leak information back to your manager and you'll be punished for ""unrelated reasons"".  Needless to say, when combined with the other issues already listed above it's no surprise that morale here was sorely lacking. 

7) Leadership
Every single issue listed here and more all point to one major problem - leadership.  To say that leadership in my organization operated like a ""good old boys club"" would be an understatement and their ignorance was matched only by their arrogance.  QA leadership was the worst but dev wasn't far behind.  Across the board there is a lack of even basic knowledge regarding quality assurance, software development, or general industry trends and zero attempts are made to improve.  You could count on one hand the number of TDs and above in QA who could write ""Hello World"" or even a decent manual test case and still have unused fingers.  Many so-called leaders would even argue that it wasn't their job to know or understand such things.  Since leadership has no idea what they are doing with regards to technology much of the work that principal/lead engineers and managers should perform, including testing strategies or resource needs, is being pushed off to junior engineers who are better equipped for the task.  However, while leadership does nothing to support these lower-level engineers leadership would still take credit for successful deliveries or, if a release went poorly,  throw the junior staff under the bus.  This brings up the issue with leadership having no idea how to handle modern engineers or how to run a modern tech department.  The general mindset is reminiscent of an 80s approach.  For example, at a departmental all-hands meeting last fall, the only such meeting all year, senior leadership in the department acknowledged the drastic turnover among TA-TC engineers but then proceeded to rant about those ""darn millennials"" expecting gifts just for doing their work and how these young people should be ""grateful they have a job"".  Never mind that these TA-TC engineers are keeping the department afloat while being ripped off in every feasible way and openly insulted.  The general attitude from TDs on up was that they were above the common rabble.  They'll steal a lower level engineer's ideas because they have none of their own but still insist that because they outrank that engineer on paper they are somehow more intelligent.  In an effort to pad the budgets and feign importance it was common to see an overabundance of leaders in project teams.  There were assignments with one lead or manager for every 1-2 engineers even as the engineers did the work the leads and managers should have been doing.  Budget for employee expenses has been reduced to practically nothing.  Those below a TD level rarely get to travel, the laptops and other hardware are painfully dated, even small recognition awards like $20 gift cards have been cut, and there are frequent cases of managers forcing their employees to attend team lunches while making each team member foot their own bill.  Meanwhile management can afford catering for their ""leadership building"" events, it is common to see senior leadership traveling 1-2 times a month just to check in on their teams, and many senior leaders have brand new equipment even though they are least in need of such devices.  Leadership will ask for feedback but if you do anything other than sing their praises they will complain to your that you aren't a team player or, chew you out in your next 1:1, or give you a bad performance rating.  Attempts by previous leadership from years past to at least pretend that they cared about the opinions of those beneath them, an anonymous online suggestion box or anonymous yearly surveys for example, have been shut down under the reign of the current leadership team because according to them it wasn't conductive to their goals.  The executive team makes no effort whatsoever to reach out to the TA-TC engineers and turns a blind eye to everything going on beneath them so long as the leadership teams reporting to them bows down and claims everything is fine.  The executive team also makes poor decisions without doing proper research or math on the consequences.  For example, right before the layoffs last summer many of the older staff members in the company were ""offered"" a buyout.  The executive team grossly underestimated the number of individuals that would take the buyout, by almost 50% according to most sources, which means that a lot of teams lost a lot of experience and talent which in turn reduced the productivity of those teams greatly.  Perhaps the best recent example of leadership here is to point to a particular team that was once a gem for technology in the company.  Under the expert guidance of an externally-hired leader the team was able to blaze the initial trail for modern day testing in the company.  A few years ago though the executive team decided to force the leader overseeing the team to a new department and bring in a longtime company veteran as a replacement.  Under the awful reign of this new individual within 18 months over 2/3 of the staff on the team had left the company, multiple HR complaints had been filed against the new leader, and the team had become a shell of it's former self.  Thanks to the ""good old boys"" mentality though this leader hasn't even received a slap on the wrist and they along with their other leadership buddies will openly criticize every person that left the team claiming that those who left couldn't see the big picture, didn't understand how things work at Fidelity, or were overrated and couldn't actually do their jobs.  This is in spite of the facts that the team has gone from superstar status to an unproductive, floundering mess and the department hasn't seen a major technological breakthrough in years."

- decent bonuses
- some flexibility.  I say some because I have noticed that parents can be given a hard time if they ask to work from home too often or have issues come up.  This would also depend on how ""favored"" you are with your manager.  See ""cons"" for explanation.
- awesome coworkers
- longevity of the employees.  This is both a good and bad thing.  It is good because it gives a strong sense of loyalty to the company and knowledge stays within the firm.  It is bad because people assume they are ""entitled"" to pay raises or promotions simply because they did a job for a period of time.  (Not necessarily that they did it well.)  They are very disillusioned to how the real world works in regards to higher pay or promotions and that can become frustrating.
- the culture.  I do enjoy the culture as a whole at Fidelity.","- no mobility especially if you are already in a specialized area.  They talk about moving people up or across all the time, but in reality, it doesn't happen.  
- favoritism.  (Yes, it exists everywhere and that includes Fidelity.)  What's hard to stomach is knowing the person getting preferential treatment is a horrible worker while those who do a great job can be given a hard time.
- abuse of overtime.  It's hard to believe that management wouldn't be aware but it seems to be a common issue that is not addressed.  Those working needless hours would get a higher payout on bonuses as well based on hours worked per year.  Essentially they are being rewarded twice for ""stealing"" from the company.
- the bonus payout really stems from management's opinion of you.  Even being a high performer on the team does not guarantee a fair rate.  In all truth, it's impossible to understand how they derive at their numbers.
- my managers have either been disengaged or came from departments where they had little to no working knowledge for our group.  It's very hard working for someone that lacks basic knowledge of what your work entails.
- they advertise a lot about woman empowerment, but I haven't witnessed it in my group.  I would venture to say it might be the exact opposite.  If you are talented, you are more likely to be seen as a threat and this will be reflected in how you are treated and the type of compensation you receive.
- the ""fit"" meal program is kind of a joke.  When I started with the company, I thought it was a fantastic idea, but ""fit"", as far as my coworkers and I can tell, is based solely on sodium intake.  If you buy anything non-fit, be prepared to spend a small fortune for a little portion and average/below average taste.  Items like curry can be unfit.  I don't get that at all..."

5677,Fidelity Investments,Financial Representative - an exciting career talking to angry customers on the phone.,2017-11-01,1.0,Financial Representative,"The pay is decent, the benefits are good, after 6 months you are eligible to begin having your student loans reimbursed. Fidelity puts a substantial amount of effort into training you to pass the series 7 and series 63 tests.","Beyond training you to pass the series 7 and series 63, Fidelity doesn’t really train you for the job you will be performing. 
Most, if not all jobs, are customer facing phone center jobs. Half your time will be spent dealing with angry customers. Most of the time they were told the wrong way to transfer money, or otherwise service their account, by a poorly trained rep. Other times, a form will be rejected and instead of Fidelity sending an email or making a call, a poorly worded letter will be sent advising the customer to call the general service line instead of the back office group that can actually help with the problem. 
Prepare to be micromanaged. In an eight hour shift, you will get one paid 30 minute break and one unpaid 30 minute lunch. Other than that, you are expected to be on the phone. You will receive “coaching” from your manager if you spend too much time writing notes on an account, if you don’t enroll enough people in the voice recognition system, if you call the help desk too much because you don’t know how to help the customer, if your calls are longer than ten minutes, if you don’t take at least 6.5 calls in an hour, or if you don’t get enough new business leads. Also, your job performance will be judged based on what customers think of you. Customer surveys must be “top box” for them to count toward your bonus.  If you help a customer who was given bad information by a previous rep, even if you resolve the issue, if they’re still unhappy with the overall service Fidelity gave them (which they usually are), you get a poor evaluation. That poor evaluation is then used to assess how much of a bonus you get.
After passing the series 7 and 63 you get a retention bonus. Meaning, if you work at Fidelity for less than a year after receiving the bonus, you have to pay it back. This was put into place because of the huge amount of turnover that takes place once reps are done with the training and start the actual job.
Additionally, you will be taught how to avoid giving anything that resembles investment advice by directing customers back to the website for almost everything."

The same leaders drive the same mediocre results, and continually keep positions in the firm.  Repeated service model and strategy changes cannot change the mediocre managers leading each team. 

Leaders in the business with finance backgrounds do not bridge the gap to ""innovation"" in products, they can measure but are not creators.  Always concerned that if the market tanked, I wouldn't be able to sell products at Fidelity's prices with the cost structure so heavy."

Not everyone makes it in the first 8-10 weeks of training and they either quit because they find out that the job is not for them or they fail the Series 7/63 tests. It's a great feeling of accomplishment after you get through the initial training program and pass the financial licensing exams and you feel like you belong to a strong reputable company. From there you can move on to other departments like sales, stock and options trading, 401K investment guidance, pensions, operations, management, training and education, support desk help, compliance, etc depending on your interests. Everyone that I worked with in management was very supportive of my goals in wanting to move up in the company or try different areas of the business. As long as you have a plan and show interest in another position, they help you secure the position by working with the managers of the group or department that you are interested in. The 401K/health/reimbursement benefits are the added incentives to staying with Fidelity long term and the 401K matching/profit sharing is the best in the financial services industry, maybe even most of corporate America.","The downsides to Fidelity is that you are working in a call center and sometimes day to day activity can become boring, mundane and very repetitive. Some managers are known to micromanage when you can take breaks including how often and they monitor operational metrics very closely (number of calls taken, average handle time and how much time after every phone call). They are very persistent about coaching on what is the best language to approach each customer, sometimes to a point of emphasizing perfection. If you are there for 5 yrs or more, base salary becomes stagnant and it becomes more challenging to apply for positions and roles that offer more compensation potential because the people in those positions have been there for 10 years or more."

No reason you won't have over $100k in your 401k account after 5 years. This is the only pro to working at this company.,"If you're looking for a technology position, I would go to a technology company. Fidelity is a financial services company first, and as a result they have some questionable practices. They have their own version of agile which just doesn't work. Be prepared for hour long stand ups in the morning, project managers that are not technical and fail to keep track of meeting minutes.

From a salary perspective Fidelity is way behind technology companies. I left a senior position in Fidelity, and joined a junior position in a technology company. My salary went from $74,800 to $120,000. 

Once you get to senior in Fidelity, the path to principal, manager, director and above is almost non-existant these days. Your promotion path is not based on job performance, it is based on putting the time in with the group you're with. This much was admitted to me in my review meetings. If you join as a senior or get promoted to senior and want to be promoted to principal be prepared to put in more than 5 years before even being considered for it, and chances are the company will use a down turn in the economy as a reason for not giving you the promotion you deserve.

If you're near retirement you'll be fired so the company can save money by not giving you a full retirement package. I know a lot of people that this happened to in 2008, and again recently. 

The company keeps changing direction. When I joined in 2007 teams were organized by function - developers, testers, etc. Recently they re-organized by product. You can be sure in another 6 - 8 years they'll go back to being organized by function after an independent consultant comes in and makes the case for it.

Every 8 years the company sheds around 10 - 25% of their staff - most of them are the people it pays the most."

On the whole I was treated very well, but it was about what I put into it.  I felt that I worked hard and was rewarded (promotion and $ wise) appropriately.   As with any big company, your success is very dependent on your supervisor and how they choose to treat their staff.  But I always felt that if you worked hard and performed well, you got what you deserved.  Benefits are very good and I felt I more than compensated fairly for my work.","Fidelity by nature is risk averse because of its reputation and that is also it's biggest issue when it comes to innovation.  Fidelity, for all it's lip service as a leading edge company, is behind the curve on technology and is working to make strides in cloud services and robo investing services to keep up with more innovative companies attempting to steal the millennial generation market.  In addition, there is no real accountability within technology operations (including the need to really measure performance against budget) so there is a lot of stagnation among long-time employees and in  management.  Fidelity moves very slowly on re-orgs and layoffs after telegraphing changes are coming, leaving employees in limbo for long periods and impacting productivity."

While they cut your pay they are asking you to do twice the work by consolidating roles and drastically increasing calls per hour expectations. Expect to  handle complex problem resolution on matters like alternative investments, international wires, or incorrect cost basis research all while taking 7 calls per hour.  You will get paid around $50,000  for practically handling every aspect of service for all clients and financial consultants who very likely know less than you but get paid over twice as much.

Fidelity didn't innovate/realize early enough to understand the changing employer landscape which has cost it a lot of turnover.

The people are friendly (for the most part) and I had a great relationship with my manager.","The HNW role could be extremely frustrating at times, to say the least. We were fully licensed brokers, but the majority of my time was spent doing password resets and distributions - I'm not sure why the firm would pay our licensing fees only to have us perform repetitive tasks any (unlicensed) customer service rep can do. Dealing with the general public is trying - people will call in and scream/curse at you over something you had no control over.

For a newly graduated college student, Fidelity is a great place to get your feet wet, to learn (their training programs are topnotch) and for an entry level position, the pay is very competitive.","I have been with Fidelity almost 12 years and made my way through a few different departments along the way.  For the first few years, there really seemed to be a Fidelity culture, we were all proud to be working at such a great company with such integrity. But as the years wore on and I sat in a role where I felt doomed to stay because moving up beyond my current position at the time was not an easy feat, I did finally land that ""destination role"" position, the one I thought I would be with until I retired. Fast forward to today, currently two year in the ""salaried"" position and miserable. I am doing the work of three people because they won't back fill our department, we work some times 80 or more hours a week just to stay on top of what is put in front of us. The promised ""big"" raises, we were told was nixed from above. The morale is horrible. I have been sick more than I care to mention from the stress. I entered this role knowing very little about the position and there wasn't any training, I was handed 130 clients to start with and told, you'll figure it out. My laptop has never worked properly, mail doesn't go out or come in all the time, to name one of the many issues, no one knows how to fix it, nor will they replace it.  I never thought I would say this about Fidelity, but I do feel like a number. I have talked to many of my co-workers in other groups who are feeling the same way, so it's not just the group I am in. Right now, until I can find (or have time to find) another job, it's just a paycheck, not a career."

6028,Fidelity Investments,Stain on my resume,2017-07-01,1.0,Financial Associate,Not a lot of pros here but the hours weren't bad I guess...,"This is a call center environment.  Pay is minimal and management has poor communication over all.  Actually that's not true, they have NO communication over all.  You are always being monitored.  What I mean by this is that all the calls are listened to and graded, if you stop calls to go to the bathroom, it counts against you.  If you don't take your break/lunch EXACTLY at the specified time, it counts against you.  If you're stuck on a long call and you go past your break time, you're SOL.  And it counts against you.   The computers are so old and constantly freeze and crash on you, which gets increasingly frustrating everyday.  You would think for a multi-million dollar company they could provide their minions with some semi-functional equipment in order to do their jobs efficiently.  But I guess not.  Fidelity also boasts about all the opportunities they have for their employees to branch out to, and frankly the opportunities are few and far between.  They sell you the dream.  And even if you are lucky enough to get a different position, you'll still be on the phone all day taking ~60+ calls per day.  The job descriptions are very vague as to what you'll be doing.  And the little information that is conveyed is very deceitful.   No where was it ever made clear that this is a call center.  Had I known this, I wouldn't even have applied.  I did not go to college to work in a call center.  PLEASE do not apply here!!  Run far and fast!  If you really want to work at a call center, find a different one.  Do your future self a favor and DO NOT WORK HERE!  You WILL regret it.  You'll be thinking about this review while you are sitting at your desk and be thinking ""why, why didn't I listen to this person!""  This job was such a joke and a stain on my resume."

A 529 plan allows individuals to save money for a beneficiary by contributing up to $14,000 (or $28,000 if married and filing jointly) annually without incurring gift or generation-skipping transfer tax liability. Earnings in this plan grow federal income tax-deferred and the distributions are federal income tax-free as long as they are used for qualified higher education expenses.

Nepotism
Who you know can get you a job
If your manager doesn't like you, it's going to be nearly impossible to move up in the company
Last year they bumped up the new hire pay by I think $5,000 to get more people interested in applying, but none of the pre-existing employees have gotten any type of compensation adjustments to make up for it
The annual salary review (and usual salary increase) is being pushed back this year, so that it's a year and a half from our last increase
Don't get settled into what your role is defined as, because it'll most likely change without your opinion being considered
Everything is going full-blown sales - they push a ""customer first"" attitude, but all of the compensation and management feedback is exactly the opposite
We used to be able to take time to do research and follow up on our clients' needs, but they're punishing us for taking the time to ensure our customers have good experiences because we're not constantly taking phone calls/chats/emails etc.
The only things that our bonuses are really based on are how many interactions we're taking per hour, how many sales leads we can get, and then our customer feedback survey scores - but they keep lowering the amount of impact the feedback surveys have... it seems like they're caring less and less about the customer's experience, and more and more about how much money they're making (to be honest, it's a dog-eat-dog world out there for investment firms right now though)"

Good learning environment, company invests a lot in learning materials. They want to keep employees very relevant in the market.","Common judgement process for employees is a pain. You need to be Rockstar to climb the ladder. 
Culture of meeting too often, no proper focus while working on complex code 
Mid level management is bit incompetent and arrogant 
Sometimes goals are written in blood. They aren't flexible. Innovation is must no matter complexity of your project.

Sometimes you feel like a operator transferring calls. Bonus is effected by how your team does as a whole.  They make a lot of changes throughout the year and you need to be on your toes to keep up with all of it.  Colleagues can drag you down by being negative about their job.  Customer experience surveys are a very big factor in eligibility for larger bonuses and annual raises.  You can take thousands of calls but 30 surveys can make or break your eligibility for a raise. Some other small things, but this position is a call center position it's not always easy but definitely a good starting job to get you comfortable with the lingo and customer facing position."

Great financial license teachers and ongoing training. Good work/life balance. Good starter company for the industry then get out after vesting as so many do.,Salary is the worst especially given the number of competitors in close proximity. No raises this year and many positions being cut. A fellow employee was literally let go due to persistently low customer surveys which you have to get a perfect score. Anything else counts as an F. If you get a good score you're still screwed. This employee had his CFP and masters paid for by the company. What an asinine  policy to spend all that money on someone and then walk them out.

Only positive,"The firm constantly states how conservative and honest they are, but that is only in regards to their clients, not employees.  Upper management constantly lies about anything and everything.  False promises across the board.  Stated that simply working a full calendar year qualifies you for their 10% profit sharing payout.  After a year of work, told we wouldn't be receiving the payment because we missed the ""deadline"" that was never mentioned.  When speaking to managers/directors about why this was never mentioned to us, simply told that ""you should have received it.""

Promotions are just lateral moves.  Want you to assist their customers on the phone, but if they talk to much it ruins your metrics and you get yelled at for it.  Nothing is done to problem customers.  You will spend an hour on the phone calling the Risk group about a blocked account for someone who a negative balance with the company.  Of course you can't hang up on them either.  Don't let them lie to you about how you're a ""financial professional.""  Very little finance, everything about appeasing their horrible client base.

""Promotions"" are almost constantly handed to the most unqualified applicants.  It isn't what you know or how well you perform within your role, its all about how big of a shill you can be for the company.  

When applying for a new position, every female candidate will be promoted regardless.  This trend can be seen throughout the whole company.  Women make up maybe 10% of Personal Investing but when it comes to manager roles its around 70/30 Female to Male.  

If you're looking to get sponsored for your 7/63, work here for the 2 months it takes to get them and then leave like everyone else.  Turnover rate is rampant.  Pay is garbage and no one is looking out for you.  Wait for the near future for more layoffs.  Vanguard is taking all of Fidelity's clients and no one is safe from the chopping block."

Dress code","I originally found this job posting when searching for Hospitality related jobs. Hospitality professionals, BEWARE. They are going to tell you that you don't need a finance background and that they can teach you everything you need to know. This is not all together true. They are going to train you the absolute minimum that they can, and then they throw you onto the phones. 

This is not a customer service position. It's sales. Most of the calls are awful, and people pretty much yell at you all day for things that are completely out of your control.  Need help? Call your help desk that's most likely to belittle you and make you feel like an idiot. It's bad enough that customer's are rude, but any other department you call for guidance is rude too. 

Have a bad day? Well, everyone is going to know about it. They send out a stack rank email every day with your calls handled, hold time, after call work time and survey score to your entire time. Oh, the survey score scale rating goes like this: Highest score = 100%, and not the highest score = 0%. Seems fair right? Even better, they ask three questions, one of them being satisfaction with rep, and it doesn't even count. The only one you get scored on is the one that asks about their overall experience. 

I understand that this job is just not for some people, as I found out pretty quickly. I was told that advancement could happen quickly, however the path to an off-phone role can take years. This is why so many people seem jaded when I was in training, but I didn't see the red flags quick enough. 

Also, you get a 30 minute break and a 30 minute lunch for an eight hour shift. You have to use your break time to go to the bathroom so it doesn't eat up your after call work and effect your metrics. You pretty much feel like a kindergarten that's being monitored consistently."

6219,Fidelity Investments,Game of thrones,2017-04-21,1.0,Engineer,Salary is okay. Perks are okay.,"My rating is purely based on my experience in Fidelity’s IT department specifically in plan admin group.
I had horrible experiences in this group, primarily because of all the politics that goes around. The modus operandi for this group is traditional command and control in the today’s world where openness, collaboration, and team work is paramount for being successful in competitive world. There is reverse discrimination (discrimination based on ethnicity by Indian managers toward Indian worker), ignorance of meaning of word ‘leadership’, age based discrimination, and disregards of person’s ability/skills/experience.
Reverse Discrimination: I have experience a constant reminder that am Indian and shouldn’t forget that where I come from. Don’t think you would be treated equal, just because you are working in US along with US workers. I would still latch on the fear tactics, which is based on fear of numbers (i.e. don’t care what you bring to the table, I would replace you with a cheap labor from India), to make you submissive. Only when you are submissive, then you will be given anything (responsibility, promotion, raise, bonuses etc.). Otherwise forget about it. How are can you be creative, and realize your potential when you are being force in submission by your leadership? What a paradox!
Leadership: Middle managers (VP & Below) don’t get the meaning of leadership. Leadership is about bringing out the best from each individual not force him/her into submission, and then use them as labor. They are uninspiring, have no stewardship, have no contextual awareness, and bully. I have seen people going into clinical depression who have worked there for many years, and gave best their lives to the company. These managers have no regards for that, and have no idea how to inspire people to actualize themselves. They are micromanager because they don’t know how to create value for businesses which would create value for themselves as well as value for people working for them.
Age based discrimination: Managers discriminate people with higher age because they can smell nonsense from a mile. Uninspiring leadership would naturally resolve to tactics of command & control, carrot & sticks, and God knows what else. One weapon in their armor is to fire aged guys 35 & above and hire young one for cheap. Instead of leveraging experience, and skills of senior person, they are condemned to dark roads after giving best years of their lives to the organization.
Disregard for skill/knowledge/experience: Doesn’t matter how highly educated you are or what skills do you have or what experience you have, you still be treated like a labor. There is no decentralization of decision making, empowering the team, or given chances to advance your career.
Politics: Highly political environment. Sometimes it felt like we are not in business world but in political world, where pulling one another down by any means necessary is fair game. In my opinion, the deep reason for such behavior is fear of losing job. Subconsciously, that fear brings out protectionist tendencies, and creates unfair environment. Below is tactics for harassing people.
•	Don’t let them talk to business folk – red tape.
•	Don’t let them have their vacations when they want.
•	Don’t communicate expectation from the job. Keep vague definition of roles and responsibilities so that they can be mended and used against people to break them down mentally.
•	Act like a bully for people who don’t agree with your idea. Typical Indian way of working. Create gang of unskilled sycophants to intimidate others by show of force.
•	Always criticize, never appreciate.
•	Don’t clearly communicate goals, vision, or strategy for the group. I most certainly think that they have idea what these means, or how value creation process work."

The company has good benefits and fairly good pay. I got some great experience starting my career here. I grew thick skin dealing with the daily client abuse. Training is good, they will hold your hand and spoon feed you through anything to get you certified.","Welcome to Corporate America. Promotions can be a nightmare with hurry up and wait mentality. sometimes there will be 6 months between job opportunities. In Denver there is a very limited amount of opportunities, managers will tell you to move to the east coast if you don't like the jobs available. Trade support will witch hunt you if you get a trade error, even if its for 1 cent. Trade errors are used to punish employees and lowers your chances of getting promoted. Managers will use fear tactics to push the bottom line which has more to do with customer surveys than anything else if you are in service. I wish I could write some of the profanity the customers will say to you over the phone, truly horrific dealing with the general public. Training in large classes of 20+ young professionals feels a lot like high school and its not ideal for education. Classes tend to get ""clicky"" and like managers, the facilitators always have their favorites. Unless you are a great ""suck up"" don't expect to get promoted based on your merits here."

-management is all about the flavor of the day: for a couple of months it was having great conversations with clients, then it was all about having a good workplace to be in.. now it's about taking as many calls as humanely possible with no rest. 
-management likes to hype up the small things.. like wireless headsets, or taking a break when you want to... but they will pass a long all bad news to the lower level managers and will not face the front line reps at all. They refuse to hear any criticism on policy updates. Some are so far removed from helping any client that it's comical what they expect.
- lately they have been devaluing the high net worth service reps. They used to allow for casework and follow up on issues, but they've tossed that in favor of handling as many clients as possible. So now the client with 2 mill as equal standing as client with 2k. 
-management treats all reps the same, no matter fresh out the dorm room or seasoned worker. Can be frustrating..
-this is not a role to stay in for long. Go the sales route. Stay away from customer service.

Job security - second to none. Working in Finance and providing guidance or customer service is a job that only gets more secure as the economy gets worse.","Completely undervalued - we were told for over 1 year that we would get raises and we did not. All the other groups in my business function received pay raises, and 3 or 4 other functions in the company did the same job as my group, and they got paid 20-50% more. The only time I felt like anyone cared that I was working my tail off was when I announced that I was quitting.
Overworked - you are tethered to your phone, and you are required to take inbound calls constantly. It is a call center.
""Sales"" - you are consistently told that you are in a sales function, you have a quota to hit, and you are held to metrics. However, you have no control over what phone calls you take or what customers you talk to, and the environment and pay are not reflective of a sales function.
Pay - the pay was pathetic compared to the rest of the industry/rest of the company.
Budget cuts - we were not allowed to work overtime, but our sales goals were raised.
Inconsistency - calls were transferred to my function by other sales roles. Those sales roles had very little idea what customers needed or wanted, and we were restricted from giving any type of pushback. We were required to take all calls that came to us, regardless of whether the customer's questions were in our job description.
Promoting based on politics - I saw multiple instances of people getting promoted that did not deserve the job. There was an explicit instance that I witnessed where someone was hired into a position because they were a woman, even though they were less qualified than another candidate (who happened to be male) - management made an explicit comment that they wanted to hire a woman to the position."

As a phone representative the number one benefit is the colleagues that share the role and the customers we get to hear from. Really enjoy the interactions with the diverse active and retiree populations!,"Huge downside at the Durham NC location. Many of the floor managers are unprofessional and constantly an impediment to helping the customer and helping employees develop. This is the first and only organization that I have worked for that will actually discourage you from applying to an open position within the firm. Has happened on a few occasions now and so appears to be the norm where to apply you need to go through current manager and they never follow up to discuss or confirm if an intent letter was forwarded.

Most of the managers I have interacted with were never able to answer serious inquiries on customer accounts and push back greatly when a customer requests to speak to them. Very sad to think I could be treated that way when calling in as a customer.

These same individuals are commonly loud in the call center environment where it is common to not be able to hear the customer on the line. Just recently I had to put a customer on hold while doing a death notification because I did not feel it appropriate for the caller to hear the loud laughing from a manager and team leads. This is a very common occurrence at this location. Finally, quite a few give me the impression that they do not do much at all during the day besides going to the gym (1+ hr), out to lunch (1 hr), listening to calls, and meetings. Back to the serious customer issues, have only had one manager that ever seemed to care about the issue and helped to get it resolved.

At this time it does appear this situation as a whole is why I will leave Fidelity and transfer all funds immediately thereafter."

Community environment promotes growth.,"*Once you are hired, salaries are competitive but merit raises to existing salary is not desirable.

6388,Fidelity Investments,A Job to nowhere with a very low compensation at all levels,2017-02-20,2.0,Fund Accounting Analyst,"Mostly good honest people to work with. Diverse.
A good company for entry levels positions (but that's it).
Very nice and large campuses nationwide.
Can jump between departments if you want to make a change (but mostly horizontal movement that can last for years with no pay change)","The fund a accounting group methodology of work is one big mess of excel spreadsheet macros with errors written by very few people at Fidelity and hold the knowledge and responsibility of why/what this job is about. The rest just push buttons and fake it. 
If you took 1-2 finance classes in college you will probably learn nothing new to help you in the industry. The monitoring and problem solving skills learned are 100% based on troubleshooting of departmental chaotic/confused processes of using excel and/or internal softwares. 
Managers don't (mostly) have any managerial skills or passion to manage and do so in order to climb the latter. In reality, they are analysts who stayed at Fidelity the longest (or when everybody else left after 2-3 years). 
Those who leave (which is almost all employees except managers) do so after realizing they will never be able to support an adult life/family with the low pay (including all ""unique benefits""). 

In conclusion, 
To demonstrate the shortsightedness and focus on internal computer troubleshooting I will use this fact: Most managers and directors can tell you a lot about how to find a variance due to miscalculation of an Excel's spreadsheet formula but no very little to nothing about the stock market, bond market, and most importantly the nature of mutual fund investing.

No support from management.  You are set up for failure if you are passionate about your work.

You are then given an impossible amount of tasks to complete in a deadline that will not be met, and you're given little to no support.  If you don't mine working 65 to 75 hours a week in order to keep up with the workload then this will be the place for you.  However, if you do not enjoy working weekends, holidays, cancelling vacations, etc. for work on a constant basis then look elsewhere, because management will really look down on you for not sacrificing everything to meet their impossible expectations."

6469,Fidelity Investments,Financial Representative,2017-01-23,3.0,Financial Representative,"*Good benefits

*18 days of PTO right off the bat (sick and personal days are combined).

*Friendly, helpful, and intelligent co-workers

*Loose attitude towards using cell phone at work, as long as you're doing your job

*Quarterly bonuses are based off of customer service, not sales

*Training is paid and very, very thorough

*$2500 bonus for passing licencing exams

*If you're moving more than 50 miles for accepting the position, they will give you a relocation package. But, you have to ask BEFORE you sign the acceptance agreement. You will not be eligible for the package if you have already signed.

*Work stays at work, no home-work

*Voluntary and unpaid days off for when call volumes are low, typically come up during the summer","This is a CALL CENTER, you will spend 7.5 hours a day taking INBOUND CALLS for at least half of the year with no breaks in between. They will tell you when you get hired that you can be promoted within a few weeks, that only applies to 1% of employees, and they usually have years experience in the industry. And if you do get promoted, all they do is change your title, give you a very small pay increase, and stick you back on the inbound phone line. Usually takes about 3-5 years to get off the inbound phone line, as most of the non call center positions are filled with external hires. They will give you a list of regular ol' business day schedules before you sign, then change your schedule to something vastly different when you get licenced.The sign in bonus is great, until you find out that you have to stay at Fidelity for more than a year to avoid repayment. It seems like they are using it as a tool to artificially increase retention. This job is VERY monotonous, and you will be burnt out after 4-5 months after completing training. Most people in the office are either trying to get into a position where they aren't on the phones, then applying elsewhere when they find out there are none. Service reps are the front line, so when other groups have meetings and off phone work between calls, you will not. Constantly changing rules about what you can/can't do on the phone, and very little communication about changes. The worst part is watching upper management coming in 30 min late and leaving 30 min early, while you are tied to your phone, taking inbound phone calls from slightly rude people for over 7 hours a day."

Very positive corporate culture.,"Ever ask yourself  ""How can I waste my finance degree AND make myself less marketable at the same time?"" Well, have I got a job for you! Sarcasm aside, let's just be brutally honest here. COLLEGE STUDENTS/GRADS PAY ATTENTION!!! Unless you plan to become an advisor (cough...salesman), most of the jobs you will find in the world of personal investments/brokerage services are going to be a CALL CENTER JOB! This is just the nature of the beast, yet something that your career counselor at college probably wont tell you. Call center experience is only a marketable skill to more customer service jobs.  I have worked at Fidelity for several years and can honestly say that I feel I have wasted years of my life doing something I have grown to absolutely despise. Dealing with customers on the phone is a life-draining experience. So let's bring it back to Fidelity, shall we? Would you like a real-life sample of what your job will consist of as a ""Financial Representative"" or ""Customer Advocate"" at Fidelity? Well, say no more!:

8:00 a.m. - Distribution check request.
8:10 a.m. - Hour long password reset with 90 year old client. (College degree hard at work!)
9:10 a.m. - Distribution check request.
10:10 a.m. - Help client find tax form online. 
10:15 a.m. - Why wont my debit card work?
10:25 a.m. - Why wont my credit card work?
10:35 a.m. - Complex multi-leg option trade.
10:45 a.m. - 30 minute password reset with 80 year old client. ( I went to college for this?)

Now rinse and repeat this for 30 calls a day, day in and day out. Not exactly what you pictured yourself doing with that shiny, expensive college education, is it?
Look...I could go on and on about other details of the job (particularly the wacked-out survey questionnaire Fidelity bases a large portion of your bonus on) but I'll leave that for some other disenchanted soul. Here is the bottom line...if you want to do sales, that is great for you and you will find many career opportunities at any brokerage firm, including Fidelity, and you will make a great living doing so. However, if sales is not your thing then I highly suggest you look elsewhere."

You will learn a lot at this job, and they do foster development within the constraints they provide. They're incredibly flexible with scheduling and accommodating for sick days etc, which is a huge plus for me.","This pertains specifically to the Denver site, but is also relevant to the role as a whole;


1) In the FR role you're essentially forced to burnout. The efficiency metrics are high, and when you good at the role you will take 70-100 calls a day. If you haven't done this before, you have no idea how exhausting it can be, people are pissy, impatient and dump their problems in your lap every day. Despite having a Series 7, you will quickly learn you're not really a stock broker, you're a frontline customer serviced rep in a call center. I rarely trade, most of my day is spent playing clean up with banking,tech support or paperwork issues while playing damage control with inconvenienced clients. You will quickly learn how insane people can be, you WILL have a client cussing and irrationally berating you because you can't make their check clear on a Sunday. 

2) The career opportunities are narrow, particularly for the Denver site. During training they will tell you that everyone is promoted within 4-5 months, and some promoted out of the training class. This is misleading at best. I'm a top performer in the site and now over a year in role, there are serious issues with favoritism in hiring, I've seen stellar candidates passed over countless times. Even with a promotion, it doesn't change the fact that 90% of jobs are on the phone. It's not easy to be leashed to a phone for 8 hours at a time, there are no projects, or tangible accomplishments, your tasks are often monotonous and dry.

3) There's a massive morale problem in the role, more than half the people I talk to are actively seeking other employment or are despondent and burnt out. If you don't drink the company Kool - Aide 100% (which you never should at any job) you will quickly see a lot of the problems with the business decisions, common practices and client t treatment are frustrating. With this being said, there are people who enjoy the job, and stay in it for years, just be very self aware when you consider the job. 

4) For the licenses, you're underpaid compared to the industry. They justify this by giving you a ""culture"" that is superior. To a degree it's accurate, compared to other phone sites and financial firms, it's pretty decent. 

5) Your central metric, upon which bonuses and promotions are centrally focused, are customer surveys, which are graded irrationally and unfairly. You can correlate higher, but it is largely random, and it can be infuriating."

Rep performance is measured every which way. Working under a microscope is discouraging.  Every new management regime resets expectations. Result: two steps forward, one step back. Latest focus is ""being efficient"" aka doing more with less. Lip service to Work/Life balance. Business needs come first. Company is largely segregated: Lots of India natives in IT. Blacks, women, the elderly in Phones. Promotion is based on who you know which means company loses some high potential employees who don't know the right people and don't see any growth potential."

On the tech side PI is one of the most modern whereas FI is stuck in the early 1990s. My group is excellent and for Fidelity we are on the cutting edge. Work life balance is great - in general the management is very flexible. There are politics but a good manager will shield the developer from this. If you can prove your valuable by innovating Fidelity will take notice - if you do nothing new then you will stagnate. Base compensation is on the lower end of what a developer could make elsewhere but the wide array of benefits, especially the contributions to 401k (7% match and generally 10% profit sharing) are unheard of. Senior management seems to have a clear vision of what they want but the execution on it by middle management is variable.","So much of Fidelity's tech is old and maintaining, enhancing the existing systems and building new capabilities requires lots of investment which up until the year the company had been pouring money into. In my opinion some of this money was wasted on buying expensive vendor products from the likes of IBM and Oracle that could have been done without paying for a license. Another issue is Fidelity still hires too many useless contractors and unnecessary project managers."

By far the worst culture in any place I've worked, and sadly its improved from it was when I started.   Know multiple people that currently work and have worked there that don't like there job, but sometimes stay because handcuffed by the money they make, me being part of that group for awhile. 

-Expected to work lots of OT in sales jobs.
-Lower Pay than comparable jobs.
-Very tedious and repetitive for most phone sales positions.
-Manager half the time doesn't even know your role so that can't help or teach you other than to tell you to work harder, more OT, or give suggestions that have no tangible merit behind them. Part of that is because of the change that happens so often and never gives groups stability within the company.
-Worked there for six years and only ever knew the people directly around me.  Its ironic as you talk to people all day yet you don't get to know anyone at the job unless your in a higher up positions where you have more leeway to be off the phone for a few minutes.
-Entry job is into service group is awful, super strict on when you can go to lunch, break.  Basically no flexibility.

Great for coasting into retirement.,"Not a good place for people who are implied leaders. It's a very top-down culture. You have no budget even as a VP, no freedom to push outside the ""Fidelity way"". Most people have been here for the last 20 years and it shows how out of touch these leaders are with how workforce of today looks at leadership and work in general. Long tenured middle managers and individual contributors also show a strange indentured servitude behavior. Many don't have the spine to say the truth, stand up for their beliefs and do the right thing. The culture is to sugar coat bad news and push all decision making as far up as possible. 

This might be fine if you come from a top-down, command and control culture. If you have worked in a culture of empowerment, this will be a stifling place. 

The company is headed towards uncharted territory but people up top lack the will to get rid of the ""leadership"" crud that only knows status-quo and actively tries to stonewall new ideas. A vast majority started their careers in phone sales - so they are not equipped for todays and tomorrows world. It will be an extremely hard task to correct the current heading of this ship. Drastic measures are needed to clean house but I doubt it will happen. I am waiting to see what happens in the next year.

Again, if you are a young, go-getter this might not be a place for you.  If you want to build a career that enables you to work in another company later, don't count on developing yourself as a leader here. If you want to be told what to do and just want to spend a few more years until retirement, this place is great and has excellent benefits."

Salary was competitive as a grad (in my location at least), as are annual salary increases (I averaged 8-10% per year entering as a grad - in several smaller bumps - enough even to stay on par with peers who job-hopped!) though I don't know how that scales for higher-ups. The performance/review process is formalized and well run. 

The work environment is very good - flexible work hours, good work/life balance, very little tolerance for toxic behaviour, good people, I usually work 40 hours and leave the office at 5 most days.","As a technologist, the office is still very male-dominated - though this is a problem everywhere for software engineers. 

A lot of the salary/bonus structure is very clearly tied up in the overall company performance. During a recession  or market downturn, the salary/bonus experience may be very different. 

There seems to be a lot of politicking in the upper-management. My team felt this through frequent group re-orgs, initiative changes, sudden U-turns on key priorities etc."
6718,Fidelity Investments,Great Internship,2016-10-18,5.0,,"Strong culture, beautiful campus, great leadership team.  Lot's of talented people to work with.","Lack of upward mobility, and other cons typically associated with larger firms.  Nothing specific, although the industry has been challenging lately."
6719,Fidelity Investments,Financial Consultant,2016-10-17,2.0,Financial Consultant,"As mentioned, great benefits. 7% match and 10% profit sharing. If you do 7% your going to be putting away 24% of your total pay into retirement which is great.","Their Portfolio Advisory Service (PAS) is the key product along with annuities that you are pressed to sell. They train you really well on how to overcome the objections of Clients. You get paid 0.07% or 7 basis points for every dollar you put into these products - JUST ONE TIME - there is a tiny bonus based on Retention. The worst part is that every one in the Financial Consultant role knows the product is terrible and underperforms consistently by 1.5%-2.2% on a yearly basis. If you work here, prepare to exchange your conscious for your paycheck. 

Management will talk trash about you after you leave, there is no loyalty. You will work with 400 Clients, the best Financial Consultants don't develop deep relationships with Clients because you don't have the capacity to do that because you must sell about $36 million a year at a minimum in their garbage products."

I have never seen so many mgmt people afraid of conflict, afraid to tell employees they were not performing, etc.  The culture is one of fear to tell the truth, when people are asked they do not tell the truth because they fear retaliation.   I personally sat in a senior mgmt meeting and heard a Sr. VP, tell another manager to tell her minions to stop sending feedback to Sr. Mgmt, they may ask for it but dont really want to hear it.  When they downsized a few yrs back they laidoff some of the best most knowledgeable talent, i suspect bcuz they made the most money, but many left were clueless which meant that those remaining had to do twice as much and cover the clueless.

6804,Fidelity Investments,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",2016-09-20,3.0,Senior Manager,"1 ~ Many would tell you the best thing about Fidelity is the people you work with and I agree. I have made several life-long friends and look forward to seeing them every day. Asking around you will find many people also found their significant others at work as well.

2 ~ Upward mobility and job opportunities. I may be biased from working at the Westlake campus where there are over 6000 jobs but it is also relatively easy to move to other locations within the company. There was a time years ago when it might have felt like you had to go to Boston to move up in the company but those days are gone and there are many great leadership positions throughout the country.

3 ~ Brand recognition you can be proud of and sleep well at night. Fidelity is a discount broker so not ripping people off with high loads or fees. They did not get caught up in the mischief so many other firms did with the mutual fund scandals or financial crisis.","The best things about Fidelity are also the worst things about Fidelity. 

1 ~ If you end up in the wrong department with the wrong boss your life can be a living hell. Fidelity is very liberal in its HR policies which can be good but also means they let things fester for a long time before taking action. There is a percentage of people that will take advantage of this and especially if you are on a small team you may end up constantly covering for a weak link.

2 ~ It is an American dream to start in the mail room and work your way up to VP someday and that is totally possible at Fidelity. In fact, it may be a bit too easy. It is completely common to attend leadership meetings and hear from senior executives ""I started on the phones just like you!""  Well, that is fine once in a while but at some point you do want people leading you to actually have some training and experience. Fidelity is full of hundreds maybe thousands of Directors, VP's and SVP's that started on the phone ""just like you"" and it shows.

3 ~ Fidelity has managed to stay out of the news but there are plenty of unsavory things they do behind the scenes. They are currently very worried about the Department of Labor proposed Fiduciary Rule. Their current employer benefits business model is already unethical but if the rule is enacted will be illegal as well. It has long been a major IRA rollover sales lead source to take advantage of relationships with employers to gain access to employees. Fidelity is the world's largest 401k record-keeper and should this lead source be taken away it will be a huge hit to their personal investing sales model in which two thirds of the new assets are from internal rollovers. The Fidelity brokerage business would be nowhere near what it is today without having taken advantage of these workplace business relationships."

Very friendly and open culture in the back and middle office, Great in the job training with a huge knowledge base within the company",Its very easy to get lost and go unnoticed because of the size and scope of the operation. Trying to be an agent of change is also very difficult because of the size of the company. Benefits and pay are the best in the industry for middle office jobs but the grind and the lack of tools to use that are available in the industry are difficult to overcome
7087,Fidelity Investments,Great benefits,2016-05-25,5.0,Accounting Manager,The student loan reimbursement program is great.,Too many employees. It's is not really a con.
7088,Fidelity Investments,"Solid employment, benefits, work environment and work life balance but expect to work  your fingers to the bone.",2016-05-24,4.0,Financial Associate,Job security and routine daily tasks with few surprises allow for each day to go smoothly once you get the hang of all of the rules and soft skills to serve customers.,The job itself gets monotonous and frustrating so if you don't move up the ladder you might just go crazy answering the same questions day in and day out.

Great campus to work at and the systems are state of the art.,Salary is not as competitive like other Financial firms but you can offset that with the benefits that are being offered. Company culture is great but it does depend on what department your role lands into.
7095,Fidelity Investments,Financial Representative-Health and Welfare,2016-05-22,1.0,Financial Representative,"Fidelity has a great culture. I have never worked at a better company. Great perks, decent pay, bonuses, amazing cafeteria, overtime and VTO always offered. Manager Apprentice program, PTO, 4 months maternity leave, loan and tuition reimbursement . I love the Employee Resource Groups. Great way to start career out of college.","The job. We are answering calls from employees and retirees from well known companies. Health insurance is very difficult and the calls we get are a bit much. A huge disconnect from Fidelity and the clients. It's great to help people however we get rude callers who want something now and do not understand how insurance works, no matter how we explain it. Very stressful job and I hate to look elsewhere but the stress is not worth it all.  If you love customer service and can take calls from angry people all day then this is for you. NOT a bad company, just the Health insurance side is not a great department or position."

It is a company that is slowly but surely seeking to improve the work experience. My managers have been awesome, too.","Most of the opportune moves are lateral, Fidelity takes it's sweet time on paying bonuses and raises, it is a call center job and if you don't enjoy this type of engagement, opportunities are severely limited. Not many jobs here that allow you to critically think, but rather answer questions. Most co-workers treat this as a job, rather than something they enjoy (though this is not true for all)"
7097,Fidelity Investments,Top Tier Company,2016-05-21,5.0,Senior Project Manager,"Fidelity Investments is one of the top company's in the financial industry.  The firm's focus on workplace atmosphere, collaboration, career growth, benefits, and work-life balance make one of the most rewarding and enjoyable employer's.  Fidelity also regularly hires third party company's to conduct employee surveys, and that feedback is taken very seriously.  I say this because I've seen senior management respond to areas of improvement with meaningful and relevant changes that enhance the working lives of Fidelity's associates.","The usual large company drawback's apply.  If you're looking to work on the most cutting edge technology or explore ways to disrupt industries, maybe it isn't the best place to work.  Although Fidelity focuses on innovation strategies and new markets, it's size means that change does not come quickly, for the most part, as there are many processes and controls wrapped around existing models. There are also significant regulations to which all players in the financial services industry must adhere, which is fine, but learning and adhering to those regulations limits flexibility."

People are eager to help you understand the ins and outs and always supportive while you're learning in a new environment.  They also give you flexibility in your summer to take time off and go on vacation if that's what you had planned.,It's hard to think of a negative here.

You are told when you are hired and during training that customer service and advocating for the customer is the main goal.  That you should ""own the call"". However as soon as you are on the phones, you are told that once the customer is handed off to what ever dept ,  you should not be involved anymore, that you should not make too many outbound calls to the customers because we are an inbound call center , I do not consider this owning anything.  The procedures and resources are time consuming and cumbersome.  Your computer is prone to freezing when you are in the middle of a call because of all of the resources you have to have up,  and yet you can not say anything about your computer not working properly. 
  Fidelity has compassion as part of it's mission statement , yet most of the procedures could not possibly show less compassion for the customer if they tried.  In short I feel like I was lied to about the position I was hired for.   
   Management shows favoritism as well as cliquishness, and though everyone appears to be friendly it is surface only.  You never know what management expects or what they are in charge of  because it changes constantly."

Room to grow in the company if you are willing to move,"On the surface the Financial Consultant position seems great. They give you a book of clients, there's no cold calling since they provide leads and you can make over 6 figures with average effort. But in reality it's a pure sales role with very little concern about what's right for the client. Definitely not a fiduciary advisor and the turnover is extremely high.  It's all about selling product and filling the buckets. Fidelity FCs are managed by the ever present spreadsheet. Everyone is stacked ranked and if you are below average on any category your branch manager or RPC ( who are usually inexperienced coaches that stink at sales) will come talk to you to see how to improve. The problem is there are like over 20 categories of things they measure you on. So you will always be below average in something! Another annoying thing is every click on the computer, every phone call, every email is tracked like big brother ! They also continually roll out some new method or spreadsheet and say this is the way things are going to be so get used to it. 4 months later you never hear about that spread sheet again. There is no adjustment if you are new, if you are in different markets or have a smaller or a more established book. There is a certain level of gamesmanship with the numbers too. Click here it counts, click here it doesn't even if you did the work. Talk to a client for like 30 seconds and tag their deposit and you get credit. Drop this client from your book without the client knowing and you won't get hit with an outflow.   The people who do well in the role game the system the best. All the managers are ok with this and all they care about is selling managed money, annuities and bringing in new assets. Who cares what's right for the clients. That's really the sad part the clients think you are helping but in reality you are just selling what pays you the most basis points and hope they never call you after the sale. My advice is if you get this position plan to work it for 2 years then find something else in Fidelity not in the branch network."
7223,Fidelity Investments,Nice company to work with,2016-04-05,3.0,Sector Specialist,"Work life balance
chance to learn lot of things","low salary comparatively
poor people management"
7224,Fidelity Investments,H & W Customer Services,2016-04-05,2.0,,Great investment options regarding 401K and ability to really become knowledgeable about investing.,Development opportunities are just not there
7225,Fidelity Investments,Customer Service Representative,2016-04-05,1.0,,"Training is pleasant. They hire right out of college. Work-sponsored outings are a delight. Great facilities, beautiful campus, on-site Starbucks is the greatest perk of all. Friendly coworkers. Pretty packaging for what proves to be quite an awful deal.","Customer service representative work and culture is truly toxic, mentally taxing, entirely sedentary, and unsettlingly monitored by management. You are physically chained to your desk by a phone set for nine hours a day, and provided with two 15-minute breaks and one 30-minute break, all of which are timed by the tracking system. 

There's a big sentiment of favoritism that guides promotions, bonuses, and on the flip side - verbal / written warnings. You don't need to be able to think in order to excel in this role, you just need to be able to follow chain of command and avoid questioning anything. Voicing your opinion will always work against you.

For anyone who studied finance / econ / business, be warned: this is NOT a finance job in any capacity. You will not learn anything about the financial service industry by being here - unless you move into a licensed role, in which you'll really only be able to learn about the industry to pitch the same handful of Fidelity products that benefit the company, so it's really just a glorified sales role. I work with many people who previously worked in grocery stores, coffee shops, or retail shops, who never went to college. It doesn't matter what you know - if anything, it'll benefit you to avoid all forms of thinking whatsoever, as Fidelity does not value ideas, only obedience. 

Your schedule is monitored by a system that quantifies every second you spend on / off the phone into performance metrics that determine your fate at the company. Do not drink too much water at your desk. If you take bathroom breaks, it'll harm your metrics and your manager will have to talk to you and possibly issue a warning. Management speaks like they ""want to help you"", but they really want to help themselves climb the Fidelity ladder, and couldn't care less about their expendable employee base. Pay is very low for a financial services industry job...customer service reps are barely making $38k. And this was after a much-raved about ""pay increase"" that we should've been so humbled and honored to receive, for the grueling work we struggle through. 

Coaching sessions are torturous. You'll be placed in a room with your manager and possibly two to three other colleagues, to listen to each others calls, and tear them apart to bits. You are expected to adhere to a call structure and parrot the same lines, check off a certain number of transfers to certain departments, pitch a certain number of ""contribution increases"" to bring more money to Fidelity at the customer's expense. Managers never tell you what you did well on calls, only what you did poorly. It's not that we don't want feedback and to improve - but sometimes, we did some really nice things on the calls and want to be recognized for our positives too.

Minor technicalities are a guaranteed pull down the rabbit hole of warnings. If you have a technical error, the quality team screens more of your calls, notifies your manager, and you get a ""verbal warning"". They'll screen exponentially more of your calls than they do for anyone else, so that they catch more mistakes you made that everyone else makes too - regardless of how minimal they may be, the repercussions escalate very quickly. Management gets excited to prosecute their employees and never looks at the full situation when quality provides feedback. Half the time, they don't even read their emails or listen to the call, just issue a warning because you ""messed up,"" and they don't care about your side of the story. Sometimes if you try to explain, they'll ask you to stop talking.

If you start in a phone center, you will end in a phone center. Before you begin working, management will pitch to you that the ""sky's the limit"" with career growth in the company, but they don't tell you about the red tape that stands between you and the sky. Fidelity sucks people in for years and years, until they don't have any speakable skills to pitch anywhere outside the company because they've been on the phones for so long, and they're stuck there. It's a culture run by unfair management who talks down to you like you're an incompetent toddler. You will be overworked, underpaid, and undervalued for all the efforts at self-betterment in this job, as it all goes to waste. If they like you, they like you. If they don't, nothing will change that. Either way, get out of there sooner rather than later. The brand name that Fidelity provides isn't worth the mental and emotional suffering of their customer service work."

As a senior person in my position you get to know the skill set that is important for your job. When you do outstanding work you soon realize that advancement Is not based on merit but who you are aligned with. A company that is interested more in protecting management with an emphasis on the org chart and less about the work itself. Constant internal battles and intentional reorganizations. An internal employee goal program that ignores how you want to grow as an individual instead focusing on how a manager wants you positioned. If you get a good manager that focuses on the work it can be a wonderful place but soon there will be a reorg and and you will find yourself having to pay more attention to the political back channels and less on your passions and skill set. Politics is extended externally as well with profits spent on preventing governmental ""regulation"" but internally a love of regulating the employee. Highly protectionist from the top on down.

Now factor in every person calling in extremely mad because there is an issue with the website and they had to literally wait 45 minutes to get to you so they take their anger out on you.
It is not even sure if it's the Walmart of the financial industry.

Its filled with people either making a mid life career change and they are so excited about a 401k and insurance (because they were going nowhere in their life) or you come straight out of college and if the person is halfway normal they are gone in less than two years.

Not a lot of pressure to get things done
Nice office/campus
Free rent for 5 months
Get paid to do pretty much nothing all day

This was my first job out of college as a software developer. They have a training program where they send you to North Carolina for five months to learn about various technologies and to work on a ""real life"" project.

About halfway through the program you get notified of the actual team that you'll be on when you return to your job site. You have some input with this, but the decision is ultimately made by management.

The program itself isn't too bad. I learned about a lot of technologies that I hadn't heard of and it gave me a little bit of real world experience.","Work non-existent/not challenging
Office is located in the middle of nowhere (Texas)
Old fashioned attitudes
Not a lot of young people unless you work in the call center
Old technology
Too much bureaucracy

The downside to the training program is that the team that you get placed on is very hit or miss and very much or if your control. Some people were placed on awesome teams working with cool products and technologies while others were stuck working on software that was 20 years old. 

Also during the training there are a lot of B.S. corporate events/talks, which were super cheesy and unnecessary. Some of the topics during training were a waste of time too, like learning how to write an e-mail (yes, I'm serious).

The team I was placed on seemed to have no plan in place for me when I got there despite the fact that a manager has to request an associate from the aforementioned training program so it's not like I was placed on their team by surprise or without their knowledge.

The whole time I was there I wrote probably a total of 20 lines of code because the product was in maintenance and there was very little new development. There wasn't really any work for me to do, so I essentially got paid to read reddit all day.

There are tons of meetings to attend and most of them are just people from various teams/business units arguing over minute details about random aspects of a project. The amount of red tape that you have to go through to get things done is pretty high."

This was often not the case with my peers, whom I was ranked against. Certain employer events would also cause flows of assets beyond my control. They attempted to capture this in the goal setting, but that was done so far in advance that it was certainly not an exact science. The travel time made it very difficult to have much of a personal or social life as well.

The health insurance is a little pricey but the plan itself is the best I've ever seen in terms of what it will cover.

In WPS, we are underpaid for what we do (median in New England for our job type would be closer to $70k), the expectations are always changing, applied inconsistently, and you are prodded and driven to do overtime because they choose to understaff for the busy seasons to save money. In the call center positions, you're on a clock, you get the legal minimum required breaktime, and there is a general lack of respect for work/life balance.

I worked in a department that service multiple Fidelity companies and was in charge of trying to figure out prioritization for multiple projects. Decisions were being made all over the place and constantly overriding previous agreements. I know that is how most large companies work but Fidelity takes it to a different level.
7437,Fidelity Investments,Portfolio specialist,2016-01-16,4.0,Portfolio Specialist,Great benefits package and a large company so lots of opportunity to grow. You can advance quickly if you have ambition. The retirement benefits alone make it worth it. 10 percent profit sharing...Seven percent 401k match. You can expect to make over 100k as a portfolio specialist which is decent and is truly under 45 hour work week. They are rolling out things like16 weeks paid maternity for women and 6 weeks paid for men. The best thing about the job is you do meet life long friends and work with a ton of amazing people.,"They are old fashioned. They don't have a work environment that inspires creativity.They have call models and sales models that they want you to stick to ""to make you successful""...they actually focus more on those models than educating about the products they want you to sell...it can sometimes make you feel like a robot and clients pick up on it.

7463,Fidelity Investments,A Values Based Company that you can build a long term career with!,2016-01-09,5.0,Senior Vice President,"I am in my second decade with the firm and I am so happy I chose to work here out of college.

Family Owned:
This company takes care of its people.  I have been through 3 major economic downturns in my career and the firm always takes the long view and does cut into muscle and bone during trying times.  The Johnson family thinks in the here and now, but they also have a view 50 years out.  They are humble and grounded individuals that are always looking for opportunities to improve our business and our employee experience.  

Benefits:
We are industry leading, period.  Childcare assistance, tuition reimbursement, college loan repayment, healthy meals at a deeply discounted rate, onsite gyms, onsite healthcare facilities, onsite CFP programs, 6 months of leave for moms, computer purchase assistance, etc, etc, etc...  
If that wasn't enough, the firm isn't comfortable with out offering in this space.  We are in the midst of a major benefits reassessment.  Abby and her new head of HR are leading the charge in this effort.

Work Environment:
The family and the company goes to great length to ensure we have the best facilities for our teams.  Our major corporate campuses are spread across the country in beautiful locations.  While Fidelity is a conservative company, they build our buildings to last centuries and the are constantly refreshing them.  

I have read many posts about the call center environments.  I felt compelled to respond.  Call centers with any company are tough.  There is no way around it, it is a tough job.  However, it is an entry level position where you can learn a lot in and then leverage that learning to different roles in the future.  I know of 5 Executive Vice Presidents, several SVPs, and VPs who started in the same positions at the firm.  If you are coming out of college, you will likely start in an entry level position at some firm and you will have plenty of opportunities to work up and sideways from there.   

The firm could do a better job of facilitating that movement, but I will mention it further in the ""cons"" section.","Career counseling: 
Many of us were told early in our career that you needed to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps when it comes to career planning. Essentially meaning, the cream will rise to the top, and the driven folks will figure it out. 

While there is merit in this strategy,it is outdated for the size of our company.  Like many companies of our size it can become difficult to navigate.  I feel that is why many of the comments on glassdoor related to this topic are correct from the perspective of the person writing the review.  However, this is absolutely not the intention of senior leadership.  The leadership team wants to hire college grads and watch them progress out of entry level positions and branch out throughout the business.  The individuals who do, are generally immensely successful.  

The problem lies in the lack of programmatic career planning conversations and marketing of the internal opportunities and job matching. To their credit, the firm has recognized this issue and I have heard is working on building career centers to help facilitate these dialogues and career plans.  I would expect comments related to issue to start to subside as this rolls out. 

To make a long story short, the sr. team has shown that they care and want to help find the solution.

HR systems and training:
Simply put, we have antiquated systems in HR, and training needs to be modernized to adapt to the way college grads learn.  A better mix of classroom training integrated with a lacking digital solution that ties to our HR systems. 

HR system and staffing:
HR needs an overhaul.  Specifically in staffing.  We have a very traditional model and staffing and HR are loaded with career HR and staffing people.  We need to take a cue from Silicon Valley companies and add more business consultants and business leaders to the HR function to modernize it.  We need to keep about a 1/3 of this business unit as traditional HR and Staffing consultants, but there is a serious lack of creativity and challenge of old processes because of the the similar backgrounds of everyone in the group.  Until we do, we are destined to be average in this space."
7464,Fidelity Investments,Fidelity Financial Rep.,2016-01-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The training program is one of the best training programs you could go through.  They do a good job of teaching you how to answer the phone in a professional manner and how to use the systems.  They give you study guidelines that will help you pass the Series 7 and 63 licenses.  Paid training, which includes studying for your licenses.","Have to pass the Series 7 and 63 licenses within 3 months of starting there. They tell you that you will be studying completely for the first 6-8 weeks, but you end up answering phone calls for the 2nd half of the day starting the 4th week.

7470,Fidelity Investments,Good Luck,2016-01-07,2.0,,Very easy and money just falls in your lap cause of the brand name. Easy competition for the stack rank. It's fairly new so it isn't micromanaged yet but it is trending that direction. More relaxed than other roles in the phone site.,The compensation is much less than what it should be for the money you move in and service provided. Confusing bonus structure that is constantly changing and bonus is dictated by manager entirely and not by production and stack rank so it can be very bias. In reality the stack rank is pointless cause 2nd place can get a bigger bonus than 1st. It is starting to become more and more micromanaged. It has become more of an efficiency role instead of quality even though the main point is sales and not service. Very unorganized part of the company. It's a little niche compared to the rest of the company so there is constant change and no one including directors know what's going on in the future. Also misrepresented growth opportunities. They say they are expanding and you can promote to the more prestigious phone role or into the field however when one of those spots is vacated they backfill it with two people in this role instead of replacing. So be prepared to be stuck.

I can't pay rent, buy food, or pay all the other bills I have will my ""great benefits.""  Money is the only thing that helps with that - and the salaries Fidelity pays, compared to the broader industry, are ridiculously low.  Moreover, there have been numerous changes that have occurred in the last 12 months that are ostensibly to ""make things better"" for the customer, as well as the associate, but the net effect has been the opposite ... for both.  They've basically significantly increased the scope of the role, while narrowing the performance metrics ... all while creating an increasing environment where it essentially makes it impossible for you to provide the positive experience the customer is expecting, and meet your goals.  How this has played out out to associate is ... you can kiss making more than the bare minimum for your quarterly bonuses (which also ... in not very much at all) goodbye.  Also, over the last 12 months or so, there seems to have been a dramatic concern with turnover, primarily among the associates who have been with the company less than 12 months.  The company has become ridiculously preoccupied with finding ways to keep this demographic with the company that they're basically throwing everything but the kitchen sink at them in the misguided hope it will keep them from leaving.  Basically ... they're focusing all their measures on increasing salary, compensation, and quality at work to the employees who have been there the least, and contribute the least to the company's overall functionality.  I've been with the company, and in this function for years, and even though I've been given yearly bonuses and increases I sit next to people who have been licensed less than 6 months, and are making the same amount in salary as me, or more.  It's really insulting, not to mention makes all the experienced, and seasoned employees feel extremely unappreciated.  Then there's also the issue that performance and ability really have no bearing whatsoever towards promotions or recognition for achievement - the current situation at the location where I work reminds me more of my senior year of high school, and everything boils down to a popularity contest.  The end result is you have people who weren't even competent to begin with and routinely failed to meet even the most basic of their performance metrics, being given increased levels of responsibility and management if they're ""popular.""  Granted this exists to some degree or another no matter where you work, however the level I've witnessed over the years is on the order of 20 times worse than anything I've experienced in nearly 15+ years in the workforce."

They're also the most likely firm to get you to pass a series 7 if you have no finance experience or degree to fall back on. If you can handle call center work there is some job mobility in that function, just don't expect to get into the back office or anything beyond a phone unless you're a lucky duck destined for management.","Where to begin...The mantra being preached to new hires is that your contribution matters and you're helping our customers just by answering the call. In reality, training is now so utterly warped and schizophrenic that you likely will need a promotion above the entry level position to assist with anything more complicated than cutting a check or trading a mutual fund. Consequently, it is absolutely crushing that you can't help half the customers that wait hours in line to get to you and that's even worse when you first start to where you transfer 95% of your calls. Management is unhelpful and most of the call center managers you honestly scratch your head at what they actually do other than go to meetings and give you self-directed coaching assignments. As with any call center, metrics are King. I got promoted entirely because I got through calls fast and didn't ask questions only for the next role to be even worse. Certain departments (core/hnw services mainly) have forced overtime right now that is held against you if you don't meet the supposed goal or have other activities that prevent you from doing so. The new systems internally have also taken hold times and raised them exponentially because of the new/barely trained reps having to transfer everything and attrition causes old reps to leave for jobs outside of fidelity or internal promotions with the stress the new system has lumped on them from new hires being functionally useless. Volumes aren't even as bad as they were last year but it's still a high stress job that keeps you tied to a cubicle having to apologize to clients for management failing to see the problem in changing the entire service model at the busy time of year when clients are already in a hurry and coming in in droves. The money isn't enough to make this worthwhile."

I was there 7 years was give great feedback during review time but managers always found a reason not to give me a raise ( I received on raise the entire time I was employed). One made up reason given when my manager spent a min tripping over her words to think of what to come up with was that she heard I spend to much time in the ladies room (of course it was not true but it was good enough for her to justify when I again would not receive a raise) Most of my managers were up north therefore  managed at a distance and visited maybe every three months per year.

Ok job for a fresh college graduate, but other than that I would advise one to stay away.

Good food on campus. They hire good cooks to feed us while work. Decent pricing too","Once you get licensed and ""get on the floor"" that is when the trouble begins.

The job is extremely boring. Dealing with people calling every second of the day from about 9-4pm is horrible. Most of the time you are resetting passwords, not actually doing anything finance related. And when you do get the chance to do finance related things, all you do is enter trade tickets and hit send.

In training, they sold to us that we are ""financial professionals,"" however, I would beg to differ. The only difference between ""service associates"" and a regular CSR rep is that at Fidelity, you are licensed.

The job sucks. It sucks your soul. It is not a fun environment. IF you enjoy  answering calls all day for $16-20 dollars a hour, have at it.

**Also, it should be noted that promotion to the sales side is extremely hard. There are 200 apps a year for 25-50 sales jobs. You have to kiss major butt and kill your metrics to get ahead. It is just too many people applying for those jobs. Managers will say that there are so many positions you can work in, but in reality they are all the same job, with a x<5000 in pay differential in the service side.

7562,Fidelity Investments,It's a stepping stone at best.,2015-11-27,2.0,Financial Services Representative,"Fidelity has an incredibly in-depth four month long training program that will not only bring pre-licensed financial representatives up to speed to pass their Series 7 and 63's (even for those completely new to the industry), but will also familiarize you with all of the software that would be used on a day-to-day basis. Generally speaking, upon completion of the program, financial representatives are capable of adequately performing the job duties in what is objectively a complicated job function without any sort of assistance. Also, barring a layoff climate or doing anything illegal, job security is very, very high; never hitting your numbers will still get you your weekly paycheck. If you play the game, opportunity is most certainly there to advance (and your manager will be first in line to assist you in achieving your goals), but you can only go so far in the call center, both in terms of job duties and salary.","Unfortunately, the training program is where my positive experience ended. Employees are reminded every day from the first time they peruse the careers website, to the job interview, to on-boarding, to training, to team meetings, that Fidelity isn't like Merrill Lynch, Schwab, JP Morgan, or any other player in the game; Fidelity is a family-owned company and doesn't have to play to it's shareholders, and thus they are one of the few in the business ""for the customer"". That sure sounds nice, but beyond being family-owned, it's just not true. This job is in a 24/7 call center, and just like every call center in the world, metrics are king. You'll never move up anywhere in the company for retaining a multi-million dollar account or preventing perilous actions through education of financial instruments or any other morally outstanding action... you'll move up for finishing your calls on an average of less than eight minutes. This ""time = money"" focus exacerbates an already-beaurocratic business structure by incentivizing representatives to transfer their calls or to be curt to the point of being entirely unhelpful. That's fine, and almost expected from most call center representatives with other companies, but in financial services, it's unacceptable; you're dealing with people's retirement accounts and livelihoods. On the sales side, recommendations are limited to proprietary target-date funds and bloated, high-fee ""managed"" accounts. Going above and beyond to solve problems that are repeatedly surfacing and are consistently unaddressed is a habit discouraged by management: ""that's not your job"". Other than their own propaganda, nothing differentiates this company from the other financial services firms--do not take a potential paycut to choose Fidelity over them with the idea that you'll be working for some sort of Red Cross organization, even though they will spin it that way. At the end of the day, this is a 24/7 call center (where your job is to verify customers, reset passwords, give website support, send checks, and enter trades at their direction...financial professional is thrown around very loosely around Fidelity, but I would not consider the FR to be one) that is ALWAYS hiring. If you weren't able to deduce, there is an unhealthy amount of turnover at Fidelity due to employees leaving for increased responsibilities and salaries (most Jax representatives went to Merrill, which was literally across the street!). On the other hand, if you have some sort of relevant degree or experience and are out of work, there is a ton of job security and experience to be gained here. It's a stepping stone at best."

The hours seems reasonable and not ever having to work weekends seemed great,"I went through the entire hiring process and was made an offer, went for drug testing , fingerprinting and to have a badge made . On a Monday before class started I mentioned I was pregnant . On that Tuesday I recieved a call from hr asking question regarding my pregnancy , on Thursday I recieved a very rude call stating they were withdrawing my offer due to ""unspecified concerns that came up during background check"" even though the background portion had already been completed and passed long before... There's no doubt in my mind that they changed their mind due to my pregnancy , which Im pretty sure is illegal. I'm very disappointed , I was looking forward to this job and wasn't even expecting a maternity leave from them, I was back at my current job when my youngest was only 6 days old. There's nothing in my background that should've kept me from getting hired , per their rules that I looked over carefully. Whatever their reasons, I know that my merit and experience more than qualified me for this position , and my character has never been questioned, especially by an employer or associate. Their loss I guess."

7595,Fidelity Investments,Co-op Student,2015-11-09,5.0,,Fidelity invests in their co-op students. They had between 20-40 co-op students each semester (most in Toronto Office). Every week HR organized walkthroughs of different departments and seminars to help co-op students better understand their business. Co-op students get many benefits including presentations from Portfolio Managers and guides on interviewing and recruiting to professional etiquette. Of all of my co-op terms I was treated best at fidelity and that was a common experience. Fidelity is also a very highly respected employer to have on your CV.,"A con to Fidelity is that there are a limited number of investment roles. Their investment team might hire one top student a year. There are roles available in Sales, Finance, Products and Accounting but no investment roles. As far as I could tell you would have a better chance getting a job with McKinsey than investing money for Fidelity. This isn't really a con to co-op students as much as it is to grads who want to actually do investing."

If you are the sort of person who thinks differently and enjoys a dynamic environment, this is probably not the place for you. Being told what to do by Boston, as in other US multinationals, can make for an easy, but un-challenging routine.

(you get the pattern) Too bad, it will eat into your phone statistics since they measure how many seconds of every minute you're actually on the phone and report it to you every morning. FORCED over time for 10 months out of the year (i.e kiss your weekends goodbye) even though on the interview they claim it's just for 1-2 months.

7692,Fidelity Investments,High Net Worth,2015-10-03,5.0,High Net Worth,"This job is technically a ""call center"", but don't let that dissuade you, Fidelity an amazing place to work. The benefits, training, and exposure to the financial markets are invaluable. For those wanting to enter the industry that do not have degrees from overpriced private colleges, Fidelity is the place to be. You will work alongside some of the best and the brightest, ambitious individuals who come from a wide array of backgrounds, all sharing a common desire to help the uneducated investor find success.

I can only speak for the Jacksonville, FL location, but the training is phenomenal. The series 7 instructors, alongside the rest of the learning and development team will make sure you are successful. You will have to be self motivated though, every day during the initial training you will be coming home to take 1-3 hour tests, but if you ever need assistance with a concept the mentors are there for you - and are actually encouraged to help you by being paid overtime.

Whether you want to move up in Fidelity or leave and go to another firm, this is a great place to get your foot in the door in a normally very competitive industry.

Benefits are amazing. Make sure you take advantage of everything.

With the brand new systems in place, schedules are more flexible!","If you want to go to a role involving financial analysis, or anything unrelated to the direct relationship with the clients, it is almost impossible to do starting from the phone roles, you will easily get a job at another firm with the training and certifications you gain, so you may have to jump around from firm to firm.

The advisory/guidance roles in Fidelity are less ""sales"" related in comparison to say Merrill Lynch, but they are still sales related. At the end of the month if you did not speak with a single customer that needed an annuity, you should not see any form of negative impact for not putting someone in one. Fidelity should be leading the industry in the charge towards a more ""fiduciary"" standard.

The compensation was recently increased to 42k for the entry level, which is okay, but honestly everyone across the board should receive about an extra ~10k. Fidelity can afford to do it, and the retention rates would drastically increase. Most of the employees are recent college graduates, so amazing healthcare and benefits are not as important as cash money to invest."

Some execs are reassigned to lead departments in which they have no experience and are clueless about strategies and issues.  Overall, they are very slow to take action on toxic performers, which causes turnover of  the solid performers who can get jobs elsewhere and not have to deal with the grief caused by the toxic colleagues.  Sr. leaders ask for feedback and suggestions, but rarely act on honest input - it's easier for them to manage the status quo.

This is a financial sales company, not a financial services firm.  The goal year in and year out is to maximize sales at the cost of providing true financial planning services to clients and developing relationships.
Book sizes are over 500 and by nature, representatives have little incentive to interact with current book clients unless there is new money coming in.  Reps are constantly not following up with their own clients because there is no incentive to stay true to a relationship model.  The planning is a masked service, run by computers and over complicated pieces of marketing material.  When each ""solution"" for a client is a fidelity managed account, you start to question what actual planning you are really doing.  If I client does not want a managed account, there is barely anything you can do for them, besides show them how to research on their own, defeating the purpose of a ""guidance"" appointment.  Management is constantly looking at ways to better the years previously at the cost of the reps and the clients.  More appointments, more phone calls is the name of the game.  It is impossible to keep a relationship model when this is the driving force behind it.  

If you want to provide financial planning guidance in a more meaningful way, it is best to join an RIA, which is where fidelity is losing most of its staff to anyway."

Tuition reimbursement, 10% profit sharing, 7% 401k match, health reimbursement (gym memberships), etc.  They are very lax compared to other companies when it comes to using sick time, last minute vacation, and changing your shift to accomplish a better work/life balance.

This means you actually have time to think and do things right with less pressure to simply deliver.,"Not a performance based company.   While they claim to be,  monetary reward system tends to be socialistic with little distinction for a person's productivity. Much of compensation is tied to 401K as opposed to cash in pocket.  Will know more on this once I've gone through the bonus round.  Once you get hired in you are fairly well set since they tend to steer away from terminations, rather they look first to place people in another position.

Fidelity is on the wrong track, this has not always been true, however, seems to be the direction they are taking in 2015. It boggles ones mind that a company the size of Fidelity would not find the best talent in the industry, instead of promoting mediocre sales people to manage branches, most of whom do not know the first thing about how to treat employees.

Some groups work in crowded arrangements because leadership will not support any official work from home arrangements.
Lack of oversight on Directors and Vice Presidents with direct reports. A bad apple can really tear a department apart. 
Review process is not individual. People are stack ranked and there are quotas on high ratings. Even if you have 2 star performers, only 1 can receive the most excellent rating. The process is truly not individualized.
People provide reviews for employees they have had very little interaction with. Can get very personal.

Poltiical maneuvering among senior leaders is widespread, a result of C-level unwillingness to set direction clearly or resolve conflicts decisively. Company culture is consensus-driven - often from the bottom up in that individuals, groups and teams are left to work things out themselves - and when issues among teams arise that cannot be resolved below the SVP level, they remain unaddressed and left to fester until things get bad enough that someone senior HAS to step in, usually with more fallout than would have been necessary if the problem had been addressed earlier. There is a serious blind spot when it comes to recognizing the limits of consensus-building and the fact that leadership by directive is sometimes necessary.

Great potential for advancement","Fidelity - who is a recordkeeper for who knows how many companies 401k plans, has a 5 year cliff vesting schedule, and you're not even 20% vested in company contributions until 2 years.

The systems provided need a MAJOR overhaul.  There are procedural specific systems and client specific systems to use when handling calls.  These systems are not updated, so 1/2 the time you are under a constant worry if you are handling something incorrectly.  When cross trained on multiple products, you are not trained completely, so customers can ask questions you are supposed to be able to answer, but you can't because you don't know.  The answer is supposed to be searchable while you put the customer on hold to get the answer.  But holds can only be for 3 minutes, and it can take a lot longer than 3 minutes to find the answer because 1/2 the time when you search something the system comes back with no results. 

If a customer escalates, they don't go to your immediate manager, you're to call your ""solutions desk and escalate the call"" and that rep is supposed to handle the call from that point.  However the solutions desk reps are extremely lazy and will do anything and everything to push the call back on the tier 1 rep because they don't want to handle the call, thus causing the customers to become completely frustrated, yelling and screaming at us over why we are not transferring them to a supervisor, and then give us a bad customer survey.

If you need to enter a work item, they are shipped off shore to some reps in India to handle who have no idea what they are doing.  So they resolve the work item incorrectly, and we need to enter multiple work items for the same exact thing over and over.  We promise customers a 5 day work around timeframe and something so simple can take over 1 mo to resolve because the India reps just don't care.   The customers become very upset over how long it takes to resolve a simple error. 

While the company offers great potential for advancement, it is all in who you know, not what you know.  I had an interview for an internal transfer once, and while I was nervous as I didn't have a lot of interview experience at the time, my interviewer was constantly yawning and looking at his phone even before the interview started.  I don't think I was that boring, but that was extremely unprofessional and I can't believe he got the job he did because while I didn't get it, once trained I'm sure I would've been way more suited for the position. 

When you do need your manager and not a ""solutions desk rep"" they are nowhere to be found because they are always ""in a meeting"".  

This job creates a lot of extremely stressful situations, but when you become frustrated and voice your opinion, you're in the wrong and put under review or fired.  You can offer suggestions on how you think things should be and how to correct it, and management will pat you on the back for it, but then nothing is ever done to fix anything."

- Large enough company to move around in and chart a career path

- Pockets of great situations (good leadership, interesting work, challenging opportunities)","- Those pockets of great situations are growing fewer and further between each day, the amount of influence one's boss can have on their career at Fidelity is astounding ... in 3 different jobs, I was rewarded (1) on par/average, (2) over-the-top with $$$ and shares and promotions, and (3) not at all .... my approach to the work didn't change in any of those jobs, so it shows that people of equal talent and skills could expect significantly different experiences at this company

 - Jobs are moving out of Boston, so local opportunities are few and far between ... those that pop up are usually pre-reserved for a hiring manager's friend (i.e. probably not the most qualified candidate), so the talent base is watering down, causing animosity, and those that want to advance their career in the Boston-area have to look elsewhere

- There is a layer of lifers at the Director / VP level that have settled into a comfort zone, earning high salaries from the days of raises/big bonuses (long gone), they are staying off the radar, and don't want to rock the boat ... so they are stifling innovation, they are roadblocks to progress, and they are blocking career opportunities for younger, talented, innovative staff members.

- Didn't get a raise in 3 years despite the company pulling in $2.2-2.4B in profit each year, was told it'd be made up to me in the form of a ""higher bonus"", but the bonuses were the same each year.

2. The pay is very good especially considering the work/life balance: I declined a job that paid 10k more, but fidelity pays overtime, where as the other job was gonna work me 55-65hours per week. NOT worth it. Fidelity provides a very good pay with the ability for those who want to work over-time to make more money.
3.Great opportunities for growth. They pay you to get your licenses, they have great tuition reimbursement benefits. If you are ambitious and want to grow, Fidelity is your place. I am already planning to get my licenses, an MBA, a masters in law, and move up in the next 6-7 years. 
4. A great culture with efficiency to its core.
5. Healthy lifestyle emphasis. They have the FIT food which means salads and healthy food is super cheap. How affordable? $2 for a salad vs $10 for hamburger. Yes, they want their employees to be healthy and thank goodness. They also have a recreation center and a health center.

8157,Fidelity Investments,Genuine Fidelity Gurgaon Review IT Professional,2015-04-08,1.0,Senior Analyst,Major Pros: Free Cab and free food. Thats it!  Might be lenient towards female employees. Used to be a good firm 5 years back,"Hi Folks,

This is an honest review from someone who is been working for 4 Years in this company Fidelity Gurgaon Unitech cyber park office.
Total experience is of 8 Years now.
I have seen this company on all its sections functioning in gurgaon. So i will comment on each dept individually. Myself been part of I.T Technology department, i have worked in development/maintenace and support roles in this company so knows in and out. This review is completely transparent and genuine.


I.T Technology Dept Review: 

1) Only if you join above ""Tech spec/Project Lead"" level i.e 10 plus years this company might be for you otherwise please go to any service based firm even if you are paid little less. The life below the 10 Years guy is a hazardous journey. The people at higher level are sitting for more than a decade,  they do not have any kind of skills ..be it technical/managerial. Pure office politics and not giving credits and demotivation from senior management. Knowledge sharing is not a concept here, only self learning and politics is the mantra.

2) The Support profiles in company L1/L2/L3 ,People in these roles are highly frustrated, There is no learning there are no knowledge sharing sessions between development and support team.The heads of two departments are often on rivalry which leads to suffering of employees only. They do not have work life balance, the shift allowance and oncall support allowance are worst than any other firm. Working in night shift entitles you to a mere 200 rs a day and being oncall for 24 hrs even on weekend from home entitles you to only 350 rs a day. 
The project once developed is made live and the support team is not made aware till the release day what they are going to support in production :):).

2) Zero onsite opportunity, and by chance if there is any(1 week/1 month) they make you travel on sunday night ..reach UK on monday morning directly to join office then dey make you fly back on friday evening after office...as they dont believe on spending even for 1 xtra day to employee....and per diem they give is 28 pounds. Which is lowest.

3) High disparity in salaries within peers. A mid level employee salary difference could be in 1-8 lacs, so you can imagine the disparity level as you go up.

4) Their promotion cycle is July? But the clever HR has declared minimum difference for next role change is 18 months. So that automatically comes to 2 years. And mgmt will obviously take 2 cycles as a concept to promote you so minimum 4 years of waiting for a promotion after ""senior analyst programmer"" which is for 5 plus years itself and ranges to 10 years.

5) Bonus potential. It is part of pkg only and based on rating it is reduced as well . So how they can call it bonus. Next is you have to wait for year end to get it, if you leave between, it is completely surrendered.

6) No HR in the company. There is high shortage of HR. There is no concept of HR meeting of whatsoever. The HR is not available in the company for anything you dont have any HR to discuss any grieviance you have. There is just payroll department. All the HR are contractual ppl passed from colleges..they are kids just for recruitng people, even talking to them feels ashamed of urself.

7) Company itself finding difficult to cut off the extremely highly paid people working in the company since beginning. These people are stuck to company like termites they have packages equivalent to what their team is getting and are not a value to company. So company is slowly trying to get rid of them and past 5 years there has been sacking of people at higher levels quietly.


Operations-Back Office Department Overview:

1) It is worst for Operations / back-office department people.  Long hours.Strict breaks of 60 mins, which are being checked via software which checks the login hours of employee on computer.If the time out is more than 1 hr then he is to be scolded.

2) Worst paid, over worked. Highly uneducated an unprofessional culture in Operations team. So 1 rating for that. Just for sake of getting a job and so called brand name ..you can join Fidelity in operations. It is worst then call centers."

Don't expect  integrity in HR.  Lack of diversity at management levels.  The most consistent complaint to HR is that the same people get the rewards and opportunities.

It is not the company that it used to be, regularly laying off senior people with some or other excuses and hiring at the same time at lower level. Being a very big company, groups works in silos. So, some group may be worst than the other, specially if you are applying in SIPD group, careful. Very unstable."

Its as they promise - atleast in my previous roles. Fantastic 401k matching and PSP. Great benefits, great training. Overall pleasant company to start with if you're new in the industry or ready to retire","Its a machine and you get treated like a replaceable cog. Heavy micromanagement to control output of product (ie what you say to clients) They're like the mcdonalds of financial services - you know what you get, whether good or bad. Working there you're forced to adopt their processes and procedures with exact scripts, very robotic - often times reminds me they want you to be a parrot (ie repeat what they say with greater enthusiasm, then they feed you a cracker like Iago from Aladdin). Management recruits you by promising you a book of business and that its like you running your own business but with fidelity's resources and support. Further from the truth. Once you're in, you always have to continue to generate revenue for the firm. This doesn't lend a good hand towards servicing your existing customers. Good pay, but its a hamster wheel.

The facilities are nice and some of your coworkers can be friendly. Training and L&D structure is quite good.,"Incompetent management who are only around to spy on employees every waking moment of the day. They drill you with metrics and are quick to point out the negative aspects of your performance while glossing over any positive aspects. For example, you could be leading your team in trade accuracy yet they will berate you for the fact you take a few extra seconds in between calls to wrap things up. Your metrics suffer if you have to use the restroom when you aren't on a break (often times you go a 3 or 3.5-hour stretch without one). Your schedule is outside of your control and offers no room for any leeway (I would always have break and lunch at different times every single day of the week). If you work on a schedule where you have to work on weekends there is almost zero chance of you ever getting a Saturday or Sunday off. Many of your coworkers and managers are rude, narcissistic egoists who will do anything to get ahead. There is almost no room for upward mobility if you start in the call center - something made very clear early on. It's just an endless line of phone jobs, finding a spot where you aren't working on the phone is exceedingly rare. Despite the fact that it does pay well, reps are still underpaid for the amount of work they must do. Full traders are almost always sitting in a position where there are 20+ calls holding all day for the entire 10 hour shift. Soul-crushing monotony with zero work/life balance, this job will inevitably make you wish you would get in a fatal car accident on the way in to work."

Ridiculous amount of people working on small projects that in any normal software house would take 3 weeks but take 3 months in fmr.  The Ireland offices are pretty much treated as an off-shore group, work is allocated from the US, but Ireland is not seen as an equal partner. You are expected to fill the time with coming up with ""innovation"" ideas, which basically means trying to convince the US partners to let you have more people ... exacerbating the first issue which is there's too many people and not enough work.

Management, in general, is a bunch of glad-handing guys and gals.  You seldom see managers let go/demoted, even if they are consistently poor performers/coaches.

Regardless of the experience, credentials and skills you bring to the role, you will still be managed like a $10/hour customer service rep. In my experience, don't look to your manager to provide career and professional development, that is up to you. Lastly, depending on the level you are hired at (i.e. 25, 27, 29) you will not be eligible for the full, advertised bonus. This is the great unspoken fallacy of this position.

Fidelity really seems to take care of its employees.  I heard when I first joined, and it seems to be true, that you can do your basic 9-5 and be fine.  No one bats an eye.  But if you go above and beyond, then you'll be rewarded with promotions & salary.  Pays well with sizeable end-of-year and 401k bonuses.  Benefits are good, 401k match is fantastic, as you would expect of a company that specializes in retirement plans.  The only people I've seen be let go by the company really deserved it.","""Relationship company"" means politics are everywhere, especially in middle management.

- Gurukool sessions
- Good quality work
- Good transport facilities
- Great marketing of own brand
- Good leave policy","After I quit the company, I realized how come there are so many good reviews about this company. Then I realised probably they're the ones who never had any work in the company during work-hrs

- no work-life balance, Managers will tell u upfront to work till 16 hrs a day and shout at you in front of everyone ( ask u to do development during day time and Prod support at night)
- improper performance review, biased and politically influenced
- Ethics helpline is just a gimmick, there is blatant favoritism etc
- HR is a puppet who are mere slaves of managers/directors
- BAD BAD COMPENSATION: Bonus is HEAVILY included in the CTC and they'll eat away all you own money
- They'll give a huge chunk like 50K as transportation which U wont get upto even a penny if u dont opt for (good for far flung commuters)
- NO TAX saving options in salary and U get MEAGRE take-home (the company earns keeping all ur money in their own FDs)

This is a great place to start (but don't stay long),"Fidelity is one of the lowest paying company in the financial industry. They start you at $38K. I have been offered $20K - $30K more doing the same for other companies. The quarterly bonus is a joke. If you are a decent rep you can max you bonus really fast. The company does not care if you have post graduate degrees--you will not advance for being better educated and prepared then the next guy. Also, the company has this weird mentality to promote women. If you are a woman and want to advance fast, apply here. Management will hire less qualified women over qualified men just because of their gender. I have seen friends who had 3 years experience or more apply for a job, and management will hire a girl who is still going through full trader training. If you are looking to get paid three times as much, get trained here and apply at Moran Stanley or eTrade.

I left voluntarily with a strong professional network and tremendous experience, for which I am grateful.","The culture of the company has really deteriorated - there have been many management changes and shifts in direction.  The benefits are still great, but I don't think the compensation is as competitive as it used to be.

8308,Fidelity Investments,Poor Management,2015-01-20,1.0,Financial Representative,"Good work-life balance if they aren't understaffed and requiring OT

Easy to move up in certain sites","Poor management - There are far to many managers, doing far too little work. When call volume goes up the managers have less to do and can be seen watching youtube or congregating around a desk talking about their children. Their success depends on their teams metrics but the metrics are a crap shoot for the most part. Being promoted is all politics - its about who you know and how hard you can suck up. That may just be how the world works and I am just naive, but this is certainly not a meritocracy.

Metrics - It is understandable that a call center would have metrics, but even the best employees will miss them. They are arbitrary numbers that management places too much weight on.

Faceless Corporation - There is no room for personality, uniqueness, or creativity. Maybe a symptom of a highly regulated industry but feels more like the policies of a faceless corporation.

Monotonous - This is a call center. You take calls. All day. If you are seen taking a break out of schedule you will be told that what ever you are doing can wait till your scheduled break.

Pay - TIAA CREF offers the same position for better pay, more relaxed environment, and more reasonable metrics. They are snatching people from our offices left and right."

There are multiple shifts available to you which you bid for, and most people receive their first choice in shifts.
Amazing, supportive co-workers.
The best technology I have used in the Finance industry.
401(k) matching is among the best in the industry, but annual salary is not competitive.
Good work/life balance.
Team outings each quarter.","The call volume is ridiculous, and you spend most of your time resetting passwords, even once you are on the full-trader gate.
Fidelity talks a lot about career development, but team meetings and one-on-one coaching sessions with your manager are constantly canceled due to call volume.  A manager cannot develop his/her employees without ever speaking with them.
Even when you are promoted you do not get a raise, you get an increase in variable comp, and that is determined by whether you hit your metrics.  You can get a ""promotion"" without ever getting a ""raise"".
Management is hit-or-miss.  I worked for a couple of amazing, hands-on managers who were very engaged with their teams. I also worked for a few managers that appeared to do nothing other than sit around and play games on their phones all day.
A lot of push-back from different departments when you try to transfer calls.
Metrics are constantly changing.  What is important one quarter may be meaningless the next quarter.  It makes it very difficult to try to establish a routine on your calls when you don't know what measurements your bonus will be based on.
This is a call center job.  Don't try to kid yourself, you will be on the phones 8 hrs/day.  Unless you get a position in a branch, you will be on the phones, even if you are ""promoted"" to another role."

Occasional travel to conferences once you have experience.  Abundance of opportunity to learn if you apply yourself.  A good job out of college for a few years and then it's best to move on.","This particular position is a dead end, but management may lead you to believe your responsibility will improve or that you are doing work that is important.  The work is simply making charts and analyzing numbers in Excel, which others will use to make decisions and this gets boring quickly.  The people you will work for can be high strung and passive aggressive, so they will ask you to do something and then hover over you until it is done, or they will be short with you and then friendly later on to make up for their initial rudeness.  Few of them have the time to teach you, so be prepared to learn on your own.  The corporate culture is poor because the main hires are highly intellectual people from top universities who typically have limited social ability.  People in my department went through the day with little social interaction and when they did interact it was forced and awkward.  The managers are better socially, but they don't know how to lead people because their prior roles were individualistic assignments.  Those assignments didn't allow for the opportunity to hone people management or leadership skills.  Instead of rolling up their sleeves and making the occasional tough call, managers sometimes pay people lip service and kick the can down the road.  Management's personnel decisions come slowly or not at all for fear that those decisions won't work out and it will reflect poorly on them.  Upper level executives are slow to make any drastic or necessary operating and strategic decisions, which are required in this rapidly changing industry.  The company is strategically behind the 8 ball as a result.  People usually stick around for so long because it pays well and people sort of muddle through New England life at this company."

Advancement is limited to very specific paths. It's rare to see someone move outside of these paths. 
So many managers with so little formal education in management or prior experience. Stunned at lower level management incompetence, although they are powerless to promote change as upper management directives and metrics are etched in stone and beyond reproach as the higher level VP's strive to hit their own metrics at the expense of their departments well being. No happy work balance here. Voluntary/mandatory overtime is the norm, as the company is completely understaffed on the front lines.

Very customer focused, which is a pro if you are a customer/client.","My manager loves to over coach you to the point you feel as though you are incompetent. There are others that do the same. This is part of the coddling Fidelity does to their clients. If you are in a service role in a phone site you will be expected to place trades that fall into the complicated and varied internal rules that often defy logic. If a client wants to place a trade and you place it without questioning the client on why and how they are wanting to place it, you will be scrutinized. Fidelity's internal trading and distribution rules imply that all of their clients are idiots and we must save them from themselves. If you miss the opportunity to save the client from their own actions you will be charged an error. They will tell you how easy it is to exceed the quarterly bonus and get a full payout, but it is far from the truth. You have to trade error free, have efficient calls, meet sales lead goals, and have positive client surveys. The entire team has to meet their goals in order to maximize payout. Without significant experience most error free traders don't have efficient calls, because they are spending ten minutes a trade to make sure one of the silly rules isn't being violated. If you receive good surveys then your probably not meeting your lead goals, because despite the belief, not every client wants to be probed for opportunities.

Perceived job promotions, movement, reorganizations are more lateral movements."
8355,Fidelity Investments,Decent compensation but all advancement is purely political.,2014-12-24,2.0,,Compensation is comparable to other large financial services companies.  Benefits used to be among the best in the industry but that has fallen in recent years.,"In my department advancement, whether in the form of formal promotions or stretch assignments, go only to those with contacts at higher levels.  Midlevel managers routinely tell subordinates that they believe the subordinates deserve advancement but that none is available unless the subordinate can figure out a way for senior managers to take notice.  Senior managers don't believe this is a problem because they see promotions going to the people they know are good.  They are oblivious to how many good people work there that they don't know.  That is because people rise to the top at Fidelity by managing up, not managing down.

There are two types of senior managers.  One is the Fidelity Lifer who understands how to play the game.  Don't try to change anything, don't take any chances, figure out how to not get your finger prints on anything that might fail and know that after 20 years you can retire extremely wealthy.  The other is the short timer who comes in from another company expecting to get things done.  They take chances, they get involved in new projects that take the company in new directions and they are the first to be blamed when things fail.  These people rarely last long."

They will talk about other areas career-wise but those positions are extremely rare and very taboo to get into i.e. Branch, research, rotational programs, marketing etc. Hard time retaining talent because of pay scale and willingness to pay external hires much more than the people they hire in initially. Entry-level service managers come off arrogant and micro manage to the point the job is unbearable. Boast about retirement benefits when in reality you do not see profit sharing nor match for the first full year and none of it vests immediately after that.

Management did not have an effective way to deal with a problem employee. I was hired with all my licenses and 4 years of experience into the financial rep role to eventually move into a sales role (after 9 mos to a year). After 3 months I had been repeatedly told by management that I was not filling the role ""effectively"". I received almost no training and was expected to not make a mistake. The job is not hard but being ""written up"" and receiving ""warnings"" for every mistake caused a lot of issues. They did not use me for the talents I had, I started looking for other employment within 60 days of starting. I have worked at 100% commission and was less stressed out than here.

You are driven to set as many appointments as possible (and tag as much business as possible) so that you look better than your peers
The only way to get ahead is to brown nose your superiors and those that have access to give you potential leads (thus people are being promoted on the basis that they were  ""liked"" in the company and not by their performance).
All that matters is your Fidelity ""Buzz"" 
There is very little to no upward movement for promotions."

There are multiple layers of management who don't really know anything about technology.

Good engineers typically get frustrated with all the politics and beauracracy and leave after a few years.

Good brand recognition from customers, but this can turn into a negative if you lack humility.  Most reps are not as good as you think.  The green machine is doing a lot of the heavy lifting, but those who are good at building value and relationships can transfer those skills to an RIA and do really well.","- Although micro-management is mentioned in almost every review, I think it stems from not trusting your veteran representatives.  Fidelity feels like they have to control people from the top, having branch managers regurgitate sentiments from the top.  This also leads to *bleep* rolling downhill.  Some managers did prove themselves as good salespeople, but eventually have to drink the Kool-Aid or they won't last long.  Either that or they give up because they can't change the system.  Other managers were opportunists who rose through the ranks quickly, moving fast enough before people can realize they aren't as good as they appeared.

- Compensation:  Yes, you can make very good money here, but if you're really good, you can make way more outside.  Compensation is figured out ahead of time and they reverse-engineer the compensation plan to get AE's back to target comp.  The last couple of years, they've reduced some of the pay, like basis points on new flows, coinciding with the S&P at historical highs.  Oddly enough, they had a reduction in force in 2009 because they based payroll on the S&P and had to cut people.  So when the market's down, you're screwed, and when the market's up, you're also screwed.  Ultimately, you can't keep lying about AE/SAEs being in relationship roles when your compensation is still based on selling products.  And this relationship model is 5 years old."

Bonuses are higher in fin'l services than other places and Fidelity will pay you quarterly bonuses plus profit sharing bonus.  Fidelity teaches you how to ask questions in discussions w/ clients so you can better understand who your client is and what solution fits best. Good career path for goal driven young people as they can become managers.  Recreation room with video gaming system and ping pong tables. Company loves to hire internally for regional offices.,"Unfortunately to excel you simply have to take more calls than anyone so you can outperform in your metrics.  A 45 minute discussion w/ your client about how best to invest his/her money is a stat killer.  Big focus on pushing people to 'do it yourself' online. I've been in fin'l services for 9 years...young managers aren't good managers. Fidelity does allow people to become managers when they are not skilled enough to do it. As a seasoned outside person who started with Fidelity, their max starting salary to outsiders was $45k...below what seasoned people make.

8393,Fidelity Investments,Burn Out from Politics - Not from Call Center Work.,2014-11-21,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Health benefits are great, with different options/price levels to choose from. Great 401k/Profit Sharing. If you come in knowing little to nothing about finance - they are willing to train, if you are willing to put in the work. The sponsor & pay for licenses. If you are a personable person and like working with the public, you will enjoy the customer base for the most part. Their technology in the call center has come a long way since I first started, so those that might complain about it here with less than a year of service should consider themselves lucky. Finally, misery loves company - so you'll have some great camaraderie with your fellow employees!","I don't know about other call centers in the company - but in ours, they schedule overtime automatically into your schedule then you have to opt out by a specific time otherwise you're expected to work it. People on here keep calling the vacation time ""PTO"" but it's not truly. It's accrued vacation time, max of 4 weeks a year (depending on years of service), and it's use it or lose it (no carry over to next year). The NH call centers are ""triple AAA"" rated, meaning if there is a weather event or crisis in another center, we cover for them if they need to close, and if we have bad weather here - we're still open regardless. In the call center, you have to schedule your vacation time about a year in advance, but they do give you the option to change dates through the year. Vacation date availability is doled based on seniority in your ""gate,"" but to be honest, this is really the most fair way to do it. Just don't expect to have any big holidays off in your first couple of years there is what I'm saying. 

There's little upward mobility. They have a Management Apprenticeship Program, but the people I've seen go into it aren't those that work their tails off - it's those that buddy up to their manager. When you come out of the program, you might go right back to your old position, until a manager position opens up - eventually. Also, on this vein - I started the company working a late second shift, but needed to change to a first shift for personal reasons. My manager at the time was resistant to have me move - not because we were shorthanded on the 2nd shift - he said 1st shift was reserved for those who ""earned"" it, and that it was a ""reward."" Now there are times when people are actually HIRED for 1st shift, so how is that a reward for those who are just hired? Nor am I a lackluster employee. 

As a rep over 6 years, I've probably had 10+ managers - and my position hasn't changed. So it's very hard to know what is expected of you, and to truly succeed. With having so many managers, any goals that I've set with previous managers have gotten lost and I've had to start from the bottom. If you want something for yourself, such as a new position, you better work for it, and work fast. Also, don't ever get comfortable at your cubicle, you will move. Alot. 

If you ever take a Leave of Absence, expect that when you come back, that the call center may have been reorg'd and your position as you knew it when you left is no longer available, and the new position that is taking over may not be offered to you. 

There are no COLA raises. 

Finally, if you ever have a problem with a manager, the burden of proof is entirely on you to prove you are being mistreated somehow. Management sticks with Management, and HR will listen but is more likely to provide ""helpful"" advice for conflict resolution than to step in, unless you're accusing them of a major infraction."

Initial management are the employees who couldn't make it in what they actually wanted to do or just wanted to be lazy.

In fact there was proactive approach to protecting customers. A great place to work if you have a good executive level manager. Benefits become very good the longer you stay with the company.
Genuine attempt to provide outstanding customer service.","Unfortunately upward management, confidence and spin rather than quality and quantity of work or good management skills is a very successful technique for promotion to the executive level. This results in some cynicism from smart observant lower level employees that see this happening. 
Strong movement away from being a technology leader to lower costs and operational excellence as a competitive advantage. So no longer an outstanding technology company to work in if you are a technologist.
The company is in a constant state of reorganization. This includes offshoring to India then China, downsizing, moving staff to new locations in the US. This creates huge waste and insecurity for many employees here and offshore."

There is good potential for promotion, however, only in client facing roles.  In other words, it is a call center.","It is a call center and it is hard talking to people for eight hours a day about their finances.  Clients are often old and sometimes senile, often needing help online or setting up transactions. The work can be stressful.

They preach the ""culture"" and ""what is possible"". Well, the reality is the culture is corporately sickening and the fact that the ones who have a clue leave before the green Kool Aid totally zaps the life out of you. ISR managers are a joke.

Joke clients that think they are big shots because they trade 200 times a year in a $20k account. Management makes employees think they are actually making an impact on the business when they actually have no control whatsoever. Your bonus is 99% based on customer surveys which you have NO control over. And your manager has the authority to subjectively slice up the bonus pool based on who they like and do not like ( I did fine in bonuses, it is just a terrible way of handling it). Your variable comp as they like to call has very little to do with your overall performance. The Active Trader group has this allure of being a specialty group and close to an institutional trading desk, when really all it is is another phone site job. You just have to be a bit better at handling jerks on the phone and entering trades timely and accurately. Pay is very low, and exit opps are NON - Existent. It is nearly impossible to explain what you did in ATS to any future employers. Other than sponsoring to sit for the Series 4 exam you build zero career equity.

The training is good and you get a lot of support.  Management encourages feedback and evaluation of everything.  Fidelity promotes from within.  If you are a young person just starting out in a new career, it is an excellent place to get started and move up.  They like to train people into their own culture and reward those who comply.  When you apply for other opportunities, they give you feedback if you are not chosen.   The benefits package is good.  Even though this is a call center environment and it can be busy, it is a pleasant place to be and I have never felt overly micro-managed.  The callers are usually nice and pleasant and management encourages helping the customer no matter how long it takes.  Customers routinely tell us how they appreciate the service they get.  There are often potlucks and employee appreciation events and fun things going on.","The facility is in a somewhat remote location and is a long drive.  If you are an experienced person, unfortunately opportunities to move up seem to be more limited.  The company tends to prefer training inexperienced people instead of promoting people who have experience from elsewhere.  The recruiters will promise you career opportunities, but there are some interesting politics involved in getting the other opportunities that they do not tell you about.  There are a lot of very young managers who started out with the company, but who do not have a lot of management experience.  While everyone is very nice and friendly, sometimes they seem to be intimidated by older, more experienced staff and look for ways to deny opportunities instead of trying to fit people in where they are most qualified."

8450,Fidelity Investments,Corporate cult environment,2014-10-11,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"You get great benefits - everything from health insurance, disability, to shopping discounts. It pays rather well considering that you don't need much experience beyond customer service to get hired here. Fidelity also embraces diversity and community service.","This company has an uncomfortably cult like environment. Everyone has to put on an air of completely loving Fidelity and loving their job like they are brainwashed robots; if you don't play along, you will have problems. If you want to reveal your true feelings about the job, or you have something remotely negative to say, think carefully about who to confide in. It's actually pretty vital to be over the top pro-Fidelity if you want any chance of transferring around or getting a promotion one day. However, plenty of people still don't get to move around or get the promotions that they deserve because they don't act brainwashed enough and/or they're so good that they are kept trapped in the call center forever. Some managers have all but lost their call center skills and they basically serve as cheerleader coaches. They might ""coach"" you on what to say, but rarely will get on the phone themselves and have lost touch with what the job entails.

In the call center you are micro-managed severely. Co-workers and managers will sit down with you and pick apart your calls word for word. You'll be invited to pick apart other calls as well. Every second on the job is recorded and timed. If your call extends into your lunch break or you have to take an extra bathroom break, you'll be out of adherence which you will be reprimanded for and which will affect your next bonus. Your bonus is completely up to your manager's discretion, by the way, which has quite a few implications. Your team will compete with other teams to have the best stats and you will receive judgment for yours, even though most of it seems nonsensical and/or out of your control.

Orientation frames the job as pretty great. You have a blast with your new co-workers and are spoiled with fun activities and long lunches. But once you are out on the floor and the novelty has worn off, you see the job is more about statistics than anything else. Customer service is heavily emphasized in conversation, yet all that really counts is call lengths, schedule adherence, how much your manager likes you, being fanatically pro-Fidelity, and being subjected to constant and excessive micro-managing and taking it all with a smile and nod. 

It's hard not to even have the support of your co-workers. The gossiping is incredible. For some, this place is really their life's career and they will never leave, so you must be careful about what you say about the company and you have to navigate the strange drama of people who have worked there for years. There are also so many people in the call center that you will regularly have other people's mistakes dumped on to you via a livid customer and/or will find that co-workers don't care to take a transfer or help you during a difficult call. Burnout here tends to make people curt and apathetic toward each other, which is no fun when you have a customer on the line and a manager who's constantly looking to find fault in your actions. I constantly felt stranded. 

I should mention that the job itself of answering calls is not easy. In short, there is an entire book behind every retirement plan. You have customers throwing all sorts of crazy and complex questions at you while you have to stall for time while browsing an extensive encyclopedia of information. You will find that your resources are incomplete, confusing, way too elaborate, and/or misleading on a regular basis, which renders a lot of stressful and difficult calls. Have I mentioned all the abuse you have to swallow from customers? They are way worse than customers face-to-face. Some days you feel like you are being attacked on all sides. 

Although everyone has to act like Fidelity is utterly amazing, give it enough time and you'll see what's really going on - the nonsensical promotions, people becoming trapped in the call center - denied every opportunity to take a new position, and unable to leave the company because they have no transferable skills - people's relief to get off the phones whenever allowed, the apathy, etc. it's depressing. It's the unhappiest work environment for a customer service job because you have to act completely fake all the time with everyone you work with and every single thing you say and do is watched and usually ripped apart by co-workers and managers. I had a lot of awful days on this job and was so happy to get ou. 

I guess this place is okay if you have no other options and/or you like being micro-managed in a corporate cult. Otherwise steer clear."

I've never worked less anywhere else. When I've had visitors in on a Friday in the summer, and only 6 of 30 team members are in, they ask ""where is everyone"" and I have to explain that this is normal. Largely ""Working From Home"" is used more than it should.

As far as ambitions go, Abby and Ned own the company. What they want goes. As such, you can expect fiats from on high and many people and divisions shuffling along, getting by. This is not a terrible thing, but you'll not find floors of teams rushing to ""get it done"" and invent the ""next great thing"" despite the corporate newsletters the champion such internal trends. Rather you'll find bureaucracy, process, and more process taking weeks to do something as simple as write a single line query. One fiat was all applications moving to Linux servers from Window servers. Why? Ned had met Bill Gates at a conference and decided he didn't like him, so we needed to get rid of Windows.

Pay is slightly below market, but health benefits are good ($140 for top health plan), bonuses not bad, and the hours are great. Good training budget. OK vacation policy (15 days). Nice facilities.","Big Warning: Fidelity is divesting in Boston and New England. They are moving all the jobs they can to Raleigh (NC), Westlake (TX), Ireland, China and India. Every year more Boston teams get sacked and given the ""chance"" to move 2000mi or more, though usually only 10% take the offer. Be careful if you're not deeply entrenched in the front office, your days are likely numbered.

Everyone keeps to themselves. Passing people in the hall, they stare at the floor. In the elevators you could hear a pin drop. Folks are not outgoing and I've seen many teams that sit 10 yards apart and don't know each other at all. This helps breed the internal silos and technical fiefdoms. If you behave gregariously, people will be surprised.

Fidelity IT loves to talk about Agile, but we actually use FAM, the Fidelity Agile Methodology. During your interview, ask deep questions about how so called ""Agile"" teams work and you'll be in for a laugh. FAM is a broken application of Agile and little better than classic waterfall. If you've really learned Agile elsewhere, people are going to laugh at you your first few weeks here.

If you're looking to grow rapidly in tech, look beyond Fidelity. Our systems are laughably behind the times, though our ""architectural conferences"" will swear they're cutting edge (i.e. IE8 anyone, Java 6, Tomcat 5?)."

The people are great and, even at the phone sites, you do get the general feeling there is a consistent strive for a happy, healthy workplace from the CEO & other corporate executives. You're always aware of the direction of the company.","I loved working for this company, just not the management in charge of the phone sites. 

Overall, poor support of all the main themes they advocate: work life balance, integrity, culture.   The process that managers are required to maintain a working relationship with their employees doesn't apply with upper management.  They put out fires and congregate only when corp executives are paying attention.  Huge inconsistencies in OT needs vs. life balance, actual job role vs. what you're responsible for, company processes vs. actual process.  

* A lot of managers confused, uncomfortable, and/or constantly feel their job is at risk.   

* The allowed leniency within each business unit makes for huge discrepancies. 

* A lot of complaints from employees and management that there's a clear disregard to promote people who are actually qualified.

* Compensation was below average locally and nationally across multiple roles.  Team that up with OT + added responsibilities + inconsistent processes + mixed communications and you get high stress for less than average.

** It has a lot of the typical political messes a job like this brings.  Advancement is possible, but, similar to most companies, you must be liked by the right people.  Compensation is comparable if you're one of the top 15% who are selected for one of their prestigious sales roles.

8528,Fidelity Investments,"Great pay/benefits and work/life balance, poor everything else",2014-08-24,3.0,Customer Service Specialist,"Pays well, and benefits are best I have ever seen or heard of since.  10+ hours of overtime were offered almost every week, optional if you wanted to make more money.  Flexible schedule ranging from 7a-midnight, also 4x10's available where you work 4 days a week for 10 hours each day.  2 weeks vacation, might have had 3-6 months waiting period for it, I don't recall. 

You are taking phone calls and there is a call model to follow but it merely guides the flow of the conversation, it does not generally have things you must say word for word, therefore you don't sound and feel like a robot despite the extreme repetitiveness of taking phone calls.  

Looks great on a resume, and is a foot in the door for the finance industry.","Disorganized between departments, as well as possible and probable deliberate deception of employees, dangling the carrot so to speak.  And as most places have, occasional incompetent managers.

This specific role was all inbound phone calls which were randomly graded by customers and managers.  Managers who graded your calls were inconsistent with each other, one would give you high marks for a chosen course of action while another would mark low and suggest an alternate route.  Or there was the occasional manager who would mark lower than average scores across the board compared to other managers.

Myself and a few others were selected to get our series 6 & 7's and moved to a different division of WPI (workplace investing, you deal with 401k's and similar accounts) where we made a new team with a new manager.  One week later we are all told there was an error in planning, and nobody in our newly found division would be getting licensed.  However, the division we left would all be getting licensed.  When I asked, I was told I could not be moved back to my old team, or join the training and stay in my new role.  A few months later our new division was told we would all be getting licensed as well, only to be told a week later, again, that we would not be getting licensed.  

You are always expected to probe for outside assets that could be brought to Fidelity.  If there are assets which can be brought it, after finding them you must transfer the call to a specialist who makes money based on how much he brings in.  The numbers you bring in to this department, as well as what actually comes into the company from these leads are tracked by Fidelity, and unable to be viewed by yourself.  Management says it doesn't matter what you bring in because it's not your job, but again, these numbers are tracked and managers have access to them, keeping them high will most likely open new doors despite what is said.

Corporate culture seems that Fidelity wants cheerleaders more than employees.  Make the customers believe we're great and you will be too if you give us your money.  I came here to help people, and I was naive.  It is all about getting more money in the door.  But if you can make a lot of money working for Fidelity, and have relatively good job security."

They are hired for driving to metrics and not the ability to manage, lead or inspire. Just do your homework to determine if the leadership of the function will align to what is important to you.

Also understand the bonus opportunity and how it is structured.  Your bonus percent is always immediately reduced by the funding level (fund at 85% for example)  and then you get  a percentage of your bonus eligible amount depending on performance. .85 (funded level)  X .85 (decent bonus based on performance) X.40 (eligible amount) = 28.9% is really what your 40% ""bonus opportunity"" turns out to be. And that is for a solid performer. Just be fully informed as  you negotiate your salary.  80/20 rule applies here -Only 20% get the top bonus which means you actually get the ""opportunity"" tied to your grade level. Don't get me wrong here - is 28% a nice bonus? Yes. Is it far away from 40%? Yes.  What is supposed to be motivating you to perform well just becomes exhausting."

All phone calls and all computer use is recorded, timed, measured -  Anything you say or do can and will be used against you.  Metrics for everything and anything - Did you leave for break on time? (doesn't matter if you're on a call with a client);  How many and how long were your bathroom breaks?;  Constant coaching of what you said on calls with clients.  If you're not perfect, you don't get a raise.
They want drones, not humans, you're expected to say the exact same script every single time, no matter what.  They should just have employees monitoring calls from clients and push ""Button #27"" for the script for that question, ""Button #92"" for script for this question...  As soon as you hang up from one call, the next call is coming in, virtually non-stop the whole shift.  I'd be surprised if they don't run out of people in the area soon to fill those jobs - they've burned out so many and/or fired so many for miniscule infractions of their rules.

Lots of positive people and I've definitely gotten my share of great managers that like to promote within. I believe that management culture does trickle down and inspire new and up-and-coming managers. Being positive at this company will certainly get your far. I tend to be a naturally positive person who is extremely driven. That speaks volumes.","It's stressful at times. The pay could be a little better, but it's not horrible by any means. I still feel like upper management is slightly disconnected to what we have to do vs. industry standards vs. their expectations. Lastly, we have an internal feedback board we can utilize to provide customer as well as coworker feedback, however the time frames from when the research of a project starts to when it completes can be well over 1 year.

I really like the people I work with. They are intelligent and genuinely friendly, except for a few people, who happen to be in decision making roles. A college education is encouraged and most people have that or have had years experience in customer service, business or finance. This makes for a great group of coworkers, but makes it more tragic given the cons.","I have been at the company for 7 months as a 401K associate.

I feel like the culture and environment turns my good co-workers into fearful drones looking out for only themselves. 

And now from here down are just facts:

You have to have your computer system up and running with 4-5 applications by the start of your shift. if the computer locks up, which happens at least once a day, more for others, you cannot let the customer know, keep talking, reboot, refresh etc. they are now transitioning us into a different computer system but coming up this month. I'm not optimistic. 

My Veritude hired co-workers were on the job for 6 months until transitioning into non-Veritude, or I guess ""regular Fidelity employees"" were not eligible for the mid year review raise. Also, the day they transition, their computer systems were locked up and it took all day for IT to fix. The company was not prepared. This is how I found out how many there were at my site it was about a quarter of the DC associates. Many of these people were some of the best members of my team. I didn't know what Veritude was until I read Glassdoor this evening. it is actually a Fidelity hiring department. It is a temp to hire. So Fidelity hires some employees and gives them the same job as other regular employees but they do not get the mid year review raise or quarterly bonus.

My manager purposefully plays politics and does not hide it.

The salary is very low. 

You get sick leave throughout the year but each time you call in sick it counts against you as an ""incident"". Each manager has discretion on what will be used against you. This is unfair period.

The company match is 7% on the retirement savings acct. but only after you have worked there 1 year, and you are not 100% vested until five years. 

Each site in the nation has only specific job roles available. 

Our job is to go above and beyond for the customer and work for the customer, which, if done right, means printing out statements and literature by hand and sending them in envelopes or calling out to our solutions desk to do research on complicated issues or submitting research requests which are complicated forms where we have the least bit of training on. Any work done that is not on the phone is going to be counted against your hold time, your idle time or if you are unlucky and do not take your lunch on time, your adherence time.

We get two 15 min breaks and 30 min lunch. It takes 15 min to walk down to the cafeteria to acquire food after standing in line with the slowest people in the world (management knows this) You eat in 10 min, go to the restroom and rush back to get system ready to start again. that is assuming there are no tasks to wrap up after getting off the phone and starting your lunch clock, and there always is, along with some trying to talk to you."

- Minimal work pressure (If you want to chill out for the rest of your life with zero learning its the best place)","- Incompetent & old peer group who are out of touch from new technologies
- Hardly any technical or innovation related discussion on the floor, all discussions are about ""what time are you leaving home today""
- Focus on show-off & oiling your manager instead of quality and excellence 
- Use of obsolete technologies whose experience doesn't count in the market anymore
- Too much red tape in the organization. In the name of risk and compliance the management has created a maze instead of simplifying things. If you ever had an yearning for working in a government job, you can get the first hand experience in Fidelity
- Too much restrictions on trading activities. Cannot participate in IPOs
- Pathetic salary structure. For majority of the employees the salary structure is {Basic + HRA(60% of Basic) + Other Allowance (30% of Basic) + Bonus (15%+ depending on designation) ... guess what the only non-taxable component of the whole salary is HRA, that too you can max claim upto 40% of Basic as Bangalore is a non-metro.
- The average bonus payout is 75-80% for the company and again 75-80% based on your performance. So, if your bonus is Rs. 100, you are paid Rs. 100 *.80 (company payout) * .80(your performance) = Rs. 64 you could see for yourself how the company fools you with its bonus calculation
- Zero flow of information and knowledge - The work culture has been designed in such a way that you hardly talk to your team mates as you are mostly an ""individual contributor"". Majority of the time your manager doesn't have a clue on what you are working on and hence don't expect your colleagues to know much of it. 
- In my line of work ""Business Analytics"" they take in good talent pool and make them work on pathetic projects on obsolete tools and technology. Hence, majority of the newbees leave early
- the company is overstaffed with employees, as more FTEs ensures fat bonus of the VP or Sr. Director. Hence, majority of the times employees are sitting idle doing nothing
- Zero growth opportunities
- There are 'Silence Please' boards at multiple places on the floor --- U think I am kidding r8?? Go and check for  yourself
- No more frequent US trips after Infosys case

In the call center, you are considered close to a trained parrot, and the only value the company recognizes is your ability to regurgitate the same lines over and over.  Even after considering very carefully how to word certain items with customers, a management intern with weeks of relevant experience who has very little understanding of your job will listen to your calls and tell you exactly how they want you to speak to customers, down to exact lines of text that won't work very well and will cause you more problems with customers.  Thinking people will hate this.  Work is very boring and rote.  The tools provided to get the job done are poorly designed, and can hurt your call statistics.

There is also the opportunity to move around to a wide variety of different jobs within the company if you want to change the focus of what you're currently doing.,"On the technical side of things, the company's top leadership ends up being mostly reactive rather than proactive, so much of the tech work revolves around putting out fires, instead of building toward the future. Top leadership does not have a clear vision on how to build, organize, or manage the tech divisions to leverage their power & look toward the future, instead choosing to focus on old school approaches that historically have not been effective. Unfortunately, the very excellent & innovative ideas that abound at the employee, & lower & middle management level at the company are lost due to a lack of vision or understanding within top leadership of the tech division."

Bonus will be good but there will be minimum change in your CTC. You'll find good friends in your Cab but not in team.

Team leaders have to improve on their process knowledge. Leadership skills are important but it does not mean it is unnecessary to learn the process.

Previous experience is not respected once hired on; only benefits prior to being hired when qualifying for roles.  Micromanaged down to the smallest detail.  As the title of the review says, gamification of the workplace is in full swing (look it up if unfamiliar; may not be suitable for all individuals).  VERY negative attitude towards competitors.  Upon resignation of the firm all previous connections will instantly dissolve.  Senior management uses smiles and positive speeches to squash any and all critiques/feedback of existing processes.  ""On-loan"" roles are overused in order to keep from permanently funding very enjoyable roles.  Lower management uses toys (slinkees, pom-poms, hello kitty candy dispensers) to ""encourage and motivate"" their teams while in the middle of tax seasons.

Wonderful location on beautiful campus with amenities.

Opportunities for advancement.

Workplace Guidance role inspires reps with mission to help customers with onboarding within their employer sponsored 401k plan. 

Top-notch facilitator teaches principles involving the use of consultative selling skills to facilitate deeper, needs-based analysis in order to better serve customers.","Unfortunately, when training ends, the reality is that associates must position Fidelity IRA's, regardless of whether or not enough information has been gathered from the customer to substantiate the pitch. Since there's no time for a consultative approach when managers expect you to take as many calls as possible--- and because there's no need for a consultative approach when an IRA is always the answer--- phone interactions result in the same canned pitch over and over.

Managers and Guidance Support Specialists coach to numbers only. Customer satisfaction surveys somehow no longer matter. Site wide departmental sales performance reports are routinely e-mailed to the group and posted on white boards near team areas. Stats reports (number of calls handled, average handle time, etc.) are e-mailed daily. Associates are even required to keep a running personal daily tally and turn it in each week as a sort of unofficial reporting mechanism which is still e-mailed out to the team.

Within the Workplace Guidance business unit there is also a drive that pits all sites against one another, competitively speaking. Westlake prides itself on being ""relentless"" and even encourages dishonest tactics to provide an unfair advantage such as working unscheduled overtime in order to take more phonecalls than other sites."

Pay quickly stops after several years to a grinding halt, even with stellar reviews. Most of these positive reviews are from newbies who are the only ones fidelity invests in. After a couple years, trust me, you'll be begging to get out of their militant and lack of resource style. Managers know nothing about your role, as Fidelity typically hires managers with no knowledge of the role as they believe managers are their to ""manage"" and not need be experts at the technical aspects of the role. With that said, where do you go for guidance? Glad the police, fire department or pilots aren't hired Fidelity style. Who is the go to contact if your manager doesn't have a clue about the day to day of your job? Being a manager is a great deal at Fido as they have zero accountability and throw you under the bus if need be. I've been there 7 years and have a rockstar performance record, so this review is not in spite, rather it's just reality. Get in, get your license and experience on their dime, get out. Was a great employer years gone by, but as Ned once said ""Our employees are our biggest asset"" has not been heard in years and years.

I felt proud of the products we sold and knew that people really put their energy into doing the best possible thing for the customers.  From the chairman down this was how the company operated.  There was never any question about that.,"There is an unusual culture of politeness, but not in a way that is productive.  People nodding and smiling did not mean your idea had acceptance - outside of the meeting people nodding and smiling could work vigorously to defeat the idea.  The lack of openness and vigorous debate was unusual.  

The compensation at the executive level has a highly variable component based on the company's performance.  People who had been successful getting internal ""shares"" tended to become more and more protective of their position and their turf.  They had to continue to look good to get more and more shares and would actively undermine anyone with ideas different from theirs.  I think this compensation model stifled innovation.  People who rocked the boat didn't last very long; many of the people I admired in the executive ranks were eliminated during ""reductions of force"".  There are antibodies to thought diversity that are really difficult to overcome.

I'd thought I'd be a lifer, but lost my job after 15 years during the 2008 recession.  Since then I've had a lot more personal freedom than I experienced working at Fidelity with a more rapid pace of personal growth both consulting and starting a company.

Interesting and enjoyable co-workers for the most part.,Commuting from Metro West into Boston is like working a 2nd job.  Work-life balance is something they try to say they are all about.  I suppose it depends on your position.  As a cube dweller.... flexibility is not really an option.  Constant change in roles and management hierarchy is difficult for some people but is the culture at Fidelity.  You learn to deal with it or move on....

If you're looking to get into the securities business this is a great place to get your licenses and cut your teeth.","This is a phone center job. Your schedule is 100% set for you, down to the 15 min breaks before and after lunch, which is understandable, your job is to answer the phones. Most of the day you're not placing trades for customers but doing some sort of account maintenance (pw resets, IRA distributions, sending them forms, etc.). Everything is tracked and monitored (again, understandable, just be aware before you take the job).

The information you discuss with clients is more complicated than other phone jobs, so you'll be relying on internal information systems since you can't know every little policy or acronym.

Fidelity now cannot care about their new recruits having bachelor's or master's degrees, because many of the site directors have only high school diplomas to their name.

And great benefits for everyone.","The culture is insidious.    Terribly dysfunctional, paricularly the more senior you become.   Its simply not about how well you do your job - many people have realized that doing well and being rewarded is as much about making the other person look bad to make you look better.    If getting ahead for you means throwing your co-worker under the bus, then this is the place for you.   Its such a shame, because the company could be so great, but the culture of fear is simply gripping the place so that people are terrified, yet in many cases they are paid so well that they are equally afraid to leave.   Someone who left once told me that working there was like being in an abusive relationship - and you don't realize it until after you have left.   So many examples of people who on one day are viewed as superstars, and the next day they are suddenly viewed at the bottom of the heap - in many cases this happens when their manager leaves, and the former manager loved them, but the new manager doesn't value them and wants them gone.  So, you come to realize that the ball can drop on you at any moment.   I remember one executive saying, verbatim, ""we all have a bullet with our name on it, and its only a matter of time until it hits you.""    Senior management used to be very inspiring years ago, but no longer - it really changed for the worse around 2008 and from what I saw and continue to hear, it keeps going in the wrong direction."

When you have down time due to testing environments not working, you have some time to build worthwhile skills for a new job.","Test environments are horrible - It is impossible to actually test. They are always changing code that breaks things with no accountability. Client Configurations are always getting messed up. It's impossible to test a product completely. Random error messages every day. It is extremely frustrating to be in this type of environment and you will be stuck waiting for dev/systems to fix issues on a daily basis.

No advancement opportunities within DB - They will gladly allocate you to 120% because they like to ""run lean"", but they don't like to actually recognize employees monetarily. If you ever do get a promotion within the team, don't expect a good pay raise.

Atrocious raises - With each year the raises are getting worse. After leading major projects and putting in a bunch of overtime, I was presented with a 1.5% raise. Others received worse percentages. Make sure you haggle on your starting salary, because you will be at that same pay until you get out of the department.

No incentives - The only incentive is if you are hourly and can work overtime. Otherwise, you won't get recognized and there will be some time of excuse why raises/bonuses are low despite making record profits. I don't know many coworkers that want to stay in the department.

Cheap - When they do encourage team bonding, they make it known that it is NOT funded and that you have to pay. Example - lunch outings with new teammates will be talked about for a week in advance and is highly encouraged to attend, but you will have to pay for yourself. When they used to acknowledge birthdays within the group, the cakes had to be bought personally by management without being able to expense them. 

Benefits - There are health benefits, but they have increased ~220% within 2 years. So you make less money by staying with the company. If you want any type of health reimbursement, you have to track your daily fitness/diet/etc; which they do reimburse $125/quarter, but it is very time consuming

Menial tasks/job - The job itself is very menial. Other departments test a lot more that seem to overlap. You will not build any skills with this position. The hardest part of the job is understanding the complex systems, and when you have a good idea how they should function, they do not actually work. You spend most of your time writing defects. Each environment has limitations that seem to fluctuate per project. You will not build any skills that will help you develop professionally and could hinder future opportunities.

Access issues - There are so many different systems that you need access to. You will not know that you need access to a specific table/environment/program/system until you lose it and can't access something. Then you have to wait days in order for them to give you access permissions again. 

You will be ""voluntold"" to participate in certain tasks that are not related to your role (or even department), have no prior knowledge of and are projected to ""only take 4 hours"", but they end up taking multiple weeks while you still have project work to maintain. That will be on addition to the 120% allocation that you already have for projects as well. 

The main application used in DB is 20+ years old. The code is basically all patchwork to fix problems on top of problems. There's ""known issues"" within certain functionality that isn't actually known among teams until a high-level dev informs the teams."

I left because I knew that I wouldn't learn anything there, and my skills would inevitably get stale in an environment that lacked innovation. The management was just getting excited about Flash at the time, at the moment when the industry was moving toward abandoning it! Additionally, diversity was a problem.

Over 25% of IT people have titles of Director or above, however this is not because of ability, it is because it is the only way Fidelity can retain staff.  These people would not cut it at technology companies where engineering and merit are central.

In order to accomplish anything at Fidelity, you must have countless meeting with many groups of people, most of whom will not understand any technical aspects of the discussion.  Instead decision makers will rely on people with inflated titles whom they believe to be technical gurus, but who are simply the best at appearances and politics.

Fidelity is extremely title, appearance, and politics conscious.  Your actual ability to innovate, be creative, or lead is secondary to these factors.  If you are a true lover of technology who wants to learn and grow, then you should make every effort to join a proper technology company.  Avoid Fidelity at all costs.

Culture depends on the division you're in -- I used to work in Strategic Advisers, Inc. (later rolled up into Asset Allocation) and the majority of the people that I worked with in that group were incredibly nice and smart. I'd heard not-so-great things about some of the other divisions at Fidelity, though, so I counted myself fortunate. Compared to the other floors in my building (245 Summer St), my floor was relatively casual and the floor plan was more open -- large half-cubes instead of the cube farms at the Smithfield, RI campus. Because I worked on a floor with portfolio managers and other members of investment management, we also got nicer drinks in the fridge.

I also had a very kind and nurturing manager and a good team.","Even within the division that I worked in, there were a few deadweights -- people who had made it to middle management after being at the company for 15+ years and were really just complacent and there for the paycheck. Those people were always a drag to work with; fortunately, I was able to minimize my dealings with them and usually partnered with the research and investment teams, who were filled with smart, driven people.

One other con was that it IS a big corporation, so change does come fairly slowly, and there are constant re-orgs and re-branding initiatives, which can get a bit difficult to keep track of. It can also be hard to get things done in an efficient manner because there are always a million stakeholders on each project."

They do generally take very good care of their people.","If you're not in FIMT or one of the trading companies, you wear the badge, but don't necessarily have the good pay or benefits, and you can expect to pay dearly at the cafeteria. Fidelity's companies are VERY siloed, so if you want to advance from one group to another and don't know someone there, or your manager doesn't have strong connections, you are actually at a disadvantage to outsiders trying for the same position.

They will take you in, get you licensed, teach you all of the fundamentals, instill great work ethic in you, and always encourage career development.  And with how spread out the company is, you can essentially work anywhere and know you'll have a great job with great people.  The pay is ok, but the benefits are amazing which is truly what helps you setup your retirement savings.  They offer 401(k) match and profit sharing, and that all adds up quickly.  Many people spend their entire working careers at Fidelity.","There aren't a lot of cons other than some of the people--a lot of middle management can be extremely obnoxious with inflated heads & egos, and they are also the ones who somewhat control your career, besides yourself, of course.  
Fidelity is way too conservative too, which can also be a 'pro.'  And their compliance policies are some of the strictest you'll see anywhere.  
They need to show their employees how much they value them with better pay--a lot of the positions deserve to be paid a bit more for the hard work that is expected, but again, it's hard to complain about that b/c of everything else that is positive about the company.  
Even with its cons, I would recommend Fidelity to anyone who is a solid, sharp, hard working, & committed worker."

They have a weird dress code where they decide the length of dress for girls, the material to be worn.

Pay was on the higher end of competitive work. We had potlucks and team meetings. I always felt like I could talk to any of the managers. Sometimes we would go to 7 eleven for treats like little kids. I met several life long friends there and that really made it a worthwhile place to work.",The financial industry isn't really my thing.

Quarterly appreciation event with cupcakes and games.","No career. Politics counts for 90%, which hurts the evolution of projects and deliverables. Improvisation, lack of leadership skills, and management that plays favorites, not with those that contribute the most, or who do the best for the company, but those who kiss the boss's behinds more often. People will often take credit for your deliverables, and will also blame you for their mistakes and snafus. Performance reviews are a joke in all areas of the company, and the employee has no chance of refuting the facts. Management is often clueless, and worse, it often lies about status of projects, impacts, deadlines, or deliverables. Everybody is a VP. The less degrees you have, and the more bs you can talk, the better."

This job is mundane at the core.  Every single task is repetitive.  It is a constant stream of taking glorified service calls over and over, with the same requests again and again.  

There is very little outside opportunities, or work responsibilities.  

Managers are nothing but micro-managing and just want to see themselves go up the ladder.

All promotions are just another form of phone job in a service or sales related role.

9072,Fidelity Investments,Awesome company,2013-08-11,5.0,Financial Services Representative,The benefits are great and the corporation really knows how to treat its employees. I have been working at a branch with about 20 other advisors and everyone has been extremely supportive of one another and helpful.,I have only been working for the company for about 9 months and so far I haven't noticed anything I don't like about the company.
9073,Fidelity Investments,Great Company & Benefits!,2013-08-11,5.0,Retirement Investment Specialist,The training program is very effective and the benefits were great!  Lots of opportunities for overtime which was time & a half. Quarterly bonuses were nice!,"Its a call center, you are on the phone 24/7.  Would be nice if there were alternative ways to get off the phone and do work.  Very strict, micro-managed. compensation is lower than expected."
9074,Fidelity Investments,"Micro management, double standards, and politics reign supreme.",2013-08-11,1.0,Account Executive,"~401k and profit sharing are excellent. 
~Education reimbursement. Will pay 90% of CFP certification.
~Health benefits are good, but a bit expensive, and in order to reduce the expense quarterly, you must engage in an online ""wellness"" program.
~High volume business allows for lots of opportunities to hone in your investment and retirement planning skills.","We are hired for our past successes in planning, sales and relationship management, but then mircro managed and questioned for every single action beyond belief. It is hard to work here and maintain a sense of self respect and dignity! 
~Phone calls are listened-in on by management, and then your conversation with an existing elderly client is called in to question, like, why did you waste 5 minutes talking to her, continuing to build that ""relationship"", and looking up the status of the TOA for her, when you simply could have forwarded her to the call center cust service team? Seriously? Every rep in my branch has suffered a similar type of encroachment.
~Management will occasionally either sit in to observe an appointment, or they will have you dial their extension and listen remotely from their office phone. It is an arbitrary and random decision as to which appointments they ""join"", but really, nothing shakes the confidence of a HNW prospect more than thinking the advisor they are here to see is undergoing some sort to management oversight!! It doesn't matter how well the manager justifies it to the prospect, they are thinking, ""run""!! Every rep in my branch has suffered a failed appointment due to this hideous micro-management.
~Fidelity preaches the relationship model, putting the customer needs first, holistic financial planning, blah blah, then really only cares about what products you ""sold"" to each client. Management is very very short-sighted. An appt where you meet with a multi-million $ prospect preparing for retirement in a few months, building the relationship, developing trust, laying ground work for all future wealth planning, is not regarded as a successful appointment or very good use of your time, because it did not result in actual ""business"" today.
~Fidelity is bombarding their clients with a never-ending barrage of email, mail, just non-stop marketing, all on the S/AE behalf, which drives most clients absolutely nuts.
~They only care about whether or not you are completing the menial ""tasks"", like clicking all the appropriate buttons in siebel. You are tracked and watched and measured on every single little thing you can imagine. How many clicks you clicked. How many times you dialed out...And all your numbers that are tracked are not only to ensure you are being a busy little bee, but the manager is rated on how many little clicks and menial tasks his/her advisors are doing. It's really all about how to make the manager look good to his/her manager!
~Management at the branch level is extremely lame. They want to treat you like a child, and keep you fearful, knowing every little move is being tracked and watched. Like I said, it is hard to maintain a sense of dignity and self respect in an environment like this. Those who can brown nose management, and are otherwise spiteful, political and backstabbing (to fellow colleagues) do well here. Success is: just tell management what they want to hear, and slam clients into products to satisfy management... Those with little talent and integrity stay, endure, and ultimately get promoted, perpetuating the bad leadership. They stay, put up with the games, and endure because they realize they could not make it anywhere else (except, perhaps, on a used car lot). Those with talent, integrity and truly good planning skills leave for a saner environment. 
~Clients in the S/AE book are very frustrated by the fact that every time they get assigned a new S/AE, and they happen to like that advisor and feel that they are working with someone with knowledge and integrity, that advisor ends up leaving. They keep getting turned over, until ultimately, they will end of in the book of one of the talentless, low-integrity bozos that never leave, or, they will just TOA out of Fido.
~Management, by their own admission, have never worked in our S/AE role as it is currently designed. The ""relationship"" model is relatively new, and as reps, they only served customers that were fed to them by the ""green machine"" on a transactional, not relationship, model. I think that disconnect helps explain the double standard; why they focus on tracking/forcing transactional business while falsely preaching relationship development. They like to talk about how successful ""they"" were in the role...but yeah, if all I had to do was take inbound calls and leads, roll the assets over and slap the client in PAS, funds, and/or FILI, then just move on to the next one with no follow up or relationship accountability...well, heck, any moron could do that."

The environment can be quite stressful and some department management seems almost proud of the level of stress.

After getting their licenses, the Financial Reps then get to use what they learn and more importantly, what they didn't learn, about the real world thru a series of graduated positions covering more complex environments.:  Mutual Fund trader, Stock trader, then Full Trader (options, IPO's, etc.).

 Also the people at Fidelity (Westlake at least) are great to work with.  They are smart, personable, and care about doing a good job.  The management team is also good and works to accommodate personal needs (e.g., medical conditions, personal conditions).

 The fact that Fidelity is privately owed gives it more flexibility to try new things that will payoff longer term.","1.  You need to be comfortable with having everything that you say and do being monitored.  Al your phone calls, transactions, emails, chats are monitored due to compliance and also for coaching and management evaluation.  You are also supposed to document all your customer interactions in Siebel.
2.  You also need to be cognizant about your time/work schedule.  Your calls will be timed, your breaks/off phone time, etc.  This is a call center; productivity and adequate coverage are important.
3.  Creativity and working/thinking outside of the box is discouraged.  Procedures are defined for everything.  If you get caught not following, you will be coached/reprimanded to do so.  E.g., when a new procedure was introduced on how to verify callers, it was gosh-awful that clients and  us financial reps were complaining.  Despite the feedback, we were told to keep with the new procedures. The President of our division came for a visit a couple of months later and sat in on some customer calls.  She told the management that the verification procedures were awful and to fix it.  It had to wait for the tops down to make a common sense change?

9139,Fidelity Investments,Very Good company to work,2013-06-09,4.0,Senior Analyst,Work Life balance is very good.Work from home helps in case of emergenices.,Growth is stagnant as the company is not hiring
9140,Fidelity Investments,Great place to begin a career in Financial Services,2013-06-07,5.0,Investment Solutions Representative,"Fidelity does a great job at teaching their employees the basics of financial services. Their benefits are some of the absolute best in the industry as well. 401k plan match is 7% dollar-for-dollar with profit sharing of 10%. Health plans are especially good. The pay is also fair for a discount broker. Ultimately, Fidelity is one of the best places to work in Financial Services, because they have a long tradition of placing top priority on the customer experience. The Johnsons are good people who truly value their customers and their employees. When you are coached, it will be to whether or not the customer's needs were met, not whether you were able to sell them on an inappropriate product. Even working in sales, I always made more money off great customer surveys than I ever did due to sales results (although sales results are important as well). Lastly, the company is very conservative on a number of different topics. You are very unlikely to become involved in litigation working for Fidelity, because they stay as far away from ""the line"" as possible. Also, due to their conservative nature, FIdelity tends to be a safe place during times of layoffs unless you work in middle management.","As great as Fidelity is, they are not without fault. Many negative things that I can say about Fidelity, I can also say for other firms as well. The Johnsons are good people. They do a great job at spreading their gospel of customer service, but sometimes the message is lost on middle-management. Middle-management tends to stress too much on day-to-day figures such as Sales, number of calls taken, and the ""customer experience indicator"" (surveys) rather than focusing on the actual interactions that reps are having with customers. 
Managers (especially in sales) also tend to not be entirely clear on what they expect from their employees. My opinion is that this is done intentionally, because they know that they can't coach you to sell something inappropriate that makes them look better on a piece of paper, but oftentimes, they won't call you out on it either if you do in fact do just that. 
Like most big firms, Fidelity can be bureaucratic in many of their operations. The main problem (which is a good problem to have) is that Fidelity is a leader in Employee retirement plans such as 401(k)'s and 403(b)'s and a leader in personal investments such as IRA's. These are technically two separate companies, but under one roof under one name. I've worked in both sides of the house, and it can be annoying to go back and forth with colleagues on the other side of the fence who have these incorrect preconceived notions about your side of the firm. It's exhausting, but it's part of working for a big company. 
Technology is one of the biggest headaches. I can honestly say that while Fidelity invests billions of dollars into technology, much of this is to improve the website. Don't get me wrong, we have a great website for customers, but they don't spend nearly enough money trying to improve quality of life for the employees. Their systems are so complicated, it was almost always easier to tell the customer how to do transaction online rather than through a rep (which is probably what they're aiming for). Also, in this modern world of e-mail, skype, facebook, etc. Many of our employees are still unable to e-mail customers which would be fine if other firms kept the same policy. Other firms have changed with the times. While, I can say that Fidelity is ""on their way."" They've also been ""on their way"" to implementing e-mail correspondence for years now. I mentioned in the Pro's that they are conservative from a legal perspective. This is where some of the cons of being conservative come into play. 
Lastly, middle management is way too politically correct. It's annoying to many employees of all backgrounds. This especially rears its ugly head in the form of reverse discrimination. Being PC is fine as long as you continue to hire good people. Usually Fidelity does a good job in hiring the right people, but occasionally I've seen them compromise just to check a box that they're a diverse firm of employees. This can especially become annoying if you're looking to get promoted."

Not much of growth."
9151,Fidelity Investments,"Great in some areas, lacking in others",2013-05-30,3.0,529 College Planning Specialist,"Overall good benefits package: medical, dental, retirement. Medical insurance tends to be on expensive side, but coverage was good as well. Retirement benefits are awesome once you actually vest and are eligible for a match.","Work environment was lacking. Vacation days (15/year) were okay, but definitely not enough to reward for the amount of work and stress for employees. Amount of sick days (6/year) was absolutely horrendous. A family of 4, like my own, could eat up that amount of time in a matter of months, and I didn't even try to abuse the system.

The area most lacking was employee appreciation. They attempt to appreciate by focusing on some areas (i.e. generous retirement package, perq points, team competitions), but overall falls very short. 

The perq points are based on performance during quarterly competitions. I exceeded goals every competition, but received no more than equivalent of $60 each time. Those who didn't really try and wouldn't meet performance goals would still get about $40 each time. 

My team won about half of the site competitions among teams. We were a very good team. However, the rewards (usually a increase in budget based on head count) would get paid out months after the fact. When it actually did get paid out, for some reason we never seemed to have enough money to do anything fun anyway. Something was amiss in the entire process. Maybe it falls on our manager, maybe the site management. I don't know.

In my 529 college planning specialty role, recently more and more tasks were being added to our plate. It was as if they were using 529 was ""Fidelity Special Forces."" We took on the Canadian Remediation in the summer of 2012, started backing up PAS with their overflow toward the end of 2012, and gradually took more and more general service overflow. When I arrived, 529 had a seasonal workload where it was very heavy during some times of the year, and a little lighter at other times. When I left, we were constantly ""lit"" (meaning calls waiting to get through to us). Most calls we received were general service or something other than 529 calls. The 529 customers were being neglected because we couldn't provide them service in time.

The increased workload would have been fine by me if they would have done a few things:
1. Inform us in advance of how, why, and when the workload is increasing.
2. Provide an increase in compensation (or bonuses or something) since we were not originally hired to do the increased work.
3. Hire more employees to do the peon work of general service. Since they worked us a lot of overtime, you would think that it wouldn't cost as much to hire another employee with a lower salary than to pay me at time-and-a-half with my higher salary.

My last point of review on what was lacking at Fidelity is the career opportunities. Ultimately, EVERYONE needs to go the sales route to accomplish anything. All career paths on the service side reach dead-ends very quickly so employees are stuck with low salaries. My being a non-sales type of person, I realized very quickly that I needed to jump ship. Thankfully, I had the opportunity to take a job I had been wanting to do for a long time. I didn't even blink before I accepted the offer."

Because their funds tend to have higher turnover ratios that in turn allow their fund managers to perform trades. This equates to significant trading costs that are not disclosable under current law. Investors only see the fund expenses and forget the hidden fees. Do you really think they are going to give good advixe and not be charging you anything people?  Really?

Good health benefits. Some quality people still work there.","Comparatively low salary, unless you come in at a certain level. I was at Fidelity for several years -- in the beginning I was excited to be there, and I got great reviews and I moved up, and I did meet some really good people, so I thought there was a future there for me. But after seeing behind the curtain and realizing every part of the business was messed up, I jumped ship when the opportunity presented itself.

In every business unit I was in, I saw a shocking lack of leadership. Projects are started and stopped in a haphazard, wasteful way based on whichever direction the political wind is blowing. Projects take years to complete when they shouldn't, and sometimes things launch and then they are immediately discarded. Or subpar work -- the standards, when you are talking about technology or communications or design, are way too low for a company of this size and reputation -- is allowed to launch and is weirdly celebrated. The website is terrible, and the technology at Fidelity is frighteningly behind, yet they spend billions on it every year.

Many VPs (and there are oh-so-many) are afraid to say what they think, so naturally everyone underneath them is. People who move slowly and don't make waves are rewarded. People who suggest new ways to approach things are often viewed as threatening by people who have been sitting comfortably in their roosts for too long. Very little actual work gets done and I think Fidelity customers would be shocked to see how much money is wasted by this company on people who are paid way too much for producing way too little by the end of the year. Typically you'll see a business unit with a couple of overworked worker bees and several VPs who go to a lot of meetings but don't do much except talk at each other in meetings and try to figure out how to work the politics.

HR is obsessed with the upper echelon of management, and could care less about the employees. They'll drive themselves crazy over how some memo looks to Executive A or all the SVPs and meanwhile they put very little forethought into a relocation strategy that affects thousands of employees and will bite them in the long run. For example, how many future genius fixed income portfolio managers will sign up to work in Merrimack, New Hampshire when they can go to the competitors in New York or London? And how many dollars is this firm saving by outsourcing HTML work to India when the work takes three times as long to be completed because every single piece of it must be explained, checked, and then checked and requested three more times until it is correct (and each round takes 2 weeks)?

The word on the street is with the up-and-coming leadership regime, it's all about the yes-men, and there's no heart there. Some of the old benefits have already disappeared, and most of the people in the know expect that when the Chairman retires, his successor wants to get rid of things like the long-loved employee shares. Believe me, this will happen. 

This company loves layers, and insecure management lets incompetence reign in those layers -- especially directors and VPs -- because they can manipulate those employees or because they're too afraid to fire people who are in over their heads. Management and HR love to market to themselves internally.

Yet Fidelity will continue to make money in spite of this because it has reached a certain size in the marketplace. When I left, I took my money with me because after seeing how the sausage is made, this really isn't the best place to put your money. (Unless you are a high net-worth customer, they push you into the Freedom Funds, which are consistent underperformers.)

It's sad, because from what I understand from people who were there for a really long time, it used to be a really great company. This sentiment is heard around the firm, but I know a lot of people are afraid to leave because they're shackled to the benefits.

Life is short -- there are a lot of companies out there. If you're not overly committed to your kids' private schools or college tuitions, get the heck out while you still can. There is a world outside Fidelity."

This is not anything different from any other large company.

In terms of the people in call centers and computer programming roles, well it is probably tough to stick out from the thousands of other people, but it is still a great company and they don't really expect too much of you from a performance standpoint so why complain about it.

Great health benefits. Company 401k match and profit share is good. Products and services offered by firm are great for customers. Offers tuition reimbursement and gym reimbursements. There are several different positions on the same level to move to within phone sites.,"Micromanagement - clock in and out for your scheduled breaks - metrics to make sure you follow this exactly as planed.
Bonuses are based off of customer surveys of your entire team (not individually) you get % based off phone metrics. 
Metrics are not designed for you to keep the customers interest in mind (ex: if you have to call back to a customer - break between calls to finish a project or do some research for a customers issue - your metrics take a hit). 
You get 3 calls/month monitored and graded on if you said what your manager wanted you to say (can be a little childish at times and not a good measurement  3/500 calls graded) 
Days you will take 60-70 phone calls a day for 8-10hrs (cant focus on customers individually - turn and burn).  
Branch employees are viewed as more valuable to the company and are told to ""dump"" issues to phone centers (they do not know how to complete any processes for clients). 
Limited movement: most managers in current roles have been there for 10-20 years with no position to move higher into.

Also","The high pressure environment isn't made for everyone.  The department I was in was also left hanging occasionally by being left out of inter-departmental project meetings and then still left to deal with the decisions and timelines that resulted, leaving us in ""drop-everything-and-work-on-something-different"" situations more than once."
9268,Fidelity Investments,A once great company...,2013-01-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Ten years ago Fidelity was a great company to work for.  Five years ago, before Lawson's reign of error chased out much of the core of long-term senior executives, Fidelity was a good company to work for.

Benefits are still good (though much reduced from earlier days).  Compensation has been been flat for years, while the workload and responsibilities have increased as headcount has dropped.","Today Fidelity is a place you should look to only as a last resort.  You will live in constant fear of having your job off-shored, eliminated, or moved halfway across the country.  Some choice anecdotes from the last few years:
- Sold your house to follow your job to another state two years ago?  Good for you, you can move again this year, right?  
- Involuntary transfer from the East Coast to the Midwest last year?  So sorry, you make too much money, here's a 20% pay cut; you can take the pay cut, or take a severance package at your *new* pay rate.
- Great news!  We eliminated our on-shore development team to save money, so you'll need to work with the new offshore development team to complete your projects.  PS - they're twelve hours ahead, and they aren't allowed to work remotely, so you'll have to work with them during their business hours (9 PM - 5 AM EST).  Make sure you're in the office 8 AM to 6 PM though, wouldn't want to people to think you're slacking.
- Due to the economic climate, there will be no merit or cost-of-living increases this year, and bonuses and incentive programs are being cut for individual contributors.  The good news is, we did manage to scrape up 300 million dollars for off-cycle bonuses for our top 270 executives.
- It's the first Tuesday of the month.  The good new is, it will be way easier to find a parking spot tomorrow.  The bad news is, you'll have no idea whether that key contributor on your project has been laid-off, or if they're on vacation for a week (unless you're the key contributor, of course)."
9269,Fidelity Investments,Excellent company with good benefits and decent pay,2013-01-06,4.0,Lead Analyst,Open ideas are encouraged and a strong work/life balance is encouraged.  It is easy to move around within the company and find your niche.,Overall the people are easy to work with and the atmosphere is positive.  I really don't have many negative things to say.

Modern and updated facilities with decent amenities. Tight security both physically and on the customer data side.,"Does not pay for performance or set performance expectations well. There are unwritten or absent expectations regarding ""success"" in job roles; performance is not necessarily judged against what your assignments are and how you execute them. 

For example, recently I had achieved all of my performance goals for the review period, such as being ahead of project completion schedules, under budget and delivered targeted business scope. Two weeks prior to the performance review the performance assessment criteria was changed to ""measure"" me against targets that I had no chance to meet since they were completely different than the job assignments.  The manager conducting the review admitted that the assessment criteria was ""new"" and ""unfair"" and the lack of communication was deliberate in order to send a ""message"" to the organization.

After over a decade of service with eighty percent of my performance reviews being ""above average"" under the various grading scales (and never having had a poor review before), it was a very strange turn of events.

It appears as though it may be a targeted ""reduction in force"" or ""desired attrition"" by targeting people at certain pay and/or years of service, since I was only one of several colleagues who held similar positions that expressed a very similar situation. 

Rewards are more and more concentrated at the very top level, with the middle layer becoming hollow and the entry level positions are subject to RIF's regularly.

Exceptionally poor planning in just about every business unit, and the company as a whole. A general  inability to keep focus."

The firm matches 7% of your 401(k) contributions and adds annual profit sharing money which is a percentage of your salary. The quarterly bonuses are quite nice too! There are many other corporate perks/discounts as well. I like the fact that I work with young professionals that range in age, sex, and race. Everyone at the firm is very charismatic. I've been there for 6 months now and I can easily see myself retiring with Fidelity. I honestly can't think of anything bad, especially since there is PLENTY of room for advancement/growth.","It can be tough to advance (change roles) if you are an introvert. Moving around in the company happens by shadowing others, so you better show charisma and the drive to take control of your own development.

Kentucky area as a whole. Benefits were good as well.,"As has been stated in various reviews on this site, if you are too intelligent, attractive, or bring sound business experience with you to the role, expect to be shunned eventually if not immediately. In the S. Ohio/N. Kentucky region there are not many opportunities, even for college graduates so its easy to scare the majority into conforming into whatever management requires at the time. Where else can they go? This was true even before the world blew up.

They will hire minorities but they expect them to be docile, weak and just smart enough to do what is asked of them. No matter how smart you are, if you are a black male you have little chance of making any real progress. Of course there are the ""tokens"" to make things look good on the surface. Once a manager even sent out an email to his team that had a Martin Luther King speech in it that said the Negro was still not free. Imagine that in this day and age. This kind of behavior is condoned in Covington Kentucky."

Good name within the industry and loyal client base. Great inexpensive investment lineup.,"Corporate politics abound here. To move up carry toilet paper around often to wipe your nose. They only want to hear the truth if its what they want to hear. You can be #1 in sales but if you dont further their agenda you will stall your career. Micro management is well over the top. Worst I have ever encountered. The compensation is extremely weak (My gross income here is what I used to pay in taxes at my other jobs and I am in the top 20 people out of 300  in the nation for 2 years running) Great place to get hired if you are desperate or looking for a stepping stone but will never be long term. They are short term focused but always talk about the long term. Do not let this fool you!  Middle management and some mkt mgrs truly have no clue how to manage. They are failed sales people with brown crust on their noses that micro manage and have little to zero outside experience ( this is their only real job since college).  The work and dealing with clients is ok as the Fido client is a cheapskate and know-it-all. It takes time to build trust, realtionships and for the client to self discover they need your/Fido help. Management wants you to slam them into products today. A ""what have you done for me today"" mentality. If your response is ""built a deeper relationship 
based on trust and confidence"" the branch mgr will look at you like a cyborg and keep repeating  ""that does not calculate"" until his brain starts to smoke. Corp vision is a lie. They say they want to retain top talent and build long term relationships. Look at their actions. It is a lie. 5 top Senior Accountt execs left in the last 12 months. Everyone of them were threatened on the way out by their mgr rather than spoken to for retention measures. If this were a public company I would buy a put 3 years in the future so i could put it to someone I hated and make a killing from their lose. It is a truly broken system and the mend is at minmum 5 years away. Possibly a decade. Lastly, once you do sell something you have to track it and a third of the time sent up exception as they are not crediting it to you but atbthe same time will be delivering you an oral warning of termination for low production which they will not rescind once its credited and also become part of your HR file. It is purely about power, fear and control at this place. It is only for the weak and timid not top talent."

Fidelity is a good name for the company. For the most part I feel like I am an advocate for my clients.","Fidelity seems to apply more to the clients than to the employees. WAY too many metrics. Way to many excuses for not getting a full bonus, even for the high performers. End up top ten in the nation and be told all the things that you are doing wrong and that you could do better. Usually by a manager that has not been on the front lines under the same metrics for years, and never produced at a comparable level. Too many levels from the front lines to the actual end rep who will handle the client. Finally at least some movement as the company seems to have just realized that it needs to ramp up hiring or it will not be able to compete for a relevant position in the coming tsunami of retiring baby boomers. Mediocre compensation for even the best performers."

9336,Fidelity Investments,Fidelity no longer the company it used to be...,2012-09-20,1.0,Client Services,Flexibility to work from home.  Salary and benefits better than average but Fidelity has made many changes to reduce these in recent years (i.e. elimination of pension plan; change in merit and bonus review program; move to high deductible medical plan).,"Fidelity is a sweatshop.  If you job involves client services, you find yourself working on vacation and holidays with no appreciation or reward.  Fidelity has been doing consistent reductions in force over the last several years so less employees do more work.  The company also recycles the same managers year after year which do nothing but provide lip service to upper management.  The old boys club rules at Fidelity.  If you are part of the club you are in.  However, if you are honest and speak the truth, you are out.  Senior management does not want to hear the truth and doesn't care about what the rank and file employees want or need or for that matter what the clients need.  On the institutional side of the business, what is best for the client is what is in the best interest of Fidelity.  
Client Boards are just ways for senior management to goes to posh hotels/locations to schmooze with clients and give them lip service.  Recent changes in the merit review process results in most employees being rated as average.  This review process is a bell curve so only a handful are rated as excellent and requires that some employees fall into the need to improve category.  This certainly makes it easy to determine who is out for the continual reductions in force.  Finally, if you manage clients beware that if that client leaves, the buck stops with you.  Even if the decision is out of your control (i.e. senior management won't budge on pricing or the client is bought by another company that is not with Fidelity) your manager will hold you accountable and your job will be on the line."

- Good company culture with mid-level management that cares about your work/life balance
- Industry leading benefits package (health, dental, 401k with 7% match and 10% profit sharing bonus - essentially a 17% match if you contribute 7% to your 401k, tuition reimbursement is $10,000, Company covers most or all of the cost of mass transit passes, etc.)","- Benefit package is great at the cost of low base pay compared to industry competitors.
- If you get an MBA or advanced degree, there are virtually no opportunities in SLC to take advantage of that. The only high paying career opportunities are in phone sales and management.  However management has virtually no turnover which is because of the great situation they have (Many have +10 year tenure), but this is bad if you want to try to get into management - be prepared to wait years for that opportunity or be forced to find an opportunity somewhere else.
- For those in SLC who want to move elsewhere in the country most of the opportunities are only for representatives who want to go to branches, if you want to go to a higher value added position in Boston or any other location good luck if you don't have connections or years of experience. Getting an advanced degree while working means nothing if you are trying to get in the door outside of their conventional channel of campus recruiting at mostly Ivy league or east coast universities."

- The company is big on following the kaizen philosophy

The agreed hiring quota far exceeds business needs. Fidelity manages to meet the quota, yet at the same time, save their budget by making sure that employee turnover is pretty high in this office. Instead of spreading in-coming calls evenly among associates, they create separate work units called MU's. A particular MU receives ALL incoming calls with other MU's receiving only spill over workload. As a result, people quit constantly in the overloaded MU who are then replaced by newly recruited associates.
Other questionable business practices also exist in this office. People are randomly given additional reponsibilities or promotions with the promise that they will receive increased pay commensurate with their added duties. Months later, promoted employees are still waiting for their increased pay. The excuse by management is that they are still waiting to see if you can actually do the job. Instead of a salary increase, they try to placate these employees by decreasing their workload by dumping their duties on the overloaded MU. This is a widespread practice throughout this office. They also hire people at level I and give them Level III duties once you are in the job with Level I pay.
Because of the widespread unemployment situation employees grit their teeth and put up with the situation until they can find another job. In my experience with local and international organizations, I have never seen such dishonest business practices as witnessed in this office. It is truly regrettable that organizations can actually get away with such behavior right here in the United States.

If you can somehow manage to either get your series 6&7 licenses (which they'll pa for... but only very rarely, to reign in costs), or transfer to HR or IT... the company could be a good place to be in the long run. Whatever you do. Do not stay on the phones. It is seriously a slow, mind-numbing and monumentally uneventful death.","Working in a call center is so, so, sooo very monotonous. The job very quickly becomes, not only uninteresting, but also completely unchallenging. The immediate supervisors (excellent performers and leaders) were laid off a couple of times, and then replaced by lower paid, inexperienced, entry level supervisors. Also, reassignment and relocation is common. I had 4 different managers and constantly rearranged teams over the course of 2 & 1/2 years. Entire departments were suddenly and unceremoniously laid off, as well. Working on the phones gives you a certain amount of security, because they need people to answer the calls... but, there's not very much opportunity for advancement. When you are on the phones you are pretty much tethered to your phone and your desk until your designated breaks, so you need to have a strong bladder or lay off of the fluids for hours at a time. You don't really get a chance to interact or get to know your co-workers. Meetings were cut down, which cut down on goal monitoring, teambuilding and learning opportunities. The part-timers had very little opportunity to become full-time workers. If you are on an evening shift it is practically a Herculean feat to get moved to the day shift, even if you've worked there for years. However, despite this fact, the company will consistently bring on completely new hires and place THEM on the day shift... meanwhile, they'll tell the tenured evening shift-ers that there are ""no daytime slots"" available at this time, and ask them to please be patient (years into waiting)."

Most employees don't benefit from these programs. Also, compensation figures are arbitrary and there is a lack of transparency into compensation. Bonuses are literally figures on the back of a napkin
Management is generally clueless about the day-to-day and treats employees like indentured servants. Brown-nosing is the only way to get ahead in this company. Management only values the opinions of the sycophants within the company, which creates an acrimonious and preferential environment.
