0,Fivestars,Fun Culture,2022-02-24,5.0,Product Designer,I had such fun time collaborating and innovating for Fivestars' product teams!,Hard to think of any at the moment.
1,Fivestars,Sales consultant,2022-02-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Great culture Good trainingGood management,No career growth to be shown
2,Fivestars,Poorly managed,2022-02-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Lots of growth opportunity available for young professionals,"Poorly managed. So much focus put on work culture, you need to fit in and want the lifestyle they expect."
3,Fivestars,Door to Door Sales,2022-02-08,2.0,Outside Sales Consultant,"Capitalized on the loyalty marketing trend to small businesses, overall very easy to use, I personally used as a customer before joining the company.","The company had burned bridges with businesses that originally had the product, then dumped it after it quote ""cost too much for what revenue it actually brought in."" While the product has seen updates, not enough to make it enticing for businesses that were ""burned""
The door to door 1 call close - that's the job. This is not a relationship sale by any means (while that may not be a con to some, it came off that way to many small business owners who base purchases off relationship and revenue dollars)
Client onboarding and service team was spread too thin so they couldn't really invest time in providing ample support to each client
Your success as a field sales rep depends on the territory, if the businesses in the area have had an experience with Fivestars there is a VERY high likelihood they will tell you off or roll their eyes. 
Not a con, but FYI your sales metrics are meetings set, meetings held, and deals closed (10 was the goal each month and most didn't hit that)."
4,Fivestars,Good people and good training,2022-01-30,5.0,Outside Sales Representative,Great people and sales training,Not a super huge earning potential

8,Fivestars,"Great place to learn, grow, and find community",2022-01-04,4.0,Marketing,"It is trite to say the best thing about a place is the people but, for Fivestars, in this case it is true. Some of my strongest professional and personal relationships came out of Fivestars.

The team is smart and driven by aggressive goals so it is hard to get bored at any point. It is challenging but in a good way most of the time.

The tech stack is pretty well developed but there is a lot of room for innovation and novel approaches to problems.","Quarterly OKRs don't give ideas enough time to grow. Sometimes it feels like it is just move fast for fast's sake.

There's a tendency to write something down in a deck and assume it is agreed upon without brining in SMEs so someone is often left holding the bag on someone else's idea.

There is a level of nepotism within the leadership ranks (hopefully this is less so these days)."
9,Fivestars,So much potential,2021-11-22,3.0,Senior Account Executive,Fun working environment. Self monitored.,Lack of communication between departments. Slow implementation and sometimes bad customer experience.
10,Fivestars,"Low pay, weird sales incentive, high turnover",2021-09-28,1.0,Sales,Chance to IPO one day,"Everything else, pay, go into 10-15 stores a day for cold sales, lots of rejection"
11,Fivestars,You do not get a work/life balance,2021-09-26,1.0,Sales Representative,A LOT of experience with rejection.,It’s all cold door-to-door sales. Don’t let them confuse you in the interview because it is absolutely not what they describe it as.

You can learn a lot here. Lots of opportunities. The culture is truly great. I've seen many people left to work for bigger companies. If you're early in your career, Fivestars will help you build your foundation. If you perform well, you will get your promotion. Overall, I can't complain","Since COVID, working from home has been more difficult. No more perks."
15,Fivestars,Great Company for the right Sales Person,2021-08-12,5.0,Sales Consultant,"Outside work and Autonomy, ability to meet people and do meaningful work with small businesses.

18,Fivestars,Door To Door b-2-b,2021-08-02,2.0,Account Executive,"No commute, defined territories, simple product to understand, Little micromanagement.","Customers buy and then try to cancel. Customer service lets them (even with a contract that says they are committed to 6-12 months) and then you don't get paid on the sale. They expect 1-call close in most cases. Easy for ""members"" to get the benefits without getting the marketing (Send to app instead of text, then delete the app)"
19,Fivestars,Great Experience,2021-07-15,5.0,Loyalty Consultant,The freedom of an outside sales role.,The company was going through a lot of growing pains at the time.
20,Fivestars,Micromanagement,2021-06-25,2.0,Account Executive,Great tool for business owners to engage customers.,"Management is more concerned about the bottom line before what’s best for the client. 
Micromanaging your employees with threats does not inspire motivation."

28,Fivestars,Great work life balance,2021-02-22,5.0,Account Executive,Work life balance was great and loved working with local biz,There was a lack of support from management
29,Fivestars,Fast paced Fintech start up with major upside potential!,2021-02-10,5.0,Account Executive,"For starters you’re selling a (SAAS) product to  small businesses that they has proven to be vital during Covid. 95% of my day 1 clients are active and have made their ROI within their first year. From top to bottom you’re given an all the support you need to succeed. Everyone from product, sales and marketing is more than willing to go the extra mile for your success. We’re all share holders in the company. Past & present. If you perform and hustle you’re rewarded handsomely with cash bonuses on top of your commission, stock options and paid trips for President Clubs winners.",You need to be willing to adapt to changes in the marketplace
30,Fivestars,Great place to learn and  build relationships!,2021-02-06,5.0,Supply Chain Specialist,"Fivestars truly invested in me and my professional growth from the moment I joined the team. The leadership team has put together a strong foundation and company culture to setup each individual for success. It is extremely rewarding working for a company that engages with you on a personal level and understands the value of each team member. 

In addition, it was inspiring to work alongside smart, talented, personable and motivated individuals working towards the same goal. In many ways the Fivestars team felt like a family in which people will help each other not because they had to, but because they wanted to. At the beginning, I was intimidated to ask for help or even ask questions but when I finally grew the courage to begin asking my biggest regret was not asking sooner. My questions were met with great advice and thoughtful responses that fueled my curiosity and encouraged me to learn and inquire more.

Being surrounded by a supportive community coupled with a growing and agile company opened up many opportunities to take on new and exciting projects. My manager went out of their way to guide my career in the direction I wanted it to go and helped me become involved in projects to build the skills that interested me. While working on these projects my ideas and opinions were always heard and their were opportunities to experiment with my own processes. 

For the projects I was not involved in, the leadership team did an outstanding job keeping everyone up to date on what was going on with all the different moving parts of the company. I admired the transparency of the leadership team and their ability to make quick and thoughtful decisions and to communicate them to entire company and stressing the 'why' behind their decision.","At times Fivestars is stretched thin on Human Resources leading to long hours and stepping outside of the scope of your position. However, this does open the door to opportunities to grow your career in different directions."
31,Fivestars,different experience for different departments,2021-02-05,2.0,Sales,met some great people that I have strong relationships with,"If you read all the reviews you'll notice that most of the people in sales gave negative reviews while people in other departments gave more positive ones. I think that reality is the truth. I did not see the core values being lived out in the sales department and there are definitely toxic aspects to the culture. People were great but it cannot make up the negatives that you experience. Comp plans were always changing and the pressure to sell during the pandemic never ceased. Even if you hit numbers you often feel like it was not appreciated, even in the backdrop of all the craziness in the world."
32,Fivestars,Awesome tech start-up working towards an awesome cause!,2021-02-02,4.0,Customer Success Manager,"Friendly and welcoming work community, very progressive work environment, awesome place to get your foot in the door at a tech start-up, opportunity to learn new skills, great benefits package (this company really takes care of its employees)","Be flexible and prepared for regular changes and restructuring, opportunities and paths to move up in company can be a little murky"

36,Fivestars,Jobs,2021-01-12,5.0,Customer Service Representative,Good work environment good people,None at all that I can think of
37,Fivestars,"Hard problems, great values",2021-01-12,5.0,Product Manager,"- In my career I haven't worked at a company with values like those at Fivestars.
- I especially appreciate the unique confluence of ""humility and authenticity."" At Fivestars you can speak your mind and give candid feedback without fear of consequences (at least in R&D).
- It's not political at all, everyone has a heart for the company.
- Lots of hard problems.
- I'm making friendships here that will last a lifetime.","Wins don't come easy - so if you're looking for a rocket ship resume booster, this isn't it."

You can tell the company cares for its employees and their success",The pay and commission structure is still being worked out for the inside team for account executives. I believe they are underpaid for the work they do.

41,Fivestars,Micromanaged every minute of every day.,2020-12-08,1.0,Sales,PTO and benefits are offered right now.,They lost their core values. Especially in sales. The culture is just awful. Even if you produce they are on you 24/7. Most employees want to leave and churn is very high.

-the 1% of sales people that make it do pretty well",Lack of training and unrealistic sales quotas. My whole hiring class was gone within the year. Managers pressure you into selling to SMB's that are not a good fit.

51,Fivestars,Work,2020-08-12,3.0,Outside Sales Representative,Great work life balance fun place to work,They way they handled their employees during Covid was very unpleasant and unethical.
52,Fivestars,Lots of opportunities to learn and grow. Great culture!,2020-07-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"Healthy culture, bring your authentic self to work.

An amazing opportunity to make money like you never have while simultaneously helping your community. They were able to adjust to the 'COVID' crisis and take care of each and everyone of the employees especially in effected markets. The values of Fivestars that my team and every other team around the country are held true to the core. I was super nervous becoming a 'remote' employee for the 2nd time in my sales career. I was afraid of feeling lost and lonely - and what Fivestars has done is made me feel more connected then ever. I can't think of one single event or action that hasn't been a positive experience throughout every day of employment! The benefits are FANTASTIC and continue to provide stability and security for the future.,With any outside sales job there is a large degree of self responsibility. If you don't commit and learn the product inside and out + spend your time wisely then you will not have a favorable experience.
57,Fivestars,"High energy, startup culture, innovative approaches and fun workplace",2020-06-01,5.0,Account Executive,"Good culture, core values, creative ideas and positive atmosphere.","Training was lacking, the AE's who thrived and were subsequently promoted went off script while the sales force was encouraged to stay on script."

If not, please save yourself.",2020-05-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great espresso machine, cool snacks, high ceiling atmosphere, huge restroom, nifty artwork wall","It was definitely a couple departments that seemed to be very negative. I won't say which one - they ought to know who they are. It was very unprofessional and draining working there everyday. I dreaded going to work when I was there and the last couple weeks was terrible because the ones that knew I was leaving gave me dirty looks. It was like being in high school again with all these gossips thrown around. I felt like walking out a few times, but held my grit til the last hour. Heck, it was so bad that as I was leaving to get outta there, I get the most nastiest comment and a couple fake hugs (even though I was treated like crap during those last weeks). Honestly, there's no need to give them 2 weeks notice. 2 weeks notice basically gives them 2 weeks of torturing you with mean comments and dirty looks. Save yourself from that and take the 2 weeks off to enjoy yourself."
60,Fivestars,Great Company Mission - Debatable Leadership,2020-02-26,3.0,Customer Success,Fivestars hired some great employees.

66,Fivestars,Stressful but high earning potential for top reps,2019-11-26,3.0,Loyalty Consultant,"I worked at FiveStars for two years. The culture is top notch. From the top to the bottom, everyone is extremely welcoming and available for guidance. 

When you hit your numbers, you can earn a lot of $$$","When you don't hit your numbers you feel awful, but that's what sales is. Quota started at 6 deals/month when I first started and increased to 9. The pay structure changed too. If you hit your quota then you can make some money, but if you even fall one deal short it can hurt you dramatically.

FS is also one of the pricier loyalty programs. There are many competitors that do virtually the same thing that can undercut you by about 1/3 of the price."

The product is like communism, good on paper but awful in real life( don't believe me, check their FB page.)...Picture a boiler room but just canvasing on main street USA everyday. After month 2 low pay, unreasonable and unachievable quota.  You will get messaged every single day from the bottom all the way up..

The ability to make six figures here is very doable if you put in the work and trust the sales process developed here. Currently going through another round of fundraising with big things on the horizon!","It is a different sale than most other sales positions. Loves of cold calling, canvassing, and some phone calls. Your pipeline is determined by you, and you need to put in a lot of work early on to ramp properly, but if you do, you can find great success here!

For example, two values- humility and authentic relationships. In a 360 review I had the audacity to share that my boss needed improvement in an area. The feedback had been given to her prior to the review by myself and others, but when I shared it was was reamed for it. I thought I would be fired then and there for giving authentic feedback we'd discussed. Hardly humble.

*If you can ""kill it""(also a commonly used word in this company) out in the field hard enough, the commission will add up. Quotas are getting harder and harder to hit FYI.
*You will learn to grow thick skin fast in a B2B role. But learning this will help you in your career, and life in general.","*Most in management/team leads were promoted due to favoritism, and ""opportunity for growth"" is what will be told to you during the hiring process, but not actually offered to all who aren't favored.
*Training will have you sent to San Francisco for 2 weeks... sounds nice, huh? Come to find out they will ""wine and dine"" you, just long enough for you to learn about, and believe in the product so much that you never are given a real sense of reality to what happens to you once you get out in the field. Drinking their Kool-Aid will only give you blurry vision for so long. 
*Throughout the day you will be communicating with your sales team on an app called Slack. If you do not communicate enough of this app, you will be called out for this....even though your position will be sales and you are supposed to focus on meeting with business owners, they will still expect you entertain one another throughout the day on this app.
*Beware of any confidentiality with you manager, especially if you are needing support during a hard week/month that you are having trouble hitting your numbers. Some will answer your phone call and put you on speaker without warning you, allowing anything you say to be projected, leaving you vulnerable. We all need managers that we can trust, and with this company, there are only a handful of those. 
*Lastly, be prepared to be called out on Slack/sales meetings by your manager, especially if you are having a slow sales month. They will semi praise you for doing well, however the managers have WAY TOO MUCH time on their hands for how often they are commenting on this app."

You'll learn pretty quickly that management sucks, just look at how often VPs and heads of FiveStars has stepped down from those roles. Good luck trying to move on up, especially if you are in Sales/CS/AM. I recommend you STAY AWAY if you're in sales unless you don't mind slaving away grueling work hours for little to no pay. Product model hasn't worked for way too long now and FiveStars still hasn't figured it out, they always say they rolled out new features but every improvement turns out to be a disaster. FiveStars just doesn't care enough about the bottom funnel of their employees, ask them about their employee turnover rate. AEs at other companies are looked up upon and make good money because sales is a hard job and they deserve the uncapped commission! Here at FiveStars, they hire anyone as AEs and they leave the company just as quick as they're hired because they are not equipped to sell a platform like FiveStars. I decided to leave after watching all their best employees leave for better opportunities, told myself I deserved better. Good riddance."

132,Fivestars,Outside sales in the LA area,2017-05-05,5.0,Senior Loyalty Consultant,"There are a lot of pros working in outside sales at Fivestars and everyone gets into sales for different reasons for me it boils down to freedom! Freedom to have a flexible work schedule and freedom to make great money! Upper management takes any suggestions seriously, whether it is a concern about product pricing, rep quotas or even feedback on the products we offer. I have been asked about my personal opinion on future products before they are released. When you're in sales you assume that you're just ""here to sell""-not the case with Fivestars. I have personally seen how other reps, including myself, can shape the way the product works. Working for a start up also comes with great perks. We get a ""passion fund"" every year to spend on an experience that is important to us, anything from a fine dining experience, travel, a class, anything! It's pretty awesome! Everyone on my team is awesome and supportive! The health benefits are great too!","For some the short sales cycle can be a challenge and I have seen some reps that ""have the skills"" get discouraged and throw in the towel before they really got a chance to hit their stride. Small business owners (our core market) are inherently difficult to work with, so if you have difficulty building rapport and trust quickly it can be difficult to sell to them.  While you can really make your own schedule, sometimes late nights or long hours are a part of the job, especially if it is end of month or while trying to hit quota at mid or end of month."
133,Fivestars,It was good while it lasted.,2017-04-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people who you interact with day to day are phenomenal- good hearted, caring, intelligent people who you can become friends for long term.","After the office moved and the start of an aggressive hiring spree began for company growth, everything started to go downhill:
1) Massive layoffs 
2) Unorganized management directions 
3) Unclear structure and paths on where the company was heading towards next 
4) Unanswered town hall questions 
5) Massive firing of outside and inside sales representatives
6) Stressful environment 

For a company that preaches so much about values and being mission driven, it was disappointing, to say the least, to see how little this actually meant to management. It is an excuse for them to teach the certain values and behaviors for the company when they do not care about their employees.

You are as good as the number you are reporting on. Be expected to add a lot of stress to your life if you work here as you are often made to feel undervalued. The false idols of the occasional free beer and convenient location are not enough to keep people happy. They say the good ones always leave, but in the case of the FiveStars, the good ones either leave or they are fired."
134,Fivestars,Loyalty Consultant,2017-04-24,1.0,Loyalty Consultant,"Co-workers are great! Free lunch on Mondays and the health benefits, 401K, profit-sharing, ample time off and pet friendly office were all great!","If you're looking for an outside sales role look somewhere else 

Cool co workers but friendships were made through the same frustrations we had with the company from top down! Even though the benefits and time off was outstanding and definitely a way to reel me in, I am so sorry I moved for this job.

Overmanaged and underled. Metrics based system where metrics took precedence over sales. This is not an exaggeration. Multiple new reps selling 150-200 percent of quota being questioned on why they missed the cold call quota by 5. Really? Let's use some common sense here. Other reps selling literally zero that were hitting metrics were praised for following ""the process"". A mandatory Monday call block where you would make 50 calls to make appts but if your team didn't set enough appts during the block you had to miss the appts you made that afternoon. Really? Let's use some common sense here. 7-10 meetings a week on improving the process. When can we actually focus our energy on selling? I remember one week we had a call block all day on a Monday and nobody had time to go out that day to work and the following  Friday we had 4- 1 hr long meetings. Hmmm isn't that a 3 day sales week? Really? Let's use common sense here. No leadership! Micromanaging would be a compliment to this company. I heard one rep say this was NANO managing. Leads! What leads? They are all cold. All the ""warm"" leads go to the veteran reps which they basically take and close because they want to make sure someone can close them. They believe that once a rep closes 15 deals they are ready to get ""warm"" leads. Really? Let's use some common sense here- sales 101: a veteran rep should have a mix of cold and warm leads. They should have partnerships and referring relationships from the clients they have signed up over the last 2/3 years. Most organizations but no this because this would make sense spread all the ""warm"" leads evenly giving Everyone a chance to make more money and get better. Wouldn't this system make veteran reps lazy and weak and make new reps frustrated and lose confidence? Just a guess. Out of the 4 people I interviewed with 3 are gone! Out of the 7 people I started sales training with 6 are gone. 2 months into my job the sales director quit and 2 people on my team are gone. Is this a retention company? And the worst part about all of this is that everything and anything gets pushed underneath a rug like nothing is broken or wrong when in fact this is broken as a sales organization can be. 

Seriously I can go all day and night with countless examples of why not to work here but just trust me and move to the next job opening. Out of the last 30 reps they have hired which represents 3 months of onboarding over 24 are long gone."
135,Fivestars,Culture shift for outside sales,2017-04-05,2.0,Loyalty Consultant,"Free lunch at corporate a few days a week, free lunch Monday's at the satellite offices. Young fun people everywhere","Big culture shift happening, commission cuts, new quotas, focusing more on the app instead of the controls for the end user (which is the small business owner). Sell you on FiveStars culture, but beware once training is over, very little support for how to create your daily schedule. Also pushing for IPO so there is very little work life balance will expect you to be out 7 days a week and work about 60-70 hours a week. Very low industry pay"
136,Fivestars,Sales,2017-04-04,2.0,Sales,"The culture is great, CEO is humble, catered food/paid lunches some days, and if you are getting your tasks done there is free time.","The company sells you on this Fivestars ""dream"" where everything is great and you can make endless money. The reality is that not many SMBs are receptive (long term) to the software. There's lots of competition charging much less, which the company typically pushes under a rug. You are micromanaged based on metrics (day by day/ month to month). This is a COLD sale, so lots of cold calling and cold product demos bc you're selling something that ppl don't want or think they need. The software doesn't have the best reputation in some cities. This is more of a job for someone fresh out of college who just wants to get their foot in the SAAS world. Not recommended for a career veteran since pay is below industry average."
137,Fivestars,Just Ok,2017-03-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Working for a start up was a lot of fun.,Training was not tailored to each individuals strengths

139,Fivestars,A Fair Warning,2017-03-07,1.0,Account Executive,"I got to work with some of the best people I have met so far in my sales career. People are genuine and you can make some great friendships.
Health/Dental/Vision benefits were nice
PTO was nice
Free food 3X a week was nice","1. Overworked and underpaid
2. 90% management promoted from within leads to a consistently failing cycle. Bring in people from outside of the company to teach the team how to actually sell. When failure across the company is repetitive, maybe the amount of dials daily isn't the only variable to look at.
3. Unrealistic quotas and changing comp plan. Changed twice while I was there and it became impossible for even the top performers to hit their goals and get a decent paycheck.
4. Management lacks ability to provide constructive and prescriptive feedback, if you come with little experience, this is not the place to learn how to be a steller salesperson.
5. Incredibly high turnover. If you're considering this job now. Out of 100 people that were in the Denver office when I started, only 15 remained when I left. Both due to layoffs, people quitting because they were losing money, and people getting nixed left and right for not being one of the upper managements favorites.
6. They lead with fear.
7. This is a nice to have not need to have product. You are selling and audi to someone who only needs and can afford a bicycle. 
8. Bad marketing strategies - after nearly 6 years in business no one knows who FiveStars is. 
9. They advertise rapid growth but this ended up just being a huge step backwards in my career. Managers were cut, team leads were demoted, and there was nothing offered to you outside of inside the AE role. The company is in too much chaos to support growth."

I became genuinely good friends with my co-workers and enjoyed working with them. Monthly team events were great for team building and getting to know each other, which helped with our productivity during the week.","I loved this company and worked very hard and was aligned with their vision. Somewhere along the line, the rejection from small business owners and a sometimes faulty product negatively affected my faith in the product and process. I was very vocal about these concerns because I wanted to stay with the company and wanted help to improve. I asked for extra training and was simply ignored and told that there is nothing else I can learn. What about sharpening my skills with the sales trainers? It didn't seem important to my city manager. I was inevitably fired for underperforming, even though I was vocal about my struggles and asked for help. There also doesn't seem to be much room for growth for individuals."

What ever shortcoming they have, I am willing to bear. Reality is no company is perfect, and if a company is trying with their every might, that is good enough for me."
170,Fivestars,Outside Sales Associate Review,2016-07-18,4.0,Loyalty Consultant,"Fivestars has one of the best company cultures that you can find. The atmosphere is friendly and supportive and the perks are great. They offer 20 days of paid time off, some food and snacks in the offices, monthly team outings, bi-annual paid community service opportunities to give back to the community and a $200 passion fund to go towards any experience you are ""passionate"" about having (ie. ski-diving, a mountain climbing expedition, etc.)","As an outside sales representative you are expected to perform daily activity that is tracked through a set of metrics. Although your monthly sales performance and how that measures to your quota is going to be the most important measuring stick you are graded by, the daily activity metrics seem a bit like micro-management in a job role that you would think would naturally allow you a ton of freedom. 

Additionally, trying to sell a loyalty program and customer engagement automation tool to local business owners is like trying to convince a 2-year old they should use their fork to eat. Small business owners don't think about data driven results; they are typically partially clueless as to the real reason they've been successful thus far. It's a hard sell to convince them of their need for a customer retention marketing program. Additionally, local business owners make business decisions like consumers and also, sometimes try to take things back like they bought it at Wal-mart. This job requires you to be able to close on the spot deals. 90% of business owners that don't buy on the spot won't buy later on... not because it's not the right business decision but simply because they forget how the program works, what it will do for their business and only remember the price tag. The Fivestars program is a great marketing tool for local business owners with not a lot of good competition in it's market space, but it's a hard sell because it's not solving a problem most small business owners are aware they even have.

As the company grows and expands there is plenty of opportunity eternally to advance your sales career and potentially move into different departments. Just keep in mind that as an outside sales rep selling a product to local businesses, your city-market has a saturation point. Reps that have remained in the same city for more than a year or two work almost solely off of referrals, however most deals are closed from sourcing your own leads and closing deals from a cold approach. After some time, if you want to advance in the company, you will likely need to move to another city that Fivestars is expanding to. 

To sum up, working as an outside loyalty consultant is one of the hardest sells you can make because you are selling an advanced business solution to local business owners that buy like consumers and are more passionate about their pizza than successfully growing their company. The product is great and there isn't a lot of strong competition in the market space, but the biggest competition you'll have to overcome as an outside rep is creating enough of a sense of urgency in the mind of the local business owner to get him or her to take the risk and move forward with the program."
171,Fivestars,Very Youthful Company,2016-07-15,3.0,Account Executive,"It is a very casual work environment, as long as you get your work done you can pretty much do whatever you want.  You can dress however you want.  Free food and catered meals, a happy hour at least once a month.  They really do have a family feel and the people do genuinely care about one another.  I really liked working here at first because of the culture and the friends I made.","Very unprofessional in my opinion.  Most of the managers are only in their role because they have bene there the longest.  Most of the employees are under 30 years old and do not know how to conduct themselves at work. The office is so loud, lack of respect for other people trying to make sales on the phone, lack of HR policies.  If you do not hit sales quota you will eventually be let go.  Not a whole lot of career opportunity here unless you are a killer telephone salesmen."

You'll have to think creatively, work closely with everyone on your team on a daily basis, and be ok and honest about making mistakes.

I think the only team whose members weren't totally depressed coming to work was the engineering team,. Other teams like customer support, account managers, and sales have horrible management and high turn over as of late. I was in one of these teams and had good friends with the other teams. Fivestars has a lot of charm at first, but then you wonder why some managers and supervisors were put there in the first place. Once you get past all the charm and talk of great values, you see that no one is really inspired like they preach and in order to get ahead or be given opportunities you have to smooch the higher ups or get out."

It's strenuous, also. 130 phone calls per week. Set/hold 3 meetings per day. Plus canvassing. There is so much rejection and utter disdain for this type of salesperson from business owners that it is hard for someone sensitive, such as myself, to end the day with any sort of self esteem in tact. Then add in that the pay is very low, commissions can be generous but if the business owner doesn't do their part, they are forfeited, the cons sadly outweighed the pros to me. I wanted to love working there - I truly wanted that badly - but every day, I was sad."

Strong culture -- really like their 4 core values of Shared Humility, Authentic Relationships, Warrior Spirit, and Joy Every Day

Lots of learning (and helping) different types of small businesses, from coffee shops to restaurants to gyms, bars, and many different verticals. Great place to learn about a bunch of different industries (if you seek it out)

Unified leadership team that makes time for people and tries to listen","Challenging pace -- SMB is a tough segment to crack, and that's FiveStars' core merchant demographic. It impacts the intensity of work from sales to account management and support to engineering and product

Lots of focus on small business / local business / brick and mortar, so that's a con if that's not interesting to you"
199,Fivestars,"Uniquely values-driven culture, combined with commercial success",2016-01-19,5.0,,"Full of people who are committed to the vision and values - somehow the people who join this company are almost all completely bought into our values.  I think that we've built something that does a great job of getting people aligned on how we want to behave as co-workers in a business, and encourages that culture to grow in a positive direction.

Strong execution ability across the board - the company just executes really well, managing to hit tough targets and execute on organizational change initiatives that have continued to evolve the way we do business as we scale.  It's great to be a part of something that works so well in driving change.

Giant market with tons of expansion potential - we've grown really fast and because we still have only a small slice of a really large market (US small businesses) there is plenty of room left for us to grow.  Not that it's easy, but it's all there for the taking!

Leadership - a very smart, talented, thoughtful group in the leadership team.  They're not perfect, but as a whole team they're the best startup leadership team I've encountered in a company this stage and size.","It's a tough slog selling to mom and pop small businesses and I sometimes feel like we're putting a tremendous amount of effort in to hit our numbers in.

Sometimes an unwillingness to make tough decisions, especially if they make people unhappy - we may need more focus sometimes to grow, and the way to get it is to say ""No"" to more things and ideas, be more disciplined about where we invest resources, time and energy."
200,Fivestars,"Great co-workers, great culture",2016-01-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"FiveStars is my first start-up job, and it's a great environment where everyone moves fast, works hard, and still makes time for fun. Perks like catered lunch 3 times a week, snacks and games are provided in the office. We also have company-wide quarterly volunteer events to support the company's value of community connection and giving back to our communities. Smart and friendly co-workers make each day at the office a pleasure!","Because a lot of middle managers are fresh to management roles (the nature of a fast growing company), there are some communication break downs from time to time between managers and employees. However, there is now manager training and coaching being offered for all supervisors so this will improve in the future."
201,Fivestars,Proud to be a part of this company,2016-01-04,5.0,Loyalty Consultant,"I'll start with saying I'm having a very difficult time refraining from picking apart a lot of the negative reviews...do I probably will a little but lol ;)

1) I've never felt more cared for in a company - the values are what drew me to this company initially and I see them in practice every day. There are more supportive, helpful and uplifting ppl to turn to here than I could have asked for.

2) Benefits are out of this world, in my opinion. I've never had any company pay 100% of my medical/dental/vision plan. 
For those saying ""beware of the change in PTO"" as if that is a negative - it's not. Most every company has a PTO plan and though we don't get unlimited days off - we get way more than any other company I've been with and I'm grateful. 

3) Hard works pays. Yes - it's a challenging job and a lot to learn but if you work hard and keep a student mind set - it is VERY worth it. 
Also - in response to a previous review about the ppl who make a lot of sales do so bc they are handed ""better"" ""hot"" leads...that is False. I feel I have become successful in my sales position and it was NOT bc anything was handed to me. I worked to prove to myself and others that I can be successful - with no ""good leads handed to me"" - just hard work and consistency. In doing so, I now do, from time to time,  get provided a few inbound leads but they aren't any ""easier"" or ""harder"" to close than any I ever pursue on my own. No excuses. 

4) I admire and respect the heck out of our CEOs. To say they are not as involved as they once were is completely understandable given the growth we've had over the last year or so in adding new employees. Most companies would have absolutely zero relationship or access to their CEOS but I guarantee you if you ever wanted to speak to either one of them,  they would be more than happy to make time to listen to anything you have to say. I've experienced it firsthand and personally feel very safe and confident being lead by them and in my continued growth w the company. 

5) The work culture is great. My last few jobs were awful bc of the environment - this was a nice change for me.

Here's the deal - sales can be challenging almost anywhere you go. It's not for everyone and sometimes it takes actually trying it for the first time to decide it's not for you and that's fine. But in my experience here - help, encouragement, and growth is unlimited so if you aren't successful here - it's most likely that you didn't press into your full potential by accessing all the resources - bc you weren't willing to put in the work - or simply bc the job itself wasn't a good fit. You can be as successful as you want to be.

Side note - that review about the Dallas manager is completely wack and fake. I am not the Dallas Sales Manager but I can absolutely tell you - that's ridiculous and it literally made me LOL that someone would actually take the time to write that.",I can't think of much - for the most part - the upper management is really good at listening to issues or suggestions and I feel they do a fair job in making adjustments and trying to make sure we're all happy and taken care of....

203,Fivestars,Great Company,2015-11-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This company is growing so quickly; it progresses to a higher/more structured level every 3-6 months. There's never a boring day. Everyone works hard, and it's definitely an environment that will push you to be a better employee. High level leadership is very strong and a great base for the company. How well a company does is directly related to the people working cohesively in one direction.","Since the company is expanding and growing, at times, our structure/process have to be created on the go. It's so fast paced that we have to keep evolving and improving which can be stressful at times."
204,Fivestars,Do better,2015-10-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some very intelligent individuals in the company, nice that you can have dogs in the office, some of the typical perks of a start up such as some catered lunches, happy hours, etc.","Low Pay, Overworked, company claims the culture is so great but if you are not overworking and kissing up or in the correct friend circle you will not be given the opportunities to advance. Benefits are horrible, they are not honest and transparent with your job responsibilities and expectations, you come to find out that they make up a lot of rules as they go. Not everyone is capable of being a leader/manager but this company is more for quantity than quality. Lack of diversity, the list could go own but overall the company is very much unable to keep up with the explosive growth they claim to be having. Churn is high."
205,Fivestars,Operations,2015-10-14,1.0,,"Free catered lunches Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. 
Fun and Young environment.
Team outings and retreats.","What seemed to be a promising place for an individual to grow their career turned sour quickly.  FiveStars used to be a place where you could express your thoughts openly and not be exiled for it.  Once upon a time FiveStars really did believe in it's core values and practice these values in employees day-to-day.  These values were 1) work hard play hard 2) bring your everyday self to work 3) authentic relationships 4) shared humility.  None of these values exist in FiveStars today within the Operations and Sales organization.  You could simple look at an employee and tell they hated their job.  Management in both the Sales, Account Management, and Customer Support team.  Performance and metrics mean nothing if you're on the bad side of one manager.  Personal issues that FiveStars should protect their employees from are swept under the rug and used against you.  Upper management does not paint a clear path for growth or success.  NPS surveys are not anonymous, therefore employees feel as if we have no voice."

Came in with no sales experience and struggled for the first 2 months, but hit my stride month 3. You aren't going to come into this job and start making sales left and right by working 9 to 5. You have to put in the extra work and reach out to your peers from around the country to learn.  You're constantly learning and bouncing ideas and how to handle objections off of your co-workers and managers. You never stop learning. After you sign up a merchant and you see them grow and doing well, it brings a smile to your face. You have to put in the work and not be afraid to work an extra day or two on the weekend especially when you first start. 

Can't say enough about how great the people in this company are.","One of the major cons for me is that there is no 401k company match. I think they're looking into that in the near future.

Some departments (customer facing) are under-paid, workers have to play politics and suck up to managers for managers to listen to them, and there very little room for growth, recognition, and proper compensation. Other departments are open to change, managers listen to the needs of the team, and work very collaboratively. If you want to work here, I would suggest asking a current employee in the team you're applying for what they think of their team/role in order to get a proper gauge of  how it's going to be like working here."

- You're selling a really good product that truly helps SMB owners and is superior when comparing it to other loyalty SaaS companies. The companies you're competing with (Belly, SpotOn, etc) are easy to steal from unless they've given them a 2 year long free trial which is what they're notorious for

- Their price point is higher (which is a given due to better quality) which means higher commission for sales reps vs competing companies

- Good perks: catered food, happy hours, fully-stocked fridge, tons of snacks, keg full of beer, full bar, and some more happy hours. Plus a nap room, gym, games, etc. 

- Amazing sales team that consists of a rare breed of incredibly fun and awesome people. Sales is a tough and stressful role at any workplace but people there actually look forward to going to work because they have a team that strives to help each other get better. Plus they just brought on an incredible sales trainer that will help you develop your sales skills which will benefit you tremendously in any other roles that you may end up pursing farther down the line in your career
