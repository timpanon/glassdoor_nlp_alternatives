Work Pressure is at peak
Managers does not listen to their team members.
HR hardly respond to any urgent requests or take any action.
Not at all Employee Friendly company
They only want you to work 24X7, just the Big company but it is so frustrating to work at such a place where even at senior position you are not valued, nobody helps you at the end and no-one takes any action so in the end you have to just leave the job.
They don't care about their employee 
Anytime work can come, even at 11pm you can get a call if the sale is going live at 12pm.

2. Job security (mostly)
3. There are good trainings and central learning initiatives taken by org.
4. You have the option to change teams/roles after spending 1 year in the current role/team","1. Your growth will greatly depend on how good you are at managing your perception rather than your true accomplishments at work. 
If you are an introvert, trust me its going to be extra hard for you. You will be required to create and receive way too much stimulus which is not at all required for your job. You spend 3-4 hours doing something .. another 2 hours drafting impressive mails around it.. another 30 minutes ensuring all important stakeholders, seniors are marked in CC... and then another few hours anxiously checking your inbox who appreciated and who didn't.

2. Not much scope for on job learning unless you are a fresher. Root cause are not discussed openly. The idea is to execute and execute at the speed of light but who is thinking?? A lot of new initiative are not well thought and designed. Relevant stakeholders are not involved in the strategy process. Ultimately , after wasting so many manhours a lot of initiatives are dropped.

3. Since the projects / initiatives are not well thought, problems keep arising and you are always fire fighting. Working hours increase along with pressure to deliver. Very good chances that around BBD you will discover how fast you have aged. On a lighter note, you will loose hair at a very rapid pace ."

The manager I was reporting to had an history for being an unfriendly one. In fact, an entire team had quit because he treated them like a floor mop after an year of slogging to build Flipkart's first datacenter. Of course, this person has his good books and all the employees with 7+ years of experience in that team are people in that book. I would avoid Flipkart if I had to work with this detestable person again.

HR works hand in hand with the management. You are just a pawn on the chess board (unless you are in the good book). Don't expect any justice from these folks. Again, I haven't seen an HR that tries to either. I have only heard of them."

Average age of SDEs is in mid 20s

Pretty frequent outings and fun during work is promoted

Pretty ideal for freshers, even more so if you plan for masters/MBA after 2-3 years","Below average opportunities to grow

Apart from basic pay, comp is pretty abysmal

Compared to its competitor Amazon which gives a minimum of around 10-15L in RSUs, Flipkart's ESOPs absolutely, unequivocally PALE in comparison.

Promotions and levelling up criteria are extremely poorly defined, good engineers can be stuck at the same level for 3-4 years easily

Raises are abysmal unless if you started with a below average comp, in which case higher raises are given to normalize pay across team

Codebase, infra, architecture is poor, although efforts to improve that are being made, its simply not on par with other tech companies in the industry

Growth, learning, guidance and even direction is mostly dependent on self, management is there to ensure good mood of SWEs whenever possible and to deliver product teams demands.

Good stock options if you can ast here to avail them
Flexible timing
Easy Going","Highly disorganised
Even the HR don't know the policies here
Executives are never available to set direction or even do 1-1
People who have been here for 5+ years have rotten, have sub standard tech skills and lack leadership at all levels. Interacted with EM, SEM, DOE, VP all lack tech skills and more so have least knowldge of management or leadership.
It didn't help that there was too much confusion due to Walmart merger
All hiring plans are put on hold, however the roadmap still remains the same
Promotion policy is very biased and old boys gang wants to promote only their boot lickers
The VPs are never available, nor can solve any problems be it team dynamics, product prioritzation, conflict resolution etc
Legacy infrastructure, majority of the people have no idea about AWS, Azure or any leading public clouds, they continue to use their own data center which doesn't support IaaS, PaaS and let alone any SaaS.
Extremely inefficient middle and top managemnet from EM through VP.
Multiple teams try to do the same thing for instance Data Science is done by labs in US, the data team in India and then another data science team. All 3 teams are lead by 3 different VPs and there is no concensus between each other. Even with so much investment in data sciences you hardly have any usable services or models for ML deployed in prod. They are nt even close to Azure ML, AWS ML, Tensorflow etc.
Highly political, its probably the only company where you will find zero documentation of any of the systems. Architects here will just talk and not code or even publish system design. HLD, LLD etc. 
Only SDE1/2 or perhaps SDE3/4 are the ones who slog and majority of SDE5, PA just blabber and do not deliver any tech roadmaps or architectures.
This organization is filled with deadwood with iept line mangement, and unproductive middle managemnet and unworthy sr management."

Underwent an exhaustive training with various verticals of SCM, gained hands on experience working with leaders across Business Development - Vendor Management, Retail procurement, Central Payments, Warehousing, Logistics, Order Management, Risk Operations and Customer Support - All just within 3 years. Witnessed streamlining of processes, induction of new visionary leaders, automation of activities and business analytics that led to a greater control and visibility across SCM.

A fully chillax environ, but on some occasions had to extend over night. I derived encouragement watching my senior folks, couple of whom instilled the feeling of ownership and commitment towards work. Culture was great - never hesitated to meet up Business heads. Processes, KPIs, policies were very dynamic and so were the challenges. An experience of this sort has catapulted several employees to higher positions else where and still continues to do so.",Mid management - Their words and actions sometimes would not be in sync at all. Can't blame them - since they feel the heat both from executives and the management.

A bit disorganised work, a bit lack of planning (unplanned working), a bit too many parallel tasks/threads/projects going on. A bit too much competition within the teams and across teams, less coordination and cooperation within and across teams. Lots of youngsters. More focus on coding, less on design and architecture.

2. work - great work, there are many things to work upon hence the day goes just like that. 
3. pressure - lot of work, hence huge pressure. Prioritisation is required a lot of times. 
4. Constantly changing managers - You get to work with new manager almost every six months. High probability that he might be rude, indifferent, uncultured. Most of them are premium B-School pass outs  who hardly care about customers and focus on numbers. 
5. Thought provoking - You are working with a lot of intelligent people around hence you should not accept status quo","1. Non-objective review - The reviews are objective on paper but subjective in reality. There is a cartel formation going on in some teams. I have seen people going places just because they knew the ""right people"" or were from a premium b school. 
2. Referrals - Since employee gets a referral bonus, people are more keen towards getting talent from outside than to nurture talent from inside. The referral bonus is huge when you consider Sr. Manager or Manager level. A relative is also considered a referral :-) 
3. Everything happens from Bangalore - If you are working in Delhi, then it will be difficult to show your work.

2. Code base has zero documentation. Nobody follows the rule of 20-30% comments in code. Not a single line of comment you will find. Either you infer what the code is doing by reading it, or debug it.
3. Lack of coordination across teams. Teams change their API responses without any notification leading to runtime errors somewhere else! People do not respond to emails and you have to walk to their desks and ask questions.
4. Lots of noise at workplace. No desk phones. At any given point of time you will find at least half of employees not at their desks and discussing stuff at someone else's place. (because many people do not respond on mails, and there is ZERO documentation)
5. Mentorship ? Whats that ?

If you are joining the company, 
(1) Find out the names of all the folks that interviewed you and look up their Linkedin profiles - one of them will be your hiring manager. Ask yourself if you really want to report to the guy
(2) Reject the first offer letter saying designation is not correct. They will get back in a couple of weeks with a revised designation. Extremely unprofessional trying to under-level you
(3) Ask for the organizational structure and find out who are your peers (if they are a decade less experienced than you they are probably immature and you will have issues) and also how long they have been in the grade
