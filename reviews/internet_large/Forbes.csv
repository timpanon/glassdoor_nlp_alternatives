Staffers also get the week between Christmas and New Year's off.","The mutual contempt between the chief content officer and his staff is eroding the organization. Reporters, including long-time staffers, are leaving en masse, whether by choice or because the CCO pushed them out the door. Forbes is not producing the level of work it should or could because reporters and editors scramble to appease the CCO, who will shoot off abusive emails at 2am, publicly belittle staffers and change deadlines and editorial priorities on a whim. Forbes is having trouble recruiting talent to replace those who have left because of his reputation. It went downhill during the several years I worked there, a trend that will likely continue."

96,Forbes,Quite possibly the worst and most fraudulently-operating off site operation of any American publishing outlet,2018-05-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"...big office, glass windows, food.","First things first; stop illegally operating in India. Everyone involved with Forbes.com U.S. - India operation is aware that it's, by copyright law, not allowed to operate in India as Eureka Forbes already has it, yet it not only continues to do so, but while also completely disregarding the labour and employment laws.

Now where to start. I was hired in a senior position by a representative from Forbes (who actually lied and was actually related to a Forbes U.S. employee with 0 qualifications or connections to Forbes), to work for the Forbes.com website and eventually obtain a Forbes employment. Still not entirely sure how we had access to literally the whole of the Forbes backend, though we did, which solidified the idea that Forbes may just be operating here legally. 

We were told we'd be given proper paperwork, but I might as well have been working for the mafia as no contracts were ever provided to us. We were actually working, throughout the 8 month tenure, for some unknown payroll operator in Mumbai noone had ever heard of or consented to be working for, though it was insisted on that this was only temporary. Looking back at the nature of this whole setup, you can guess what kind if payroll services they offer. Hopefully the law will catch up, but I still need my outstanding pay.

I am still waiting for my about 2 months salary which has been illegally held from me due to unlawful and untimely termination outside the probation period, though that's hardly the whole problem if newcomers are reading this.

For quick recap, we were made to sign a bond of employment (absolutely illegal in India), given leave policies absolutely in contrast with the labour laws of India, and were unlawfully terminated without the full pay of the tenure released, even though the govt of India makes the severance and leave laws very clear. Can't blame them though, I doubt the ""Forbes representative"" in charge of us was any more educated than high school. Let's not even get into how plagiarism was encouraged; Forbes will be swimming in copyright lawsuits if someone actually gave a damn about what they're writing about. Half their website is copied, the other half written by contributors with powers to directly publish with no editorial oversight. Though being a bad content platform is not a crime.

I'm still awaiting my outstanding payment, though looking at the advertising content standoff and the fact that Forbes US is so desperate to look towards the Indian market and bend legality as its own content market is us absolute shambles, looks like its dying anyway. Not sure if running against the law to exploit gullible employees in other countries is the answer though.

New employees, please, always verify your employers. In my case Forbes was illegally operating through an unauthorized, officially unrelated vendor, even though they can't operate in the Indian copyright arena due to  the Forbes trademark being used by Eureka Forbes. Especially people looking for jobs around where they're operating in Mumbai. I doubt we can do anything to a giant like Forbes, but we can definitely keep ourselves safe."

3. Work-Life Balance","1. The salary is literally half of the average. 
2. The biggest problem in the company is ""the managers"".  Yes, with ""s"". They are not professional enough to handle their jobs. 

Some managers can only be able to mention worthless points in the emails, in order to get attention and try to not be outshined by their subordinates. 

Some managers can't understand the products' logic well enough even they have already been reminded couple times before. 

The lack of the communication between managers causes that some tickets are going to release, and then being pushed back because other groups find the ticket mess up their products. And even a new product is almost done, people finally find that there is no stakeholder for it, because every manager thinks ""there should be someone..."".

We did have a good product plan and we almost made it. We did have some managers who help us to get over the problems and get the work done.

But why do so many talented people left in these six months?"

People with no relevant expertise and experience were brought on-board and that has proved to be a huge failure in how everything functions now.
Intern programs were less efficient ( even when we had a great conversion ratio of interns being on boarded with full time opportunities)

109,Forbes,Disappointing Experience,2017-12-05,1.0,Editor,It's Forbes. It's a nice name brand to have on your resume. The content management system is awesome. It's fun to set your own hours and get paid based on traffic.,"Management is routinely arrogant, curt, mean, cruel, dis-empowering, and cheap.  They tell you to not go for link-bait, then they reward link-bait. Certain editors get a free pass on the rules. Their contributor content model is a sham. It's compromised by advertisers. Church and state are one. Here's my advice to management (which I am also sharing here): Expand your coverage outside of your NYC, Silicon Valley bubble. Focus on good, decent, humble, hard-working entrepreneurs and CEOs in the Heartland. Your bias towards coastal elites makes this an imbalanced read. Hire people who are unlike you, think differently than you, who are kind, considerate, humble, decent, who prize customer service, generosity of spirit and good-natured treatment of others. Ditch the arrogant, tech-obsessed snobs and robots."

That's really all that matter to the Forbes family. So first, I question their methods of ranking the rich. Who is fact-checking them? No one.  I reiterate, what matters to Forbes is the Forbes name, not yours. So why bother, really? There are better companies and better work cultures elsewhere. Also a bit of an old boys network is often at play."
