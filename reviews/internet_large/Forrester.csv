0,Forrester,Once a great company…. Could be great again,2022-04-08,3.0,Vice President & Principal Analyst,"Culture very collaborative 
Everyone willing to help
Excellent benefits 
Excellent pay for senior people
CEO supportive of employee happiness
It’s a great place to work if you can keep your head down and not make waves.
Office culture is great 
Supportive of working remotely
Fantastic clients 
Opportunity to work with great brands worldwide
Lots of travel opportunities","Political: Management supportive if people keep quiet. If people say the wrong thing or criticize management openly in any way, it seems they soon leave for one reason or another. In this respect it’s like any large company - except Forrester isn’t that large. HR used to care more about employees as people: if an employee needed a change they would try to find another role for them; now it seems it’s easier to move them on. 
No sabbaticals.
It’s impossible to do the job well and hit goals in 40 hours a week. 60 is typical and 80 not uncommon.
No opportunities to move on past VP PA.
Burnout is high.
No problems having tobacco companies as clients.
Lots of travel."
1,Forrester,"Modern, progressive culture inhibited by typical, big-company problems",2022-04-06,3.0,Account Manager,"Pros
- Smart, talented people
- Progressive atmosphere","Cons
- cumbersome & unpredictable bureaucracy
- company politics (egos, spin, conflicts between teams)
- slow & inefficient
- low compensation relative to market (common joke is the only way to get a decent raise is to boomerang, leave & return). merit increases this year were paltry compared to inflation
- attrition currently high, so work pushed off to others without additional compensation"
2,Forrester,Excellent Work Culture,2022-04-05,5.0,Senior Analyst,Phenomenal Analysts and creative individuals.,Work-life balance can be tough for top performing analaysts.
3,Forrester,Company culture not enough to make up for everything that is broken,2022-04-05,3.0,Client Executive,"Smart, helpful, nice people, well respected company.",Pay is below market. Always changing GTM strategy and solutions which causes issues for sales and clients. Our CX is not good. Finance run org vs sales run org.
4,Forrester,Research Associate Entry Level Position,2022-04-05,5.0,Research Associate,"Working with many experts in a given field, being involved in the research via interviews, secondary research, and writing, plenty of opportunities to learn about various different areas/technologies.","Monotonous at times, a lot of call scheduling, exposure to the research is heavily dependent on the team/people you work with, difficult to move up within the research organization."
5,Forrester,Great company with lots of opportunity,2022-04-01,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Really smart but also nice and approachable people, interesting work, they respect work-life balance.","Need to upgrade their operations to support a dynamic and matrixed workforce, need more emphasis on project management and enablement."
6,Forrester,Wonderful First Year at Forrester!,2022-03-31,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"The training process is fantastic. Basically an 8 week program with a mix of on-demand training that you do yourself, plus live sessions with fellow CSMs who are the instructors. 

Work life balance is awesome - we were given the opportunity to work remotely as often as we like, and it has been nice to be trusted to get our work done from home every day. 

The perks are great - nice vacation package with personal time, floating holidays, volunteer day, 401k match, employee stock purchase plan, etc. They are generous with bonuses and reward you for achievements accordingly. 

My coworkers are warm and were welcoming when I joined the Customer Success Org. A number of people took the time to have ""virtual coffees"" with me and introduce themselves during my first couple of months. 

The growth structure is well mapped out, so you are not stuck in the same role without being promoted for years on end.

Participating in meetings w/ analysts give you the ability to learn such a wealth of knowledge - the ""Forrester MBA.""","The pay could be better, but is not terrible. Compared to a SAAS CSM Position, it does not pay as well. 

Sometimes there's a disconnect between departments. Example - CSMs are told to give the client certain language, but other teams do not relay that same information so put us in a tough spot. 

Lots of products and information to learn right away - can be overwhelming.

Corporate rules can be annoying when it comes to annual raises and bonuses."
7,Forrester,Great place to learn,2022-03-31,4.0,Account Manager,Great learning and development environment. You have the opportunity to work with some of the best business leaders and learn from them directly. The culture is conducive to learning as well. tons of good resources,Comp. does not seem to be on par with the industry.
8,Forrester,"Well respected brand, but that's the end of the good",2022-03-31,2.0,Account Manager,"- Good brand name, people love to talk to us
- Lots of resources internally to help with selling
- Decent work life balance, not the highest stress or energy sales atmosphere","- Low energy sales atmosphere, little team feel
- Low pay relative to everywhere else
- Company leadership is laser focused on stock price, nothing else
- People are fleeing! Low pay is likely why
- Many people are overworked and way behind on SLAs
- Many inexperienced folks in roles that are critical to day to day functions
- Company is heading in the wrong direction, leaving it's legacy in the dust for that shiny new ""ARR"" (we wish we were a SaaS company, but we're not a tech firm)
- Sales leadership is not great, generally inexperienced
- Analysts (our ""product"") are overworked, unavailable, and fleeing the company at an alarming rate
- We're forced to sell products that our clients truly do not want, cannot use, and cannot afford, just to make quota"
9,Forrester,Going through Transition,2022-03-23,3.0,Account Manager IV,The executive team is very transparent. Good company morale.,"Many key analyst are quitting, they are giving significant increases on quota without being able to fulfill with the proper analyst team to deliver. Most employees are overworked and underpaid compared to market value."

- Egotistical and toxic company culture"
15,Forrester,Forrester Practices What It Preaches,2022-03-01,5.0,Customer Success Manager,Working at Forrester for the last few months has been nothing short of an amazing experience. The people at Forrester are some of the kindest and most hard working people I have ever worked with in my career. Everyone is always willing to help each other out and collaboration is encouraged. Everyone has an impact and feedback is well received and implemented. Forrester analysts are a pleasure to work with and care deeply about Forrester clients. I would highly recommend Forrester as a great place to work.,"Training for my role could have been better structured and overall I felt as though I did not want to do next. However, I never felt that I could not ask for help or guidance when needed."
16,Forrester,Amazing Place to Work.  I may never leave,2022-03-01,5.0,Sponsorship Sales Executive,Forrester has a wonderful ecosystem of employees who value a work/life balance. The leadership team really listens to the opinions and concerns of employees and makes thoughtful decisions to improve on the employee experience. Leadership puts the customer first and uses the same train of thought with employees. This is by far the best company I have ever worked for and I feel very lucky to be here.,"Communication among different departments can be tough. Some information is learned by what is heard ""by the water cooler."" That being said, communication is still better than any other employer I have worked for."
17,Forrester,"Great culture, poor compensation",2022-02-25,4.0,Research Associate,"Wonderful people, ample opportunities for career development and personal/professional growth, CEO is incredible. I've loved every team I've been on, and (for the most part) my managers have taken the time to develop me and push me past what I thought I was capable of. I do believe in our work and our industry leaders. I see how hard people work here, and it is inspiring.","Forrester believes they can compensate employees less for having a great culture and for being a leading research firm. It is true that I haven't left due to the people and environment but Forrester is not competitive enough in today's market. I think Forrester would rather keep salaries low, and lose talent then invest in their employees and compensate them appropriately."
18,Forrester,"Collaborative. Respectful, Welcoming Culture and Flexible Workplace",2022-02-24,5.0,Finance Analyst,"The company was transparent, innovative and inclusive when working through Covid related issues, mask mandates and back to office concerns. We maintain a flexible workplace; workers can continue to work remote or choose how many days they want to be in the office. 
Management regularly takes surveys and polls to include employee feedback in their decisions. 
The culture at the company is welcoming, respectful and progressive. 
The salary and benefits are good and the Cambridge office is convenient to the train station.",There are many career opportunities at the firm but you must be self directed to find them.
19,Forrester,Don’t work for Forrester,2022-02-22,1.0,Customer Success Specialist,Nothing good to say about them. Don’t care about their employees and will do anything to hide their dodgy management,"Everything! The management is appalling, HR are useless and will not help in any situation so beware. Not inclusive whatsoever"

21,Forrester,Good work life balance but little growth opportunity,2022-02-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The work life balance is great and the people are always kind!,There is no defined career path and growth here is slower than at most other firms.

Great work life balance",Need further investigation for time
24,Forrester,A great place to work with a choose your own adventure atmosphere,2022-02-01,4.0,Senior Consultant,"Forrester is a great place to work. I've been at the company for six year and during my tenure I've come across different challenges (in a good way) and opportunities that keep me motivated. I've found that the company does a great job giving you the space and resources to learn and grow. I started in more of a client services role, supporting IT leaders and learned a significant amount about technology. I was promoted in that role and when my family and I wanted to relocate (to be closer to family) they were more than supportive. I was then able to move over to consulting when an opportunity came up, which has allowed me to explore new areas and grow more skills. Of course, my accomplishments at Forrester haven't been given to me, they been earned. And that's what makes it one of the better companies to work for - they empower you to make the most of your career and recognize good work.",Change is a constant at Forrester so come with an adaptive mindset!
25,Forrester,Good Employee Experience and Development Opportunities.,2022-02-01,5.0,Account Executive,"Employees are well respected and career development is a big theme. Plenty of women in leadership roles also, which is great to see. 

Pay is fair and benefits are pretty standard.","Not much in terms of work socials, but this is mostly down to the pandemic."
26,Forrester,Not planning to leave Forrester any time soon,2022-01-31,4.0,Events,"Forrester really listens to their employees and has implemented Anywhere Work, which will enable employees to choose to go in the office if they want or work remotely (and when they do go in, work collaboratively). Over the years I have worked here they have always done their best to increase flexibility and promote the members of the team. They have amazing vacation time to offer and they also have a great maternity leave policy. There are a lot of different opportunities available as well if you decide to switch career paths.","It can be difficult to have a good work-life balance and to disconnect and use vacation time. It’s not easy to just consider this a 40 hour a week job and you will often take work home with you outside of those hours. However, they are now increasing headcount which should help with this."

They fostered an environment of collaboration and we got stuff done!,"There wasn't a lot of room for growth even though the company constantly said there was.

Innovative, forward-thinking and profatable.","As with any research firm, the IP is the people and more specifically; the research analyst. Over the past 2 years (20/21), there's been an uptick of turnover of long-term & well respected analysts. Mildly concerning."
43,Forrester,A company who values it's employees,2021-12-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's a great, open and straightforward company, who cares massively about it's people!

It's somewhat a small company numbers wise, in comparison to where i've come from, so you are valued as a person.

The ability to work from home and to do so whenever you want (post covid) is excellent.","Missing some benefits that others would provide.
Depending on your background it's quite difficult to pick up the terminologies and how the business runs."
44,Forrester,Great Company to work at -- IF are In Sales and IF you are in the US.,2021-12-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Good work-Life balance and recent work from anywhere approach is a benefit.,"Unpleasant culture and experience if you are not in Sales and not in the US. International Sales leadership and their subsequent Sales Leaders outside US foster and nurture a culture of zero collaboration with Non-Sales employees, no respect, lack of trust and definitely a ME ME ME approach of working. Definitely Join Forrester if you are interested only in a sales role........."
45,Forrester,"Smart people, flexible culture, interesting work",2021-12-06,5.0,Vice President & Principal Consultant,"Colleagues, flexible culture, and fascinating clients that also keep us on our toes","Because of the nature of the work, career growth can be limited."
46,Forrester,Great place to work and grow your career,2021-12-03,5.0,Client Executive,"Great work-life balance. You have the opportunity to work with the smartest people and most innovative companies in the world. You're at the center of business, tech, innovation, etc. Sales is very consultative and it will up your game and business acumen. Maybe just decide to skip the MBA and go work for a firm like Forrester?","Compensation may be a bit on the lower side but you can get to a point where you're be compensated well based on past performance. OTE can be strong if you're a top producer. If you can get there, you'll be working for an amazing company and earning a solid living."
47,Forrester,Out of Touch,2021-12-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Work/Life balance is pretty good,"Incredibly difficult to move forward in your career. There is a serious bias towards hiring people from outside the company whenever a more senior role is made available. You end up competing for promotions with professionals outside of the company and are at a disadvantage because of it. Since the pandemic began, Forrester has also seriously scaled back opportunities for advancement and to upskill (previously available perks like education reimbursement have been cut, hiring/promoting frozen). At this point, accepting a position at Forrester is a guaranteed way to put your career on hold."
48,Forrester,Opportunities to learn and grow supported by a strong culture,2021-11-23,5.0,Senior Consultant,"Whenever I talk to prospective applicants about why I've stayed with Forrester for so long, it always comes down to the culture. Client projects come and go; some great, some challenging. But over the last 5+ years I've found that I work with employees who are smart, kind, mature, and open to new thinking. I have never been made to doubt my value as a contributor, and in turn I am motivated to do my best work. 

Work/life balance is strong, and hours are flexible. As long as the work gets done, you can take the time you need to recharge. I have personally found that I can often make my own hours in a way that suits my working style / energy levels best.

On top of all that, I have made some of my best friends at Forrester. I could go on about culture.

As for the work: over my tenure I have played a few different roles within the organization, and have been encouraged to find what works best for me. Within Consulting, that encouragement continues where I have been given the space to explore and learn what I enjoy doing most. 

Forrester gives you the tools to build your expertise in whatever area you find yourself most drawn to. I am continually challenged to grow and am now miles ahead from where I started when first joining the team.","The workload is often heavy, and burnout is a strong possibility if you don't take the initiative to take care of yourself. That said - the team is highly supportive and understanding when you need to take the time to re-energize. 

Compensation could be better - but management is working to rectify this as we work our way out of the pandemic."

56,Forrester,Okayish organisation with very negligible growth opportunities,2021-11-13,3.0,Account Executive,"- Good compensation structure in India
- Great work life balance","- India is not a focus market for Forrester. The management doesn't communicate or care much about employees in this part of the world. Might be different internationally 
- While Forrester publishes extensively about EX, there's almost nothing they do to improve EX for their own employees 
- Most of the benefits were rolled back during the covid period. So no tuition fee reimbursement, referral bonus, no joining kit, you earn your salary and that's all.
- Very frequent product changes makes things difficult for the sales team"
57,Forrester,"Great Place to work, but very limited opportunities for Growth",2021-11-10,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been a part of Forrester for 5 yrs now, it's an absolutely great company to work for, the culture & the work life balance at Forrester is one of the best. 

The leadership at the top is very transparent even in the toughest times.","1. Very limited growth opportunities, the leadership does say that we are trying to work on this, but on the ground it's a different story. The managers arent so much interested in helping the employee's to upskill & grow within Forrester which is why there is a lot of employee churn in the last few months & it's expected to continue. 

I have a lot of ex colleague's who have left Forrester for the exact same reason, even though they didnt wanted to leave. 

2. The compensation is far below the industry standards in most of the functions + no scope of future growth = employee churn."

The firm has earned its great reputation.,"Analyst role is very demanding, so much client interaction and demands from sales, elsewhere, that there is little time to actually do research and write reports (only about 1/3 of my time is spent on the latter).

Great work life balance
Realistic expectations and rewards.
Learning culture allows you to explore.","Pay and benefits aren't as sexy as a tech company, but you stay for the culture and the work, not to become billionaires."
69,Forrester,Not perfect but overall a good place to work,2021-10-01,4.0,Consultant,"- Lots of very smart people. People in middle management roles really feel like they've earned those roles and are very competent.
- Generally a good work/life balance in consulting. The nature of the work means you go through the occasional crazy patch but it balances out.
- You're treated like an adult here. Nobody micro-manages your time and nobody is going to scold you if you don't always show up to work exactly on time or if you feel like you need to take a break so you sign off at 3pm on a Friday. As long as you're getting your work done, nobody really cares how it happens.
- The work is interesting. You learn a lot and definitely develop a ton of very transferable skills as a consultant.
- Benefits are good!
- The company is on very solid financial ground. There were obviously some dips during the pandemic but I don't believe anyone had to be laid off or any salaries were cut.
- Despite all of the cons below, I definitely have enjoyed my time here and have worked with some really awesome people.","- Salaries are quite low compared with the market. They're comparable with boutique market research firms but far lower than you'd be making in equivalent roles at big consulting/accounting firms or working for a vendor. Virtually everyone who leaves makes substantially more when they do. Promotion cycles are also generally pretty slow.
- The CEO is generally out of touch, often says pretty tone deaf or even downright offensive things and has far too much control over the company. Nobody seems to be able to check his worse impulses, he pretty much does whatever he wants, even if it hurts the company or employees.
- The company is VERY white. They have put together a D&I council which is doing good work so there's definite hope that this will change. The executive leadership does not seem to have much interest in it (see bullet above).
- The consulting department, in particular, seems to have become very much the forgotten child at Forrester despite it being by far the most profitable branch. I'm not sure how much that actually means long term but its definitely something that people in the consulting org have noticed."
70,Forrester,Fire the entire deal desk,2021-10-01,1.0,Account Executive,It’s a relatively respected brand to be affiliated with.,"Analysts think they are Nobel prize nominees for taking an analyst gig after working as a middle manager and graduating from the local state school

73,Forrester,Great company,2021-09-16,4.0,Research Associate,This was a great first job after college! I really feel like my professional development is prioritized.,The communication between higher-ups and the rest of the company could be better.
74,Forrester,"Amazing place to work - great team, work-life balance, and flexible working options",2021-09-07,5.0,Associate Consultant,"My team at Forrester is beyond amazing. Everyone is very open minded, intelligent, and values work-life balance. Management (both at the team and corporate level) has always been responsive to feedback and proactive about collecting it. I'm always learning on the job and there are plenty of opportunities for me to progress my career forward in any number of growth paths. Overall Forrester (or at least the team I work within) is an amazing place to work.","The salary is pretty low compared to other roles across the country, but when you divide time worked by the salary, I think it compares to most other companies."
75,Forrester,Great Company,2021-09-06,4.0,Account Manager,"Hires very good people, and very team-oriented vibe",Lots of changes from upper management. Survey employees on different aspects of jobs and then no change is seen after.
76,Forrester,"Great place to work, learn and grow!",2021-09-04,5.0,Account Manager,"Been with the company for 3 years and it's still feels amazing and refreshing. 
I have been given the opportunity to grow my sales territory with the full support from senior management team is something I truly treasured.",Lack of localization resources and market understanding.

78,Forrester,Needs Improvement,2021-08-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Forrester has a great culture and team atmosphere. I appreciate the authenticity of some of my coworkers. It's inspiring to see so many smart individuals who have so much to offer.,"Lack of career growth and getting siloed into a position with no upward movement. There's too much ""do the job before you get the title"" going on with little review of how long this is happening - a person should not be doing the job without the pay or title for more than 3-4 months. Pay is way lower than industry standard and some managers undervalue their employees."
79,Forrester,"Great, young, caring company",2021-08-28,5.0,Consultant,"Forward-thinking, data-based decision making, open to diverse ideas, flexible work arrangements","Workload get can heavy sometimes and we're slow to hire which means overwork sometimes, especially during quarter-end (since we're a public company)"
80,Forrester,Good Organization,2021-08-26,4.0,Account Manager,Good Leadership; Good product; Great team,Territories were not evaluated to be equal across the organization; Senior reps located at Boston HQ cherry picked accounts. Very hard for a new account manager to maintain success year over year

82,Forrester,"Enjoyable, challenging, great transparent team and leadership.",2021-08-23,5.0,Product Owner,"As a po you control how your team runs in partnership with amazing development leads, the developers, fellow product owners and managers are all amazing and collaborative. 

They handle covid with transparency and data rather than whims. I don't expect that will change anytime soon.","Transparency on quantitative business goals and the data to track those goals is just not there yet. 

Salary and benefits are all as expected from a non-tech first firm. 

Beyond that, I 100% recommend working here you will learn a ton and work with a team who never gives up on eachother or on their vision for a bolder and brighter tomorrow for all of our clients. Not joking, the product team always has the client in mind which is refreshing."
83,Forrester,"Great company, culture and team - much lower than average pay",2021-08-21,5.0,"Great Company, Culture and Team","I have worked at Forrester for 3 years, and have had ample opportunity to grow and develop in my career. Most of the leadership really does seem to care about you personally and professionally. There is a high standard of excellence expected, and you get to rub shoulders with genuinely smart folks. I enjoy the impact we make on client's work, and that we get to work on so many different projects.","The pay doesn't seem to be keeping up with industry trends. Even after just recently getting a raise, I'm consistently tempted with offers on Linkedin to interview with other companies that are paying anywhere from 30% - over 100% more than I'm making now...and again, this is after two promotions/significant raises in 3 years. We are well above our sales targets as a company and layed off many high-salaried leaders at the start of this year, so I do hope that makes it's way down to us ""average"" workers or we'll continue to have folks leaving that don't necessarily want to. I would also like the option to stay completely remote in 2022....Other than that, it's great."

We get to work with the brightest people, the best clients and make a genuine impact every day.","As a non-US employee its sometimes tough to work out what long-term senior career progression looks like. There's a head office gravity that's hard to avoid in any company, but in the last couple of years this has improved as we've focused more on growing the ""international"" (i.e. Not USA) business. I am hopeful.

Gender and sexual orientation diversity is awesome. Ethnic diversity is less so, though in the European and APAC divisions we have a massive range of different nationalities and cultural backgrounds. The issue is more obvious in Boston."
86,Forrester,Good place to work,2021-08-12,4.0,Marketing Specialist,Great co-workers. Clearly defined tasks.

If you’re a white male, went to a hip top tier college, we’re in a frat, and use words like “awesome” or “cool beans”, you’ll fit in great here. Just look at the executive leadership. There is not one person of color. Words cannot describe how uncomfortable I felt being one of a handful of POC at this company."

113,Forrester,A Special Culture,2021-06-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Top notch culture from the top down. The Exec Team is transparent and accessible. The company has made significant progress over the past year in keeping current with seismic shifts in the future of work. The new flexible work policy allows employees to work up to three days/week from home. The org is being much more open about diversity & inclusion and what we're doing to get better. Gender diversity has always been outstanding - half the employee base is female and more than half the current Exec Team are women. This is a community where you can truly bring your whole self to work - colleagues are truly curious about who you are and the path you took to get here. It is a kind and caring place of very smart and talented people. I've seen many people really grow their careers here.,Not the most innovative culture - product has lagged changes in the market.

-Work-life balance here is wonderful. There isn't a ""work your life away"" mentality here. While we work hard during the day, Forrester is very respectful of their employees by keeping a firm work-life balance. 
-This is a great place to be if you love being challenged. Things are constantly shifting, so you'll never be bored. The growth I've experienced in the time I've been with Forrester so far has far exceeded any other company I've worked for.

Promotions or changes only really occur when someone leaves the company = growth depends on “how many years you want to wait.” If you want to change departments you need to start over in an entry level role. Ultimately felt boxed in and undervalued.

I learnt the aspects of global business and I am continuously learning to be a humble colleague/leader. Got an opportunity to travel globally. I have/had one of the best leaders that anyone could ask. They inspire, challenge and mentor every step along the way. Covid made the company even more empathetic and caring. Forrester is known for its culture and its very evident in the people they bring on board and the trust that is installed to do the right things. I've had many ex-colleagues who tell me even today that they miss the culture the most. 

Overall, Forrester is a company that is striving to be better everyday and I am happy to be a part of this journey.","Like any other corporate firm, there are growth pains in Forrester too. There needs to be plan and vision to localize resources in respective regions. It still feel a very HQ (USA) driven rather than global practices.

- interesting perks pre covid-19 (annual sales kick-off in Boston, participation to interesting local events in Paris and annual forums in Europe)
- most colleagues were nice, and the atmosphere before covid-19 and reorganization was ok","- awful top management in France and in the rest of Europe, bad-intentioned, arrogant and toxic ""leaders"" (if you can even call them so) who are disliked by most of the employees, resulting into high turn-over figures
- overall toxic atmosphere due to bad management and unrealistic expansion targets
- useless middle management positions with no added value for the direct reports, middle managers are being exploited by top management leaders to solely handle the ugly tasks (ex. performance improvement plans or exit plans of some of the employees who are gently being pushed to the door)
- middle managers are narrow-minded, before covid-19 they used to battle themselves against remote working, they would also stalk employees through different channels (even personal ones) in order to check working hours etc. they just execute top management strategies without even asking themselves whether these make sense to their teams
- a feeling of instability and constant reorganization, the strategy and vision change year in year out
- the Paris office offers no evolution perspectives other than sales
- uncompetitive salaries and no promotion plans
- very heavy hierarchy line of seasoned sales managers who cannot be contradicted due to their status and who think they know it all just because they are old
- the youngest employees experience a feeling of being constantly checked on by either middle managers or more senior ecosystem partners (sales etc.), as if they were not experienced enough to be successful in their role and constantly needed ""guidance"", which in reality is nothing else than orders to execute
- overall feeling of being back at school and having to deal with teachers rather than with professionals, very frustrating and this makes one's job feeling worthless"

At the end of the day the impact of the company feels rather shallow. The whole business model is rooted around trying to be a ""thought leader"" in the MANY verticals the company focuses on. The quality of research used to support this model is rather poor in my opinion. A research engagement basically consists of aggregating qualitative interviews from executives at different business. The only data used is survey data that in many cases is hard to access due to cumbersome internal processes. If you look at the way companies are operating now, what's the appeal of going to this outside entity when all the data relevant to optimizing business performance can be aggregated and actioned upon internally?

- Benefits (healthcare, telephone bill, work related expenses)...warning! pay is below industry and competitor standards
- The way the company approached WFH during the pandemic, the CPO really is a wonderful person
- Intelligent people","Where do I begin!

The relentless cliqueyness of offices and teams is really a major problem. ""Country Managers"" or even team leaders are very biased to staff who are on their ""list"" and ostracize those who aren't. Diversity wise, yes some offices have a diverse background of people but the core culture alienates anyone who isn't like the majority.

Open racism and instances of religion based negative slurs happened more than 1 time while being employed. A diversity council was formed to ""combat and educate"" staff about diversity but they have a massive road ahead. 

Your bonus which becomes vital to your finances (pay being so low compared to competitors) is at the whim of the manager which looks at their budget and chooses who they like more to receive a bigger cut. Career ascension and opportunities are based on whether the director or manager likes you personally. There was instances where projects and big internal brand opportunities were given based on personal bias rather than merit or willingness to actually do the job.

HR is in most instances either the manager who is instigating this clique culture or are close friends with the perpetrator. I reported to the manager multiple incidents and feelings of being bullied and ostracized and was to believe that that person would never do such a thing and that I was at fault. Even being told to harden the you know what up....very professional!

Culture of cyber stalking and looking at peoples personal social media to judge and gossip about them is a massive problem. Separate chat and WhatsApp groups that are used solely to isolate others has to be a HR issue right!? ""Senior Management"" openly show bias towards some who they see as drinking buddies and openly disclude others from vital comms, office related events and social occasions which can be used to build better bonds internally."

Yes, we have 401k match, good healthcare, etc. But the best part is that senior leadership makes themselves accessible to you from the very first day by attending your onboarding. Unlike other corporate companies, Forrester leadership actually talks and listens to their employees. I feel comfortable emailing my manager, or even my director with ideas and questions. My manager encourages honesty and advocates on my behalf. The people are collaborative, not competitive. I have made good friends while working here and enjoy working with colleagues across the business.",Forrester is a corporation and with that comes rules and processes that can sometimes feel like red-tape.

206,Forrester,A wonderful culture,2021-01-13,5.0,Vice President and Research Director,"It's in times like the ones we live in that you truly appreciate what makes a great company culture: empathy and respect, openness and transparency, collaboration and innovation. Forrester boasts being a customer-obsessed company, which they are, but that also includes a deep care for employees. Of course, the standards of quality are very high, but the work environment is such that you can be your best at what you do. The leadership team is inspiring, but approachable, managers (mostly) empower their teams to do what is best for the firm and our clients, and work policies are relatively flexible to accommodate each individual employee's preferences. People here are smart, benevolent and always ready to help. I am always shocked and horrified when hearing from friends and family about the type of ""a-holes"" they need to cope with at work. You won't find these people here... At least, I have not come across any of them in more than 10 years working at Forrester.","There are always things any organization can improve on. For Forrester, this is about speed, innovation and risk taking. This is also about becoming more of a global company. But here again, I feel that we have made tremendous progress over the past couple of years. Even more flexible work policies would be a plus."
207,Forrester,Integrity is a priority here,2021-01-13,5.0,Account Manager,"Forrester is simply just a good company all-around. They go above and beyond to make sure their employees are taken care of, and re-assured of their importance. I wasn't finding much success at first, and Management has gone out of their to make sure I know they've invested in me, and that they will do everything to help me succeed, and to not stress over my sales numbers. Employee development is truly a priority to Management.

Also, as an aside... I went to submit an expense report, and they denied it because I wasn't claiming the maximum available amount I've never had a company tell me they wanted to pay me more money than I thought I was entitled to. That's true integrity right there",It's hard to be good at a sales job here because there is SO much product knowledge to learn. You have to really work at it.

Toxic leadership within certain departments
**Proceed with caution** Culture varies widely by team

My role is being eliminated over an incredibly long time period to make way for the future alignment of products. While leadership felt that this was the best way to help us find new jobs, it has made it incredibly difficult to stay motivated. The lack of coordination, communication, and a plan for how we will move forward is has created an awful employee experience for those of us who work closely with clients. We have been buried underneath layers of poor management, and are slowly being pushed out of the company. Given all the transformation Forrester is undergoing, you would think that they would like to keep some of their talent and re-purpose them. The opportunities have been few and far between to transfer internally. Forrester is losing great people because of a very unthoughtful decision."

Forrester has been an unfaltering place of support during this tumultuous year - an element that has been critical to someone like myself - a working parent of a young child. They've provided words of support and actions to back those words up - through a day-off for parents, schedule flexibility, and general understanding of deadlines, goals, and emotional energy during the day. Because of this, I have continued to feel like a productive team member with a long-term place at Forrester. I am also proud of how the overall company is continuing to grow through our renewed focus on D&I, excitement about our offerings to the market, and a new/rich management development program. I remain grateful to Forrester leadership for their unwavering commitment to me as a person and as a Forrester employee.","I look forward to continued investments in our technology, which will only increase our effectiveness as a temporarily-remote company.

243,Forrester,Good job out of college,2020-08-30,4.0,Research Associate,You have the opportunity to work with and learn from a diverse group of people. The benefits are also pretty good for a first job out of college.,"Because of legacy systems in place, there can be a lot of hoops for one to jump through in order to do their basic job responsibilities. Forrester is also going through a transitional period right now, which can make it hard to determine where they want to go as a company and what the long-term plan is."

There's a genuine sense of respect and collaboration across teams, which makes it easier to have constructive conflict, all with the customer at the center of our actions. The corporate culture has generally been very good (although declining quickly -- more details in the ""Cons"" section), and I've learned more in my role at Forrester than I did at my previous employers and in my schooling.","Unfortunately, the executive team doesn't embody the same corporate values that my colleagues demonstrate and take to heart . Over the last 1.5 - 2 years, there's been a steady decline in the integrity of executive leadership decisions and communications to the both the employee population and clients, to the point where I would honestly no longer recommend this organization to friends, acquaintances, or prospective clients. 

Sadly, I no longer view Forrester as a research, data, and people company. And while I have the upmost respect for my colleagues' integrity and knowledge, I now view Forrester as primarily a sales company, that just happens to sell advice on best practices in customer and employee experience, while failing to follow their own ""playbook"" and recommendations."

249,Forrester,Forrester is a family,2020-08-19,5.0,Research Associate,"I've been with Forrester for 2 years now. When I first walked in I figured it would be just like any other job. It wasn’t until I was faced with one of the most personal hardships I hope to ever endure that I realized it was so much more than just a job. So many colleagues became like family, became a support system that I couldn’t have done without. And Forrester as a whole really took care of me.

Exactly one year ago today I had to make the very difficult decision to leave my position with Forrester to tend to personal matters. I didn’t think I’d have the chance to come back.

I was only gone for 2 months and I had the opportunity to come back, and my Forrester family welcomed me right back in.

Although we spend so much of our lives at work, It’s pretty rare to find a job where you feel a part of something bigger. I couldn’t have gotten through the past two years without the support of my fellow Forresterites.",There are few cons to Forrester worth mentioning.
250,Forrester,"A hiring process reflective of the inclusive, collaborative and efficient organisational culture",2020-08-19,5.0,Employee Experience Associate,"Efficient hiring process enabling you to meet many relevant people who give you a great taste of the organisational culture. A speedy (although meticulous) and very friendly process. 
During the interview stages, the recruiter always ensured all my questions were answered and I was never left long without news, which is also the case now that I am in my role.
Great leadership across the business.",I cannot think of any cons at this stage.

They are very intuned with how employees are feeling and it's relaxed, but a dedicated place to work.","With smart people come big egos. There are some know-it-alls and your life can be drastically different depending on what team you are on.

254,Forrester,Great company with a strong culture,2020-08-03,5.0,Account Manager,- Effectively you run your own business but with great support from management and great sales training people. The recruitment process was clear and really efficient. Tim and the recruitment team were prompt and very supportive in answering every question I had. I got a great sense of competency and hard work from the senior management on the panels I went through and this has indeed proven to be the case in the role. Forrester makes you feel like you will be challenged and supported and demonstrates a great company culture and ethic. You are also working for a highly reputable company with a great standing in the industry.,"On-boarding is quite long, and getting to grips with the products and everything the role entails takes time, but it makes sense as there are not really many comparable company's. You are also very well-supported throughout the entire process."

- Good brand in the industry
- Recession proof - companies come to Forrester for help when things get tough
- Solid benefits
- Nice office in Cambridge","- A lot of egos - if you're not in sales or research you might feel left out
- For CSM team, ways of working are not standardized across teams
- You ask 5 people the same question, you'll get 5 different answers
- Way too many cooks in the kitchen, working across various teams to get anything done
- Products are confusing, especially with recent acquisition of SiriusDecisions
- Sink or swim atmosphere, didn't feel set up for success
- Pay is low, can make a lot more as CSM at SaaS company
- Location is mediocre, there's a hotel with overpriced bar in office park but no where to go for social gatherings. One T stop away from Davis Square but not like being in downtown Boston."

Really cool product and IP to sell.,"Culture isn't very work/life balanced, seems to almost dabble into work is life. Sales leadership not the greatest from boots on the ground perspective, although front line managers are fantastic. Benefits are not great, or even competitive. Lots of process for the sake of process, If you don't know the ecosystem (which is large and nuanced) can be hard to get answers and support in a timely manner. Deal Desk can some times feel more like sales disablement.

Came into org via acquisition, our org was treated like the red headed step child and the established relationships were seemingly discounted as a lot of key partnerships were switched out."

-People generally work hard and care a lot about what they do. 
-The work we do is really interesting and we get to interact with clients to solve some of the most challenging problems that businesses face. 
-In my role (Researcher), you have the opportunity to learn quite a bit in a short time.","-Organizationally, we can do a much better job of coordinating knowledge and resource sharing across the organization. On many occasions, it feels like ineffective communication across different departments makes it more difficult to do our best work. We still always get the job done, but it's frustrating at times to experience these inefficiencies as an employee. 
-In my role, it's not especially clear what the career path is which is why many researchers will leave the company for a different role because they can't find a way within the company to advance their career. Sadly, more than a few people who have left the role wanted to stay at the company but found no path to advance."
263,Forrester,Meh,2020-06-25,2.0,Sales Representative,Some of the people were cool,Not for me. Selling was difficult due to a ton of things out of your control. Comp model wasn’t great either. Leaders all over the place.

Incredible visibility into the market. I'm paid fairly. Excellent leadership in research and consulting. Lots of great support for the work itself. Superb HR leadership. The best colleagues of my career.b Great place for recent college grads to learn and grow.","The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because the company still has work to do with manager development. Bad bosses (bullying, abusive, grumpy) continue to get a pass here for far too long, and people who continue to do excellent client work and over-perform in spite of it, continue to go unrecognized."

Free ice cream every Wednesdays in the summers is a + and brightens up everyone's day. Forrester understands the importance of these small & large gestures to make us feel appreciated.

- Very open executive team, always responding to world events and keeping us informed on next steps.

- I have grown and seen others grow at this company. The culture is extremely supportive and we are encouraged to be our true selves. I don't feel the need to hide who I am around co-workers and feel supported in all my endeavors. 

- Great benefits, time off, flexible work when needed.

268,Forrester,Love this company,2020-06-04,5.0,Program Manager,"Culture. When everyone said how great the culture is during my interview process, I was like, yeah whatever. They weren't kidding. This company culture really is extraordinary. Everyone is collaborative and helpful across every team I've worked with. 

A huge part of the culture starts from the executive team. Every other company I've worked for had a divide between the C-suites and the rest of the org... not here. They lead with transparency and truly listen to what employees have to say. I actually feel like my voice matters to them. During COVID, decisions regarding working from home and travel restrictions were made quickly with clear communication. They've even given us a couple extra mental health days because they understand the challenges everyone is facing both at work and in their personal lives. They've taken a stand against the injustices that are being brought to light in our world and have given our Forrester community a place to openly dialogue and share resources on how we can be better. 
I appreciate that the executive team is willing to be flexible - if something isn't working or needs to change, they change it rather than falling back into the ""that's the way we've always done it"" mentality. 

I have been genuinely impressed with this company and the people in it.",None. Really. None at all.

Thank You! 

Our research has never been stronger (in my opinion) and the collaboration and alignment across departments never so easy.","We've had some ups and downs with weak leadership in pockets on various levels, and some hard to get rid of silo thinking - but I feel that is clearly in the past and confident that we are moving forward united and stronger than ever. Just something to keep an eye on to not fall back on weak spots and silo thinking when times are easier again."
273,Forrester,Great Career Support,2020-05-28,5.0,Analyst,Clear paths to succeeding here. Great to work with other teams across the organization - very cross-functional work!

I appreciate the willingness to sit down with each employee to learn, grow and improve. I feel that my and our opinion(s) are considered and acted on as best capable to drive the business in a positive direction. I am thrilled to be working here and appreciate the opportunity I have been given. I couldn't have landed at a more supportive and energy filled environment. From the leadership team to my peers, all are willing to jump in an lend a hand to my success and the success of the business. As a collective, we truly believe in our mission, vision and values. We embrace curiosity and genuine interest in our client's success as a partner and collaborator.","We all have our struggles or inefficiencies. From what I have seen so far, we actively engage to better learn about ourselves as a working group and our processes, then utilize our tools and resources to plan and execute to solve for a better experience. This should probably go in the ""pros"" but I am surprised by the decisiveness and precision with which we identify and act on areas for improvement."
275,Forrester,Best Places to Work 2020 - It really is!,2020-05-26,5.0,Finance Project Manager,"This is a wonderful place to work. The company offers good starting pay and generous benefits, but the most compelling reason to work here is the corporate culture. The management team leads with emotional intelligence, compassion, and empathy. They promote an environment of learning, sharing and collaboration among employees and encourage team members to come together and create innovative “out of the box” solutions. 

The company continually shows employees how much they are valued. There are many impromptu employee socials at corporate office and even during the pandemic when business was negatively impacted, the management team made it clear that they support their workforce and our health and welfare is of their utmost concern. 

The company promotes social justice, sustainability, and corporate responsibility. They encourage employees to volunteer for their favorite causes and recognize their efforts by giving them and their charity a shout out on internal company video channels.",I wish the learning center had directed learning paths tied to open jobs.

We are very focused on how research impacts or can impact our clients and take that responsibility and opportunity to heart.,"As a growing company, both organically and through acquisition, Forrester must rewrite processes to support that growth which, while required, are incredible frustrating to live through.

- Quality Teammates...I have so many smart and genuinely collaborative colleagues it's nearly an embarrassment of riches
- Important Product...it shouldn't take a pandemic to realize this, but I see how our research, content, and analysts are more imperative than ever to support companies in navigating these times and the future.","- I've said this many of times, but I think our 401k match is weak compared to similar companies. We are matched 50%, up to 3%. I'm not expecting it to change in this climate, but, when we come back out I think that's important.
- We are full time work from home now, and I think that the option to do so full time (while having a local office available) should be strongly considered. Most of my direct ecosystem live in different states or countries, and all of my clients are as well, so I don't see having the option to work remote/in office affecting my performance."

Truly and honestly concerned with solid employee satisfaction. This is a place you work very very hard but there is a really wonderful work life balance and the rewards can be fabulous.","SiriusDecisions (where I am a legacy employee) was acquired by Forrester 1.5 years ago and there are still bumps and potholes to work out, some slower then others to manage through. But that will all come to pass, just practice patience and grit. I'm coming from a way smaller company, so moving into a much bigger one has it's new challenges with work flow and a lot more management styles to navigate. Honesty and candid communication often works most of it out. Things in some spots are very slow to merge since acquisition.

Leadership genuinely cares about the employees, as is evidenced by the large investment (people and time) in Employee Experience. We are a purpose-driven company, focusing on helping our clients to become better businesses (again aligned with the values)--and there is no shortage of smart, capable people to learn from.","Every year it seems one of the Executive Team members leaves (or is asked to leave) and the new regime hits the reset button on that function. This causes a lot of reactionary thinking, and although our high-level strategy has not shifted materially in recent years, the next click down strategy continues to lurch from silver bullet to silver bullet.

298,Forrester,"Strong brand, excellent team, needs a clearer strategy",2020-05-21,4.0,Senior Research Director,"I came to Forrester through the acquisition of SiriusDecisions. Immediately on joining I felt the influence of the brand -- they have a phenomenal reputation and a clear respect among clients. The people are smart, energetic and driven. The culture is embracing.","The company lacks a clear and coherent strategy that will drive growth (or at least has not articulated this well). The SiriusDecisions integration process has been flawed, and a lot of good people have left. Senior management can come across as a clique that is impervious to change."
299,Forrester,Looks good on your CV,2020-05-21,1.0,Client Success,The research side of things are really interesting and the clients are lovely. Many colleagues are great people.,"- Management works very close with HR, don't expect any help from them.
- Flexible working is only for the chosen few.
- high turn over (guess why?)
- Some managers are real bullies."
300,Forrester,Forrester - second to none,2020-05-21,5.0,Senior Analyst,"During this horrible pandemic, the Executive Leadership team has been extremely transparent, supportive. encouraging and accessible to all of us. We are all in this together, and Forrester is leading by example","The only thing that is missing during this pandemic, is the actual face to face with my co-workers (in the office). WebEx and MS Teams does make it better."
301,Forrester,"Passionate, Challenged and Supported",2020-05-21,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"I have been with Forrester for over a decade and still come to work passionate, challenged, and supported. Top reasons I'm still here - ecosystem support, transparent leadership, great clients that I love working with every day, opportunities to learn from absolute industry leaders, being listened to and heard - able to effect positive change ,opportunity to grow my career","Forrester is a complex business and we can get in our own way sometimes. We can over-engineer solutions to simple problems and spin wheels. Post Sirius Decisions acquisition there is still training, enablement and internal ecosystem challenges"
302,Forrester,Post Pandemic leadership is stronger than ever for EU challenges,2020-05-21,5.0,Account Representative,"-Great development opportunities from some quality managers
-Moving to 'work from home' has been rapid and supported
-Technical product set which is seeing heavy engagement from current clients
-Leadership of 'international business' has gained focus and has great direction","- Chances for promotion have been placed on hold and before COVID we're subject to incredible luck and patience. 
-Heavy use of KPIs . Sometimes used for bashing salespeople over the head with rather than development.
-CEO is a major figure in the organisation, and therefore Forrester leaves itself vulnerable when he retires or leaves."
303,Forrester,One of the best companies I've worked with.,2020-05-21,5.0,Sales Consultant,"A lot: Job progression, employee benefits, work-life balance & personal development.","I can't think of any, if I could, I wouldn't be worried about voicing my opinions either."
304,Forrester,Best Professional Decision of my Life,2020-05-21,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"-Great onboarding experience
-Leadership is extremely transparent and has handled the COVID-19 situation very well
-Executive team listens to employees and it is obvious that they make considerations based on the data and feedback they receive
-Employees/my peers genuinely love the company and the work that they do
-Managers are trained well and are qualified to handle what comes their way","-The offices outside of headquarters don't give the best representation of Forrester's brand/culture/reputation and the coffee in the office is not very good.
-The current work from home policy is 1 day a week after 6 months of tenure, this should be much more flexible given the nature of the work."
305,Forrester,Client Centered Approach & Exceptional Employee Experience,2020-05-21,5.0,Senior Client Executive,"Excellent culture! I have 20+ years of sales experience, Forrester is by far the most client centered company I have ever worked for. Everyone in the organization thinks client first and is really to support that mission. Great internal partnership. The employee experience is top notch as well. So many incredibly impressive solutions we can offer our clients. Allows you to be creative in putting together actual full breadth solutions for your clients, not just pushing licenses or product.","There are so many solutions and supportive resources that it can be a bit overwhelming. However, that's a nice problem to have. Regarding compensation, while the commission and bonus structures are both very good, the overall package/OTE is lower than with other firms."
306,Forrester,Good company to work for,2020-05-21,5.0,Customer Success Manager,It is a great work place,Can sometimes be siloed as an organization
307,Forrester,Great Company,2020-05-21,5.0,Accounts Receivable Associate,"The culture within the company is great and supportive. The healthy environment is very satisfying, and the amount of support received from everyone at all levels is tremendous. Moreover, it is a great brand and well known in the market. Their compensation system (vacation days, insurance, 401K...) is great.",Complicated management structure that is hard to follow
308,Forrester,Forrester has been a great work experience,2020-05-21,5.0,Product Owner,"Most of the Forrester staff I've worked with have been wonderful - helpful, responsible, and smart. They company pivoted very well during this COVID time, having us all working productively at home in a short amount of time. They care about their clients (that isn't just talk) and they want to do right by clients and serve them well. I also personally love by boss. No company is perfect but so far my work experience here has been pleasant and also given me lots of opportunities for growth!","I don't like the commute when we are not in a pandemic, but that is because I don't want to pay the high prices to live close to the downtown Nashville office. Mostly a personal choice, but really the only downside to the job."
309,Forrester,Forrester is truly a great culture <3,2020-05-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Forrester is all about its customers and employees, the level of transparency and communication has been wonderful during these times of Covid-19. Everyone has been so willing to answer questions and work together.","None at the time. The team has worked hard to be transparent, supportive, and honest through out my time here so far."
310,Forrester,Incredible place to learn & begin your career,2020-05-21,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Freedom, endless amount of knowledge, great culture, supportive ecosystem",must be very self motivated
311,Forrester,Phenomenal culture - best in class!,2020-05-21,5.0,Senior Account Manager,Everyone treats each other with kindness and respect. Forrester understands that happiness is not based on meaningless perks. Productivity = happiness and everything is geared toward eliminating obstacles and giving you the tools and resources you need to succeed. Great work/life balance.,Haven't come across a con yet
312,Forrester,"My Two Cents, it is a hard place to work",2020-04-16,1.0,,There are a handful of genuine people working at Forrester.,"-European culture is disregarded. How can you disregard someones identity? Applying an US centric methodology will simply not work in Europe. 
- There is no career growth, you can see your life pass by in the same position. Ask and thou shall not seek. 
-Management needs drastic basic training, emotional intelligence is lacking.  
- It is a hard place to work.  There is no team spirit. The word TEAM and We gets thrown a lot but  it needs to be redefined as there is no team spirit."
313,Forrester,Lots of freedom and opportunity,2020-04-10,5.0,Vice President/Principal Analyst,"Work with really smart people. 
You get to solve hard problems for clients.
Never boring.
The only limit is you.
You feel part of a family.",It takes time to find balance and avoid burnout - you have to set your limits and work on time management.
314,Forrester,Great place to work!,2020-04-10,5.0,Senior Research Associate,Great place for young people to start their career. You get exposure to all facets of business and technology. Whether you want to be in research/consulting or not it is a great place to work and learn from. Brilliant colleagues.,None really. Experience varies by team.
315,Forrester,An Excellent Place to Work,2020-04-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The work environment, an incredibly interesting and useful product to support, and the benefits.","Work-Life balance can be challenging at times, compensation is average at best, and growth opportunity can be limited in certain roles.  Cross-functional training, particularly after a recent integration, has also been lacking."
316,Forrester,Economic Customer Enlightenment,2020-04-02,5.0,Senior Desktop Support Engineer,"I work with intelligent, compassionate, driven people with the customer as a main focus to empower through our research.  I work with very hard working nice people!","I have nothing adverse to say about Forrester.  I wish we had a Starbucks, Panera Bread or a Duncan Donuts at Cambridge Discovery Park."
317,Forrester,Terrible culture and management  - Reality does not match the perception,2020-04-01,1.0,Account Manager,"- Exciting work and opportunities for rewarding client engagement.
- Active learning is encouraged, with the freedom to follow trends that interest you
- Get to work with a talented and diverse group of people.","- Terrible management and mindset. Unprofessional with zero confidentiality and bias throughout departments. Not uncommon to hear management whispering and bad-mouthing colleagues. 
- Culture is non-exsistent in London and they ignored staff when survey results highlighted this as an issue.
- Any feedback from exit interviews deemed as negative is hidden or discarded to create a healthier image for senior management.
- Pointless Employee Experience team as they've done nothing to build a culture in London. The US feels like a separate company in comparison to Europe.
- Old office and technology systems.
- Ancient mindset from certain management towards flexible working. One rule for some and not for others seemed to be the approach."
318,Forrester,Employee Centric during Tough times,2020-03-16,5.0,,"What really amazed me beyond all the goodness that Forrester has is its global employee centric approach. The last few weeks have been stressful for all with the COVID situation & I must appreciate the Executive leadership, CPO & her team for their tireless efforts for staying connected to the Global workforce with a clear & transparent communication. Employee first approach makes Forrester a favourite. This not only motivates employees to push through during these business unusual times, but to commit themselves to the success of Forrester's clients.",None I could think of.
319,Forrester,THIS IS NOT ONE OF THE TOP BEST PLACES TO WORK! ONE OF THE WORST PLACES!!,2020-03-05,1.0,Customer Success Specialist,Some people are friendly and helpful but you never know who will turn on you for the benefit of themselves which happens more than often,"- Any issues you have with management or if you feel you are being treated unfairly, HR will not help you in any way. They are absolutely useless. they have no passion or interest in the employees which they claim to do. They will brush it off until you end up worse off and then act like they tried to help you.
- CSS dept is the worst, it has it's  favourites and if you aren't one your life will be made a misery!
- You can be punished for being 2 minutes late to work even though your work performance/rate is apparently perfect.
- Management have their connections with HR so ensure you sign up to a trade union as they won't defend you or investigate your case as a neutral party so you end up being worse off."
320,Forrester,"Great place to work, grow and contribute",2020-03-03,5.0,Internal Audit Director,"Amazing culture of dedicated people.  Management is very transparent and collaborative.  Everyone, regardless of role has the freedom to try new things.  Non-traditional career paths.  It's more about what you can do, not what you have done.  Access to C-level executives is exceptional.","The company's recent growth has been very challenging in terms of individual workload.  The extra effort that everyone has put in does not feel to be adequately acknowledged or rewarded, except in certain circles."
321,Forrester,"Best Job I've Ever Had, But a Lot of Work",2020-02-28,5.0,Principal Analyst,Great mix of creative autonomy with big company class support when you need it.,A lot of work. 50 plus hour weeks not uncommon. Travel can spike to 50%.

324,Forrester,Amazing Culture - Extremely Supportive - Excellent Onboarding & Ongoing development- Fearless in Talent Excellence,2020-02-20,5.0,Sales,"The work is incredibly interesting for the curious of mind. No two days are the same with lots of variety.  The people are exceptionally helpful, bright, supportive  and welcoming, with a fantastically real positive outlook.  If you work hard and smart, you are rewarded well.  There is a very good level of work-life balance and this is highly supported by management up and down the food chain.  Employees are listened to and action taken to continuously improve.","Honestly, can't think of any - maybe some of the benefits could be a bit more in line with the market but I am sure this will come in time as employees are listened to and smart reasonable ideas are generally actioned."

328,Forrester,Great employee experience and culture,2020-01-27,5.0,Client Account Executive,"Forrester has an outstanding reputation in the marketplace. Business and Technology leaders rarely have not heard of the work we have done. Our analysts are in demand and work closely with our client base.

The culture at Forrester is outstanding. Everyone is curious and works extremely hard to provide value to our clients. Very few egos in the workforce and teams work very collaboratively all with a focus on the best client outcomes.","On occasion, the work load can be overwhelming. Forrester's products and services can be complex and it takes a while to understand how to present them to solve for a client problem. Additionally, time management and getting to know your accounts as deeply as required can extremely difficult, especially for newer reps."
329,Forrester,Endless Opportunity,2020-01-27,5.0,Principal Financial Analyst,"The company places heavy emphasis on great managers. I’ve seen managers at Forrester (who are some of the best managers of people I’ve ever met) say that they needed to do more for their people. 
I’ve seen most employees are in control of their Work/Life balance.  
Expectations are high, and I am absolutely set up to succeed.
A lot of recognition (almost too much!)
An “open door” culture that encourages growth in employees
I would describe culture as: smart, intellectually curious, competent, respectful",The location is not great. Lunch options are tough. I got good at bringing lunch.

I feel valued and not simply a number expected to grind so the street numbers look attractive.  People at all levels are accessible including the C-suite.  I received comprehensive training surrounded by colleagues genuinely willing to help.  I have smart and supportive management that provides the tools and knowledge for me to succeed.  I work with smart thought leaders who are passionate about their expertise and always willing to share what they know.  I learn new things every day.  Good work/life balance.  It’s easy to come to work knowing I contribute to my clients’ success.","401K matching could be better, high deductible health plans, pay to park"

Overall working culture is great with emphasis on a true employee experience","So far, overall strategy is centralized in Cambridge, US where we are headquartered. It is changing with a new orientation toward more and more localization"
337,Forrester,There’s a reason why people boomerang back,2019-12-12,4.0,Account Manager,"Great benefits. Fun culture. The people are generally really nice, friendly people.",Seniority is #1 here.

Lots of opportunities to grow and interdisciplinary backgrounds are not only tolerated but encouraged. The $5,000/yr education stipend is one example of the development-focused culture at Forrester. The culture here is also very egalitarian and collaborative. Worked hours are also less than typical consulting firms, with a higher than average degree of flexibility in terms of remote working options. The benefits are pretty standard but still good.","The salaries are significantly lower than the industry average (which can be particularly burdensome in major cities such as New York, San Francisco, or London), despite above average performance by the employees here. Although it's a big one, compensation is the only major con. Overall, Forrester is a fantastic place to work."

348,Forrester,"Drink the Cool-Aid, Play Political Games, Make Your Numbers, or Get Out",2019-11-10,2.0,Research,Can be interesting work and provides a platform for exposure in the industry.  Be opportunistic and make the most of your connections while you're at the company as it can be very beneficial for future jobs.,"A treadmill for most analysts to maintain their advisory and document numbers, thus quality of work and life-balance often suffers.  A lot of talk and aspirations to change this but, when push comes to shove, it's a numbers game.  Favoritism and politics at senior management levels means you had better be in the right group with sway. HR is useless when dealing with personnel issues and the lack of diversity in the workforce is overt."
349,Forrester,Solid but not without flaws,2019-11-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- If you want one, you have a clear path to a platform, both internally and with clients. Capable folks get a seat at the table to really influence decision-making and direction. 
- It’s rare to find a bad manager here; a lot of training and resources put into empowering team leaders  
- Brand name carries weight
- Lots of opportunities to move between functions
- Solid benefits (recently extended parental leaves)
- Flexible commute (in some cases), good work/life balance
- Stimulating work and access to tremendous resources in the form of smart people and research","The company has been changing and innovating a lot the last few years, which is great, but executing on that change has missed and missed often. Growth pressures mean that new solutions are often put to market before they’re properly vetted, and when they fail, there’s a clear drag in morale. Recent acquisitions (FeedbackNow, Glimpzit) and product pursuits are initially touted as the next big difference-maker but quickly fade into the background. The company has pushed to digitize many client experiences but development resources to support them are simply not there. This means that Forresterites are asked to bring sub-par tech to their clients and hold the bag when something doesn’t deliver. 

Whether you ask for it or not, sales pressures are behind each and every role at Forrester, even if you work in Product. Pressures to renew, enrich, and hit revenue targets often distract from the core goal of driving strategy through thought leadership and research. This means that non-quota carriers are expected to play a key role in the sales process without being compensated for doing so.

The HQ manages to lack both the perks of being in a city (next to no food or entertainment nearby) AND the benefits of working in the burbs (expensive parking and congested commute).

Forrester is very conservative with compensation; some feel that the culture makes up for it, others don’t and move on.  Whether it’s related or not, attrition has been an issue more recently."
350,Forrester,Great Place to Work,2019-11-02,5.0,Program Manager,"Managers care about their employees, they want you to succeed and grow your career. The benefits are amazing, including great healthcare, a gym, massages, and employee appreciation days. Great work/life balance.",Compensation may not be the most competitive
351,Forrester,Sales Management and Product,2019-10-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Provides a brand, largely built on past reputation, that opens many doors for initial senior leadership meetings.",Tremendous amount of turnover in our Bay area team.   The company has  promoted many successful individual contributors into sales management roles in recent years.   They also have a knack for handing down a difficult territory from one new hire to the next instead of mixing some of those difficult accounts into the more polished reps territories for fear of alienating them.   Their Product direction is suspect and there's been a tendency to hire those that will not really challenge existing delivery model and push change.
352,Forrester,"Great company, benefits and people!",2019-10-23,5.0,Senior Customer Success Specialist,I've been with Forrester for 2.5 years and it's been a positive experience all around.

I wouldn't trade this opportunity for any other job I've ever had!,I haven't encountered any cons and don't foresee that I will.

Extremely supportive managers, which is a rarity in professional services firms let me tell you. Fairly generous benefits and nice little perks like the ice cream truck in the summer!","It seems to be an overly complex organization that takes a while for new employees to figure out.

- Great exposure to senior management both internally as well as externally at globally renowned organizations.
- The executive team is very approachable and visible within the company
- Ability to learn a lot about a variety of topics that are actual in today's business environment.","- Pay is not very competitive + overall benefits do not take specific region standards into account
- Tuition reimbursement is not really usable given the limited amount and current process, which, I believe is hindering its utilization. It would also be great if there could be a proactive push from the company on using it- and recommendations on what to use it for. Make it align with one's career progression and ambitions. After all, this should be considered an investment in the workforce on both the short/long term run."

There is room to grow upwards and across the organization, and opportunities to try new things. Leadership is strong, transparent, driven, and caring.","1. There is a strong ""east coast bias"" - with scheduling and benefits. This means each office has its own microculture and all things are not equal from office to office. 
2. The pay can be on the lower side - but I would rather work here and get paid less than get paid more and hate my job."

360,Forrester,Best job I've ever had,2019-10-21,5.0,Customer Success,The willingness to help others is striking. I've never worked somewhere that people were so open and excited to help others succeed. There's not a feeling of step over someone to get ahead. The exec team is very transparent with where the company is going and changing. I have incredible teammates and I'm so thankful to work here.,"The cons definitely do not outweigh the good. I almost feel bad noting cons because I feel so lucky to work here, but there are some areas that could be improved. First, pay just isn't livable. Living paycheck to paycheck is miserable especially when the company constantly speaks on how much it values it's employees. We're offered some benefits that aren't even feasible such as tuition reimbursement- but only for further education. This benefit could be so beneficial to employees struggling to make student loan payments yet it can't be used towards loans already taken out to get to qualified to work here. Training could be updated and more connected throughout the company. It's very hard to understand what the rest of the company does and teams don't have a specified training program. It's almost like everyone is winging it."

I've also been given the space to innovate, create, network and move twice with this company.","There is a lot of information to learn and it takes awhile, but once you get the hang of it, it's a very enjoyable career."
364,Forrester,Solid Career Choice,2019-10-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people are genuinely king, supportive and SMART.  I've been here two years and still suffer from impostor syndrome.  I've not stopped learning since I started and am constantly challenged to think in different ways and extend my current skill set on a regular basis.  

Senior Management is incredibly open and easy to talk to- I love that our entire Executive Team is so accessible to everyone in the company!","Sometimes there is lack of clarity in our priorities and/or we have too many priorities so it feels like we're all working hard, but not necessarily towards the same end-goal.  Additionally, resourcing can be tight because while we are a growing company the growth is moderate so there are no hiring bursts to support new areas of growth."
365,Forrester,Still the best place i've ever worked,2019-10-18,5.0,IT Director,"The people are fantastic, smart, interesting. You can learn a great deal just by being here.
Self-starters do very well, initiative is rewarded","Still too siloed. Need to work cross-functionally better. Benefits getting better, still not best in class."
366,Forrester,Great environment to learn and accelerate your career,2019-10-18,5.0,Content Marketing Partner,"- Top notch talent across the board that sets (and exceeds) high expectations/goals
- Well established and trusted name in the market 
- Culture of learning and collaboration not often found at companies this size
- Not only is work/life balance encouraged, there are dedicated vacation days in the summer months that are 'use it or lose it' so it's like...really encouraged!","- Coming from a start-up environment, I was used to a fully stocked kitchen and dog friendly office, so that was a bit of an adjustment but worth it for the other benefits"
367,Forrester,Great place to work!,2019-10-18,5.0,Research Associate,"Can really learn a lot in this role, have a good support system of other research associates/researchers and my ideas/work are valued by the analyst. The company culture is friendly, driven and collaborative.",Turn-over happens often and there is a not a clear career trajectory after Researcher.
368,Forrester,My favorite job,2019-10-18,5.0,Customer Success Specialist,"I have been pleased so far with my experience here.  There are opportunities to work remotely.  They offer a great benefits package with perks you don't find elsewhere.  My coworkers are committed to teamwork.  My manager regards me as a human being, not just a faceless cog in the wheel.  There are tons of opportunities for growth here.",So far I haven't encountered a reason not to work here.
369,Forrester,Great place to work!,2019-10-18,5.0,Director,"I get to work with great people who are smart and curious. I'm always learning something new, which keeps things interesting.","It can get busy and be fast-paced, but that can also be exciting and challenging in a good way."
370,Forrester,"Great team, leadership",2019-10-18,4.0,Customer Success Manager,The culture at Forrester is terrific. We are always learning new things and collaborating on how to help our customers. The work-life balance is probably as good as you can hope for in  a full-time job.,We are using metrics to drive our actions that don't seem to align with our customer needs. The goals and metrics we have as CSM's are focused on renewals and not always delivering true value to the customer.
371,Forrester,Great Opportunity for Recent Grads,2019-10-18,4.0,Research Associate,"There's ample resources for employees looking to learn more about business and technology. 
Provides recent grads with fundamental project managing experience.
Paid time off and work life balance are a plus.","Health insurance is expensive and doesn't ever cover as much as you would hope. 401k matching could be better. Your experience with the company, the opportunities you're given, and the chances you have to move upward in the company hinge upon your relationship with your manager (this can also be a pro if you have a good manager, but it's ultimately a detriment that so much weighs on this)."
372,Forrester,Great company with as strong focus on employee experience!,2019-10-18,5.0,Senior Consultant,"The company takes great lengths to listen to employees and actually respond to their needs.  The result is an engaging, fun, and rewarding place to work in which I feel like an important part of the team.

Good benefits and generous PTO.

Great flexibility in work schedules  which is especially helpful with kids at home and in after-school activities.

Does a good job of being transparent with company initiatives so that employees can be involved and aware of the larger organizational priorities and goals.

Lots of opportunities to shift roles/jobs within the Forrester ecosystem.","Individual organizations within the company can be a bit siloed, and it can feel like several little companies operating within one."
373,Forrester,Great people and flexible management,2019-10-18,4.0,Current Employee,"- Smart and collaborative colleagues 
- Flexible management who really care about you and your growth 
- Solid benefits package","- Food options are somewhat limited (Cambridge) 
- Parking is expensive (Cambridge) 
- Compensation can be considered low"
374,Forrester,Great place to work,2019-10-18,5.0,Associate Account Executive,"Started my professional career at Forrester, and haven't looked back. I have been afforded so many opportunities with this company: from travel, career growth, learning, exposure to a wide variety of clients...","Sometimes we don't drink our own kool-aid, ie we can very siloed and process-driven."
375,Forrester,Feeling Heard & Valued in HQ,2019-10-17,5.0,Client Manager,"I had never been surrounded by so many intelligent people who care about their work until I started at Forrester. There were a few roles I applied for before I got hired, and I’m so glad I kept reaching out – the work is intellectually challenging, and I am encouraged to bring ideas to the table. The trust I have earned from colleagues in and outside of my team has made the work feel meaningful, and on a personal level I have made some great friendships as well. The ability to show up and be my authentic self was a huge factor in my job search, and Forrester has allowed me to do so (plus I have a supportive manager).

I genuinely enjoy what I do, and I see myself staying at Forrester for a while, provided there are adequate opportunities for growth, recognition, and compensation.

Pros
•	Work/Life Balance
•	Opportunities to implement ideas instead of just talking about them
•	Constant learning
•	Energetic culture
•	Great people","•	Internal politics can be tough to navigate at times, but there are always people ready to help when I need it.
•	There are some big egos in different parts of the organization
•	We’ve made strides, but there’s more work to be done when it comes to cross-departmental collaboration
•	I’d like to see less new hires fresh out of grad school and more representation from diverse industries, ages, educational levels, and backgrounds."
376,Forrester,Great Company!,2019-10-17,5.0,Anonymous,"Great leadership, colleagues, and culture.",The company is complex and takes time to learn all the ins and outs.
377,Forrester,"Flexibility, stimulating work, top tier management",2019-10-17,5.0,Account Manager,"Flexibility - management cares deeply about making sure you are available for your clients, which makes you feel like an mini-entrepreneur to handle your book of business. 
Stimulating work - you really feel like you have a purpose
Management - i've never worked under better supervision, each meeting I come away having learned something new. Always feel like my concerns are taken serious, very much feel taken care of in general with deep understanding.","There are few con's to working here, but the main one would be that there needs to be a little refinement on the promotion process. It could be outlined more deeply to give more of a checklist to sales on where they need to improve to get pay increases."
378,Forrester,Growth Opportunities,2019-10-17,5.0,Principal Consultant,"Forrester is the best place I've worked in my entire career.  Here's what keeps me here:

-working with amazing colleagues
-challenging work
-opportunities for growth
-stability
-remote working potential
-competitive salary","No company is perfect, and while Forrester has challenges, the senior managment teams seem to be working to advance initiatives to alleviate challenges."
379,Forrester,Director,2019-10-16,5.0,Account Director,"-Smart, collaborative people surround you
-Great work/life balance
-Vibrant workforce
-High performers are rewarded
-Endless learning potential day-to-day - intellectual stimulation","-Silos still exist between functional groups - product/marketing/research/sales - creates friction and client sat issues
-The company preaches customer-obsession, but still operates as a research-led organization that prioritizes dated research metrics over client needs and outcomes. Needs to be more business and sales-led and more entrepreneurial."
380,Forrester,When is the Age of the Employee?,2019-10-16,3.0,Director,The workforce is made up of great leaders and collaborative partners.  I trust my immediate team and have found mentors and connections across the org that I didn't have in previous companies.  The HR team is always looking for ways to share knowledge between teams and roles.  While I think Forrester is falling short in many areas the drive to change and help each other is there.,"Forrester has been pushing for high growth without fulling supporting the tech and staffing needed to achieve it.  This has created silos and finger pointing across teams.  While the tag line is ""Challenge thinking, lead change"" Forrester is following the same grow-or-die model without challenging the affect on employees.  The companies benefits and compensations has fallen below market level while the ""amazing culture"" is used time and again as an excuse for less PTO, minimal amenities and poor tech."
381,Forrester,"Great People, Great Place to Work",2019-10-16,5.0,Vice President,"-Great work life balance- this is earned but management seems flexible to different schedules accommodating long commutes and working parents of young children. You need to put in the hours and do what needs to get done but assuming you do, people are OK with accommodating schedules. 
-Great people- running a business is not easy. I don't always like or agree with the answers but the leaders and teams seem to really care about the people and the impact of their decisions, investing time and resources to make sure decisions are fact based and well though-out out.","-Based on the size of the organization, some things take longer to get done than I'd hope based on shared service and internal process. This is a double edged sword because I very much like the amount of internal support resources (HR, IT, etc). If we could still offer the same services but streamline request processes that would be great."
382,Forrester,Forrester a place to work and enjoy,2019-10-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,One line that comes to my mind taking about my life at Forrester would be. Best place to work when we talk about work life balance.

383,Forrester,We actually get paid to help our clients!,2019-10-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Forrester's research, consulting, and data teams all work to help clients on a daily basis. And people are excited by that possibility. And it shows. And the clients are highly appreciative of the help. The atmosphere in the smaller offices (San Francisco and New York, primarily) is highly collaborative and energizing. Our new-ish employee experience focus allows the research and consulting practices to find what's next and keep challenging our clients reshape their thinking.","The technology we use is old and it slows down our work. If you are not in the Cambridge headquarters, getting adequate timely technical support is often a challenge. Overall, the Cambridge headquarters in the nerve center of decision making and for those outside of it, it can be challenging to understand the decision making process. Compensation feels slightly below where it needs to be, especially as many in the analysts ranks leave for the vendor or user world, where they are more generously compensated. Finally, especially in some areas, diversity in the company remains a major hurdle yet to be overcome."
384,Forrester,Very good place to work,2019-10-15,4.0,Research Analyst,"Intellectually challenging environment, where good ideas are nurtured and supported. I've only ever worked outside of HQ,  which I consider a positive.","Silo'd thinking hinders organisational agility, flexibility and creating thinking."
385,Forrester,A growing company with exciting opportunities and transparent leaders,2019-10-15,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Forrester is honestly one of the best places I've ever worked. Most jobs start to get stale after a year, but Forrester and our clients continue to evolve and change. This allows me to learn something new every day.  I have been able to contribute to my team and the organization well outside my typical job description, and it is valued. 

The leadership is very transparent and open to ideas at all levels. They not only listen, but they act on feedback. Like all things, it takes time, but most people do have a genuine interest in doing what is right to make Forrester a better place.","Like all places there is bad that comes with the good. Forrester's products are very complex requiring lots of people to be involved in the delivery. Most of the time there is extreme collaboration, but competing priorities and lack of goal alignment across the ecosystem sometimes gets in the way. 

Some technology also slows down internal teams, requiring an insane amount of manual labor for what seems like an easy task. Luckily, there have been great strides recently in modernization efforts which should come to fruition and have a big impact in the next year."

Boston office not in the most ideal location."
391,Forrester,"Amazing culture, interesting work, but slower pace",2019-10-15,4.0,Advisor,"I can't imagine a company with a better culture for people early in their careers. People here are very welcoming and friendly, and there is a strong sense of shared success in the company. On the personal level there is absolutely a sense of warmth in the office.","For a variety of reasons, the company can feel sluggish when it comes to innovation and change, and straight up sleepy if you're in the Cambridge HQ.  Despite a broad culture of community, most working teams sit siloed into their ""pods,"" with very little interactions with other teams during the day. Innovation projects tend to take place behind closed doors and most people feel disconnected from decisions that either directly or indirectly will affect their product/team."
392,Forrester,Best Company I've Worked For,2019-10-15,5.0,Customer Success Manager,At Forrester you are valued as an employee and individual. You are trusted by leadership and granted the flexibility and understanding that we all need in our day to day lives.,None that come to mind.

394,Forrester,Engaging Culture,2019-10-15,5.0,Human Resources Director,"What has kept me at Forrester? The smart, engaging and kind people. Forrester has a strong community in each of its offices - each a little different but with the same themes of curiosity, respect, and good humor. Even when the work is hard, I know I have people I can count on.","Forrester has a fast-paced culture and change is constant. To get the most out of Forrester, you have to work with a curious, flexible, learning mindset. Colleagues expect high productivity and quality."
395,Forrester,A great place to learn and grow if you're willing to work for it,2019-10-15,5.0,Principal Advisor,"There are always opportunities to learn, whether it's by reading research or engaging directly with analysts and consultants. You're given clear direction about what success looks like and you're given support to help get there. You're also provided tools that help you be productive from just about anywhere. Many (but not all) managers are flexible about work location, which should be the case 100% for a global company that has a good-sized remote workforce. You're constantly surrounded by really smart, nice people who are trying to do the right thing all the time.","The location of the Cambridge HQ makes for a terrible commute and there are no restaurants, coffee shops, etc. nearby other than the underwhelming shared cafeteria. The one-day-a-week WorkSmart program for office-based workers is outdated and needs to be expanded and more flexible."
396,Forrester,"Great opportunities, with some growing pains",2019-10-15,4.0,Researcher,"- Challenging and interesting environment, you're surrounded by people who are smarter than you - no better place to learn. It's been an incredible launching pad for my career and I'm excited to come to work most days. 
-  A lot of opportunities for career growth in other parts of the organization (not just research).
- Culture is improving and execs are considering and acting on employee feedback more than in past years.","- Teams tend to be very siloed, and while collaboration is encouraged, analysts often keep data to themselves. 
- Career growth potential is unclear within the research department, and innovation can be hindered by corporate process or layers of approval. 
- Work-life balance and flexibility vary significantly depending on the research team.  
- Lack of diversity is a huge issue, and the culture on certain teams is very male-dominant. While the overall company may be evenly split between genders, research teams tend to skew heavily male and the company as a whole is overwhelmingly white."

- May be introduce more roles to keep employees motivated and not feel stuck on the career ladder.
- Revise the pay more frequently and balance it between new and current employees."
398,Forrester,Great Work/ Life Balance & an Engaged Executive Team,2019-10-15,4.0,Account Manager,"--Management at Forrester really seems to understand that their employees have responsibilities outside of work and are supportive and flexible. 
--There are lots of learning opportunities no matter what role you are in, you can take part. They even offer training on how to explore different opportunities within the organization.  
--I feel that the executive team listens to their employees. They conduct a survey every year to hear from everyone and take action accordingly, which they communicate with the organization. 
--Parental Leave - they just changed maternity & paternity leave to reflect the needs of employees and greatly increased the time available
--Commuter benefits - if you are brave enough to take the MBTA , they pay 50% which is GREAT. Plus the shuttle from the office to the T is a nice perk on cold or rainy days.","--Culture: It is an interesting culture. Everyone is very nice and respects one another but it can be hard to meet new people if you aren't on a team that collaborates with others or isn't involved in the companies culture, it can be a little lonely. 
--Compensation: Forrester is not very competitive with compensation and for sales, commissions can be a bit confusing to understand."
399,Forrester,"Outstanding, supportive work atmosphere",2019-10-15,4.0,Client Executive,Always learning and the peer-to-peer collaboration and training is second to none.,Work-life balance can be a challenge. Aggressive sales goals for less tenured employees.
400,Forrester,A wonderful place to work,2019-10-15,5.0,Senior Analyst,"From top to bottom, Forrester acts with care and consideration for each step of the employment process. The company's values feel present throughout the organization, and while we work hard, we have fun. The perks are great, but more because they feel like a natural extension of how the company feels about us. For the actual size of this business, a big business mindset with established processes for so many things AND an individual focus is really impressive.",Sometimes spread out far from your colleagues around the world
401,Forrester,"Generally happy, but there is always room for improvement",2019-10-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Easy access to executives, culture of innovation, growth opportunities, silo busting, decent pay and benefits.",Forrester is trying to figure out if it is a company of rules or a company of guidelines. A company that embraces flexible work in 2019 or a company with rigid policies and expectations.
402,Forrester,You will never leave,2019-10-15,5.0,"Director, Sales Management","I came to the company as my 2nd job out of college, thinking I'd get my 2-3 years of added experience in and move to something else - well 12 years later I am still here and enjoy it as much (well better) as I did 12 years ago. The company keeps you on your toes, its ever changing as the market changes, we are the trend stetters. Everyone is very friendly, collaborative and willing to help at any time. Executives don't hide  in their offices they are visible, sitting in cubes like the rest of us, walking around and chatting with everyone. Opportunities are all over the company if you want to try something new as well. You won't get bored.","As great change is and can be - sometimes for some people change is difficult. Forrester is not the large gorilla yet - therefore change is felt quickly and impact is felt all over the company. We are not the highest paying company for salaries, and you will find more money else where - but for me the culture and benefits out weigh the salaries .."
403,Forrester,I regularly recommend Forrester to my friends,2019-10-15,5.0,Advisor,"- Very intelligent and hardworking colleagues.

405,Forrester,Great place enter the working world,2019-10-10,4.0,Research Associate,"The community at Forrester, and specifically the community of young professionals, is extremely strong. Co-workers are almost always willing to go out of their way to answer questions and help you solve a problem. 

The work that Forrester does is interesting. Being surrounded by some of the foremost subject matter experts in a given industry or on some technology is thrilling, if a bit intimidating at times. The opportunity to soak up information from those around you is nearly constant. People are passionate about what they do, and are usually happy to take time to share it with you.","The ability to seek growth, both professional and personal, is, at times, unclear. I find myself having to take initiative, and go beyond my stated day-to-day responsibilities, in order apply and grow the skills that will serve me throughout my career.

I don't have much visibility into what those outside of my organization are doing (and if roles in these organizations would also be of interest to me). Most opportunities I've had to learn about the different aspects of Forrester have been self-discovered and ad hoc. Internal recruitment, and the drive to always have its employees maximizing the value they are delivering, needs more emphasis."

407,Forrester,Here for the long run!,2019-10-09,4.0,Account Manager,"Today I celebrate my 2 year anniversary at Forrester and what a 2 years it has been!  It feels longer than that, but just because I have learned and grown so much professionally and personally.  As an account manager, I manage 14-20 Forrester clients and help them with their overall strategy to grow as a company; I've helped clients get funding, get acquired, or position custom content to drive more awareness to their company or close more business. If you like helping people and making good money, this is a great role for you.  There's a TON of opportunity for growth.  As long as you do well and tell management what role you would like to move into next they will make it happen, but you have to OWN it, not EXPECT it!","No job is perfect; I wish we took our own advice that we give our clients, like CX & Sales Enablement"

411,Forrester,Best company I have worked at,2019-10-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great management that enable you to do your job,Pay is below market in some areas
412,Forrester,Endless learning opportunities,2019-10-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Forrester truly hires incredibly smart people. Our motto of ""Challenge thinking. Lead change"" is actually completely accurate. I am surrounded by people who push me to think differently. You are given the autonomy to change things if you see a better way to do it, to create processes that may not have existed, you are taught how to think about the larger picture, etc. (I could go on forever). It is a great place to start and/or grow your career in ways I never thought possible. In just over a year, I feel like I have learned 5+ years of information and have made connections throughout the entire company.

As for our leadership at the C-level, I don't think I could ask for more. They are willing to listen to feedback and take to heart what employees say they want/ need to make their lives better.","There is a need for increased working flexibility (flex hours/ days off/ WFH days/ etc), but I think that will come in due time. I have faith in exec leadership to stay up to par on industry standards."
413,Forrester,"I've worked for many organizations (of all sizes) in my career, and this is the best one yet, by far!",2019-10-03,5.0,Individual Contributor,"Culture: This has become increasingly important to me as I've matured in my career. Forrester really does care about their employee experience, including you as a person, your ability to respectfully disagree and challenge each other and leadership on business strategy and operations. Also, you will have the ability  to grow your skill set and advance your career. However, while Forrester will work with you to help you grow your career, if you start off in a position that you do not particularly like (entry level sales, for instance), you first need to work hard and excel in your role, before looking for another position. As long as you put in the hard work, they'll work with you to grow your skill set and career. It's a refreshing approach. 

People: This is the smartest group of professionals I've been around, and across the board: Data Analytics, Analysts, Advisors, Consultants, Sales, and others. If you want to expand your skill set and grow your career, just ask your colleagues and management, and they'll work with you to make it happen. 

Access: Forrester works with most major organizations, and many leaders across various industries. You get exposure to subject matter experts internally, and clients that are innovating and driving best practices across industries and functions. I'm not sure where else you can get this level of exposure, and thought leadership.  

Learning: I learned more in my first year at Forrester than I did in my undergrad and graduate level business programs, combined.","Culture (while also a major ""Pro""): Sometimes, the company can be a bit of an echo chamber, and feel as though it's displaying the negative aspects of academia. So while it's a ""Pro"" to have very smart people who challenge each other, and act as true and respected thought leaders, my belief is that some ideological challenges and dissenting voices are not welcome. To Forrester's credit, they try to foster an environment where you can feel safe expressing your beliefs, but I would not feel comfortable doing so if it doesn't align with progressive ideology. Some analysts are PhD, and they're all very smart, but there are some pockets of condescension, and they often times rely too much on theory, instead of practical application, which is a primary criticism expressed by clients.

Compensation: Depending on the role, compensation is close to, or slightly below industry averages. So this isn't a major ""Con"", but a ""Con"" nonetheless. In some roles, it is well below industry average.

Having said all of this...I still think Forrester is the best company I've ever worked for. Every company has its challenges, but I think Forrester's biggest asset is its employees and culture, and leadership recognizes and strongly supports this. Forrester also has a strong, respected brand across industries."
414,Forrester,Positive environment and good morale.,2019-10-03,5.0,Human Resources,"The company is doing very well, and it's nice to be working for a leader in your industry.",We could be more active in community involvement.
415,Forrester,Always striving to do better,2019-10-02,4.0,Employee Experience,"Forrester is a place full of change and while it can be tough, the changes are often for the best and reflective of employee insights and needs. In the past year, this has included being crisper about strategy, improving our leave policies, and remaining dynamic about the growth programs provided to employees. I continue to appreciate that Forrester is a place full of opportunity for those who work hard and want to drive their careers forward. Executives, for the most part, are very accessible and down-to-earth. New CPO is a breath of fresh air and bringing new vision and perspective to people operations.","We still need to work on how we manage change, including how that change is communicated to employees directly involved, impacted, and in the periphery. Need more transparency around pay - we live in a new world of information and connectedness between people; how we navigate the sensitivity of compensation needs to reflect that."
416,Forrester,Great People,2019-10-02,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- I truly enjoy the people I get to work with each day. The people at Forrester are what make the job enjoyable. 
- Challenges and learning opportunities each day to continue to grow

- Typical management hierarchy problems (waiting for approvals and getting permission)
- Slightly uninteresting work and material"
418,Forrester,Amazing company!,2019-10-02,5.0,Recruiter,The people at Forrester are great. I always feel challenged in a good way to step outside my comfort zone and  grow professionally.,The New York office is in the best location but not a ton of people are in the office.

- Opportunities to raise your hand to get involved in or lead new projects, regardless of your level. 
- Executive leadership is approachable and visible to all levels of the organization.",- Lots of opportunities to develop and grow self / career at Forrester offered within the organization.

420,Forrester,"A job with support, growth, respect, fun, and wonderful people",2019-10-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I want to work here as long as possible. My projects excite me every day. I love my coworkers and managers, we celebrate each other's milestones and make each other laugh. My manager was so supportive during a difficult time in my life. People in general are very nice too, not to mention brilliant. I actually can't think of anyone I dislike working with. I feel respected, like I'm contributing to new, big projects with clear goals. I recognize this from the top leadership. From my POV, everyone is welcome to speak up and contribute. 

The office building is modern, open, and in a lovely location. I take walks along along Alewife brook pkwy all the time. Music is celebrated here, you often find guitar players in the main coffee break area.

I think the benefits are great and also improving.","I'm not sure what more I could want in a job. We can always work toward being less siloed, but I get a sense that this is generally known and we work to fix that."

Compensation is severely lagging the marketplace and we lose talent because of it, especially for newer roles like software and analytics."
426,Forrester,Great place to make an impact!,2019-10-01,5.0,Senior Consultant,I have been lucky throughout my career to work with some exceptional people and never has this been more accurate than at Forrester. I'm constantly challenged and supported by my peers and love that I come into work everyday and know that I'm making an impact in our clients everyday lives.,Senior leadership does not focus on consulting and sometimes it feels like they forget that we even offer consulting when speaking to high level clients.

430,Forrester,Best move ever.,2019-09-25,5.0,Director,"Great company culture, proper onboarding and learning, collaborative and openness, this is just a start. Executives truly value their employees, and it is shown by their actions, not just their words. People are hired based on company fit, not prioritised by achievements. This enables the culture to continue thriving and growing. The company has truly earned its 'Best Company to Work For' status in all sense.","As with any company, there are growing pains and integration pains but they are all handled professionally and kindly."

432,Forrester,Account Director,2019-09-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good clients, although lots are losing patience with Forrester as the research isn’t relevant to territory. Some great colleagues who are attracted initially by the perception of what Forrester do.  Nice office and location.","Really strange company. Preach one thing to clients then do the opposite internally. Sales leadership is poor. Metrics only approach, managers just go through motions and tick boxes. Very cliquey between managers, toxic and political. Good place for junior sales people as they get exposed to senior clients, but if you are senior and good at what you do then avoid this place at all costs. It will suck the life from you. Forrester, like many other companies, play the game with Glassdoor regarding reviews. Read between the lines, the clues are all there."
433,Forrester,Great place to grow - a 30 year old startup,2019-09-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"For a 30 year old company, still run by a founder, there is always the possibility that there is stagnation - NOT at Forrester!  The company is trying to be more agile and respond more to what drives our clients to succeed than what we think is best. The people and culture are something I wish I had my entire career.","working in the Cambridge HQ can be a tough commute, but once at the end of the journey, the people and challenges can make it worthwhile.

434,Forrester,"Good for the most part, but definitely lacking in positive culture",2019-09-23,3.0,Training Specialist,"Really great on the job learning from a lot of different people with really interesting professional backgrounds. My team is phenomenal to work and collaborate with on a daily basis. Overall, I'm pretty happy, but there are things that could be improved on at Forrester.","There is a lack of flexibility for work from home especially for those with long commutes. I have also noticed a lack of positive culture for working parents. The culture I have experienced is basically we work hard and get here early and leave late. And if you don't you're seen negatively. Also, it's not a great office location. The website says our Cambridge roots run deep. If that's true, why are we barely in Cambridge?"
435,Forrester,Great place to work right out of college!,2019-09-23,5.0,Researcher,"Great work life/balance, unbelievable mentoring, great community, intelligent and friendly individuals. The leadership from Research and company-wide are great and open-minded individuals. Every day I come in to work I am working on things that make me feel successful, things that are interesting and innovative, and I love the people I work with.",Starting out of college as a research associate there isn't a direct progression path/career development after a short period of time. You spend a lot of time wondering what comes next which can lead to some anxiety.  For early Research positions you have to be a self-starter and advocate for your professional growth and development or it can be difficult to progress.

Top executives truly care about their team, enterprise wide. They show this by personally attending the required orientation, starting blocks. They travel the globe to visit our offices. Remote workers are always included in corporate activities and culture through technology, in creative ways.","On some projects there can be so many Forresterites working with a client/account and it can be confusing to the client why there are so many people on the call, and what everyone's purpose is. There is some lack of clarity between certain account team roles."
439,Forrester,Valuable employee experience,2019-09-19,5.0,Manager,"The Forrester ecosystem is nuturing my professional career for years to come. I feel well-supported throughout the organization, from work-life balance to professional development.

441,Forrester,Great Company to Learn and Grow,2019-09-19,5.0,Sales Development,"I saw another review titled ""Supportive and Collaborative"" and that is undoubtedly the best way to describe the culture here.

443,Forrester,Amazing people and a culture where you will learn so much,2019-09-18,5.0,Account Manager,"Before joining Forrester, I had no tech experience, and was intimidated by the highly intellectual employee base.  However, over the course of my 5 years there, I met the most incredible people, and learned more than I could have imagined.

Trusting and respectful culture permeates across departments, with great mutual respect regardless of title or role.
Very accessible and authentic leadership.","Basic laptops and monitors.
Wish there were more social events.
Artificial organizational siloes can be constricting, though progress is being made.
Extremely high delivery expectations quarter after quarter in content marketing consulting.
Senior leadership has taken steps to grow the company, but it feels slow and not very innovative. This makes for a steady, dependable company - but it doesn't feel like the pace of a modern tech or consulting company (for better or worse)."

Flexible working conditions","The matrix style organisational structure doesn't work when the two lines of management are not aligned. The product I worked for is managed out of Head Office and there was poor alignment to local work practices and culture and an open dislike and distrust between the two managers I was supposed to be aligned to. Unless this is resolved, there will always be conflict, leading to impossible working conditions.

For a company that specialises in Customer Experience, it is alarming that there is no formal CX structure or responsibility within the organisation. Sales are definitely the focus rather than customer experience.

People are promoted on their ability to make money for the business, not necessarily for their leadership skills. There are strange leadership thinking and practices that doesn't cross cultural boundaries well.

Working for a global business means you are basically always ""on"" - 24 hour business cycle."

488,Forrester,Positive Early Career Experience,2018-10-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I initially came to Forrester as a summer intern, and was rehired as a full time employee.

My experience with my managers at Forrester has been fantastic. Forrester does a really good job of making sure managers are well trained. My manager is accessible, knowledgeable about the company, and eager to talk about my goals/struggles/general thoughts. My management experience has also been very transparent: if I ever had a problem in my job or wanted to explore other areas of the company, I know my manager would be supportive.

As a whole, the people at Forrester are so willing to invest in you. As an early career person, I have been especially impressed with how willing people (both within my team and outside of it) have been to hear my opinion in meetings, involve me on projects that interest me but don't fall into my jurisdiction, or just grab coffee and give career advice.","Forrester does so much that, as a new employee (especially one new to the ""real world""), it can take a while to fully understand what the company does as a whole, and how your role plays into that.

493,Forrester,Welcome all innovators who are ready to learn and put the work in,2018-10-01,5.0,Sales Development,"As someone with a sales background who has sold a variety of products and services across a number of industries, and for a number of companies (from office supplies, software solutions, IT product teams, life science products, to syndicated market sizing reports & subscription services), I have the perspective of someone who has experienced a range of environments, metric/KPI requirements, and customer perceptions. Hands down, working for, but more importantly, with, Forrester has been the highlight of my 7 year career of constantly looking for the next better opportunity. Here are the noteworthy differences I have come to discover during my time here:
-Micromanagement is instead replaced with  direct help (less ""what are you doing"", more ""how can we help utilize every resource at our disposal to make sure this gets done"")
-Name branding (for anyone who has worked in sales, you know how tough initial outreach is. Incredible to discover how warm every outreach is because of the  Forrester brand, experience with Forrester analysts and Forrester's respected proprietary  data and analysis methodologies).
-And, the most important factor for when I look at a new company, ability to move up, over and around. (Between our new beta program for trying out other roles, job shadowing,  weekly opportunities to learn from other departments, and intercompany events and networking opportunities, Forrester keeps you from getting bored or feeling pigeon-holed.)","It is a big company. That can be a double-edged sword. Being a big company has allowed Forrester to build their brand in the data, analysis, consulting, market intelligence and business advisory spaces.
However, being so big, with so many managers and directors who you need to convince,  has made making some internal changes move more slowly than desired at times. 
Customer obsession  is a huge focus here, but at times internal, non-customer related processes can move a bit slower due to bandwidth,  project prioritization and needing buy-in from too many people before being able to test or move forward with change."

It may be hard to navigate which  position will be the best fit for you.  Here's my take (because we love frameworks here):

- If you like to help: Customer Success, Account Management, Leadership Boards, internal roles
- If you like to sell / network: Client Executive, Account Executive
- If you like to question: Analyst, Research Associate, Consulting

Across all of these roles, you'll want to be a naturally curious person. You will be working with top companies and will need to quickly learn new industries and keep up to date on our research. 

It's a great place to work (as you can see from the other reviews), but to truly succeed and thrive at Forrester you will need to be open to learning every day.",We don't have the most cutting edge technology.
500,Forrester,Blame Game,2018-09-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I enjoy the work I do...but sales management is bad from the Chief Sales Officer down,"Lack of vision

Sales leadership has no idea what they’re doing. They’re insecure and continue to double-down on initiatives that are disjointed and don’t work. 

Sales leadership blames their high attrition on hiring people that weren’t a fit instead of realizing these sales reps were over-promised on sales commissions, under paid (hourly in the Nashville office), over-worked (Nashville hourly reps are told they can’t log overtime but are expected to work nights and weekends to close deals at the end of the quarter), and generally treated like children instead of adults. 

If you’re used to having sales tools that will help you meet your KPI’s, don’t look to Forrester to give them to you. They’ve massively cut back on tools with the excuse of being GDPR compliant. The truth is they’re more interested in how much things cost instead of understanding the ROI of these tools (increased sales, less attrition). 

Only work at Forrester in sales if you enjoy being under-paid, over-worked, and talked to like a child. 

Work at Forrester, generally speaking, if you enjoy corporate politics where everyone is promoted because of who they’re friends with not because they earned it. Then, those people who have been promoted know they didn’t deserve it and are terribly insecure. That insecurity typically turns into a power trip where everyone else is the problem but themselves. 

I don’t know about other departments, but that’s what it’s like in sales."
501,Forrester,A great company taking bold steps for our clients,2018-09-14,5.0,Manager,"Forrester is one of the most respected B2B brands in the world but this is a company that doesn't rest on its laurels.

- Surrounded by intelligent, curious, driven colleagues
- Genuine desire to help our clients grow
- Autonomy and a workplace environment that is increasingly entrepreneurial
- A culture of constant learning & development
- On the forefront of customer experience transformation (which will continue to be the biggest challenge for companies over the next 20 years)","The good news here is that the areas of opportunity for Forrester to improve are actually doable. The root of our challenges have to do with a fundamental change that is occurring within our industry and business model. Forrester's mandate over the next 3-5 years is to disrupt the model, work differently with our clients, and grow. Cons of working at Forrester include:

- At times, there is a struggle between academic prognostication and doing real work for clients (tactical, roll-up-the-sleeves work)
- The company is still working to be more connected and less siloed. Individual product teams have a tendency to think about their domain vs. the bigger picture of helping clients achieve outcomes
- There is a lack of urgency in certain pockets of the company when our clients require speed"

503,Forrester,Great Place for Young Professionals,2018-09-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"As a young professional entering the workplace, Forrester has been an amazing place to grow and develop. The best part of this past year at Forrester has been the crazy pace at which I've been learning and picking up new skills. I've been able to take on increasing responsibility and ownership over projects, and I feel empowered by my management and my colleagues to chase innovation and improve processes. 

From day one everyone has been so warm, welcoming, and supportive. I've gained a few solid mentors and many friends. My team feels like a family and a place that I belong. The executives are also incredibly approachable and kind. To have the CFO say good morning to you by name and the CPO pull you in to ask your opinion about an initiative feels incredibly rare and special. 

It's just a fun place to come to work. I never dread going into the office because there are always fun social things to keep the day moving and people are always joking and laughing. There are events to look forward to all the time and all kinds of groups to join. 

Forrester is on the cusp of so much goodness. It's an exciting time to be at a company that is at the forefront of innovation and to be around so many incredible brains. I see huge potential for the company because of the cutting edge work led by clear foresight into the changing landscape ahead.","The concept of ""don't ask for permission, just innovate"" is not always embraced consistently across the board. 

Career mapping feels like something that I've needed to initiate mostly on my own and push for more insistently than I expected. It can sometimes feel like a struggle to even have a conversation about it and nail down any concrete goals and steps toward advancement. There are tools available which I don't think are as widely used as they could be, and there feels to be a sense of ""wait your turn"" even when taking on a lot of new work and opportunities, which feels discouraging. 

The concept that culture compensates is definitely valid, but young people especially have loans and the expense of urban living, so the discomfort that salary/market mismatch causes can distract from the positive culture and may force good talent away."

-Great at listening to employee suggestions and take it quite seriously even if they can’t make quick moves to respond","-The “corporate” part of the culture gets in the way of the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit, which slows change. It seems like people are afraid to try new things because it’s not the way that things have always been done or it needs to get checked by too many people first. It's a cautious company. 
-Would appreciate a smaller focus on “face-time”. We have great communication systems, but management still wants people in the office. There is a work smart program where you can work from home one fixed day per week after a year at the company. A bonus is that a lot of managers allow more flexibility than the policy reads.

I hear that during interviews all the time:  ""I heard you have a great culture.""..... Which really means you read that on glassdoor..?  I'll tell you what it's not in my mind - it's not happy hours and free lunch (although that does happen).

Culture to me is being treated like a professional.  I do my job, take it seriously, respect and get respect from my colleagues, laugh a lot and not looked down upon and unintelligent for it, and take on additional tasks and projects outside of my ''responsibilities ' that (hopefully) will help my team and company grow.  Sometimes that falls within the 9-5 -- most often it does not.  For that reason leadership across all teams does NOT seem to micro-manage.  They know we're working hard and in return they make it incredibly easy to work from virtually anywhere and offer flexibility to encourage us to do so.   That sense of flexibility (within reason) and culture is also sensed by our clients.  We're repeatedly told how much better we are to work with over our competitors.  The challenge now is how do we scale that to grow our business.  We need to do it, and quickly. 

Hyper focused on innovation -  techniques such as design thinking has yielded some tremendous opportunities. 
Very strategic client work allows you to stay intellectually curious.
Surrounded by competitive, intelligent colleagues
Always learning, never a sense of feeling stale.

Management seems to recognize this and willing to work with you to find balance.

No matter your title or level, if you are curious, self-initiate, and it makes sense for Forrester (obviously!) you will be supported in the endeavors you choose.

520,Forrester,Great opportunity to grow but some limitations,2018-08-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Lots of really bright people leads to great collaboration. The company culture is relatively free of politics compared with many large companies.

Employee metrics are clear. Annual bonus is based on revenue and profitability (vs. customer-impact metrics). The company is fairly customer-focused (improving each year). Great focus on innovation and creating new opportunities. Recently acquired two digital startups to accelerate Forrester's digital transformation.

Managers receive regular training and coaching. Excellent opportunity for graduates to learn about business. Opportunity to work with and influence many of the most senior executives in the world's largest companies as well as non-profits and the public sector. Offices around the world, offering opportunities to work in different countries for senior leaders. Great benefits. HR provides extensive training.

Very approachable CEO who likes to stay connected to employees.
Many employees who leave do come back.","Not as agile as a startup ... it's not a startup ... but can be agile when it wants to be.
Employees are regularly moved into new teams (and managers) by senior management without discussing with employees in advance.

Managers are rewarded for managing up, not providing leadership and coaching to their teams. Managers who manage-up get promoted, even if they provide poor leadership to their teams; meanwhile good team leaders who don't manage-up as well find it harder to get new opportunities. 

Employees are not measured on customer impact - metrics still focus on inside-out metrics like revenue earned, research produced, tasked completed.

Consulting and Research teams appear to compete for client revenue (STILL).

Employee coaching not as good as it could be - managers should focus more on helping their teams succeed and less on reacting to their own manager's demands.

Senior leaders appear to not focus on how to help employees at the bottom of the pyramid, who engage with clients daily, be more successful.

2018 Pay rises in US below inflation rate (while CEO takes millions in dividends and executive team gets huge payouts in stocks). 

Managers are quick to suggest employees own accountability ... but many managers struggle to own accountability for team performance; as a result too many managers see any failure of their team to hit their goals as a failure of individual team members, instead of a failure of their own team leadership.  This can lead to pockets of low morale around the company.

HR spends too much time/resources on managers and not enough on employees who are not managers.

Decent vacation and time off.","For starters, the pay structure is horrible. Forrester keeps half of all commissions until you hit a certain threshold and with their business being very Q4 heavy, you likely wont get paid until the end of the year. 

Poor work from home structure, not even sure why they have it in place when there are so many caveats to it.

A couple of the managers in Nashville are extremely unprofessional and gossipy. 

Product is lagging in the marketplace, however many people there have really bad little brother syndrome when they are compared to Gartner. 

Bad 401K plan, where you only are fully vested after 4 years."

535,Forrester,"Smart, hard-working, high-performing culture aimed at creating value for clients",2018-06-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at Forrester, you're surrounded by some of the smartest people there are. You can learn tons on the job just from exposure to our analysts and their research. If you want to get smarter on a topic, you can read a report, watch a webinar, or talk to an analyst. Knowledge isn't walled off, and everyone is encouraged to broaden their horizons. People at Forrester are highly collaborative, hard-working, and outcome-oriented. Even better, we don't just talk about it being the Age of the Customer, you see people live it in the customer-oriented way they do their jobs. Tools like Chatter enable even more sharing, to help teams coordinate, including highly visible shout-outs when goals are reached, milestones are achieved, or someone just does a good job at something. There's also lots of mobility in terms of job opportunities. It's not uncommon for a person to change parts of the company, say from Product to Sales or from Research to Product. Job shadowing and peer-learning are encouraged. It's a great place to work for people who like to work hard and want their work to mean something.","It can be hard to find a balance, so you have to enforce some of that on your own in order to keep from burning out. If you don't set limits (e.g., you check your email at all hours of the day and night), people will expect you to be available when you really shouldn't be. Also, the ""Worksmart"" program for remote work seems like it was designed by people who don't actually want people to work remotely. It doesn't kick in until you've been with the company for 6 months, you have to enroll in it after you get your manager's approval for the ONE set day you can work remotely, and it's not changeable except during the semi-annual open enrollment periods. It's really odd that a company that gives you tools for remote work on day 1 and that advises its clients to increase flexibility for workers has such a rigid remote work program for people who aren't 100% remote. You can generally work from home when there's bad weather or something, but that's more on an emergency basis. Every other company I've worked for, if you needed to work from home, you just notified your manager and worked from home. As long as the work got done, no one fussed. So this is a bit of a strange area for Forrester to be really inflexible."
536,Forrester,Not Sustainable - thin-skinned leadership run scared - afraid of CEO,2018-06-07,2.0,Sales,"Forrester has a wonderful heritage based on its Cambridge roots and heady days of building an exciting stable of analysts and research playbooks.  Many kind, interesting and intelligent co-workers in Research who bring a much needed calm reassurance.","Notwithstanding HR’s concerted effort to organize Glassdoor activities to encourage positive reviews, there was a growing and pervasive sense over the past 5 years that the senior leadership is stuck in a kind of Groundhog Day scenario.  Every year a new slate of senior sales / consulting leaders are introduced by George who proclaims his full support for the new and improved GTM model.  But the LT all run/act scared, united by their anxiety of what the CEO will do next.  George respects and shows a kind of doting kinship to the analysts.  Everyone else knows they are expendable which generates rampant instability and turnover that doesn’t just wreak havoc on Sales, but erodes the kind of collaboration so vital in this business.  There is a certain carpet-wearing exec whose abuse of others is legendary."

544,Forrester,A great place to work that is trying to get even better,2018-04-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall, I have enjoyed my experience working at Forrester. I've had access to new growth opportunities from the start, made good friends, and have been able to maintain an excellent work/life balance despite working in the demanding field of market research. The people here are smart, open-minded, and usually a little bit quirky, which I appreciate. It seems like everyone at Forrester has some passion that they find outside of work. The benefits are great including good vacation time, 401k, ESPP, and flexibility to work from home once a week.  I've grown substantially in my career here, and I always have felt like people have given me the chance to embrace new opportunities. I work in the Research department. 

As a company overall, I can tell that the company cares about actually improving the culture and making a better experience for employees. They're actively investing in cultural improvements and trying to be more innovative. While we still have gaps, I have faith that the executive team is trying to help us move forward.","Forrester is somewhat of a perfectionist culture, which is driven by the fact that we are full of Analysts who want to be 100% right all the time. Forrester needs to be okay with trying and failing, because failure is how you actually get stronger. That means taking more risks with our content, products, and employee offerings. We're starting to do that but I still think there's a lot the organization could do to embrace failure as a growth opportunity, rather than discard it. 

The organization needs to invest in better technology too. The PCs we receive for work are pretty terrible compared to our clients, and our backend software (like expense reporting software) is almost impossible to use, which is very frustrating. The new MSFT tools are pretty hard to use as well (especially Sharepoint, which is ridiculously hard to navigate). 

I'd also like Forrester to bring back the What It Means sessions of the earlier years. The analysts collaborate a lot, but we need to bring back these sessions to really hammer out our ideas and get back to what makes Forrester great: well-researched, vetted, courageous content."

I've found my colleagues supportive and always motivated to do what's right for the client. Pros include the ability to shape your own path,  an accessible leadership team, a real interest in developing high-potential performers, and a genuine desire to succeed. Forrester has been a great place to grow and be challenged, and rewards hard and thoughtful work with opportunity. Colleagues genuinely want to help one another succeed, even when misaligned goals can occasionally get in the way.","Forrester is a company in transition to its next phase of growth. This is great for people who like being part of a transformation; uncomfortable for people who prefer predictability. It's also a lean business model, with a lot of tough choices to be made about where resources get invested, so it's sometimes disappointing that we can't invest more in the kind of internal and external digital tools that would improve the experience for everyone."
553,Forrester,Toxic Work Environment,2018-03-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free, potable water and Herman Miller desk chairs.","There are lots of cons to working at Forrester and Leadership Boards is at the top of the list. When you start at Forrester there is a lot you will ignore and push to the side. You’ll think, “there are arrogant people in every office, right?” No, not like in Leadership Boards. People that have been there way too long have a sense of entitlement that is ENCOURAGED and REWARDED by upper management. There is a complete lack of general respect for other human beings in Leadership Boards. I was embarrassed to work on Leadership Boards. Several people from different departments told me how difficult it was to work with Leadership Boards and tried to avoid contact with the product at all costs. 

There is zero support from senior management and the recent cultural shift to career building is a farce. Unless you start in Research, there are no career growth opportunities for you. No one will care about your resume or your work experience before you got to Forrester. Compensation is extremely low, almost insulting, but many people (including me) take positions at Forrester because it is a great resume builder. My best day at Forrester was the day I left and gave an honest exit interview. I hope what I said is taken seriously, but I’m not holding my breath."

563,Forrester,"A great place to work with two major flaws but lots to love, too",2018-01-20,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I work in research at Forrester. What I enjoy most about it is the intellectual stimulation, intensity, creativity, continual learning, and the fact that we focus on not just reflecting on ideas and new data but on applying our thinking and advising clients on how to do that. The result: growth for our clients and growth for Forrester. Like any company, Forrester's got problems it needs to fix but, for me, the good outweighs the bad, with many really hard-to-find strengths, and I believe Forrester will continue learning and improve the things I call out in the ""Cons"" section below.","1. Forrester recognized, a few years ago, that we need a product management team, and formed one from scratch. That was good. But unfortunately, our C-level executives keep staffing that team (from its SVP on down) with people whose product management experience is either non-existent or negligible. Forrester could be growing much faster if that team were led and staffed by people with a more contemporary and sophisticated understanding of what product management means and requires. But the C-suite does not seem to realize there's any problem, or the growth potential we're missing out on as a result of the team's immaturity and lack of expertise. 

2. Forrester is very tight-fisted about providing employees with the tools we need to do our jobs. When we visit our clients' offices, we can't help noticing that they commonly have fast, reliable laptops with one or two large displays, for example. But Forrester skimps on those things. As a result, many employees end up spending their own money to buy a faster laptop and a large display if they can afford it, to stay productive. Those who can't afford it muddle through but it noticeably hurts their productivity and morale."

New projects are created everyday and completion demanded in unrealistic timeframes.  Lots of change- which is good, but often changing so fast that new processes aren’t tested and finalized, so we’re doing the work while rules are changing. Growing team sizes for managers means less time for the “soft skills” and an extreme focus on production at all costs- forget about quality. As someone who worked here, left, and fought my way back, it’s disappointing and demoralizing.  I’m not valued for what I bring to the job, only because I get the work done at all costs.  I couldn’t keep dropping my standards- had to leave a few months ago. Other reviews cite work life balance as great, but most on my team were working 70+ hours a week with no end in sight.

- Many companies say ""Work Hard. Play Hard."" This company actually does it. It's a great environment to feel motivated and rewarded.
- Good work/life balance. They give a lot of sick/personal leave and a good amount of PTO
- Competitive Pay
- If you like marketing, technology, and business processes as general topics, you will absolutely love the content in your day-to-day work here. 
-  They are more concerned about doing the right thing for the customer, than getting money out of them.
- Sales managers seem to all be people who have previously been extremely successful salespeople. It's nice to be able to go to them for advice and help.
- Professional atmosphere. It's not ""Stuffy"" but it's also not a ""hipster chill"" environment. Leaders understand that we spend a huge chunk of our lives at work, so it's set up to enjoy your time at work and to feel like you can be yourself.","- While there is great PTO benefits, plan on staying near your house during Christmas. There's little to no approvals for sales folks around that time. 
- It's a very long sales process and there's not a ton of opportunity. So in relation, the quotas are pretty steep. Many sales people don't have a lot of accounts right now. So there is this unfortunate situation of one good up-sell could get you sitting high, but if you lose one account... you're pretty much screwed.
- There is a TON to learn. That sounds lazy, but it's a known ""thing"" that once you join this company, you will have a LOT to learn. They do a good job of trying to make it digestible, but there is just so much that it's hard to keep track of it all. Which in turn makes it hard to focus on sales because it's so hard to connect the dots.

Lots of freedom to handle your own territory like you are your own""franchise"" within your territory.

Work/Life balance is excellent.  Though you may work late or early some days, you also have the freedom to compensate in on other days.  

For the size of Forrester, the health, vision, dental, 401K, benefits are fantastic.  They also have other benefits like continuing education, 529 Plans, even legal and life insurance discounts/contributions.","Even though sales is on an annual plan, sales management puts too much pressure on reps in any given month.  If they want us to work on a monthly or quarterly plan they should incent us to do so.

Compensation and territory planning are not down to any science.    In fact, you live off a draw for the first three months of the year as they do not have quota's determined until March.    Commissions made on sales made in January, February, and March are not paid until April.  So the first three months of the year you get a 1K per month draw no matter how much you sold.  If you do not make one sale in any of those months, you don't even get the 1K draw."

The company treats their employees well and makes a good effort to keep employees happy and engaged. It's a great place to start your career and a fairly well recognized company name for your resume.","Forrester's best days are behind them. Their product innovation is non-existent and while much of their research is valuable, their products are not relevant in today's market. Company decisions are driven by anecdotes rather than data. Which is ironic because they write plenty of research on data analytics. This is partly due to the fact that their data architecture and analytical capabilities are lagging behind more successful companies. They don't do any A/B or hypothesis testing and most decisions are made on the gut feel of the highest paid person in the room. 

If you're looking for a job with plenty of work/life balance, Forrester could be a great fit. If you're looking to work with aggressive people who will work extremely hard and push you to become better at what you do, you might want to look elsewhere. There are way too many middle/upper management employees in this company who provide little value. At Forrester the person who has been around the longest will get the promotion regardless of merit. The person who has been keeping their chair warm the longest, usually wins here. As a result they have high turnover and are way too top heavy with too few ""worker bees."" 

Lastly, they lost a star in my book because their HR department (which they call employee experience) has made such a strong push over the past year to encourage employees to leave (favorable) glassdoor reviews. I've even heard of them scheduling meetings on employee's calendars for the sole purpose of having the employee leave a review while HR is in the room. I think this defeats the purpose of an unbiased resource like glassdoor, where employees should be able to choose if they want to leave a review or not. I get that you want to have a good GD rating, but instead of focusing so many HR resources on GD reviews, focus it on improving the company. This doesn't mean more happy hours this means listen to employee feedback, listen to customer feedback, listen to your own research and you will achieve a better glassdoor rating organically."

From the challenging and thought-provoking work to the energized global workforce and the best in breed benefits, Forrester is a company that always feels like home. 

It's a place where upward mobility is a real thing, and you are given as big of a spotlight as you'd like. You'll be able to engage with the biggest thought leaders in the industry and learn on a daily basis. Opportunities are endless, as long as you are willing to put in the work for them.

This helps build a terrific culture that collaborates and enjoys working together. There is room for growth within your stack typically. Their is also excellent work/life balance here.","The direction the company is moving in is a lot like wrapping up the same bad gift in new shiny paper. The company needs to change WHAT we sell not HOW we sell it. 

Management has made it clear that unless you are in premier sales, you will not get the resources you need to be successful. The premier team will be selling in account teams of 4 while core sales is limited in the products they can sell, has to split bookings credit on some of what they do sell, and does not have a solutions partner to help map out how Forrester can help ""core clients"". 

Salary is inconsistent across the organization and some roles are severely under compensated for the market. Instead of changing salaries in markets like Boston, New York, and San Fran... we are moving roles to Nashville where labor costs are lower. This is going to cause attrition of talent in our established office locations. 

The move to Nashville, in addition to the new selling model, is effectively removing the sales ""bench"" that Forrester used to have via the ADM and SDS teams. Now these employees don't have the opportunity to move into a quota carrying role unless they move out of the Boston area (where most ADMs and SDSs are located)"

We have experts in the hottest fields, and these experts are happy to strike up a conversation with you in the elevator. There are always company activities to keep people engaged. My manager is great and is really invested in my growth and success. Things generally ""make sense"" compared to other places I've worked. The work-life balance is excellent and I value the flexibility I get to enjoy in my work: Everyone can work from home one day a week, and since our success is measured on hard metrics (number of reports you write, or advisory revenue you deliver) you're judged on the work you do and not your face time in the office. We have a devoted Chief People Officer, who takes our company culture and perks seriously. For example, the number of vacation days are generous, and I admire the new initiatives to support working moms, like paid access to Milk Stork, a service that ships breast milk when you're traveling for business.","There seems to always be change at Forrester, which can be seen as a good thing, but I think it's a bit too constant here. I feel like we don't give things enough time to see if they'll work before we scrap it and try something else. When this involves people's jobs, it's disruptive in a bad way. The top execs could be a little less risk averse when it comes to innovation investment. We repackage the existing offering instead of investing to really innovate. Health insurance costs are too high, and it and many other top places to work absorb more of the increases. But all in all, the benefits far outweigh the cons and I'm proud to work here."

Much of the focus is on growing sales but you need resources to support the sales function. Almost everyone is drowning in work.

New opportunities keep emerging -- including the chance to innovate how Forrester creates and delivers value. And to a large degree, this results from Forrester's customers. Forrester serves multiple roles in technology management (IT) and in sales and marketing -- which means the mix of customer needs constantly changes.","There is no such thing as coasting at Forrester.

If you have your sights set on another department, don't hesitate to apply!","You really have to put the effort in to challenge yourself as you settle into the position. I can say that my experience was one of a very steep learning curve followed by a very flat plateau. To continue growing, start career planning early in the process."
670,Forrester,Best Of The Best,2017-01-13,4.0,,"Working at Forrester has been the most challenging and rewarding experience of my career.  I have never worked so hard or learned so much in the time I have spent here.  The pace is fast and performance expectations are high.  This is a company whose culture revolves around rapid annual growth and which hires the absolute best talent available through an intense interview process.  When you are here, you truly feel that you are surrounded by peers that are the best of the best in their role.  It is inspiring and a little intimidating.

Most long-term Forresterites are ""Type A"" highly motivated individuals - employees without that kind of drive and attitude may find the workload and stress to be too much after a relatively short period of time.  Based on my experience, the expectation in most groups is that most people will put in 50+ hour weeks for significant chunks of the year.  The reward for this high level of expected performance is an excellent culture and very competitive compensation.

If you are genuinely a highly motivated individual, you will be in good company here.  If you are looking to be a ""cog in the machine"" somewhere and perform a typical 9-5 with nights and weekends free, it is possible that you will find more success elsewhere.

Pros:
- Excellent culture - our HR group is deeply invested in their mandate to create the best possible environment for high performance and the CEO is equally committed to that mission.

- Compensation is excellent.

- Systems & IT support are top notch - from laptops to conference room setups to IT systems, we absolutely have the tools we need to get the job done.

- The organization feels very ""flat"" in the sense that C-level executives are very available and are engaged with all employees in their organizations.  Most executives know everyone in the Cambridge office by name.","- Work/life balance is not optimal for people who are not highly motivated to work very hard.

- The relationship between groups can be adversarial - sales vs. product delivery, consulting vs. research, finance vs. budget stakeholders, etc. - it often feels like we are not on the same team as a company.  This can create a challenging political environment which requires tact and strategy to navigate successfully, and is a frustration even for the most perspicacious.

- A list of minor gripes:  In my personal opinion, the on-site cafeteria is poor, but this is not operated by Forrester.  Parking on-site costs $140/month by Cambridge law - still, something about paying to park at work rubs me the wrong way.  Employees are required to have a smartphone to log in to Forrester systems, and are expected to keep tabs on their calendars and work e-mails from their personal devices, but sub-management employees receive no cell phone reimbursement."

-Forrester can't get out of it's own way. You spend more time negotiating internally than you do with your clients and prospects. Too hard to get things done
-They are reorganizing the sales team for the third time in the past few years. Although it may help a little, they are focusing on the wrong problem. It's the product. Fix the product and sales will come back.  The CSO is great but he isn't given a lot of help when it comes to product.

- Too many research staff have no experience of working in the real world (or experience is 20+ years old)
- Challenge Thinking (MAYBE), Lead Change (NO WAY)"
689,Forrester,True to its ethos,2016-10-11,4.0,Account Manager,"If Forrester Research had a middle name, it would be 'collaborative'. Everybody brings something different to the table, but the one common characteristic that all Forresterites have is this: They're extremely supportive and more than willing to share and teach.

- The brand tag line 'Challenge Thinking. Lead Change.' Is hypocrisy at its best. 
- The company has the ability to drains the life out of even the most positive person
- The strategy and processes in certain areas are questionable at best
- Poor executive leadership. 
- George should step down and had the reins over to someone who know what they're doing. He certainly needs to adjust his attitude
- Mid management back stabs, saying one thing directly to you then something else behind your back, even when you are a peer"

Never a dull moment here either.",Sometimes slow to get everyone on the innovation bandwagon but it is improving.  The location is not the best if you are looking for easy access to lunch and after work spots.

699,Forrester,A Rewarding and Challenging Experience,2016-09-19,5.0,Analyst,"Out of all the places I have worked at in my career, Forrester is where I find myself surrounded the best and the brightest employees. When I come to work I know my colleagues are going to bring their A game and it helps me bring mine. I think what I love the most is the fact that when I leave work each day I feel intellectually stimulated and that I have accomplished something important. The reward for the hard work is being seen as a thought leader and being able to drive actionable change in the ways the world's biggest companies do business. It's certainly no easy task, but the various managers I've had over the years have enabled me to be successful at every turn.","It is true what they say, there is a lot of change, but if you're business is going to compete at a high level it needs to be able to reinvent itself as needed. Now some people don't fare too well with change, and for them they may struggle. For those that handle change well, it becomes an enabler for career growth."
700,Forrester,A place to build your career,2016-09-15,5.0,,"Forrester is a great place to work.  I'm sure most readers of this review see this a thousand times for other companies...but let me tell you why it's the case here.  I've been at the company for over 15 years and started in a junior role. I was given the opportunity to explore almost every part of the organization in various jobs and am now part of the leadership team.  What's the point you might ask?  The point is that the opportunity to grow your career here is limitless if you want to work hard and take on new challenges.  If that's of interest, then this is the place for you.

In addition, if you're looking for a place to collaborate with an incredible group of people that will result in lifelong friendships because of the culture that's fostered here, then this is the place for you.

If you enjoy working in a highly collaborative team environment where you have the permission to challenge your colleagues, and they can challenge you to come up with better end results, then this is the place for you.

I have, and continue to value my time here, the opportunities I've had and friends I've made.  As I mentioned above, Forrester is a great place to work...hopefully I've made it a little more clear why that carries weight now. :)",I'd say we are too risk averse and need to be more aggressive on new product development.

703,Forrester,Sales,2016-08-31,5.0,,"I have been employed at Forrester for almost a year now and absolutely love it. It is a great atmosphere for self-motivated employees, the management allows you to work in your own style and really does not interfere much as long as you are meeting your quotas and deadlines. The CEO George Colony is a very friendly guy, he looks everyone is the eye when they walk past and you can tell makes an honest effort to try to speak to everyone when in the elevator etc. I have worked in organizations where the CEO’s attitude is complete opposite (not wanting to make small talk to management level staff) so this is very refreshing as he sets the tone for the organization. Forrester truly seems to value its employees and also support work/life balance. You can tell from the first day of employment that Forrester's #1 priority is serving its clients and of course creating a great work environment for its employees. The people here are very intellectual and respectful to one another. One great thing is that they allow all their employees to work from home one day a week, when I started that wasn’t something I cared much about but now actually greatly value that as it breaks up my weekly commute and keeps me from feeling burnt out as I frequently used to in my last sales job – great to see they anticipate the needs of their employees! I feel very grateful to be part of this organization and would recommend it to anyone that has a strong work ethic and ownership capability.",The salary overall might be a bit under what you might see in other organizations however you have to look at the full list of employee benefits that are offered as I believe they outweigh many other organizations benefit packages.

> They tend to spread their resources pretty thin, which makes the work a bit less inflexible.
> Not that innovative.  Less prone to trial and error.  That's more industry defined then their fault.
> Comp could be better.  Part of the reason I left was significant boost in comp.

706,Forrester,"""I feel respected and valued""",2016-08-24,5.0,Senior Account Manager,"What I like most about Forrester is that they don't have to boast about their ""culture"" - it simply comes to life everyday:

- in the direct line of sight from what the CEO says and what we do
- in the leaders who ask, who listen and who act
- in the success clients achieve with our thought leadership
- in the steady stream of new, thought provoking insight and learning

722,Forrester,A Phenomenal Place To Work,2016-06-13,5.0,,"I've been an employee of Forrester for four years. 

Forrester is overflowing with individuals who are intellectually curious, enthusiastic, collaborative, committed, and respectful. Having the ability to work with these folks everyday, across the organization, is an absolute joy.  

We get to help companies make business-critical decisions on a daily basis. These companies rely on us for strategic direction, validation, clarification, and ocassionaly -- for disapproval. They expect us to challenge them, and help them make the tough call(s). The work we do is immensely satisfying. 

A spirited workforce, robust/differentiated product/services offering, and a powerful UVP -- these are the things that set Forrester apart. 

If you're looking to work in an environment that encourages you to think critically, collaborate, challenge yourself and your colleagues -- then I'd advise you to come work at Forrester.","As mentioned in previous posts  -- a complex ecosystem  and steep learning curve. However, these are only cons if you are not up to the challenge. For those who are up for it, your business acumen will skyrocket."
723,Forrester,"Interestingly stimulating, but no Work-life balance.",2016-06-03,2.0,Vice President,"Your colleagues can be some of the smartest people you will ever know, and access to the research allows anyone so inclined to continually learn.  The work can be stimulating and even fun at times.","If you work in the Research org, there is no such thing as having both work-life balance and hitting your goals.  Inconsistent goals across roles, a lack of measurement capabilities, and an overflow of administrative work without assistance make it impossible to meet or exceed your goals in less than a 60 hour work week.  Leadership across the company changes too frequently and the different organizations frequently compete rather than collaborate."
724,Forrester,Fantastic Senior Leadership Team,2016-05-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I had an excellent experience with the senior leadership team at Forrester. On my third day back as an intern the CFO, Mike Doyle remembered me from last year even though I was not a member of his department. They go out of their way to get to know everyone at the company and it is something unique about Forrester that I haven't experienced at any other company.","Nothing, my experience here has been fantastic."
725,Forrester,Still More Friendly Than Gartner,2016-05-19,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Forrester is one of the top three, so by the law of averages it's got to be pretty good. And it is.","Every analyst firm is a low-margin business, which means external market volatility creates big internal pressures to retool and reengineer. Sometimes that's gone better than others. No one does layoffs well, and Forrester breaks no new ground."
726,Forrester,Supportive and enriching environment - room to grow and learn,2016-05-16,4.0,,"- Upward mobility in many parts of the company: I came in as an (over-qualified) entry level employee and was told frankly that I was to do good work, learn, but look for the next move as the starter job wouldn't keep me interested for long. I'm happy to say that it worked out really well in my case and have recently moved internally to a new role I'm very much enjoying. I'm very aware that this was by no means guaranteed and could have ended with me leaving Forrester after only a year.
- Kind people who are eager to share wisdom and ask for yours
- Good value benefit package and tools to make the most of it
- Flexible work from home policy
- Opportunities to be coached and coach in return
- The general impression that people have lives and family outside of work and that balance is encouraged.","- I have received great coaching at Forrester, but not necessarily from my own manager; I had to seek it out.
- My original position was a newly imagined one and it became clear there was very little clarity across all of us hired in what was truly expected of us; this we had to discover for ourselves and was mostly luck of the draw; still not sure why it wasn't more organized or thoughtfully considered.
- Lower than average pay in many positions; made up for somewhat in other areas of benefits, perks, etc, but still many people are eager to discuss why compensation at Forrester is not competitive
- Very little diversity; overwhelmingly white, upper middle class workers with similar backgrounds"
727,Forrester,Awesome,2016-05-15,5.0,Analyst,Excellent interview process and excellent on-boarding and orientation process. Tons of integrity.  Lots of smart people conducting lots of research looking for ways to change the behavior of technology and marketing professionals. The hallways are full with idea exchanges. Hope to spend many more years here.,Not much to add here.
728,Forrester,A Company That Gets It,2016-05-11,5.0,,"So many companies have manufactured mission statements bolted onto their business. But at Forrester when you hear its leaders talk about the business and what differentiates the company, you get the feeling that it's a story that you can buy into. It actually makes a lot sense and makes you feel like you are part of something different and meaningful.
I continue to be impressed by quality and accessibility of the executive team, the positive influence of which is clearly manifest in nearly everyone else I come into contact with throughout the company.",Not much to complain about. Really great as far as jobs go.
729,Forrester,So glad I made the move to Forrester,2016-05-11,5.0,,"My experience is particularly great because I have a fabulous boss/team. Overall, I think the company is fantastic. The vast majority of the people I've worked with are highly intelligent, committed and professional. There are, of course, issues with technology and/or processes as with every company but the positive and collaborative approach my colleagues take to these issues is truly a breath of fresh air for me given my past experiences at other companies.","I would like to second the standing desk comment. Even though I feel I could get a doctor's note about back pain and have my boss approve it, I don't necessarily feel comfortable doing this. Can you put shared standing desks in every section of the building?"
730,Forrester,Innovative Culture & Great Place to Work,2016-05-10,5.0,,"Forrester's inspiring leaders and innovative culture fuel our workplace with opportunities to accomplish great things together.  The wealth of knowledge that comes from our analysts, data, and research ensure our company and clients stay on top of the latest industry trends and technology.  If you aspire to challenge thinking and lead BIG changes this company is a great place for you!",Nothing to share here the experience has been very positive.
731,Forrester,"A Great, Welcoming, Community",2016-05-10,5.0,,"It's been about 3 months since I joined Forrester and every single day since my first, has been, in some way or another, a joy. Don't get me wrong, there have been ups and downs, technical difficulties, and even some tricky clients. But each evening, on my hour+ commute home, I have been able to think back, and smile about the things that happened that day. Whether I think about, the great workout I had at the onsite gym, or the kick-off meeting where I learned how many strides are being taken, not only by my team, but all 1300 members of the company to be the most innovative organization out there. Or whether I think about the great lunch I had in our 'cellar', or the great conversation I had with a complete stranger while listening to others mash out on the piano and guitar during some downtime, I always think back, and enjoy my day. 

When I'm out with friends that I haven't seen in a while, and we get to talking business, I'll hear lots of, ""I work for a software company"" or, ""I work at an accounting firm."" I usually go along with the conversation, and say I work for Forrester, a Market Research firm,  but when I think about it, I don't work for a company, or a firm, or an agency - I work for and with a community of really bright, innovative people, ready that are eager to work, and that strive to try new things. To put it simply, it's really, really cool.","No cons, more of an adjustment for me here. I have worked for smaller companies my whole life where things move at an incredibly quick rate. It's just something that I have to get used to that internal changes at a major corporation take longer than at startups."
732,Forrester,Awesome company,2016-05-09,4.0,,"I really love working at Forrester. The managers and executives are genuine, good people who are there to help you and want you to succeed. Great work/life balance, excellent benefits, and really awesome employees.","The only con that I would give is the lack of standing desks.

734,Forrester,Old guard holds company back,2016-04-30,2.0,Analyst,"Brilliant people, which are far the best asset at Forrester. I made a lot of friends and continue relationships with them.","•	High attrition, no stability, unrealistic demands on analysts and sales departments. Misleading representation of positions posted and compensation presented.
•	Using research and survey material is fine, but analysts need to balance this with real-world, hands-on experiences to make informed calls. Rarely does this happen. Additionally, there is too much emphasis for analysts to sell themselves and meet consulting numbers and not enough time or resources devoted to actually doing research or POCs.
•	Innovation and bureaucracy don’t mix, and the later leads at Forrester, which moves extremely slow considering company size.
•	How can you take a company seriously when they use Google mail and Google docs?
•	Everything revolves around an inner circle of the old HQ guard, and working outside of Cambridge can be difficult--not as many company perks, and cliques are more noticeable in smaller offices. 
•	There is a serious lack of internal processes, which causes confusion and frustrations across teams and individuals. 
•	Too much change in the organization with no obvious plan
•	Sr. leadership lacks visionaries; many managers don’t know how to mentor and lead; managers treat employees differently based on their popularity; HR is useless to resolve conflict.
•	Territories need to be better defined and there is too much intergroup competition (research turf wars, consulting/research turf wars, analyst turf wars). Are we not on the same team? 
•	The different teams do not interact unless you support them so you lose the opportunity to connect the dots between the work opportunities, and the revolving door makes it even more difficult to know who’s who in the zoo. .
•	The company is primarily carried by the old guard (of whom there are too many whom reign supreme in the old boy’s network). Same old people at the top riding out their careers (SVPs in sales and VPs in Research - nepotism). The new generation does not have much of a voice, which is desperately needed to move the company forward, Analysts are divas (especially the old guard)"

The people and culture of this organization are the life blood - the employees truly care about each other and making each other successful.  And this is the reason that I have stayed as long as I have.  My colleagues inspire me to be better every day.

I've made life long friends working for Forrester and also grown as a professional and person from my time here. If you want to get into the research world you couldn't find any better place to do so, but make sure the people you'd be working with are a good fit for you personally.","The company suffers from the same caveats that any corporate culture does; the pay isn't as competitive as other companies, the culture is created by the people and the company itself doesn't know what that culture actually is, and it's a struggle to earn promotions or raises.

This is a culture of discovery, where I am always learning and always teaching. This is a place with a sense of humor and a sense of humanity. In short, Forrester’s values are my values. 

Come to Forrester to challenge yourself. Come to Forrester to grow. Come to Forrester to make an impact.",We are too risk averse; not enough product innovation.
744,Forrester,A great place to work overall,2016-03-28,4.0,Account Director,"Forrester offers a great work environment and an opportunity to always evolve as a sales professional.  In my personal experience, I've had great managers over the years who act as collaborators who truly care about your personal success as well as the success of the larger team and organization.  I'm amazed at how much I have evolved as a sales professional in this organization and 6+ years in the learning and growth continues.  Forrester sets reasonable and fair expectations, with a fair compensation model as well.  We have a great chief sales officer who gets it.  Overall it's a great place to work.","While entry level workers have lots of clear growth opportunities, it feels much harder to evolve into a new role as a senior sales executive.  Work-life balance is easier for some than others."
745,Forrester,Great Onboarding & Culture,2016-03-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The onboarding experience was great and really helped me become excited to work at the company. Met many different people from all different departments, and learned so much about the products.","No specific cons, really enjoyed my time at Forrester and felt there was a great culture in the office - made it fun to come to work each day."
746,Forrester,"Special culture, lots of opportunity",2016-03-25,5.0,Sales,"Forrester's culture is truly unique. It's a special place with smart and empathetic people who help you to be your best. It's a healthy competitive environment and as long as you achieve and over-achieve your goals, the sky is the limit. Probably the best testament to the company is the number of ""boomerangs"" who have returned after leaving. Says a lot about this place and how people feel about working here.","Forrester thrives on change. There is a lot of it. Not everyone likes change, but if you embrace it you'll love working here."
747,Forrester,A great company,2016-03-25,5.0,Sales Director,"Constant change and adaptation is what makes Forrester such a great place.  Because our job is to be on the cutting edge of business, we get to constantly learn and then teach other companies how to be ahead of the curve.  As long as you're always willing to learn and push yourself, there will be opportunities here.",Change tends to be rolled out company wide instead of trying pilot programs first
748,Forrester,"You'll be proud, but keep it real too.",2016-03-22,4.0,Service + Sales,"Reputable Brand: 
you'll have the opportunity to work with enterprise organizations and C Level Executives to directly impact and influence their strategies and business decisions!

Relationships: 
if you're sharp enough, you can build connections with both C Level clients and C Level leaders that will carry forward into your next steps and beyond. 

Solid Benefits: 
while they're not the greatest, they're not the worst in the world either. 

Work/Life: 
Excellent balance. It's not the type of 'soft culture' that doesn't produce, it's the perfect blend of work hard, play hard - which is almost impossible to draw! 

Gym: 
if you're based in their headquarters you can work out for free.

People: 
you will be surrounded by the most brilliant people! Take advantage, if you do, you'll literally feel your brain growing and your skills developing. If nothing else, SIMPLY READ THE RESEARCH! It's at your disposal and effective beyond measure. 

Mature & Healthy: 
this is how I would describe the culture.

Now, please see CONS for 360 view.","Legacy Brand: 
30+ years in business, means a lot of baggage. Legacy systems, carry legacy process and legacy leader (singular) which slows everything down. The remedy is answered with band aids or poor executive strategies and / or decision making  (i.e. Roleview-- lack of vertical concentration, you can have both! Circa early 2000) 

Lack of innovation:
The budget isn't invested in business technology or products, why? The product is IP, analysts, it's a hard business model to sustain when leadership is disconnected or sterile.

Executive Disconnect: 
You will find 4 leaders. 1) leaders that get it but can't get it done. 2) leaders that are spread to thin to get it. 3) leaders that will never get it because they don't care to ask or collaborate. 4) they get it and they get it done (the anomaly). Because of this, goals between departments are misaligned, instead of working with one another - you'll be forced to work against one another. 

$$$: 
""People don't work here for the money."" If you're a junior employee, you'll find below market and none competitive pay due to corporate policies and need to scale. Doesn't matter if you exceed expectations or goals - you'll be capped, asked to wait, or worse required to duke it out with a fellow employee (their promotion model).

Tenure:
The company values tenure, which combats turnover but stiffens growth for none tenured. It's bureaucratic, you'll jump through hoops, you'll have to play chess, you'll have to have patience. There's a system. Whether good or bad be aware of it. If you're looking to excel quickly, to party, to eat regular free food, to see immediate resolution, agility, quick action or to negotiate pay- you want a start up environment and should stop reading now. 

Because of tenure: 
There's a heavy excess of middle management that consequently contributes very little to the overall success and growth of the business. This is not their fault. The company doesn't effectively hone, craft and develop skills outside of the sales org. But then again, is there a company out there that does? 

Transparency:
While you think you're getting a full view (publicly traded, I.E. They have to share). The truth and reality is no one calls it like it is because of a certain dictatorship. The eradicable and unqualified leadership which has been the head for far too long and is the catalyst for all success and failure, it always is. 

Lastly, singular focus on North America: 
There is a heavy focus on North America (east coast alone) and the HQ, which is a disadvantage to all those not located in that region. Or to the global solution. 

In conclusion, take a look at their stock value, if you want stagnancy, comfortability, safety - this is the place for you and that is okay because it's a great place!"

Good place to start your career.
Will teach some lessons in your career.","No career or compensation growth, make me demotivated.

Even though you perform well, you won't get a raise due to budget, but they still have budget new head counts

Low compensation then market. 

To get a raise/ promotion, playing office politics is the only way."
750,Forrester,"It's the people, stupid!",2016-03-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have now, officially, been here at Forrester 3 times longer than any other company I've ever worked for.  Why? It's the people, stupid!  Not only are the people I work with (and have worked with over the years) interesting, extraordinarily talented, and dedicated, but also curious, tenacious, and delightful to be around.  Every day I wake up feeling challenged and looking forward to what lies ahead.  Simply put, the culture at Forrester is what keeps me here and, in my humble opinion, one of the main factors that challenges us all to strive for excellence.

As an additional note: One of the greatest parts about working at Forrester, other than the culture here, is access to Senior level management.  I've worked at a lot of companies where the Senior and Exec level management was completely cut off from the rest of the org.  That is definitely not the case here.  They are approachable, and accessible which, for so many reasons, is inspiring and refreshing.","For a long time, an employee's experience here depended greatly on their manager (all other things considered equal.)   There have been great strides over the past couple of years to calibrate an employee's experience (as well as to better align managers across the board) regarding performance expectations.  So far, its seems to be making a difference.  Time will tell.

Also, historically, the pay has been lower than industry standard in some roles.  I would say that this is definitely changing as I have seen a lot of changes to the compensation modeling.

Not necessarily a con but something to note:  You definitely need to be a go-getter to succeed here.  Few of our roles have extremely specific career pathing (other than promotions within your role.)   However, if you're curious and driven, you will do well here."
751,Forrester,"Great job, great impact",2016-03-21,5.0,Senior Analyst,"This is a great place to be an analyst. We get the support we need to conduct and write great research, and the advisory engagements with clients are really exhilarating. It's fun to see your work have a real impact right away. There are hardly any unnecessary rules or procedures to bog things down.",There could be better coordination among analysts who are working on similar topics. Sometimes we end up stepping on each other's toes.
752,Forrester,Collaboration at its finest,2016-03-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have had the opportunity to grow and recently take on a new role at Forrester, which is part of what makes this company so great. I have never worked for a company that not only allows for employee growth, but genuinely encourages it so fiercely. 

The collaboration across departments to see overall company success is really unmatched here. It is not cutthroat, but rather everyone else making each other stronger to see the company and our clients' success grow.","With so many smart, insightful, and thoughtful individuals here, it's always challenging to pick the ""right"" idea or come to a commonly shared solution. It makes me as an individual to broaden my own perspective and thinking, which isn't really a ""con"" at all."
753,Forrester,Great first job for recent college grads,2016-03-20,4.0,Research Associate,"The Research Associate (RA) job is a terrific entry level position for recent college grads. RAs get to: 
-Work with 'wicked smaht' coworkers, who have years of experience and industry knowledge
-Be a helping hand in innovative research initiatives in the technology/marketing space
-Join the amazing RA community (i.e. you become good friends with your peers)
-Have a solid work-life balance","There are some cons with the RA position (it should be noted that, in my case, the pros outweigh the cons): 
-The RA experience is different from team to team; the lack of standardization can be frustrating at times. 
-Some managers struggle to coach, mentor, and manage their RAs effectively. 
-The location (in the outskirts of Cambridge) isn't ideal.
-The position requires a lot of administrative duties (something that is not necessarily highlighted by the hiring department)."
754,Forrester,It's a hike (literally through the woods),2016-03-19,3.0,,- Awesome office with an interesting product to sell. You work with people who are smart and motivated.,"- The corporate culture is lacking. They have the foundation for what you would imagine would lead to a good culture (cool office, funny room names, ping pong tables, instruments) but, because of the office location, it's almost a ""commuter school"". There's no where to go after work if you want to hang out, so everyone just goes to work and comes home, with occasional trips to the bowling alley next door."
755,Forrester,Sales leader,2016-03-18,5.0,,"Incredible, fun culture, fresh ideas for a think tank and the most interesting emerging technology ideas in the world. In my years of working at Forrester, I have found the focus on the client ,employee development and sustainable long term growth just some of the reasons to work and build a career and advance here",The appetite for acquisitions often take long to justify so it would be great to be more agile and take more risks to accelerate digital growth the next five years.
756,Forrester,Going from good to great!,2016-03-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Where to start?! Forrester is a unique blend of culture that you seldom find anywhere else. On one hand, we definitely have a high degree of traditional professionalism; on the other hand, we have the soul of a start-up. Whether it's our summer ice-cream truck stops, our down-to-earth & accessible executives, or our annual ping pong tournaments, we like to have fun and celebrate the humanity of our organization.

There's also a high degree of respect within Forrester. In a time where business ethics scandals abound and stories of discriminatory practices highlight the news, I often feel like Forrester is a bubbled Neverland. As a woman, I've never felt demeaned, mistreated, etc... As a professional, I feel respected and empowered. While Forrester isn't perfect, there's something to be said for feeling truly ""safe"" at the place you work.

I love the quirkiness of our culture and the people in it! We are some fun, interesting, smart people - it's so refreshing and invigorating to be apart of that.

And to repeat myself...the accessibility and humor of the executives blow me away! Our CFO knew my name within a week. Executives regularly poke fun at each other at company meetings. There's something completely endearing about those experiences!","Like I said, Forrester isn't perfect, though I strongly feel that it recognizes its weaknesses and are striving to improve them.

We sometimes struggle with transparency. While I feel that we are definitely more transparent than other large companies, we sometimes take longer to fluff up the truth (company to employees and person to person) than simply telling it how it is. Sometimes the fluff is devoid of any meaning at all. On a micro level, I've felt a lack of transparency when it comes to my job. I went through a team transition recently and barely knew what was happening to my role until a week before I was to ""start."" I understand that I had no role in the decision-making process, but cluing people in/being more open would have at least felt ""nicer.""

I'd like to see us become more progressive in some of our external outreach. Boston has incredible local tech networking events ((hello! future clients?), but we're never present. We're also missing a defined intern program and consistent campus recruitment, which with our standing just seems like no-brainers from an outreach, recruiting, and branding perspective."

Everyone that I met with at Forrester was smart and engaging, yet the interviews were relaxed and conversational.  

I have now been at Forrester for a couple of months and the onboarding experience has been fantastic.  Everyone from my manager to my teammates to the executives that I've had the chance to meet with has been 100% supportive and open to answering any questions that I have.  While there is a lot to learn, there is no pressure to learn it too quickly or independently.  There is a strong understanding that joining a new company can be a long and difficult process.  Everyone that I've worked with has made this a smooth process with their patience, support and encouragement.",The only con I've run into so far is that in my role there are numerous people that I work with internally on a daily or weekly basis.

Working at Forrester means helping the world's biggest brands understand their changing customers, and how they must change their business and technology strategies to keep up with the pace of customer change. Clients count on you to tell them what's next, what it means, and what to do about it.

There is a lot of opportunity for career development for those with the initiative to pursue it.  I am truly grateful for the opportunities I've been given at Forrester and look forward to many more years of challenging thinking and leading change.","Executive turnover is an albatross around the company's neck.  Each year we cycle through 1-2 executives, and with each new executive comes a reset of their function's focus, which often makes it feel like we are taking 2 steps forward and then 1 step back.  We have especially struggled with finding good, consistent marketing leadership - as we are on our 3rd CMO in 4 years, and the current CMO is probably the least effective of the bunch."
780,Forrester,Let down often,2016-02-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Strong leadership, heading in the right direction but it's a long journey ahead.  Good benefits.  Some very brilliant ppl that you get to work with.  Respected company.","Extremely demanding work.  Say goodbye to work life balance.  Comp plan is very disappointing.  Make sure you really understand when you will get your first pay checks and bonuses because it likely will be long after you anticipate them.  You will have to pay for your own travel and hotels for training and business trips.  These expenses can be very significant so know that before you go in because it has caused a great deal of distress to many new employees who weren't able to swing it.  For a company that talks about the importance of customer and employee experience they have a long way to go.  Good news is they do know about some of the problems and are trying.  Finally- commission structure has many solid people within Forrester waiting for their best new offer outside of Forrester because the comp plan is so far below the industry average.  It takes months before you know what is expected of you.  Once you find out you realize you likely won't make the targets and if you do, may not get paid much until end of year at best.  It is more than a RUDE awakening.  Good news is other companies want Forrester employees and will pay for them.  Lots of turnover as a result.  I wish someone would have better prepared me with all of this information before having to learn the hard way. You have been forewarned.  If you can take the good with the bad- it's interesting work.  (Only reason I didn't rate Compensation with 1 star is because the benefits are very solid.)"

If you thrive on change, challenge and continuous learning, come to Forrester!","All decisions are taken in Cambridge (MA) so if you are not ""in the circle"" your chances of being heard and developing your career will be limited. However, everyone has the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities and be recognized by their contribution to business (measured by the appropriate metrics), so it is a matter of working on your personal brand and delivering the deeds. 

Everyone's bonus is linked to the top-line (a good thing in my opinion) but there is a lot of pressure to achieve quarterly goals, making long-term investments more difficult. Many Managers are promoted from the ""inner circle"" and, as a consequence, do not always have the hands-on and international experience necessary to help the operational teams do their jobs better.

We are small and complex, so new recruits struggle to build their own ecosystem. The recent push to create streamlined processes and stronger on-boarding training has improved this ten-fold but there is still some way to go.

Forrester is a place that lives and breaths its brand promise (challenge thinking. Lead change.) At Forrester, you are surrounded by smart, hardworking, curious people who want to impact the lives of their clients. We also have, in my opinion, a truly great CEO - a leader who isn't afraid to 'make the call', speak truth, and who genuinely listens to his employees.","I don't consider it a negative but there is constant change here. In my opinion, that is required in today's business climate. That said, you must embrace change to thrive here."
791,Forrester,I have worked for Forrester for 5 years,2016-01-25,4.0,,"I work with very talented people, who challenge my thinking every day. My opinion and ideas are valued in such a fast pace and evolving company. Forrester is expecting high performance and allows you to push your personal boundaries to provide the best in class service to its clients.",no cons to share at this point
792,Forrester,Poor Management means Forrester has lost its way,2016-01-25,2.0,Sales,"Great value proposition and on paper at least, differentiated in the market place. Still some good analysts and sales folks doing their job well in spite of lack of quality senior leadership.",CEO has been through countless board execs and strategies but ultimately is unwilling and maybe unable to take much risk now with the company - last acquisition was in 2008? Trying (and failing) to grow double digits in revenue and at industry leading profit levels is taking its toll on employees weary of the same old lines. Europe is particularly poorly led with a real vacuum of experience and knowledge reflected in the figures.

The chance to develop as a person and the opportunity to collaborate with and learn from so many bright individuals are probably the most important ones. I get inspired every single day working with my peers. I just love this culture! 
If you ask me, the analyst job is probably one of the best in the world. You help customers make the right choices in a fast changing technology industry. Challenging their thinking is both intellectually challenging and highly gratifying: you get to discuss your ideas with some of the smartest people on this planet. How cool  is that!",Nothing major I can think of...
795,Forrester,Lots of opportunity,2016-01-21,4.0,Consulting,"Forrester has given me a tremendous set of opportunities and has encouraged me to grow personally and professionally, which I'm truly grateful for. The people are excellent and it's great to be around a group that is constantly coming up with new ideas.","There is a lot of disruptive change that goes on from year to year, from organizational changes to strategic visions. It would be nice to have some stability for more than a year at a time."
796,Forrester,Great opportunity,2016-01-21,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Forrester; I am constantly learning and surrounded by many talented and intelligent people.

It is a company of great opportunity.,"Like anywhere else, career progression can be murky at times, but the management team has made great strides at addressing this."

For the right person, it can be incredibly rewarding. We have supportive management, opportunities to work with/become thought leaders in the tech world, and the flexibility to explore new areas of research (and are often rewarded for challenging convention). Forrester has allowed me to grow in ways that no other job/advanced degree could possibly offer.","Travel can be very heavy at times, but often times it's worthwhile for the experiences offered."
798,Forrester,Walking the talk at Forrester,2016-01-14,4.0,Consultant,"Smart people. Big ideas. The flexibility to collaborate, to fail, to learn, and to ultimately succeed.

I have met some amazing people, all of whom are so willing and able to help answer questions, brainstorm ideas, and try new things.","Like all corporate entities, it has its share of corp-speak, politics and bureaucracy. It is also a company that is willing to completely remake itself; if change is hard or uncomfortable for you, this is not the place to be."
799,Forrester,Good stuff!,2016-01-07,5.0,,The best thing about Forrester is the people.  They are smart and hard working and want what's best for the company.  The office is also very nice and updated.  The free onsite gym is great if you work out.,"I would say that the location is a major con but some may think it's a pro.

Each day I have walked through the doors at Forrester, I have been intellectually challenged by my peers and my clients.  It gives me goosebumps knowing that I work with some of the best and brightest in their respective fields.  

I also love the fact that my manager focuses on the best ways to get the most out of me as an individual.  From the moment I walked in the door we set expectations and talked about how I liked to be managed and areas I want to improve on.  If that doesn't get you excited, I dont know what will!","The company has many processes in place and strict ways of doing things.  I think Forrester could be a tad more flexible in the way it operates to encourage innovation and new product offerings based on different ideas.  I am a big fan of processes from an effectiveness standpoint, but I think it stymies innovation."

Great company culture

807,Forrester,Mid Career,2015-12-11,5.0,,Recruiting experience was wonderful.  Everyone was transparent throughout the process. The culture of Forrester is very unique.  There is a great culture of collaboration and teaming with the focus of doing what's right.  Benefits are great with a wonderful work/life balance.,Please add a mentor program
808,Forrester,Open and very flexible work environment,2015-12-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Forrester nurtures a very open minded culture that fosters strong collaboration across teams and does enable to lead innovative initiatives and to shape ones job nearly as one wants (with the exception maybe of sales who have less bandwidth than other functions at Forrester). The company also offers a very flexible work environment: Working remotely is part of the  culture, which means you can decide to work at the office or from home (or from wherever else), as long as you achieve your goals, it doesn't matter to management where you are.","Forrester thrives on change so the company does evolve its strategy every year, which means your goals and what your mission is about, will tend to change as well on a regular basis. Anyone who's not keen on change wont be happy at Forrester. Forrester is also a North American company, so the culture is very much American, with its highs (very open and positive culture) and its lows (there sometimes a lack of understanding of the business oversees)."
809,Forrester,LOVE WORKING HERE,2015-12-08,5.0,Account Development Manager,"I am absolutely loving Forrester. The company's culture and the individuals that work here are all fantastic (seriously I have not met one jerk since starting here in March). The company cares a lot about its employees through a balanced work day (I've stayed here twice past 5:30pm in 10 months), and fun perks (quarterly parties, full instrument set-up in the cafe, on site gym). 

In regards to my position: I work exclusively with ad agencies under the Premiere Accounts Group. I help to engage them to use Forrester's resources and products that they have purchased, make sure they renew, and pitch some custom additional projects at extra cost throughout the year. 

It's a lot of fun to work with all these strategy teams on new projects for pitches and existing clients and align them with Forrester's research, data, and analysts. I have a fantastic manager and a fantastic team that I work with. The others that are in my position are always collaborating and helping each other out. We have weekly meetings with the whole group, with my agency group, and one-on-one with my manager.

 I've never felt so much support at a job.","While a beautiful building with great amenities, the location of the office is rough. 

It's right by Alewife station so the commute from anywhere other than Arlington, Belmont, Somerville, and parts of Watertown is hell."
810,Forrester,Love my team!,2015-12-01,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have the privilege of working with an incredibly talented, highly motivated and wonderfully fun group of people. Every day I learn something from working with this team. I also appreciate our unwavering commitment to serving our clients both internal and external and the always engaging and interesting ""product"" we sell.","Because we offer a suite of solutions to help our clients, and we do so in a collaborative sales environment -  the sales process can be a bit complex. The good news is that the we have a highly committed training team and support from the top to make the Forrester sales process easier."

812,Forrester,Research Associate Position Offers Incredible Opportunities,2015-11-24,4.0,Research Associate,"Since I agree with most of the pros already listed (especially the benefit of working with smart people), I'll try not to repeat too many and focus on the Research Associate role.

From the start I was treated like a research partner- not just an assistant. In my experiences I have always received honest feedback. I've worked with great mentors, both within and outside of my team. They worked with me to define my goals and then gave me projects that would help me achieve those goals. 

However, its important to note that capitalizing on the opportunities starts with self-motivation and taking the initiative. It can be intimidating to speak up in an environment of experts, but it can go a long way. In this role you have access to industry and business leaders; and there is a lot to learn if you are willing to start by pushing yourself.","Development and coaching do not seem to be consistent from team to team. Not having a cookie-cutter approach allows managers to coach in their preferred/best styles, but it means not all RAs receive the same level of developmental help (but  there are a lot of people at Forrester that are passionate about helping RAs in their careers- so taking initiative to seek these people out goes a long way)."
813,Forrester,Account Manager,2015-11-23,3.0,,Great People!  I enjoy working with the people in the Dallas office more than any other place I have worked.,Constant pressure.  Research not as advanced as advertised and the delivery methodology is dated.

818,Forrester,Sales,2015-10-22,4.0,,"Fantastic work environment. Autonomy on the sales teams - flexible hours for sales, but obviously the effort you put in yields higher rewards.

I get to build trust relationships with titans of industry and I get to share what my coworkers and I are learning with clients who have questions I can help them with. I'm paid fairly and feel cared for and supported as a person. What more could I ask for from my working life? It's amazing!","We're starting to stack rank analysts on readership and consulting dollars more, making it more visible, and I think that will have unintended, negative consequences as it has for Microsoft and others. Readership is a poor proxy for customer value when it comes to earning new business and renewals, and it can't capture the work people do to help their colleagues succeed in a team environment. Too much stack ranking with individual performance goals, and I'm afraid that customer experience and collaboration between employees and teams will suffer."
824,Forrester,Still Enjoy Working Here,2015-09-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wickedly smart people, always interesting opportunities. A great place to grow and learn.  You will make friends for life. Quirky yet interesting culture. People who fit here are definitely a breed apart. The cult of George is still strong.","The company has definitely become more corporate as it has matured. For people (like me) who have been there a long time, this is a shame because we used to be forward thinking and have great ideas, and a different. ""can-do"" attitude. Nowadays that original culture is being carried by the old guard (of whom there are many) but the new generation needs to bring their own mark to the table. Some changes feel like a step back (annual bonus vs quarterly, cubicle farms instead of 'pods')."

a) interested in making money
b) hoping to work for a growing company
c) looking for stability
d) unwilling to play office politics. 

Every year, and I was there for 6 in a row, there was a new strategy, a revised go-to-market, a new playbook, etc.  The constant change at Forrester prevents the company from getting anything done.  GFC should step down as CEO, and if ego prevents fully stepping away, stay on as Chairman.  

They make comp decisions based on shareholder return (not employee retention) and the ego complex - particularly at the C-Level is exhausting and counter intuitive (like GFC's blog)

Moving from hip Kendall Square to a forest at the end of the redline is akin to the Titantic hitting the iceberg.  It's been a sinking ship ever since."

856,Forrester,"Global culture, excellent work life balance",2015-06-24,4.0,Senior Account Manager,"Excellent work life balance, Great culture, Good Brand","too much re-structuring, hiring sub-par talent"
857,Forrester,Getting in your own way-perspective from a sales person,2015-06-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"There is a great cultural foundation and working environment here.  Other people have written about the location and amenities, which truly are nice.  Most people here are young, energetic, and collaborative.  Executives are approachable and willing to work with all employees if they reach out.  

The benefits are on par with what other organizations offer.  The addition of the option for local employees to work from home 1 day a week was a nice addition. Work-life balance is great here for sales people.

The Forrester brand is respected by clients and future employers and the research truly is objective.","If you are in sales, I hope you like waiting for your money. As another reviewer pointed out, you only get 50% of your commission payout until you hit 85% of your annual plan. Since the majority of the company's sales are in Q4, chances are you won't see 50% of the money you earned from January of 2015(or the first half of the year) until January of 2016!!!  That's the reality of the current situation.

Of course, this is assuming that you get to 85% of your seemingly unrealistic quota. If you are on the account management side, you are burdened with a 100% expected renewal rate(when the actual renewal rate is much lower) and a growth number of 30%+.  

What's that you say? One of Forrester's many research vision changes has eliminated coverage for a client you renewed at the beginning of the year or a new client that you just received from new business? Guess what, you're still responsible for renewing them and growing the relationship even though we are no longer writing about their technology or have an analyst that can deliver advisory around their market or help them market their product.  Seems fair right? Please add quota relief for these situations.

We're also reducing your territory size by 30%(giving you a smaller pool to sell to) and increasing your quota from last year by 11%. The three legged stool(quota, comp, territory) is now a one legged stool. You might as well flip the stool upside down and sit on that because that's how you're going to feel at the end of the year.

On the career development side? There isn't much of that happening here with the current sales training organization.  While these folks are truly nice and intelligent people, most of them have never carried a bag or trained people.  These are not the senior people that should be in place to help improve your sales organization.  You need to invest more in training and hiring experienced people to do the training.  Having an online database of stale product training examples is not investing in your employees, it's checking the box. There should be optional  monthly/quarterly classes offered by experienced sales professionals who are also experienced in training people. This will ultimately lead to better performance from sales reps and increased revenue."
858,Forrester,Great company,2015-06-14,5.0,,Forrester has a great culture! Great work/life balance,The commute can be challenging depending on where you live
859,Forrester,Caught between a rock and a hard place,2015-06-11,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Quality people at all levels of the organization. Support for work-life balance. An open environment, where communication flows up and down the chain of command.  Considering the stasis in the product set, the sales force still demonstrates energy and belief.","Product offerings are stagnant, and because of low growth and costly distractions (e.g. massive salesforce.com initiative; culture of collaboration rollout), they are underfunded and will stay stagnant.  Many in the analyst ranks complain about the frequency of change, and just want the good ‘ole days back (they're not coming back soon.)  The underground is strong in this company."
860,Forrester,Business Development Director,2015-06-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you are looking for a place with a good deal of input, this is the place for you.

The location is in a great old building in San Francisco with easy access to/from both freeways, so the commute is a breeze.  Nordstrom Rack, Bed Bath Beyond and Trader Joes right across the street, so it's easy to run errands over lunch. .","If you are at all creative don't expect to be able to use it in this job.  The levels of sign-off on contracts, even low budget, reach to the highest titles in the company bogging down response time and requiring by-th-book offers to keep the wheels in motion.  In this age of competitive media streams the ability to offer and execute creative contracts will make you a top tier solutions provider or constant inhabitant of the industry ""losers"".

The office is in a good location and the brand is known. you can learn a lot and build some contacts for your future.,"senior leadership is severely lacking, you get ahead my saying the right things, rather than doing the right things.

- Positive attitude towards clients from the majority of staff
- Friendly, supportive working environment between colleagues.","- Senior management lives in a bubble of their own making. Unclear growth strategy and confused market positioning.
- Middle management mostly OK, but a lot of political manoeuvring and clients tend to get lost in this.
- CEO did an amazing job building up the company but is no longer connected to reality. Needs to stop surrounding himself with 'yes' people and would better if he would stand aside altogether.
- Recent major layoff was a disaster, with much good talent losing their jobs and even more going soon after of their own accord. Seemed to mainly be about costs saving, but likely to have been a false economy."

872,Forrester,Research Associate,2015-04-13,2.0,Research Associate,"Decent name for a future job and the work life balance is pretty good. Forrester employs a lot of young, bright people and has some interesting opportunities to learn if you're placed on the right team.","Forrester does hire a lot of young, bright professionals to staff its research organization, though it does little to nothing with them. None of the ""opportunities"" available to a research associate are linked to merit, which encourages complacency and drives most of the junior staff to leave in the first year-18 months. The pay, as documented elsewhere, is barely more than half of the industry standard, and while everyone from the head of research to the head of human resources will tell you that it's not, it is. Many RAs wait tables, bartend or tutor in the evenings and on weekends just to be able to pay rent in a low-cost suburb of Boston or Cambridge. 

The work that RAs do is most often unrelated to research. 90% of the job within the first year is administrative, i.e. scheduling calls, running to the cafe to buy an analyst a Snapple, etc., and while there are some analysts that value the RAs that work with them, most view them as an expendable personal assistant, and exclude them from their research process. 

On a more general level, there is no connection between senior leadership and the rest of the organization. This has been commented on ad nauseam already so I won't get into detail, but when you're laying off employees and shredding their bonuses, is chartering flights to exotic locations and splurging on executive bonuses really a prudent decision?"
873,Forrester,Job Seekers Beware,2015-04-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The perception of a known local company on the resume.,"What a disappointing experience. Misleading representation of positions posted and compensation presented. Terrible management style and communication. Misrepresented office culture. The company boasts about ""being direct"" but colleagues are down right rude, unprofessional and often abusive and many act like it's normal behavior. I am a seasoned professional and I have never come across more unhappy people in my career."
874,Forrester,"Good name, but going downhill fast",2015-04-07,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Forrester is a really good name to have on your resume. As many other reviews have noted, it can be a good stepping stone to get to a better job - put in one to two years here, and then go somewhere that really respects you. The office itself is very pretty, with a modern design inside and a nice layout. Some of the employees are very nice as well; young employees band together through a sense of camaraderie. There is a gym on-site, and a lot of after-work activities designed to get people involved and make them feel welcome. And you can work from home once a week, which is nice. The work/life balance can sometimes be very nice, unless you get very particular analysts that believe you are accessible 24 hours a day.","The office is very nice on the inside, but it's in the middle of a field. In the middle of nowhere. Convenient for the higher ups that can afford to live anywhere near there, but definitely something to consider before working there. There is a parking garage on-site if you drive, although it will cost you a percentage of your already small paycheck. The biggest downside (as many people have noted) is the pay, which is beyond insulting. They say that they benchmark salaries against market value, but going in, know that you can make much more elsewhere. Much more. When you're first hired, they will play up that they'll make up for your salary in bonuses, which used to be quarterly. That has all changed, however. They say it's not to cut costs, but let's get real. We all know better. Bonuses are now annually, which is fine for the older execs who don't rely on them to live. Or pay their rent. Or buy groceries. And now, if you leave before the end of the year (as most do), you get nothing. Just the way they want it. The other half of your bonus is tied to the company performance, and, as you probably guessed, something you will never see the full percentage of. Layoffs come every January (right around they announce you won't get all of your bonus, before they send selfies from their private jet to the Bahamas with the sales teams. I wish I was making this up), in their attempt to ""streamline"" the company.

If you do go work here, just know what you're getting into. You can do better. And you will. You'll just have to grin and bear it first."
875,Forrester,Fantastic Work Environment,2015-04-06,5.0,Technology Management,"As someone who has mostly worked at small, ""scrappy"" companies, the first thing I love about Forrester is the physical environment. The office and surroundings are beautiful, eco-friendly, and well-maintained. It's just an amazingly comfortable place to spend half of your waking life. Every employee gets an identical workspace. There's no jockeying for the ""corner office"" (though the execs get to work in a glassed in area – but still in the same type of cubicle!) There is plenty of career mobility, most notably employees moving from corporate roles to analyst roles, and vice versa. I'm working on the corporate side, and find the pace of work reasonable and family friendly. 

Commuting here is easy. It's in Cambridge, but it's simple to drive here (you exit Rte. 2 right before it jams up at Alewife). It's also easy to get here on the red line if you don't mind a short walk through a beautiful nature preserve.

Maybe it's a sign of my age, but I appreciate the ""grown up"" feel of the company. We certainly have fun, but the culture is not gimmicky or immature. I feel like an adult among adults here, and it's a good feeling.","Well, if you're the kind of person who WANTS to strive for a private corner office, you won't be happy here. You also won't be happy if you like goofy startup culture or the (slim) opportunity to make a bazillion dollars in stock options. We also have a lot of silly euphemisms for things, like ""Strategic Growth"" instead of ""Human Resources"". Whatever."
876,Forrester,"Great place to work, smart people",2015-03-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you're smart, work hard, and ambitious Forrester is a great place to work.

Percentage of loathsome and offensive people is relatively low (but like all companies there are a few). The brand is relatively well regarded which opens doors to the vendor community.,"Management thinks it is really great when in reality, they are the core of the problems and lack of growth. To get on, it's all about how you fit into the ""Cambridge Clique"" - there is no real career progression for anyone other than juniors who are woefully underpaid. Over time, I managed to evolve my role, but ultimately management tend to try and keep you in a box rather than fast track your career. 
As regards the processes and practices of the firm - they are still firmly rooted in the past with abysmal internal systems. A real case of ""cobblers children"". Too often the ""how things get done around here"" is something you have to put up with."
880,Forrester,Senseless HR policies and poor leadership will destroy the company's previous great people culture.,2015-03-09,1.0,Senior Analyst,"There are a lot of great people to collaborate with. 

Pros used to be great work-life balance because the company allowed analysts - who have to travel a lot - to work from home when not on the road. Unfortunately, the current leadership seems obsessed with changing this. But, if you can land an analyst job as a home worker, it has a great work life balance. 

There is now a policy where you can request to work from home no more than 1 day a week. (A significant reduction in home working for many).

It's a great place for young people to gain experience.","Lots of travel and now that analysts also have to commute to work and lose productive time in commuting as well as traveling nights and weekends, the analyst job is really only great for young singles without a home life or people who already live near to one of the offices. (San Francisco, Dallas, DC, NYC or Cambridge in the USA). If the current ""policy"" is enforced, expect to see any analyst with a long commute to seriously look for work elsewhere. (It's one thing to take a job with a long commute knowing what you are getting into - it's another thing altogether when the policy is changed after you take a job based on working mostly from home and then they change the rules). 

The ""leadership"" team below the executive level is young, inexperienced and hyper-focused on managing up - looking after themselves and not on empowering and inspiring the talent below. There appear to be constant political battles in leadership. 

There is a culture of fear of speaking out. Leadership talks about supporting open collaboration but the ugly truth is that people are afraid of voicing any opinion that is not in line with leadership for fear of reprisals. "

If you don't reach 85% you lose that other 50% of deals that YOU CLOSED forever (legal?). Less than 60% of their entire salesforce made their plan in 2014. Those who do make that threshold don't make it until December (which makes for a long dry year financially), which means they don't see that bigger paycheck (with the other 50% owed to them) until January which means Uncle Sam takes an even bigger chunk than usual since it is your first paycheck of the year (withheld until tax time 1.5 years away).

We have people that support Peer networks yet they have little knowledge of the company the client works for.  We have people who manage service work (SU's). 
2. Innovation has stalled.  Our events business has not changed in years, we deliver the same format and sometimes the same content.  How our client access our research is the same, it's a report the client must read.  Our webinars are an analyst talking to PPT slides.  We haven't launched any new products to sell (CXi doesn't count, that was retooling an old product).

Willingness to collaborate with others is dependent on teams, whether people are meeting their goals, and the specific analysts.","Getting harder and harder to access our data and produce good research. Moving from an RA to an analyst is a tough but rewarding path. Unfortunately you are put on a lower salary path than if you've come in from outside. If you've worked your way up from being an RA, you likely will need to leave after a year or two of being an analyst/senior analyst. Luckily that's a good jump start for your career. There's a lot of travel, but if you've got a popular coverage area you can largely dictate if and when you travel (this is a pro and a con). Analysts with smaller or less popular coverage areas likely will need to travel a lot when it comes and also travel for a lot of unpaid events to get business. There's little reward for going above and beyond goals. This job requires diverse skill sets. You'll need to be able to write in the Forrester style, become an expert in a coverage area, be a strong speaker, be organized, and be able to pitch projects and advisory. Failure to do any of these could make it hard to meet your goals."

The primadonnas consider them above everyone else. There is lack of cordial professional relations within the company, too many silos to work around, tremendous pressure to generate revenues, constantly changing focus, anyone who opposes CEO's decisions is shown the door...more like a dictatorship. Senior management remain disconnected from market trends and functions at the whims and fancies of the CEO, many time ignoring what the client actually wants."

The job creates the opportunity to have C-level discussions and develop a good professional network.","General climate of condescension from management with the upper hierarchy manifesting with not speaking up the truth; 
The ""ecosystem"" as they call it turns out to be a real jungle, redundant and made baroque to say the least with a number of middle figures of doubtful value; 
Career paths are still quite blurred and promotions attributed on an uncertain basis, which leaves a lot of wiggle room for some less-than-professional middle managers to push forward their 'protegés'.
Success in this company is more than any other I've seen in the past structurally based on personal relationships - the fact of having or not a personal good relationship with an analyst might make or break your business, since they still have a great degree of freedom on deciding for whom they have time or not; 
Although there are many exceptions, working with a good deal of analysts will feel to you like turning into the agent of some tyrannic teenage pop star, so you'd better start practicing your zen."

There's a good camaraderie amongst employees who are, in general, very good, solid individuals. The amount, type, and quality of sales training was impressive. Overall, Forrester is an ethical company and is the least political one I've worked for. Its unbiased research provides good value to customers at a fair price.","Sales is a tough slog. The sales pressure is endless with no downtime. Sales persons are saddled with a lot of sales admin as the company is very lean and doesn't believe in assistants. There's a frequent turnover in sales people. In order to make their quotas, the majority of analysts take on only paid consulting engagements and have to ignore joint visits with sales to help win over potentially lucrative prospects. This puts a significant burden on the sales team and contributes to a high lost opportunity cost especially in developing markets. The company is conservative and risk-adverse whereby policy can oftentimes trump common business sense."

915,Forrester,Great company to work for but not without its challenges,2014-07-25,3.0,Account Manager,"I started Forrester as a junior sales person and have been able to develop my professional skills to a more senior role and deep dive into the technology industry in a way which would be hard in other companies. There are some really good instances of collaboration across the company and I've been very lucky to work with some really smart and passionate people who represent the ""Forrester"" that is so well-reputed. With that as well - Forrester remains a fantastic name to be able to put on your CV - and for good reason.

They've developed their UVP in the past 6 months meaning that they're able to move away from the direct comparison between Gartner and find their own footing - in the long term this is certainly the best move for them and it will be exciting to see the success that comes out of this.

There is a good career path should you prove yourself - but you've certainly got to represent your own ability and take ownership for the work you do and the next stage you want to reach. Forrester has definitely got better in the past year at making the metrics that they consider for promotion clearer to their staff.

There has also been an improvement in the culture of Forrester since hiring the new CSO. A shaky couple of years in terms of profit and staff retention, whilst never awful did create an uncertain atmosphere across regions. The new CSO has brought structure, drive and a fresh face to the way the company needs to go.","There is a poor and declining atmosphere in Europe. Whilst it's one thing to feel like the underdog, it's another thing to feel like the underachievers. This is a result of a combination of culture, leadership and investment. Europe hasn't been high performers for the past couple of years and so staff can feel like they're fighting a constant battle. There's also a lack of regional leadership which would help translate and implement some of the CSO's global imperatives.

There also doesn't seem to be a recognition that Europe literally won't be able to compete with the US' growth figures if they have less resources - whether that be analyst coverage, data or consulting abilities. The communication of this back to senior management doesn't seem to be happening effectively.

I mentioned in the pros section that collaboration is a real plus - which it is. However whilst it's present it isn't seen across the board - we are often told about the best practices, which is great in terms of inspiring us to all work like that, but there are fundamental flaws in collaboration between product and sales teams that are ignored. This means that often Forrester will stop themselves selling something because of poor communication or personalities getting in the way of taking a client-centric approach."

Company tolerates bad attitudes that are killing the culture. Again, there are a small set of employees - unfortunately, many are in management positions - who come to work each day with a dark cloud of negativity over their heads. They set a negative tone in the office.
Leadership is lost, though it seems as if things have bottomed out and are getting better. They were obsessed for a while with the stock price and profitability, and lost focus on the WHY of Forrester. That meant that career development, training/coaching opportunities were neglected.

Forrester gives people the ability to try new things with products and research.  It's a fairly entrepreneurial culture.
There is very good management training when the training budget is properly funded
The exposure to top-notch thought leadership is second to none","There is an ""old boys network"" at Forrester, although all the members are not boys. If you're in it, you will get opportunity after opportunity to try new things and advance your career.  If you're not in it, you will not get any opportunities to advance your career.  And there is no real rhyme or reason to who is in it.  It's about a club of ""buddies"" and it doesn't seem clear to anyone what the price of admission is. Another review said that the same people get cycled through the leadership positions, and that is right on.  As long as that continues, there will never be new vision, new strategies, and change that actually results in success.
The company changes way too often and quickly, mostly because the changes come at the CEO's whim.  Sometimes they turn out to be good moves and sometimes they don't - that's why there is so much constant change as the rest of the company works to adjust. 
If your career is in sales or research, there is a lot of career advancement potential but if you're in any other part of the company, there are limited options for career advancement (unless you're in the chosen group).
The company will continue to do well enough for it to continue as a great place to work, but it's on the backs of its amazing people (the analysts especially) and despite the leadership at the top, not because of it.

People don't support each other.  Many of the analysts think they know it all and while great at covering subject matter never learned out to work with people.

Strong focus on hitting personal goals keeps people focused on what's important.

Good company for career development for college grads. Excellent mix of early, mid and late career people helps blend skills, learning and cultures across generations. People who work at Forrester, young or old, are very forward looking and typically in-touch with the latest trends and gadgets.

Very bright analysts shape business thinking in the largest firms in the world. Hard working sales teams strive to do what's right for the customer. Support teams are all recognized for their contributions to success. Quarterly company awards and recognition.

At this time too many middle and senior managers don't bother discussing quarterly goals with their teams and often don't bother creating them till after the quarter. This can make goal setting an exercise in futility (wasted opportunity).

Shift from quarterly bonus to annual bonus.

Senior and middle managers are apparently not assessed on how well they lead and manage their teams - ""leadership"" seems to be a skill not well understood and practiced at Forrester.  Some of the best leaders are moved because they apparently don't manage up as well as they lead.

Other highlights include working with tech industry giants, and having Forrester on your resume to back up your street cred.","The Cambridge office location is horrible. Rely on public transportation? Good news: It's only a 10 minute walk from the end of the red line, into the woods, down a dirt path, and through a blaze of goose poop. In below freezing winter conditions you can play ""try to guess when the shuttle bus will actually show up."" Just don't wait inside -- driver does not play nice if you try to wait inside. Driving in? Unless you plan on getting there at 6 am or leaving past 7pm, you're stuck in the inevitable Alewife rotary cluster for who knows how long. The place feels like a prison because once you're there, you're isolated. 

Assh*les abound at Forrester -- most noticeably in the analyst ranks. On the bright side, you'll have some very thick skin when you come out on the other side. 

Quarterly goal structure discourages collaboration across teams because no one has time to spare for longer projects that don't fall within the predetermined goal guidelines."

981,Forrester,"Amazingly fulling work, but lack of focus and marketing support makes it hard to get things done.",2013-04-07,4.0,Research Director,"- As an analyst, you get paid to research and help clients on topics your passionate about.
- The work can be incredibly fulfilling and access to top tier press and execs is unparallel.
- A very strong promote from within culture and somewhat of a meritocracy for analysts.
- Great benefits and personal time off; but tricky to use all of the time given.
- Excited about recent leadership changes and hope we continue to hire execs from outside.","- Too many priorities that makes it difficult for research managers and their teams to focus.
- All research teams and analysts goaled but some get more marketing support than other.
- Lack of investment in the core product and website that,hampers analyst and sales performance.
- Recent sales changes have impacted company wide performance; but optimistic it's fixable.
- Lack of product marketing making it difficult for sales to sell without tapping analysts for help.

-The visibility is incredible, and we have the opportunity to influence and inform people at all levels of industry.
-Many opportunities to pursue new areas of research and engage with clients.
-Leadership team asks for and responds to candid feedback, and owns up to mistakes.
-Fantastic clients and the nature of the work makes keeping them happy a natural outcome. It's truly inspiring.","-Time management is hard. You will work very hard and the pay is only 'just enough' (but if you're in research for big money then you're in the wrong career!).
-Constant context switching in the analyst role (research, consulting, inquiry, internal) is inefficient. Needs more focus, less clutter.
-Bureaucracy can get a little out of hand. Takes months to get new research through the laborious editing process despite having fabulous people doing the editing."
984,Forrester,Great place to begin career,2013-03-20,5.0,,"Valuable exposure, learning and experience",Training can be stressful because there is so much to learn. Pretty big learning curve

-  Very difficult to get a promotion
- No talent management, no mentoring or coaching"
986,Forrester,An American company with an international presence,2013-03-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"People, very talented people to work with.
The sector/industry: dynamic and ever-changing.
It is still a small company with some kind of start-up mentality.
Forrester clients: very interesting companies engaged with Forrester.","It is still an American firm: everything is centralized and all decisions are made from the Boston headquarters, with little knowledge/input from offices outside the US.
Red-tape/hierarchy: There is little career path at Forrester. Promotions are not based on skills/expertise, but on who you know in Boston. Although there is a training department (L&D and ST), there is no succession plan, and competency benchmarks and assessments are a once-in-a-year event. Managers/HR does not leverage input for coaching/promotions.
Management/Executive team: The vast majority of managers/executives come from internal promotions at Forrester. A great individual contributor does not make a good manager. Forrester is stuck into its own world with little new and fresh blood from the outside.
Lack of coherent long-term strategy: If the strategy does not give results in 6 months' time, there will be changes and redundancies, even if Forrester proudly announces how much cash it has in the bank.
Lack of communication/collaboration among teams/regions: Decisions made at executive level are not properly and timely communicated to the field, what creates rumours and frustration.
Focus on Gartner: Forrester is always comparing itself against Gartner: in each presentation/training, Gartner is always mentioned. Forrester will do much better IF it focused on what makes the company unique."
987,Forrester,Great culture and people,2013-03-04,4.0,IT Technical,Smart people.  Great work culture.  Not too much bureaucracy.  You are often what you make of yourself.IT,Constant change.

989,Forrester,A great first step into IT....,2013-02-08,4.0,Account Executive,You get close access to key technology decision makers and industry experts.  It's fun to be hearing about technologies before they are widely adopted.,"Forrester Research is a company that is stuck.   The Management team lacks the vision to grow the company out of the same footprint that it's been in for the past 5-10 years and is losing it's place as a true market visionary.  Forrester provides a lessening level of pragmatic, actionable relevance to decision makers.  The sales compensation plan used to provide an opportunity to make good money but that changes after a run of extremely poor sales leaders and their sad thoughts around new account planning and compensation models."
990,Forrester,Excellent company in difficult tranistion,2013-02-03,4.0,Non-sales,"Excellent benefits, very comprehensive 3-day orientation (Starting Blocks) for all new employees. Company is very open to flexible schedules, working from home or remote locations. The brand recognition and reputation are excellent, even among the non-tech general public. For young people, a 2-year stint is a great place to launch a career in the industry.","The company has not been meeting its financial goals for the past year, and attrition remains high. In the past year and a half, it has lost the CIO, the COO, the CMO and the head of human resources. Many people feel that three factors are to blame: 1) the move to an empty office park on the edge of Cambridge 2) a badly designed new website 3) the role-based approach to research."

Strong brand
Excellent benefits","In sales, there's no work/life balance. If you're based out of Cambridge, you have to be at your desk every day. The office is on the outskirts of Cambridge in the middle of nowhere.

When Forrester misses revenue goals, like it has been for the past 2 years, they panic, micro-manage, re-org the sales force, and fire executives. The pressure for sales becomes  intolerable. Even when times are good, they micro manage (daily activity reports and daily call counts).

The company lacks diversity - it's primarily young, caucasian, over-achievers. 

Low salaries for the industry."

Autonomy, freedom a big company ethic with a small company mindset and a pretty happy company culture. Average tenure is high with hundreds of folk across departments having been with the company for 10+ years. A hugely respected name to build your own personal brand around. George Colony is a fabulous, inspirational CEO but could be more involved with spending time getting to know with his teams outside of head office in Cambridge, USA.","Too US-centric at time although big strides are being made and the board have finally realized the importance of EMEA and APAC. Too many radical changes introduced in 2012 for the teams to keep up with which resulted in loss of potential earnings from sales and an unusual spike in attrition. A penny pinching attitude at times to save a few thousand dollars when the real cost of losing great people runs into the hundreds of thousands in lost revenue, hiring and training."

Most of the people are really great people, and great care is taken during the interview process to ensure you will fit into that culture.","The senior management is immature and  inexperienced.  Most of them are home grown.  Change is not managed, aligned to company objectives or planned effectively.   Mission, vision, and values change frequently, and corporate objectives are not clearly communicated or quantified to help measure achievement or results.

* Lack of vertical advancement opportunities for entry level research positions. 
* Related to the point above, Forrester's expects a lot of its analysts, who produce research and deliver consulting (a differentiator for Forrester, compared to other research firms where there is more specialization). Analysts' heavy workloads demand a high level of productivity and regularly working after hours. Some analysts thrive, others flounder. This business model, which puts such a strain on the efforts of a few is difficult to scale.

Not enough accountability in most functions on the business. the company is controlled by the CEO - good bad or indifferent, its the fact you have to know.

Management in London office is an inner circle of incompetent mobber and idiots, who protect themselves towards talents to simply ""mobb away"" good people."
1023,Forrester,Interesting Work,2012-05-16,4.0,Principal Analyst,"Interesting work, Interesting clients, Great benefits, Management that listens (although may not react).","No leading edge thinking, conservative in stance.  Salaries at mid-point, unclear career progression. Incorrect balance between research and consulting. Research program could be stronger if more focused."
1024,Forrester,"Big-brand analyst firm overschedules, overloads, distracts, and disrespects talented analysts to point of exhaustion",2012-05-16,1.0,Senior Analyst,"The best reason for an industry analyst to work at Forrester Research is that it ramps up your visibility, brand, credibility, and connections in the industry, which is an asset you can definitely monetize through a range of opportunities elsewhere after you leave Forrester. Also, the pay is fine.","The chief downsides of working at Forrester Research are that it seems to be engineered to burn analysts out through continual overscheduling, overloading, distraction, marginalization, and disrespect. The management culture is dominated by a Cambridge-based clique of people who've been there forever, concoct lame company-wide themes, reorganize the place continually, focus more on sales numbers than the actual quality of published research, fail to recognize great work, promote themselves as analysts when they don't actualy do the research themselves, tend not to read the actual reports that their actual analysts publish, look down on research areas that may not be their personal favorites, skew opportunities (speaking, books, consulting, etc.) to their pet analysts, understaff the analyst teams severely, fail to respect the significant brand recognition that many analysts have gained in their respective areas, deny analysts the latitude and autonomy to define their research agendas as they see fit, and treat experienced analysts like they were lackeys."
1025,Forrester,Rewarding experience Company Politics difficult,2012-05-15,4.0,Sales,Overall experience was very good. They treat their employees fairly. The politics and unfairness of middle management at times is difficult to deal with. I certainly recommend any sales person to look into joining Forrester. It has truly helped me understand the benefits of running a world class sales operation.,As mentioned above the unfairness of middle management at times was difficult to deal with.
1026,Forrester,"Great culture, poor pay",2012-05-07,4.0,,"-Forrester is a great place to begin your career.  
-They focus on professional growth and while they try to follow processes around promotions, you will eventually get what you deserve in terms of title promotion.  
-the culture is open and generally honest
-there is a large focus on coaching and feedback","-the salary, Forrester does not give large promotions and they often bundle it with the annual merit increase so that it is of even less significance  to their bottom line (and YOUR wallet)
-the direction of the company can be confused and it seems that there may be a disagreement in upper management in terms of where the strategy is headed
-they work you to the bone!"
1027,Forrester,Not worth the stress and political BS,2012-04-30,2.0,,"Each day is different
Your colleagues are smart and your ideas are challenged
Analysts have a decent amount of support
Forrester has a great reputation in the market","No cross-role collaboration
Employees are measured very closely - a very numbers driven organization
Over-worked and under-paid
No bonus last 2 quarters
Management creates ambitious plans and lofty goals that can never be met
Not open to change - it's just the ""Forrester way""
Very HQ (Boston) centric/ focused
Hard work is is never rewarded unless it hits the bottom line
Sales will only sell analysts if they know who they are and if they brown nose them.  They are told to take sales out for drinks all of the time."

You will never get bored - subject matter for client-facing roles is very interesting and usually the hot topic of the day for the industry","While there is some top-notch talent and well-respected brilliant analysts throughout the firm, many are average run-of-the-mill analysts that can only be classified as average on their best days. 
Politics is the name of the game when you want to break into upper management - while on paper is based on your quarterly reviews, you only get promoted based on who you know.
Management appreciates those that shut up, do their work, and don't complain. Hard work and innovative thinking hardly every recognized and rewarded."
1031,Forrester,Great people - little communication,2012-04-12,3.0,Account Development Manager,"Phenomenal team spirit in the office - we have each others backs.
The feeling to actually contribute to a client's success.
A lot of freedom as long as the results are as expected.","Anyone who doesn't work in Cambridge has basically fallen off the face of the earth for senior management - they don't care, they don't disseminate information.
Pressure is applied globally to deliver against the ambitious goals but support is only really provided in the HQ.
If overall performances fall short at all, no bonus will be paid company-wide - not exactly motivating."
1032,Forrester,Recent grads - Not a good place to continue your career,2012-04-11,1.0,,"- Interesting work if you're a go-getter. Forrester is NOT a meritocracy and corporate rules incent treating everyone the same so you have to put in a lot of energy to develop yourself.
- Very good internal and external relationships. Like work caliber, there are quite a few amazing people here will realize we're all on this sinking ship together and they were great resources that I'm proud to call friends now that I've moved on.","It all trickles down from sr. management.

- Lumbering bureaucracy that has resulted in restrictive development, a sorry excuse for an  old boy's clubs (strange departures and favoritism), and laughable employee treatment/morale

- Blundering decisions - sweeping changes without visible metrics, testing, or controls

- Questionable research quality; there are gems but some of the things that get published are

- Insulting compensation/incentive structure. You're not impoverished but you will receive much more at competitors/similar positions."

Most of my co-workers have a good work/life balance but because of that, are not well compensated.   One unlisted perk is the ability to read all of our research for free.  It's rare that anyone finds the time to do so but it's a great place to learn.","Compensation is a little below average but you make for up that with great co-workers, steady revenue and a solid work-life balance.

Goals are achievable and the pay scale benefits those that overachieve; if you're not happy with the comp. plan it's probably because you are not closing business but that is true anywhere you work.","At times, middle management can forget that they too were once in your role.  There is some serious drinking of the kool aid taking place in the training between when they were a sales rep. to when they become a sales manager."
