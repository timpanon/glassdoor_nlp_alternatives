You are expected to work OT even you have an approved compassionate leave for major family tragedy and funeral. Right after your compassionate leave, they give you performance evaluation warning that's without a clear expectation and any performance KPIs so you are clueless on what went wrong.

   The reason of such performance warning is you didn't submit a deliverable during your approved leave. 

- You are expected to stay online and be next to your laptop literally 24/7, afterwork, at midnight, in the weekend, during your annual leave even during your sick leave. 

   Your manager will ""teach"" you that it's normal and part of the company culture to occupy your personal time.

- The late nights here are NOT like just 10pm, late nights are 3am and even 5am. Happen every week. The next day you have to be on time in the office. 

- They require you to work in the weekend like nothing. It's not a common practice to get back the working weekend as extra off in-lieu. You need to fight hard to gain such extra off in-lieu after full day weekend work. 

- Your planned and approved annual leave may be asked to canceled on the day of your leave, or you can be called back from your annual leave if your company needs you. 

It's not a matter of a fast-pacing environment and  workload, these are all just basic human respects."

In fact, most of the front end roles are managed by these young minds. The management values the ideas and initiatives taken and there are lots of opportunities to grow.
The company culture is fast-paced, yet relaxed. Periodic training and meetings with the management helps you know which direction you're going in. Interaction is key and the young  and vibrant atmosphere in the company motivates you to work and prove yourself.
Not to forget, the company knows how to take care of its employees. Weekly welfare, free drinks, food, a pool table, air hockey, etc only adds to the dynamism.  I have a lot of friends who work in all sorts of industries and companies. None have such facilities.","The growth here is quick and if you do well, you can reach your peak quickly.

So far I have to say the company has quite strong development team, based on my personal experience on other local technology companies(Based on the technology they use and the way they develop their own kind of frameworks and tools). 

In this company, as a developer, you will always be challenged by various issues proposed by various kind of bosses, managers and designers.","The company is growing too fast in its size and still keeping its way of management like a start up. Some of the points from management layers are not so ""making-sense"". You might be asked to pend the current job and finish another urgent large amount of work within one or two days.

Not so good compensation( in fact , compared to the long working hour). Some times I have to go to company in weekend

No english speaking in most of the team, since most of the people are from China. Basically It is a kind of traditional ""family business"" style company."
