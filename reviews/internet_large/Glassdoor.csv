0,Glassdoor,Nice company and nice people,2022-04-07,4.0,Employer Branding Specialist,"-Everyone here is very friendly and helpful
-Nice benefit
-Reasonable pay",Everything is great at this point.
1,Glassdoor,Great place to start early in your career,2022-04-02,4.0,People Coordinator,"Benefits, work-life balance, fun events, more good people than bad, professional development opportunities, and supportive culture and awesome co-workers but only if you're lucky enough to find the right people. If you're starting off in your career this is a great place to learn. Although misguided and out of touch at times, their DEI efforts are respectable and they're trying, which was great to see.","Leadership only pretends to be transparent and supportive, favoritism, lots of turnover, poor communication between departments makes your work harder than it has to be, babysitting and making sure other people do their job right, passive-aggressive/fake culture at times. Some sales leadership recently left without any opportunities lined up so that was alarming to see. Not a lot of room for growth, promotions are usually one level at a time so be prepared to wait. Unless you're a favorite- then you might get promoted within a year, maybe even 2 or 3 times."
2,Glassdoor,Best work culture is also a meritocracy,2022-04-01,5.0,Talent Acquisition Lead,"Positive & supportive work culture, emphasis on work/life balance, a true meritocracy where your performance is rewarded in realtime.","No company is perfect, but I'm hard pressed to find cons working at Glassdoor."
3,Glassdoor,Best workplace I've worked in,2022-03-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Hardworking and very kind coworkers. Also we have the option to work fully remote. They truly care about their employees,Could get busy at times but that happens at any job.
4,Glassdoor,The Way Work Should Be for Everyone,2022-03-14,5.0,Client Success Manager,"In a time when a lot of companies are trying to figure out the best way to maximize their workforce's performance by providing a better work/life balance, Glassdoor has nailed it. The people are kind and authentic which creates a warm and motivated culture. There is plenty of room for growth and lots of encouragement and support for those who wish to do so. The benefits are generous and their attention paid to health both mental and physical is on point. There is also a great sense of pride shared between everyone you work with. It is easy to look forward to going to work every day especially when you know the company you are working for values you.",Haven't come across one yet.
5,Glassdoor,I feel Lucky!,2022-03-11,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Genuinely, never in my professional career have I felt as respected and supported as I do at Glassdoor. 

Culture and Values are at the forefront of everything and if/when you ever have a concern you feel like you’re not only listened to, but action comes off the back of it. 

The people, the people, the people, the people! 

Salary and compensation is well above the industry average and work life balance is great.  

Clear and concise career development opportunities. 

Glassdoor have cracked the whole, respect your employees and they’ll stick around and fly the flag for you.","EMEA & US physical meet up, would help massively with relationship building from a distance."

Investment in new hires
My manger and team are pretty amazing","Organized but still figuring things out
Partnership with Indeed is a little wonky

there has been some hiccups in the past but this comes with any mergers and acquisitions - the best part of this is the ability to learn and grow through being challenged"
8,Glassdoor,"Change makers, movers and shakers!",2022-02-23,5.0,Enterprise Account Manager,"It's so refreshing to work at a company where your voice is truly heard. Recently, we had some challenging turn over and quota adjustments within the sales org and when we all spoke up with feedback, our leadership acted within 3 business days to make our lives better! What a true republic/democracy we have here! There is something so special about that. 

Also, our compensation packages are getting better and better. With an increase in our work/life balance ""ME Days,"" more time off for new parents, and more. I've been here for 2.5 years and am already up for a promotion! That has never happened at any other company.","We wear many hats in GTM team, so be ready to be agile and expect change a lot!"
9,Glassdoor,Seriously love working here,2022-02-22,5.0,Senior Front End Engineer,Glassdoor is an incredible place to work! The company actively listens and reacts to their employee's feedback. In the past couple years our benefits have been completely overhauled and they are currently amazing. Pay is great too. Awesome people all over the company and simply incredible work / life balance.,"Some of the technology is fairly outdated and clunky, but the teams are working hard to modernize."
10,Glassdoor,Full of opportunities if you can withstand the grind,2022-02-22,4.0,Account Manager,Overall some of the best people work at this company - great hearts and pure motives. Leadership is wiling to always meet with you if you want face time to discuss anything. Demand for our product is at an all time high right now with the great resignation shifting how employers evaluate their brand. Indeed partnership brings A LOT of opportunities. If you are ready to grind this could be an amazing adventure for you to tap into a hybrid sales career.,"Burn out is real, sadly. There is not enough headcount but that's everywhere. Quota's are high. Pay could be better - especially knowing we are under headcount by a lot. I'm easily working OT every single week - and most of my colleagues are as well."

12,Glassdoor,"The people, the work, the clients 10/10",2022-02-17,5.0,Customer Success Manager,I work with some of the BEST people at Glassdoor. Everyone is helpful and collaborative. Glassdoor have built an inclusive community with a strong culture that I'm so happy to be part of. The benefits are the best I have ever seen and the work life balance they have struck is perfect.,Glassdoor are still living as if we are in an active pandemic but things have changed (in particular in EMEA) and it's time to get us together again. Lets start collaborating in person again.
13,Glassdoor,"Resilient, Supported, Opportunities for Growth",2022-02-16,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"-Although we are WFH, the energy that the managers and my team brings everyday keeps me invested.
-There are opportunities to grow not only in your career, but as a person. The ERGs (Employee Resource Groups) have so much to offer. There are workshops about Allyship, events to celebrate cultures/LGBTQ+ pride/etc.
-Transparency and Open Door Policy: There is support and guidance at this role. You are encouraged to connect with your team, managers, and other employees. It opens up opportunities to learn more about your job and even if you are interested in learning more about other departments.",-Not being able to go into office yet. I still haven't had the full Glassdoor experience yet!
14,Glassdoor,Great team but bad manager,2022-02-07,3.0,Customer Success Manager,I loved working with my team. The snacks and lunches were great.,"-Low Pay
-Political good old boy club at CSM
-My team CSM manager was immature and lacked leadership skills."
15,Glassdoor,Great team,2022-02-07,5.0,Software Engineer,Good pay and I work on a nice team.,None I would like to speak of.
16,Glassdoor,Best Company Ever!,2022-02-01,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"The past year was like a dream. Managers and peers recognize your talent and they appreciate it. It is not just talks and corporate slogans, GD employees live their values. Your hard work won't go unnoticed. Great culture and a great place to work!",NOTHING! There isn't anything really to say.
17,Glassdoor,Transparency is Key,2022-01-28,5.0,Account Executive,Glassdoor revolutionizes the way business is conducted. They led the way with transparent goals and standards and held the rest of the market accountable. They raised the bar and kept it there.,All good things come to an end.
18,Glassdoor,Great!,2022-01-24,5.0,Product Manager,Love working here. Best experience ever.,A bit slow moving for me.
19,Glassdoor,Great People make great things,2022-01-19,5.0,Senior Systems Administrator,Getting together with a bunch of great people makes the magic happen,"The job posting market has had difficult times, this leads to rapid changes in direction by necessity"

Benefits are great
Working for a tech company","Pay could be improved
Future is uncertain"
22,Glassdoor,Glassdoor Walks the Walk,2022-01-07,5.0,Senior Manager,"Glassdoor creates a positive environment for employees to learn and grow. From leaders to individual contributors, everyone at this organization contributes to a culture of positivity, moral fiber, and transparency. I've never seen an organization more committed to maintaining its values and constantly challenging the status quo in pursuit of improvement. Leadership is very receptive to feedback and criticism and is constantly attempting to better the workplace for employees and improve the value delivered to customers. Not only does Glassdoor's leadership pursue radical goals around transparency within the products they build, but also the Company holds itself accountable to those goals within the inner workings of the organization and its internal communication.","At any organization, there is always room for improvement. At Glassdoor, I find that the biggest challenge is breaking the historical organizational mold to adapt to the new demands of a growing business. I often believe that while the organization is succeeding, the internal departmental structure is a step behind the needs of the business. In many cases Glassdoor's team structure lags behind industry competitors in terms of investing in business intelligence and data analytics resources. It seems that the Company needs to shed some of the start-up level infrastructure mentalities and transform its internal data and insights model into a more mature organization. I feel that teams often have to remain scrappy to aggregate and analyze data in order to make informed decisions when there are tried and true tools and corporate structures that work well to solve these types of problems."
23,Glassdoor,Great Company To Work For,2022-01-05,4.0,Customer Success Manager,"I absolutely love working at Glassdoor. I especially like that we are a company that doesn't just ""talk the talk"" we put in efforts to ""walk the walk"" as well. The leadership, working flexibility, culture, PTO, D&I, etc. are all aspects in which make Glassdoor great and I truly enjoy working here.","While we do have more of an extensive career growth plan, it would be nice to have more of an opportunity to grow. Barriers like ""time in seat"" really effect those who bring an extensive amount of experience to the role and almost a set back to grow like they should. Glassdoor is a place with an open door policy so I do know that the concerns have been heard and hopefully actions will be put in place for a more clear and open growth plan."
24,Glassdoor,Big company with start up culture,2022-01-04,5.0,Lead Software Engineer,"Glassdoor is a great place to work. Despite the fact that company grew up drastically since the time it was founded, the company keeps start up spirit with all advantages and disadvantages.
1. The biggest advantage of the company are people that work here. 
2. Another important advantage, at least for me, I can really make an impact on the product.
3. Our product has positive impact on people's life by helping them to find jobs and companies they like.","1. Company has start up mentality, so some process are a little bit messy and unorganized.
2. Top management is trying to do a good thing and raise a problem of diversity and inclusion, but it feels like there is more concentration on hire new people instead of making a place comfortable for existing one"
25,Glassdoor,A wonderful place to work,2022-01-04,5.0,Senior Manager,"Very nice culture, and I have enough opportunity to do what I expect in terms of the career path of a ML guy.",Nothing specific at this time
26,Glassdoor,Glassdoor,2021-12-15,3.0,Software Engineer,Good People in this company,Work a ton of hours
27,Glassdoor,Glassdoor lives it's values,2021-12-07,5.0,Enterprise Customer Success Manager,"Diversity, strong onboarding program, amazing benefits, strong work from home inclusivity, promotes from within, strong community values",I haven't found any cons yet!
28,Glassdoor,Review,2021-11-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are no pros at all,Fraud company and Too much workload
29,Glassdoor,Thankful for Engineering Leaders with soft-skills,2021-11-13,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Strong ""walking the walk"" ethic of really treating your employees well and giving them enrichment and autonomy.
- Came to work every day energized and engaged for highly complex, rewarding work with great people!
- Great opportunity to seriously level up your skills, especially on the mighty ugc team I was on.
- Genuine, honest, humble (now) and seriously talented coworkers and a truly lofty mission that always kept me motivated.
- A generally strong adjustment to fully-remote culture amid uncertainty and a great new generation of leaders.","- Previous Engineering leaders had rather poor soft skills and consistently made me feel looked down upon and inadequate while trying to do everything themselves (not always well). My rating would have been much lower in the past.
- Cultivated a ""clique"" of Engineers in the old SF office that hurt morale for MV employees, affected opportunities to work on high-visibility projects and reduced chances for promotion.
- Poor managing of expectations around career advancement.
- Some amount of knowledge/product ""siloing"".
- Product and Design can be disorganized and lack cohesive vision."
30,Glassdoor,Glassdoor is amazing,2021-11-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,they have great culture and care about employees,no cons that really jump out at you
31,Glassdoor,Low Morale in Customer Success,2021-11-07,3.0,Customer Success Manager,"1. Pay is good

2. Able to work remotely

3. Job isn't too difficult","These cons are based on my personal experience at Glassdoor:

1. Glassdoor pays employees based on the state that they live in, which I don't believe is an effective strategy. For example, all of California is considered ""Tier 1"", and all of Illinois is considered ""Tier 2"", regardless of where you live within the state. I did not see myself being at Glassdoor long-term once I realized that if I were to move, I would need to take a significant pay cut.

2. When it comes to the relationship between Glassdoor and Indeed, Indeed is clearly in the driver's seat. It was annoying to constantly hear about Indeed being blamed for something Glassdoor couldn't do, or about Indeed systems, or about Indeed Sales and CS, etc. This definitely made me question the business outlook for Glassdoor.

3. There is a blatant lack of racial diversity in leadership at Glassdoor (manager level and up). There are several CS teams that are almost completely made up of white people. This needs to change, and I believe it starts with hiring more racially diverse leaders. 

4. Glassdoor does not have the necessary data required to explicitly demonstrate a positive ROI to customers. This forces CS to resort to surface-level data points to attempt to show the value of Glassdoor and retain customers. Customers want to know how branding is helping them get more applies and hire more people, and as of now, Glassdoor is not able to clearly answer that question for their customers.

5. There is a lack of flexibility in how CS can go about doing their job. When I was there, there was a ""client engagement"" metric, which pretty much forced everyone to try to have a zoom call with each of their clients to conduct a business review. The ultimate goal is to retain and grow revenue, and there are many ways to do that aside from having a business review over zoom, and this metric limited creativity and autonomy, forcing many CS reps to waste time creating decks for clients that did not need it.

6. Morale is really low in CS and Account Management, and I believe that there will be a lot more people leaving in the near future."
32,Glassdoor,Identity crisis,2021-11-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Lean teams so it's easy to make an impact,Indeed has too much influence. Rewards are for the Execs.
33,Glassdoor,Do not work here,2021-11-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Free lunches when office was open.,"Glassdoor is not a good company to work for. In my and old colleagues experience, companies actually look down on resumes that include Glassdoor work history. 

They treat you like a number and management acts very inappropriately with their employees. I would not be surprised if this review is taken down. 

Do not work here!"
34,Glassdoor,"Great culture and work-life balance, Indeed integrations adding challenges.",2021-10-25,5.0,,"Transparent leadership, fun team, and good work life balance.",Indeed (sister company) integrations degrade the user experience (Easy Apply) and hard to get Indeed support to address issues.
35,Glassdoor,Best Company I’ve Ever Worked For,2021-10-19,5.0,Display Operations Manager,"I never felt so supported by a company and a team. This company is unreal. The benefits are great, the compensation is great, and everyone is extremely kind. Our managers are thoughtful and truly know how to lead a team. I plan to retire with this company.",I really can’t think of any cons.
36,Glassdoor,Great workplace,2021-10-18,5.0,Display Operations Coordinator,I like the company's transparency,No cons at this point in time
37,Glassdoor,"Amazing and fun people, progressive culture and a great product",2021-10-14,5.0,Senior Customer Success Manager,"The people are fun, warm, welcoming, understanding and helpful. Leadership also cares a lot and is constantly engaging with the workforce to make things happen and constantly improve.
The company is keen for people to develop and they always provide support.
The product is also fantastic and so insightful. It really helps the jobseeker as well as the employer.",Not many to be honest! Sometimes things can get busy but not all the time. That's any job.
38,Glassdoor,Love this company!,2021-09-20,5.0,Customer Sucess Manager,"Great company 
amazing people 
always looking to improve 
Managers are so helpful, motivating and feel like they really have their teams best interest in mind",Lots of change but have been open about changes and progress being made. It is challenging but definitely could be so much worse
39,Glassdoor,Good Company,2021-09-10,5.0,Software Engineer,Decent Salary and positions in the company,Minimum room for growth in the company
40,Glassdoor,Great Company to Work For,2021-09-09,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Glassdoor gave me so many opportunities to be successful and I'm glad I could grow along with the company for so many years. I've had the pleasure of working with great managers and sales counterparts over the years. It's truly a great place to work. Plus, helping people find jobs and companies they love is a very rewarding company mission.","- The product is getting stale and it's hard to keep customers excited about what's going on at Glassdoor when there isn't a whole lot being added to the platform. 

- The partnership with Indeed can be very hard to manage. We're supposed to be a client's recruiting and employer branding ""team"" but that is rarely the case.

- The layoffs last year left a bad taste in my mouth, so to say. It was hard to imagine a long term career at Glassdoor after that happened even though I wasn't laid off.

- Compensation is good but not good enough to keep top performers around."
41,Glassdoor,Great start rough finish,2021-09-08,2.0,Account Executive,Great coworkers- loved my peers,"Company shifted a lot in 3 years- seemed that people became less of a priority. I enjoyed my time but where the company is currently at, I would not recommend working here."
42,Glassdoor,Exciting Times Ahead,2021-08-24,5.0,Enterprise Account Manager,"Healthy, intentional culture that has the best aspects of a stable enterprise married with a scrappy, growing startup. Work/life balance is strongly encouraged which is table stakes as a father with a young child.

Fantastic onboarding experience. Training content is comprehensive and engaging and leaders/peers are eager to help, whether that be with questions, 1:1's, shadowing, etc.

Indeed partnership and integration has been far from smooth but both sides are finally getting their homes in order and there are tremendous opportunities for the business heading into 2022 and beyond.","Downside to the ever-evolving Indeed partnership is that there are still inefficiencies to work out, but leadership is open and aware of what needs to be improved and streamlined.

Delta variant has thrown reopening and travel plans out of the window (no fault of GD) so there's an opportunity for further transparency around future implications."
43,Glassdoor,Great company and culture!,2021-08-22,5.0,Senior Customer Success Manager,"It is only week one for me, however everyone is super welcoming, friendly, inclusive and supportive! Employee's wellbeing and work/life balance appears to be super important, which is great to see.
The 5 week remote onboarding program is very comprehensive and easy to follow. Loving the experience so far, one of the best ones I have had!",There are no cons so far.
44,Glassdoor,Great place to work,2021-08-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Nice office with decent work life balance. Salary was fair and balanced. Fast paced company. Like most tech companies. Generally enjoyed the experience.,Growing pains like most tech companies. Has a reputation for fake reviews harming normal companies with disgruntled employees. Needs to correct that image to improve reputation.

46,Glassdoor,Great company to work for!,2021-08-16,5.0,Sourcing Lead,"There are some amazing changes taking place, in the DEI space and I am glad to be here to witness them. The team is so welcoming, open and warm. Off to a great start. They truly care about their people and their well-being. Many things are in place to ensure we take care ourselves, including random well-bring days off and free medical care! I've never seen this at any major company I've worked for.","The road to complete and total diversity, equity and inclusion will take some time, across all teams. We are working to speed the full changes up."
47,Glassdoor,Great start so far!,2021-08-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I am thrilled to be approaching month 1 at Glassdoor! The interview process and onboarding have been seamless. Most of all, I have a true sense of belonging to a great company. The culture and appreciation for work/life balance are the best I have seen in the industry.","The company is going through a natural transition point in the maturity model and change management will be key to retain legacy team members who are key to the success. However, I believe the right leaders are in place to take the company through this and succeed!"
48,Glassdoor,Relaxed Work Environment,2021-08-14,5.0,Data Engineer,There is a very relaxed environment.,There are no cons based on my experiences.

I am not sure how they have managed to created such a culture of talented, sincere, and well-meaning individuals without a few falling through the cracks but they did and I am sooooooo here for it!",None that I can think of (and I actually spent time thinking). Maybe I am an outlier (most likely not but always good to account for this) but I can only speak for myself.
50,Glassdoor,6 years in and still going strong,2021-08-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's been quite a ride over the last 18 or so months, but it's really starting to feel like we've turned a corner. Growth is accelerating and momentum is building. I'm honestly feeling more energized now with our new vision and direction than I've felt in my last 6 years at Glassdoor.",Layoffs a year ago mixed with the COVID wfh situation has been a drag on morale. Looking forward to getting to see my amazing colleagues again when we're back in the office in September!

I believe in the company's mission, and I am so excited about all the great products and experiences we're creating for our B2C and B2B users. I feel like the work I do really makes a difference.","There's been a lot of turnover lately. It hasn't been on my team, so I'm not 100% clear on the cause."
55,Glassdoor,"Working with the best people, but there are short comings & not good paternal leave",2021-07-16,3.0,Enterprise Account Manager,"Glassdoor hires hands down the BEST people. My coworkers 10/10 have my back, are always willing to help, and have become some of my best friends. Every manager I have had also been wonderful. 

Covid impacted our company heavily, but our sales leadership set realistic quota goals that we could reach. As an organization, I do think that Glassdoor really does care about their employees.","There are 2 reasons that I don't envision myself at this company in the long run - 

1. Maternity leave - I was on leave this year and while out, I was told the information from our benefits that I was given was not correct. It was a very frustrating situation but in general, the parental leave benefit is really lacking. GD offers 12-14 weeks depending on your delivery. My friends at other tech companies are out for 5-6 months. 

As I am considering expanding my family, I am absolutely looking at companies that would offer more leave. It's disappointing because as a company that wants to be centered on employees, this is one area seriously lacking.

2. We recently partnered with a sister company and work closely with their employees. While there is improvement in that partnership, it feels like GD constantly got the short end of the stick. Both from a systems perspective and how we executed amongst selling teams."
56,Glassdoor,The Best Onboarding Experience!,2021-07-15,5.0,Senior Sales Manager,"I felt part of the team day 1.
This is been nothing short of a wonderful experience!",Not many medical benefits options
57,Glassdoor,Direction unclear,2021-07-15,4.0,Sales,Still a great place to work. Leadership team places a focus on making sure sales team is still happy and motivated during a year of significant change.,The back-end merger with Indeed has completely changed the business model in the past year. Glassdoor's previously nimble systems are being rolled into a much larger company.
58,Glassdoor,Glassdoor is owned by a Japanese co (Recruit Holdings) - I have firsthand knowledge that user/poster data is not safe,2021-07-15,3.0,Manager,It's a great co - or at least I thought it was - great colleagues.,"I work at Glassdoor. My colleague was asked by his manager (on request of his manager's manager, maybe coming from the CEO but I don't know for sure) to share the user data (posts made for other co's, location, browsing activity on the site, etc.) of a user/poster. The request came from Recruit Holdings (this is a Japanese company which owns Glassdoor). Someone at Recruit Holdings wanted the user/poster information (either for their own internal purposes or as a favor for a client, etc. - I don't know how the info will be used).

I always assumed Glassdoor very strictly protects it's users' data but I now have evidence this is not the case. If HQ (i.e. Recruit Holdings) pressures Glassdoor management, they will hand over user data. 

Does anyone know how I can get the word out about this? This isn't right."
59,Glassdoor,"Great company, even greater people",2021-07-08,5.0,Marketing Program Manager,"Transparent company with a focus on innovation and has D&I as a top priority in minds. Keeps employee top of mind, with many tools and accessible paths for growth within the company",Difficulty at time practicing what is being preached around D&I (but this is natural and expected as nobody has really nailed it yet). Lots of strategy shifts as of late

2. Colleagues across all levels are very friendly, caring, understanding & helpful
3. Great culture probably the best so far I've experienced in my career so far","Less innovative culture for sure as lot of manual work is done by many teams resulting in high cost , more time, less efficiency and zero skill development for future, I feel no one is looking into it or it's just being ignored where I can clearly see from my side that so much improvement can be done across so many teams, need to have more innovative culture promoting automation and scale to increase efficiency and reduce operational cost and human errors for sure."

Being treated as an adult (at times)
Nothing else","Poor senior leadership
Out of touch CEO

Poor decision making
The time to make any decision takes far too long and are reliant on Indeed to agree or work with us to make a decision.

Lots of great people, wonderful team and manager, the pay was good, great benefits, office amenities were amazing. Great desks, laptop included, etc. When we got laid off to covid, we got to keep our macbook laptop and they provided us with a 3 month severance. I mention this because I think it shows what kind of a company it is","As such a growing company, there were definitely some growing pains in terms of communication between teams/ departments. Also, glassdoor as a product has it's quirks, and due to growing pains, our support team isn't big enough to support and help out as many clients as we have. as a result, had to deal with a lot of complaints"

From my manager to my team and senior management, they have all extended so much help and have made my transition a lot more smooth. I could not have asked for a better team and manager! A great first experience so far!","The training was a bit overwhelming but then again, it was packed with a lot of information and that's a sign in the right direction suggesting that sales reps are supposed to be equipped with a lot of knowledge about Glassdoor's products. There was a lot of effort put into the onboarding process and that must be taken into consideration when judging the ""overwhelming"" aspect. Great team, great company, great manager, and no cons that outshine any of that."
69,Glassdoor,For a web designer it is very good,2021-06-21,5.0,Web Developer,"I've worked at Glassdoor for several years and the thing that really stands out for me is the people. Everyone has their heart in the right place - wanting to do the best for our users, our clients and internally for our people. People genuinely believe in the mission and the positive impact we can have on the world.

The people are also smart and driven but understand the need for time for family and out of work activities. There is a lot of respect for your personal time and I think in general Glassdoor offers a good work life balance.

I've also seen over the past few years the maturing of the company as it brings more structure (mostly for the better) to its operations. For instance, professionalizing planning with OKRs, salary benchmarking to ensure fair pay, well organized and thoughtful All Hands meetings, etc.

I recognize that the company has been through a lot of changes in recent months, not least of which was the impact of Covid. The CEO and Board's decision to let go 30% of the workforce, while very painful at the time, was the correct and responsible thing to do. It ensured the business was set up for future success and that there would be no drip-feeding of redundancies. I can see that Christian (our CEO) is deeply considerate and does not take these kind of decisions lightly. He was dealt a very tough hand of cards in recent months and has responded with courage and compassion. He feels the weight of his responsibilities and this comes through in the extent to which he makes himself vulnerable and transparent.

For a tech/product standpoint, I personally am very excited by the new strategy direction and believe we will have a lot of impactful and innovative products to bring to market.

Overall Glassdoor is a great employer and I would highly recommend it!","Every company has its cons and Glassdoor is not an exception. I think there are a few key areas that Glassdoor could improve:
- Sense of urgency: I think some areas of the org are strongly professionalized and the people act with urgency. Whereas with others it seems that follow up emails are sometimes necessary to solicit a response. This is just an example, but at times there is a 'big company' mentality whereas I believe we could have more of a startup, get stuff done approach (even if it means we mess up sometimes - better to move fast then get bogged down with bureaucracy).
- Meeting overload: sometimes what could be achieved in a well structured email is repackaged as a meeting. I would encourage us to set the bar higher before booking the time of colleagues. This isn't a big issue but you do see meetings occurring that would have been better served through an email."

- The rationale behind changes is not always clearly communicated, which leads to employee disengagement and confusion.

- There is a lack of business focus and prioritization (or, if prioritization is happening it is not being communicated effectively). This leads to a massive amount of work to be done in absolutely insane timelines.

- Burnout is rampant. 60% of our employee survey shows people are overworked. It's nice that they give us extra days off but we still come back to ton of work. Resources are lacking.

- You are asked to always do more, burnout is part of life at Glassdoor and you have to accept it that you will not have work-life balance here.

- We are losing ton of good talent, people see the writing on the wall that the future of Glassdoor is unstable.

- Lack of diversity. Leadership wants a quick fix for fixing the diversity issue but does not want to fix the underlining problems within the organization regarding bias. 
- HR is not authentic. Every interaction is fake and they just keep hiring people from their own networks creating an unauthentic groupthink situation. 
- All teams are running on fumes and employees feel so burnt out. It is not until the majority of the team quits, that they will open a backfill.

Plenty of resources to help you be successful. Company did take care of employees with severance when company did major layoffs.,Covid caused a lot of layoffs. Felt almost blindsided when 200+ of us were let go. We were told over and over that with Recruit being parent company there was plenty of cash to be able to handle the shift. Then very quickly we were told out of the blue we'd have an emergency meeting and we were given the news that we were being laid off after continuous times being told we are in great shape. It wasn't transparent. It almost felt as if Recruit took advantage of the Covid situation to do what they were probably going to do later. The whole market was affected but the transparency of being in great shape and then the big shock is what hurt.

I learned so much from my manager and director and am still in touch with many of my collegues and mentors even as we approach the 1 year mark of the massive lay off.",Transparency The company yielded this as one of the highest core values and they lied to us until the very last week before the lay off. The upper management (Christian and comrades) had extremely poor leadership during a very difficult time. It seemed like COVID was a cover up for the lay off when it's really that Glassdoor is being more absorbed into Indeed than before. It's sad because it was such a special place.

97,Glassdoor,We're talking the talk but not walking the walk...,2021-03-12,3.0,GTM,The people I've worked with are the best part of Glassdoor. I have made lifelong friends here with both peers and leaders. Some of the managers that are still with Glassdoor are the best I've seen in my career. They genuinely care about their people on both a personal and professional level and truly embody what it means to be a mentor.,"I believe we tout ourselves as the model for employee culture and support but there are some major shortcomings.

First and foremost, maternity leave. Glassdoor offers their US employees what feels like the bare minimum in terms of paid time (12 weeks). What's more, is that there is an option to extend leave with unpaid time (6 weeks) but not only is this still not competitive in terms of total time off but it creates an incredibly complex situation for your peers and manager who are left to cover your accounts. Will you come back to your former book and earning potential? That is unclear. Ultimately, you are left feeling like a burden on your teammates who have to pick up the ""slack"" of your accounts while you're gone. We need better support for not only the parents on leave but also for the teams and managers who are covering. Help us create a system that drives cooperation and doesn't seem to punish the person who is out and who may have to forego their current book of business for a few more weeks with their new baby. No new parent should have to make that choice. We have all discussed and acknowledged how COVID is driving women, especially mothers, out of the workforce at disproportionate rates. Glassdoor needs to walk the walk and step up supporting all new parents. 

Quota has come up in other reviews and it's worth repeating - it's a complete disaster. Sales quotas are re-set every quarter and distributed 45 days (yes, 45 days!) into each quarter. That means you have 45 days to find a way to hit the gap you inevitably have especially if you over-performed in the previous quarter. It is extremely challenging to work ahead and genuinely provide the client experience Glassdoor is known for when you are chasing transactions to fill a gap. Help us get back to the customer-obsessed consultants we were before this shift.

Lastly, feedback. It's asked for everywhere - GLINT surveys, review reminders, in monthly review sessions tier-wide, and I very much love that about Glassdoor but nothing seems to be done with that information. As such, we as reps are stuck in this loop where there's this illusion that our voice matters, only to have comments explained away or ultimately left on the table. If you really want our feedback, please take it and help us understand how it is driving change."

99,Glassdoor,Headed in the wrong direction,2021-03-11,1.0,Sales,"great people, at least there used to be",let go of a bunch of great employees. I think Glassdoor had great potential. Now it will most likely just get sucked up by indeed.
100,Glassdoor,Not The Same...,2021-03-09,3.0,Customer Success Manager,I made a few lifelong friends during my few years with the company. Everyone is truly committed to helping out their team members at all times. The benefits are 100% employer paid which is amazing. Compensation is pretty on par with the market and pays better than some companies in the area. Unlimited PTO is great and some added random paid days off other than holidays to let employees completely unwind. Great work/life balance and flexible working hours.,"Within the past year, the entire role of the CSM has changed for the worse. Stale product offerings that are hard to showcase ROI, also lead to redundant quarterly conversations with customers. Since CSMs are not trained consultants, it is very difficult to create change within customer base to showcase value of the products. Training for this is also very surface level, again we are not trained in Change Management or how to recreate and showcase a company's Employer Value Proposition. Depending on who your manager is can change your growth trajectory - some managers care and are highly involved in development whereas some take a back seat then come time for performance reviews, have no case to help you get promoted. Culture within the CS org is very negative due to the amount of change that has occurred within the past year. Everyone is burnt out and the employee engagement scores show how unhappy everyone is. Some true Glassdoor veterans have left the company and leadership doesn't bat an eye. In turn, they voice that if people want to go do less work at another company, then that's that person's problem. Leadership confuses being busy with mundane tasks with being challenged. Once you learn the talk tracks, the job can essentially be done with your eyes closed. Your day-to-day is full of deck making and calls which is easy but keeps you busy with the account load. There has been no real challenge to the role once you learn the basics."

The pay has also been pretty solid this fiscal year as well. Since we were projecting very low performance initially (due to changes in books, partnerships, and products), it’s been great for people to overachieve. 
There’s a true effort on leaderships side to keep the good ones around.","The limbo we sit in is caused by all the changes referenced above. We get quarterly quotas 45 days into each quarter (scary for sales people). We have to learn a new ‘process’ for something about once a week which typically breaks and has to be rebuilt.

Inclusive culture, collaborative teams, knowledgable yet down to earth people and excellent leadership makes this place 10/10. Every individual seems to be hand-picked by the hiring team and is not only capable of doing their job right but is also a great cultural fit. In spite of this rigorous hiring process, any contradicting behavior is observed within the team, immediate action is taken to resolve the conflict in the best possible way. Let's just say that there is zero tolerance to any adverse behaviors which could demotivate anyone to love their job here. The strong and empathetic leadership with great values flowing top to bottom makes this place unique. Every individual is willing to learn new things and is always excited to share their knowledge to train others. The mission to help people find the job they love starts at home and is expanded to the outside world.

I am still not 100% sure if the information was hidden from me during my interview process, or if the business needs had truly changed after I was hired.

117,Glassdoor,Seemingly progressive company with a below average maternity leave policy,2021-02-09,3.0,Sales,"Great sales culture. Lots of autonomy and flexibility to get the sale done. Reps are very relationship/consultative selling focused. It’s competitive but also collaborative. Not a lot of slime. 

Sales managers are willing to help when you need it but also don’t babysit you. The sales culture is what keeps a lot of the sales reps here. You have the opportunity to win big. 

Because I touch base on Maternity leave below, I will point out there was recently additional fertility coverage added to our benefits that was a great step in the right direction. While our Paternity leave could be longer, it’s competitive and the flexibility with timing is a nice bonus. Many companies don’t offer that flexibility.","Maternity Leave: I am writing this review specifically to draw attention to our maternity leave policy in the US. We spend an enormous amount of time and internal resources striving to be an inclusive/progressive company, stressing that we will lead the way in multiple capacities, however the bar we set for our own maternity leave is the bare minimum for local laws. I would go into detail as to why this leave policy is detrimental to the women in our US organization, but I have faith that any glassdoor leader reading this would understand why this hurts a women's professional career and personal life. So with this, I ask you to do something about it. Chat with the women of this company and discuss a better policy. Increase the length to be competitive in our industry, add in a transition plan that allows mother's to slowly come back, build a network of mentors to help support new mother's. Ensure we have proper coverage while individuals are out. Built it into our organization. It is no secret women have struggled coming back, and some have recently decided not to come back. We can not pretend to be a forward thinking company with a bare minimum plan. I don’t think this is an unreasonable ask. Our colleagues in other countries have a more robust policy simply because their laws requires it. Is that our bar? Maternity leave is something that isn’t openly talked about because our women do not want to seem non-career focused, weak, or proposing something that’s self serving. Maternity leave is not a vacation. I am asking Glassdoor to do better. Lead the way. We are approaching a new fiscal year, dust off the policy and help the women of Glassdoor. I also encourage other women to speak up who are frustrated by this policy. I can’t believe I have to resort to an anonymous review. 

Quota Creation: How rep quotas are created and the metric we use to track revenue creates a false narrative of success and is fundamentally broken. It can be really frustrating as a rep. The plan resets each quarter and disproportionally rewards reps for selling short term display. Bringing on new customers, retaining clients, and growth on renewals doesn't move the needle. The leader board is a reflection of who has accounts that purchase display (not a dig on them, good for them). The most frustrating part about this is that I'm pretty sure SOPs keeps doing this because we don't have the time or resources to put together a better methodology. It's detrimental to our long term success as a company and (silently) effects things like product adoption and client retention. 

Dumpster Fire on the Front Lines: Reps are spending an enormous amount of time trying to navigate finance / contracts / data / CMPP launch etc. with the new partnership. Customers are feeling this pain too. It doesn’t feel like there is a real strategy in place and the admin side of the job has taken over to become where we’re spending most of our time. Reps are leaving because of this and then them leaving make it even worse. Sales leadership keeps praising revenue in all hands meetings but we are crumbling here on the front lines. We are drowning."

122,Glassdoor,"Focused on the outcome, not the process",2021-01-13,3.0,People Team,"- Total benefits and compensation package is competitive. Glassdoor paid 100% health benefits premiums and offers incredible health care coverage. This was a great resource to have in the midst of a global health pandemic 
-Glassdoor swiftly made the decision to go remote and offered resources to employees to adjust to this transition, from offering home office set-up stipend and mental health resources 
-It is evident that Glassdoor hires good people. Employees and leaders are caring, kind, intelligent and innovative. People stay for the leaders and the way they make employees feel engaged and supported","I find that the cons fall under one main theme: Glassdoor is focused on the outcome goals but not building the appropriate foundations and process to get there.
-Glassdoor made the decision to quickly cut its SMB business to integrate with sister company Indeed. Reductions in force often result in unexpected process and service disruption, but some of the gaps in regard to how current SMB customers would be serviced was a miss that should have been anticipated as part of the process
- It has been widely known that Glassdoor significantly lagged in re: to D&I. The employee population asked leadership about the company's plan to address the fact that the team was very homogeneous. Action around D&I initiatives were slow until last summer's events. Since then, Glassdoor has moved towards very aggressive diverse hiring goals. While this is an amazing and needed outcome goal, without the right foundations in place, this can be perceived as a quota to meet vs. creating an inclusive environment where diverse talent can thrive 
-When it comes to building a team, Glassdoor would benefit from greater focus on coaching and development. In this area, there are two extremes: people with potential are at times pushed out rather than developed. Conversely, individuals who are not qualified for roles are given opportunities without having demonstrated the competencies required for the role"

Really important to provide people with all the information about the jobs that they are going to take. The company as a whole takes care of their employees and were early with work from home options and providing flexible options to work.,The company as a whole is still having trouble switching from start up to larger stable organization. Strategy is a moving target and there is a lingering legacy leadership with Robert and Ryan that have not let go of the company and are holding it back somewhat. Christian (CEO) is still directed by Robert and doesn't really have a handle on the new product needs. Overall the company is still very much focused on business needs to the detriment of the users. There have been many key people to leave recently and there might be more.
130,Glassdoor,"Great People, Great Benefits, Typical Corporate Flaws",2021-01-06,4.0,Lead Data Scientist,"First off, really, really great benefits, comp isn't super competitive but it's very good and I understand my compensation very well. I also really like the transparency around compensation the company just undertook. 

I love my coworkers, most people are here to do good work and collaborate. Department leadership genuinely cares when there is tension or conflict and works to improve our communication, systems or team setup to mitigate friction.

I like my day to day work, it's a good mix of foundational work like creating datasets or dashboard, and more analytic/ML work like building models or analyzing patterns. 

My manager sets me up for success and trusts me to do my job. Glassdoor takes people management seriously (at least it seems so from my team) and asks managers to really commit to being people managers. My boss cares about my career and has helped me work towards not just my Glassdoor goals but my personal career goals.

GD is also flexible on things like taking an afternoon off for a doctor's appointment or changing your working hours to fit your schedule. I'm able to block off time in the middle of the day to go grocery shopping when the stores are empty.

The Senior Director of D&I really seems to care, I like him a lot. I trust Glassdoor to work to make it a more inclusive workplace, but we have a lot way to go to be someplace that's comfortable for oft-marginalized people.","There's a limit to the flexibility. I don't have kids but I've witnessed some stress among my coworkers with kids with WFH/stay-at- home orders/daycare shutdowns. There's acknowledgement that folks may be less productive but no reduction in workload.

Deadlines seem pretty arbitrary, we end up stressed out particularly around hitting product-based deadline when it seems the deadline just comes from ""it's on the roadmap"". Based on my work experience, this is very typical in software companies, but Glassdoor is generally smart so I don't understand why we can't get over this very very typical flaw. 

Corporate leadership talks the talk about caring about our mental health during mandatory WFH but we haven't really slowed down the pace of work at all (the thing that would do the most to help us cope during a one-in-a-lifetime period of stress and sadness).

The layoffs over the summer were really sad :(."

This is also great as a sales rep, I knew everything there was about the product I was selling and I could feel good about selling it. They never asked me to lie or twist the truth. Always honesty first.","Diversity could have also been much better. The Chicago office was pretty much a monoculture. Everybody was nice, but homogenous. I was a little worried when I first started.

2. Zero transparency or executive level support. The entire executive team seems to have zero idea what is happening in the go-to-market org 
3. Continuous roadblocks to success. You’re not setting your sales reps up for success and you’re seeing people leave because they realize the workload is not sustainable.
4. Lack of diversity. I am the only POC on my team and one of the few in the entire sales org 
5. Measurement. If you expect your reps to perform, give them quotas on time and transparency into how they are built 
6. Collaboration. Properly define the roles and responsibilities between AMs/CSMs and the Indeed counterparts. It’s provides chaos internally and a poor client experience externally"
136,Glassdoor,"Right mission statement, but empty words",2020-12-09,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Glassdoor had good people sprinkled throughout, good people with good hearts, wanting to take their skills, expertise and collaboration with thought leaders and actually build a high-quality product. But only a few, and not enough.","Will make this quick.

Leadership (non-product) was a biz ops party through and through, and at times, felt a lot like you had to be ""one of the guys"" to be heard. With a basically all-White management team, and just a sprinkle of diversity across the senior-level directors does a disservice to what you guys call yourselves - an open company. 

A company with the opportunity to be the solution job seekers need, especially during these times, yet it was clear they weren't ready to sacrifice short-term growth for a long-term strategy focused on building a strong product.

Though the culture was ""open"", not once did I feel like a part of the team. It's a dog eat dog culture, all about bettering yourself and not working as a team.

Managers need to learn how to empower, mentor and provide air coverage for their teams. Being a manager isn't about taking the credit by putting yourself in the spotlight, it's about coaching and leveling up your team."

140,Glassdoor,Grateful for Glassdoor,2020-11-16,5.0,Manager,"Working at Glassdoor allows me to work a corporate job but have the fulfillment of working for a company with a great purpose. Not only do I align to the mission of our company, but I appreciate that our leadership is taking bold strides in transparency (like pay transparency), and I'm grateful that I have gotten to attend many D&I events hosted by different groups where I can take time out of my work day to learn, meet new people, hear different perspectives, and challenge myself.","It can be difficult to see how things are going to shake out in the long term given the big changes we've made recently. However, I think our leadership has done a good job of encouraging me to stay motivated in the near term until we can see further out."
141,Glassdoor,"Still a great place to work, but still some things to work on",2020-11-03,4.0,Supervisor,"The move to work from home has been awesome. The teams all the way to the execs have made the transition from working in the office to working from home pretty seamless. I also enjoy the fact that we can now work from anywhere. While I did not enjoy working from home initially, I have found myself to be just as if not more productive on most days. Along with that, allowing us the opportunity to move to different states is an awesome perk for those who want to take advantage of that. 

The stipend that was given for us to buy office supplies was clutch. I was able to buy a brand new desk that has made my home office a much more comfortable place to work. I thought the amount was more than generous and was greatly appreciated.

My team is awesome. We don't take things too seriously, but also work hard and collaboratively to get things done","I am not a fan of how slowly things move within the engineering department. This is due to the many bugs that occur on what seems to be on a daily basis with the admin side of the site. It appears that resources in the engineering department are slim and things do not get addresses as quickly as they should. It seems like there is more of an emphasis to push out new products than there is fixing our existing products. While I appreciate trying new things and trying to move forward, a lot of times the tools that we currently work with need fixing before moving on to something else. This slows down productivity for a lot of people within C&C and is frustrating to see a new product coming out when we don't even have a handle on the old ones or even something new that was already released that still might not function correctly. A lot of these things just feel like ""hurry up and wait"" situations. Hurry to push new things and then wait for them to actually work correctly. Again, this is referring to things on the admin side.

Also, I hate Workday. I would prefer a less complicated and more intuitive employee management system. I was given a small crash course on how to use this from a managerial standpoint that I still don't know how much of it works. When we are given new instructions on new things we have to do, the instructions infrequently match up with what I see in WD and don't function as the instructions say they should. Every time I have to do something new in WD, I already anticipate some sort of issue and most of the time I do end up with an issue."

from that, i've gotten back in touch with an old familiar friend. something this salty, overstayed-their-welcome individual hasn't spoken of in a while...

- 'pride' - 

pride for...
-the hours i put in
-the people i surround myself with
-in what each sale means and every dollar does
-us taking chances and risks again, not chasing competition but chasing progress
-defending free speech
-aspiring to create an inclusive society, challenging the status quo
-seeing us challenge conversations around privilege and race
-working to support gender equality and supporting gender identity

that all is in-and-of-itself worthy of my pride. i don't work here because it's easy, im proud to be here because it is hard. the result is growth. so daps n pounds to you glassdoor for going for woke, not broke, in all of the above.

some other aspects im particularly fond of:

-employee safety and wellness - we acted quickly and before many companies to move to WFH amidst a growing pandemic. since then, we've had various support groups, up-leveled communications to keep people informed, and genuine efforts (even if not perfect) to keep people engaged. I applaud the workplace experience team's efforts. 

-D&I - we're on a mission now people. our product is evolving to encompass more D&I transparency for employers and we're first on the list of companies acknowledging that we have growing to do. it's refreshing to see us admit our flaws but already be hard at work to create a safe space for all. our employee resource groups led by Jacob Little have been eye opening. i knew nothing before and through this team i've been more exposed to how i can be a socially responsible global citizen. it's in its infancy but has so much potential. 

*on the above - if you are black, latino, asian, indigenous, LGBTQ - you have allies here. we've got work to do, and we're extremely imperfect, but we've got you.","the layoff and restructure was the single most taxing and emotionally draining experience of my professional career. there is a scar tissue that i dont believe will fade. it sucked. the whole experience can go kick rocks and the mess that it created has spawned more uncertainty that is hard to navigate. however, i do believe that the time and energy spent to get through that restructure a more prosperous future.

i don't want to do that again and it's going to take me a while to get back to the output and productivity i once had. amidst all that, we struggle and continue to have an achilles heel in sales with good old fashioned communication and prioritization. what do we need to get done today, this week, this month - how are we gonna do it and who's owning it? ok. go. we have far too many internal meetings, deliberations and shifting messages. distill it down and keep it simple, especially for us on the front lines. it's been at times chaotic and other times mind numbing. the amount of problems we've had to solve for stacks miles high and people are tired.

then again we're doing something we've never had to do before; lay-off 300 people, pick up the pieces, and move the company in a new direction. it's not easy. but we did slack on the fundamentals and that slowed us down significantly.

someone once said:

“great leaders are the ones who think beyond “short term” versus “long term.” They are the ones who know that it is not about the next quarter or the next election; it is about the next generation.”

deep down though i know that despite all the frustrating and agonizing days that were this summer, they were meant to set our next generation up for something good. if you're reading this and you did something at some time to have someone's back to protect, coach, develop or counsel a colleague, direct report or peer through all of this, know you're appreciated. i speak for all of them."

For a company that prides themselves on transparency, Glassdoor handled mass layoffs extremely poorly. Glassdoor also lacks communication across teams and in general teams did not work together cohesively. Just a few weeks before laying off around 300 people in May, Glassdoor wasted everyones time by moving forward with an annual sales kick off meeting called SKO in which they reassured employees their positions are safe during the hardships of COVID-19.

I signed a contract to come to Glassdoor to be a full-time salaried employee with full benefits that exceeded anything I've seen out there. By Friday on week one over 1/3 of Glassdoor had been impacted by the change from exempt to non-exempt, meaning we would all go from salary to hourly with the most cherished benefits being stripped away from us. You can imagine how this change on day 5 after signing a contract with the same company with various promises being made changing my role completely. The lack of transparency from the top and the fact that they were still hiring while not disclosing this change was about to come down to people signing contacts that would completely change was unacceptable and a bit cruel. Glassdoor did right their wrongs in the coming weeks after the announcement and shift and I can only hope they will continue to do right by their people."
166,Glassdoor,"A lack of transparency, Indeed.",2020-08-14,2.0,Senior Customer Success Manager,"The people. Glassdoor hired some incredible people and my managers in customer success EMEA were the absolute finest managers I’ve had: open, transparent, supportive, had their team’s back every step of the way.","“I'm sorry to hear your feedback that you feel the recent layoffs were unexpected and a surprise” 

This is just an example of the responses I’ve read from the CEO and senior management to reviews left in recent weeks, after Glassdoor announced that 30% of their staff were made redundant. The responses also state that staff were warned in all hands about the negative impact to the business. I was one of those surprised and blindsided employees, but it’s interesting to see that myself and others like me should have apparently listened better in all hands meetings. This is a shame."

174,Glassdoor,Big Changes Ahead,2020-07-22,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people at Glassdoor have always been the reason I've stayed so long. I have been on a few great teams at Glassdoor and each one has been filled with encouraging, smart, and supportive people. 

Great benefits, unlimited PTO, new computers and IT has been incredibly accommodating by providing anything needed to make the transition to WFH as smooth as possible.

I am excited to hear the new focus will be around Salary Transparency, for a company that is built around transparency this has not always been the case. After I shared my salary with a member of my team, my manager asked me not to do this in the future. I am glad GD is starting to practice what we preach by embracing salary transparency.","Over the last 6 months, there has been a ton of uncertainty, with the massive layoffs and the future partnership with indeed it feels as if we have just molded to whatever indeed needs. We have switched our strategy three times in the last year and it is hard to understand what our goal as a company is long term. I am not confident that there will be a need for the Glassdoor GTM teams once we officially start partnering with Indeed and anticipate layoffs. Only time will tell."

- Leadership is transparent and empathetic when making decisions
- Awesome benefits including unlimited PTO, fully covered health insurance, cell phone reimbursement, etc.
- An industry leader in response to COVID-19 - mandatory Work from Home was enacted in early March 2020, weeks before other companies took this action. We also got to take office chairs, monitors, and other equipment home or expensed as needed.","- A lot of bumpy change. There's no doubt the past 6 months have been unprecedented, but besides macroeconomic & public health conditions, there's been a lot of internal reorganization. In many cases it felt that leaders were too quick to enact change and didn't consider the possible fallout.
- I think it speaks highly of a company that many employees have a long tenure with the company. However, there tends to be an attitude of ""we've tried that before"" or ""that didn't work before"" when folks with less tenure make recommendations. New & diverse perspectives should be sought, acknowledged, and valued.
- I wish 401k match was more in line with industry standard (full match up to 4%)"

177,Glassdoor,Great place to learn and grow,2020-07-21,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Good Benefits, great staff, diverse workforce, open to all technology (no one-size-fits -all approach)","Old technology, slow to innovate, lots of product churn and changes in direction"
178,Glassdoor,a heartbreaking ride to the finish,2020-07-21,3.0,"Manager, Account Management","I've said it once and I'll say it again: the people at Glassdoor are above-and-beyond the finest group of humans you'll ever have the pleasure to work with. They've become my mentors, my friends, my best friends, and my family. Becoming part of that extended family is one of the greatest things that ever happened to me. I can remember at my first job post-college, a more senior colleague said to me, ""You'll never find a place this good."" She was so wrong...for the most part.

The personal & professional development was also top-notch. I'm not sure I fully recognized how strong our leaders were in providing that development on a daily basis, but I grew so much in my time at Glassdoor. From Guru Ganesh sales training to Gallop Strength Finder to SKO to Management Offsites, there was always something to look forward to in order to learn & develop. We definitely took our foot off the gas a few years back with emphasizing & enforcing proper sales training which was disappointing, but the roadmap that prior enablement leads crafted for our SMB org made up for that.

Fun. It was just fun. It wasn't until the Recruit Acquisition that things started to feel different and we lost that spirit we were so famous for. BAMF, Spirit Days, team events & offsites, interactions with executives in casual environments, SMASHie Awards, etc. 

HR & Legal Teams - unfortunately, a lot of the strongest & best advocates left the company in the past few months, but our GC and team + HR rep in CHI were incredible in every way. They cared about the people and, particularly our HR rep, helped develop the personnel. I also admire the Executive team for truly wanting to know their people. This goes for Christian and Robert -- it was never scary or intimidating to approach either or provide feedback.","I will start this off by saying that I was fortunate enough to make the decision to leave Glassdoor prior to the mass layoffs. With that being said, my heart is still crushed that this was the path we (yes, I still refer to Glassdoor as 'we' because I will forever be part of it) went down. This was always the plan to reduce the SMB arm and roll it more & more under Indeed. But to completely eliminate the roles of 300 people in one fell swoop and blame it on COVID rather than plan feels like a tacky PR stunt. 

When reps that I hired, trained, and managed are reaching out in real-time as it was happening, fear in their voice because they weren't sure if they received the infamous calendar invite, and then tears when they got news that they were axed. They had no one to go to because everyone was in the same boat. It was like a shipwreck in the middle of a dark sea -- no horizon in sight, no one nearby to save them.

Apart from the layoffs, there was several incredibly uncomfortable ""situations"" in recent years on the management front that should have never happened had proper training & protocol been in place. At a Sales Manager Offsite in ATX, the male leaders grouped together at the evening event to get a group to head to one of the local strip clubs. VPs, Directors, Managers. For (most of) the women there, it was a feeling of ""Do I put myself in an uncomfortable and go with them so I can be 'part of the club' or do I stay behind and risk being seen as too immature to hang with the top dogs?"" Thankfully, the majority of them decided not to go but how that crossed their minds as something appropriate to propose with their colleagues baffles me. It was the only time in my tenure that I actually felt uncomfortable and disappointed with our leaders and that I could miss out on an ""opportunity"" to ""network"" despite the inappropriate nature.

There are other instances, as with any tech company, of relations between manager & rep which led to hostile work environments and, in some cases, fear. There was never retaliation for voicing concerns, but you always knew who knew what and whose side someone was on based on how they interacted with you...including a few leaders (past & present). The org, as it grew, began to feel divided between sides of right and wrong."

181,Glassdoor,An executive team as fake as all their recent reviews,2020-07-20,1.0,Account Executive,"The people. Even though majority of Glassdoor's incredible, top-performing reps and sales leaders were driven out, I'm thankful that I had the opportunity to work with them.

Since I (like all those who were hired) was not given a proper training program to lean on during the early stages of my employment, I learned the ropes myself. It’s hilarious that this is what gave me strong sales skills: like my experience, the new hires that came after me had absolutely no direction from enablement, which opened the door for myself and my colleagues to put our work aside and help new employees. While I had no problem doing it, and it improved my relationships and knowledge of the product (hence my placement of this in the ""pros"" section), it's inexcusable that Glassdoor's enablement team left these new employees in the dark. But by all means, Glassdoor Leadership: spend a fortune on office plants & tacky decor instead of a strong enablement team.","Christian honestly had no idea of what we as salespeople did. How much can you appreciate your people if you lack an understanding of their roles? For a company founded on the basis of transparency and that is unique for reviews and ratings, Christian is completely careless to our feedback. On the contrary, I remember when Robert was CEO and would make his way through many parts of the floor when he visited the Chicago office; we all enjoyed listening to some of Robert’s own disco calls that he’d run and record for us, and above all else, it made us feel more united with our leader.

I actually recall a time around December when Christian made a (very rare) visit to the Chicago office. A manager from the SMB team put together a presentation on how to connect with CEOs, and Christian was asked to participate as we foolishly thought he could provide some good insight (how dare we think our CEO could offer us feedback and guidance!). To everyone’s surprise, he overwhelmed us with negative comments about how he as a CEO doesn’t like being reached out to and we honestly all left the meeting more discouraged than when it had started. He rushed back into the meeting about 5 minutes after leaving to give us some forced words of encouragement, knowing that he had messed up and trying to put a quick bandaid on it. No one was convinced.

Christian, in April 2020 when you thought you were being relatable taking zoom calls in your master closet and garage, when you thought you were being relatable sending in videos of you with your family working from home, you instead should’ve focused your energy on saving your top-performing employees that you would blindside only a few weeks later, or if nothing else, you shouldn’t have lied to us. Thanks for showing us your family, but now we’ve had to face the reality of perhaps not being able to support OUR families during an uncertain time when we were promised that this would not happen.

If you still aren’t convinced that he doesn’t value employee feedback, he also mentioned in that same December all hands that he was unsure of his current CEO rating. For any other CEO at literally ANY other company, I’d say that would be surprising but excusable. For a CEO running this very company, the one that is known for its ratings and reviews, the one that says we’re “changing the way people find jobs and companies they love through transparency”… inexcusable."

--Openness to change. Glassdoor takes on change with grit. As a company, everyone understands the change, although we aren’t afraid to ask “Why?” or “How?” and leadership responds with the answers. 
--Leadership is willing and eager to put in the work. The majority of Senior Leaders are young in their careers. They are willing to hear the direct feedback and implement changes. They are eager to grow and develop in their own careers to make Glassdoor an even better place to work. 
--Ability to have ownership and be accountable. I’ve been at Glassdoor two years and in my time, I’ve had ownership over a handful of projects and l continue to learn what truly being accountable to a business metric and making an impact means.","-- Work Life balance while working remote. When Glassdoor was in a physical office location, the environment was more relaxed and felt more open to taking time off. Now that we are entirely remote, it seems like projects just don’t stop. Taking time off, even just for yourself, seems like an unrealistic ask. 
-- Slow to innovate, risk averse until recent. It seems like in the past 3 months, a spark has gone off and Glassdoor is starting to wake up from a nap. I’m nervous Glassdoor might be a little late in the game to course correct…"
186,Glassdoor,Mission driven with great people and an exciting future!,2020-07-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've worked at Glassdoor for several years and the thing that really stands out for me is the people. Everyone has their heart in the right place - wanting to do the best for our users, our clients and internally for our people. People genuinely believe in the mission and the positive impact we can have on the world. 

The people are also smart and driven but understand the need for time for family and out of work activities. There is a lot of respect for your personal time and I think in general Glassdoor offers a good work life balance.

I've also seen over the past few years the maturing of the company as it brings more structure (mostly for the better) to its operations. For instance, professionalizing planning with OKRs, salary benchmarking to ensure fair pay, well organized and thoughtful All Hands meetings, etc. 

I recognize that the company has been through a lot of changes in recent months, not least of which was the impact of Covid. The CEO and Board's decision to let go 30% of the workforce, while very painful at the time, was the correct and responsible thing to do. It ensured the business was set up for future success and that there would be no drip-feeding of redundancies. I can see that Christian (our CEO) is deeply considerate and does not take these kind of decisions lightly. He was dealt a very tough hand of cards in recent months and has responded with courage and compassion. He feels the weight of his responsibilities and this comes through in the extent to which he makes himself vulnerable and transparent. 

For a tech/product standpoint, I personally am very excited by the new strategy direction and believe we will have a lot of impactful and innovative products to bring to market.

Overall Glassdoor is a great employer and I would highly recommend it!","Every company has its cons and Glassdoor is not an exception. I think there are a few key areas that Glassdoor could improve:
- Sense of urgency: I think some areas of the org are strongly professionalized and the people act with urgency. Whereas with others it seems that follow up emails are sometimes necessary to solicit a response. This is just an example, but at times there is a 'big company' mentality whereas I believe we could have more of a startup, get stuff done approach (even if it means we mess up sometimes - better to move fast then get bogged down with bureaucracy).
- Meeting overload: sometimes what could be achieved in a well structured email is repackaged as a meeting. I would encourage us to set the bar higher before booking the time of colleagues. This isn't a big issue but you do see meetings occurring that would have been better served through an email."

-Tremendous learning and growth opportunities. Glassdoor is really committed to developing its people and giving them increasing responsibility and seniority over time. 

-My colleagues are kind, smart, committed, thoughtful, and fun. I literally miss hanging out with them now that we're working remotely, which I know is not true of a lot of people at other companies. 

-The mission - people really want to do right by jobseekers and help them find a job and company they love. This is our driving force, no matter what rumors you hear about employers paying Glassdoor to delete reviews. That doesn't happen. We would never sacrifice our trust to jobseekers like that.

-A fun, collaborative culture. I work with many cross-functional teams and with few exceptions they are valuable partners, committed to achieving our shared goals.

-Layoffs are always devastating, but I appreciate that Glassdoor put together a generous severance package including 3+ months pay, healthcare through the end of the year, etc.","-Covid has hurt our business, and we have dramatically changed our company strategy in response. I am tentatively hopeful that our new direction will be successful, but it feels like it might be a long slog to get to there. 

-Related, the recent pace of organizational change has been relentless. No matter how well-intentioned, it's created some uncertainty and reduced motivation. 

-Total compensation for PMs seems to be under market, especially now that LTIPs are worth so little. My friends in similar roles have 3-10x as much equity as I'm currently earning."

For my role I feel I am paid fairly and when we had a physical office in Dublin, I felt we were well taken care of in terms of the usual perks (office snacks, team nights out etc). Hopefully the company will find a way to continue that while we work from home for the foreseeable due to COVID-19. 

In the past I always felt that career opportunities were great at the company - I am unsure if this will continue, but hope it will. 

At the moment I feel that management and leadership are listening to what we have to say, and our opinions are being taken on board. 

Working from home has been great and the flexibility that the company has always shown in terms of time off is a huge positive. I am hoping we can continue to work from home on a permanent basis but that is still TBC.

Overall I am still happy to be working for Glassdoor but there are huge challenges ahead.","Let's be honest, the slashing of around 55 jobs in Dublin and 300 globally was handled terribly. It felt like a house we had been building for years had just been hit by a bomb. 

The announcement was handled badly. We have preached transparency for years and at the moment when we needed it most, leadership failed. 

The reviews on this page from Dublin pre-March 2020 are now worthless as this is no longer the same company. It is a similar company, but definitely not the same one I have worked in for 4 years .

The reorganisation has been a bit of a mess and I think it will be the same for the next 6-9 months. - I guess that is to be expected with such a large change in strategy. 

Unfortunately with the recent changes, we now have no high level leadership on the ground in EMEA and we have gone back to being led by the US. This did not work in the past, and it wont work going forward. We need someone with overall responsibility for the region to be actually in the region to deal with issues if / when they arise.

With the reorganisation, the jobs we were previously doing have changed significantly, and to be honest a lot of us feel like we have been demoted (despite the company message that we have not)."

199,Glassdoor,"Talented People, Bright Future",2020-07-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Reason #1 to work at Glassdoor is the People -- my colleagues are the type of people who make me excited to come to work and solve problems collaboratively. I genuinely enjoy the people I work across all departments.

Reason #2 to work at Glassdoor is the Mission -- Glassdoor enables the type of transparency that helps people find jobs they love and, in turn, improve their lives. Glassdoor employees are united in this effort and, personally, I feel a strong connection to this mission. This is noble work to be doing, now more than ever. 

Reason #3 to work at Glassdoor is the Future -- Glassdoor is the leading platform for workplace transparency and employer branding. As the world becomes more transparent, and job seekers continue to expect information about potential employers before they accept a job offer, I fully expect that our value to both employees and employers will only continue to grow.","We experienced significant layoffs just two months ago, and are in the thick of a substantial restructure as a result. To say it is an unprecedented time in Glassdoor's history is no understatement. 

Things are changing rapidly, and not in the normal ""startup"" way. We've been asked to bring a new level of adaptability to work each day, and not every type of person is up for this type of work. 

There's a long and winding road ahead so if you do join us, buckle up and bring your best."
200,Glassdoor,"Fun work, great coworkers. Aggressive male leadership, too much bureaucracy.",2020-07-15,4.0,Senior Data Scientist,"I work with some really smart people, from all different parts of the US + the rest of the world. The work is fun, I like working on the Glassdoor products, and believe strongly in the mission of the company. People are generally really nice! I like my coworkers a lot. 

A fair amount of freedom in how you scope your work. There's plenty of opportunity to be immediately helpful and impactful, particularly in product & engineering and associated teams.

The technical systems are also pretty good. Tech gets updated fairly often, and there's a continual emphasis on improving process.

We had layoffs recently, and although there's no great way to layoff a lot of people, Glassdoor did it in the kindest way possible.","Senior leadership within departments can be pretty absent unless something is going wrong which can be frustrating. There's an acceptance that being aggressive is fine which can lead to some people (mostly men) being allowed to be really shout-y in meetings, or leaning really hard on people to get things done too quickly. This shoutiness is often out of knee-jerk defensiveness, which sucks. That's not everyone though. 

There's also a significant amount of bureacracy, the benefit of which is not obvious. Almost every capability has it's own ""operations"" team (business ops, marketing ops) and it can be confusing to know who to ask for things, and projects end up with bloated stakeholder list, making getting all necessary people into a single meeting basically impossible. 

Way too many meetings, but we're working on it. There's also a lot of process for process's sake, with no obvious value."
201,Glassdoor,True to our values,2020-07-15,4.0,Business Systems Analyst,"One of the things I like most about working at Glassdoor is our recent renewed focus on our values and that we live them everyday. I see examples of transparency, innovation, and grit all the time and of course, I work with a group of not just good, but great people.",I’m encouraged that Glassdoor has made commitments to improve diversity and inclusion because I feel that we could do so much more.
202,Glassdoor,Blunt Honesty,2020-07-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I'll start by saying - I have worked at other companies in the past and partnered with clients in various industries where I was able to experience their workplaces. I'll be the first to say - Glassdoor is far and above superior to all of them in terms of courtesy and professionalism of employees, work-life balance and employee benefits. When I first started, I could physically feel the shift in the workplace unlike I had before!

A few pros I want to highlight:

+ Visibility. I feel completely taken care of and seen as a worker. I have never felt like ""just a number"" or ""another face in the crowd"". I also feel as if my voice matters, and if I want something acted upon or noticed, it will be! Meetings with our managers are always productive and they make an effort to ask if there are any questions we need answered or changes we would recommend.

+ Change happens! Again, never worked for a company that is so outright eager to gain employee feedback. They proactively ask for it on a regular basis. They encourage us to share the good, the bad and the ugly to be as truthful and raw as we can. If my previous employers asked for feedback, no changes were ever made and you never heard about it again. At Glassdoor, not only does our CEO and PeopleTeam read the reviews, read the survey feedback and openly ask for more, but they take this information and make ACTUAL CHANGE! They even asked us to write reviews about how we were feeling right now, knowing there may be quite a bit of animosity at the moment. Crazy, right? They recognize the power that their employees have and care enough to shift things to favor their people. It still blows my mind that one review has the power to change the forward motion of a company, but it's so true!

+ Employees. I can confidently say I am among some of the best and brightest individuals in the industry. My colleagues are kind, funny, intelligent, professional and always willing to help each other out. I feel proud to work alongside them every day!

+ Work-life balance. Managers encourage us to take time off, take a personal day or go on vacation. The unlimited PTO and fantastic benefits package is top-notch!

+ Work from home. I'll preface this with I enjoy working from home. I miss my people, but I don't mind not having to commute, sleeping a little longer, etc.. When our WFH order happened, we were told to let our IT team know if we needed anything - extra monitors, keyboards, desk chairs, desks, you name it. We were even given an option to buy work from home essentials we may need and expense it. This has helped make the WFH experience so much better. Again, I feel very supported and taken care of!","You can't have a lot of good without some bad, right?

A few cons I want to highlight:

- Layoffs. By now it's a broken record that people have written about the harsh handling of the layoffs in May. While it's difficult to tell 300 people they are being let go, I do believe a more conceited effort to give folks a ""heads up"" would have been extremely appreciated by both the folks who left and the ones who remained. While the severance packages were generous, the situation could have been handled much better and more direct from the first sign of trouble in paradise.

- Culture. While the people are all top-notch in the industry, some of the ""Glassdoor Lifers"" don't understand how things could be outside of working at Glassdoor. There are quite a few employees who have grown with the company for their whole careers and don't know what it's like working anywhere else. Because of this, they constantly compare the current Glassdoor to how it used to be without realizing that things could be much worse, as they are at most other companies.

- Concise forward planning. Lately, all the change feels very unstable and wishy-washy. It feels as if our service motion or future partnerships are changing every day. We hear information one day, and it's different the next. It would have been better if management would have taken a week or two in order to plan. Sit down, and really work things out before having us do what feels like this whole 'trial and error' thing to work out the kinks. The back and forth is starting to take a toll on internal teams and client relationships instead of having one solid plan that either succeeds or fails."

206,Glassdoor,Great people,2020-07-15,3.0,Content and Community Associate,The people at the Ohio office are amazing. Great benefits. Inner-team collaboration makes you feel valued. Working-from-home is a wonderful benefit that we adapted. Dog-friendly office. Management consistently gives you feedback to level yourself up as an employee.,Not sure there is a lot of opportunity for growth. The workday can sometimes get repetitive and monotonous. Pay is not great. The company stresses transparency but I don't even think they know where they are headed in regards to future partnerships.
207,Glassdoor,"The company's heart is in the right place, but can we deliver?",2020-07-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Glassdoor has been great at navigating through this difficult period of chance (both externally and internally). I appreciate my co-workers and the transparency from the leadership team. I'm also excited to focus on our strength: informing employers of how their brand is perceived.,One word: execution. I've seen so many fantastic product demonstrations that fizzle out somewhere along the line and never make it to market. We need to innovate faster rather than just launch features our competitors successfully launched years ago.
208,Glassdoor,We rolled the dice,2020-07-15,2.0,Director,"Even by Glassdoor standards, there has been a lot of change in 2020. However, the mission is as strong as ever and for me, the most significant pro of working here is the people. 
I love the fact that I can work independently and the support for WFH has been awesome. We have a strong People team that has really come into its own during the pandemic.
I fully support the new strategy shift and the drive for transparency. However, the pace of change is scary and dramatic. We've rolled the dice in a major way and I hope for all our sakes that it works out. You can't deny that there are some pretty bold changes kicking off right now.","Unfortunately, while I have had a good run, I fear that post-restructure I am running out of road. It wasn't Glassdoor's fault that COVID-19 came along and I believe senior management acted in the best interests of the company in letting 30% of the workforce go. Some of those people will be sorely missed, others, not so much. However, this has had a dramatic affect on my day-to-day role and the outlook for my development and progression is not good right now. 
I hope this situation changes, and you can never tell what is around the corner, but right now my scope is severely limited. I wish I wasn't facing this situation, but I just can't see how to haul myself out of it and there is no magic wand for Glassdoor to wave. It is gut-wrenching."
209,Glassdoor,"Great people, poor communication and structure",2020-07-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Great team 
-Friendly and approachable mid and senior management
-Salary not bad for the work involved
-Great work/life balance
-Career progression

The best part about my time with Glassdoor was by far the people. Intelligent, funny and warm you always found someone willing to help.

Great times were had and a lot has been learned from others.

Management were approachable and were always laid back and willing to listen. I have never seen senior management interact with the teams so much and that was refreshing. 

For the work involved the salary was OK. The work wasn't back breaking or ever encroaching on your personal life. You never had anyone breathing down your neck.

Although not completely structured there was great opportunity for progression.","-Very poor communication
-No KPIs (Some would see this as a pro)
-Little to no process or structure
-Way too many fluff meetings
-Onboarding was shocking

Communication is a major issue with Glassdoor. Huge updates were poorly timed, a two paragraph email could turn into a 45 minuet meeting, some comments and feedback came across as very snarky and personal, and at least 75% of the meetings were not necessary. 

In my role at KPIs did not exist or very few that were measured anyway. KPI's are the core structure to measure success, improve processes and make the customer journey seamless. 

Half the 1-1's I had there was nothing to discuss.

There are little to no processes, no documentation, no email templates nothing.

If something did exist it was 5 years old and hadn't been updated. Something as simple as a credit to an account was an arduous task as no one knew the process.

There was never a day without a meeting and as said before 75% of these meetings were not needed. It was all about how great the product is and how great things are going and how the sales teams targets are calculated.... (All teams were invited to these meetings even non sales) 

Cut the chatter on fluff. More training's, meaningful content, learning. 

This should be where that time is utilized you cant expect a slack channel to be the prime place to learn how to do your job.

The on-boarding was shocking, half of the content was sales focused (I was not on the sales org) the enablement team spend the whole year planning for the Sales Kick Off. 

I think in over a year there I had 2 training's with the enablement team. Unfortunately neither were useful to my role. 

Training's are only rolled out as a reactive measure to an update etc."

I worked at Glassdoor pre-COVID but admire how they supported their employees transition to other career paths when things got hard","Hard path to promotion , culture fit goes a long way"
211,Glassdoor,A challenging time - but fundamentally still plenty of good,2020-07-02,4.0,Operations,"- ""Good people"". It's one of our core values, and while it sounds kind of vague and cliche - it's really true. It's not just about the people we hire - it's more about how we all treat each other every day. It obviously doesn't always work out perfectly, but as a rule it's a culture where from the top down people genuinely care, they listen and they respect eachother. It's not about ego, power and empire building- it's about a group of people trying to do the right thing for the company as a whole. 

 - Career growth. If you're ambitious and capable and the opportunity is there, leadership will take a bet on you and support you to do more and more. That's true in my team, but I've seen lots of examples of it happening in other teams as well. Promotions are part of it, but it's also about having the chance to learn and try new things.

 - The mission. It doesn't always feel like we're putting the mission first (although with our new strategy feels like we're getting back to it) but it does feels good to work at a place that's doing something meaningful and real. And especially right now, helping jobseekers feels important and worthwhile","- A lot of change. There's a lot going on right now. We've changed our strategy (again..) to focus back on our traditional products around content and branding. We're trying to build new products. We're dealing with COVID and remote working. Other people have talked about layoffs which sucked even though I do believe the exec team tried their best. And the way we work with our sister company Indeed is changing as well. Who knows if all of these things will work out, and a lot of them are hard to control. But it means that this is a place where you need to be comfortable with a lot of change and unknowns at the moment, and that's not easy."

All employees have direct lines of communication to the CEO and everyone in between.

We have a super flexible work environment, amazing benefits, open PTO, 401k match...",2020 has brought a lot of changes (to the world) and to Glassdoor; we need to ruthlessly prioritize and focus. It's easy sometimes to get enamored by the bright shiny objects.

2. The mission - Glassdoor does have a great mission and everybody really stays aligned with that. Despite some of the other reviews, I think Glassdoor does try to find ways to improve the product although perhaps a bit tentative to take big risks","1. New leadership - Glassdoor is attempting to change. When I joined there was still quite a bit of opportunity for anybody to make an impact and that was encouraged. With our new leadership (excluding engineering and product) it seems that ideas are only able to come from leadership and otherwise your job is blindly deliver. We are more and more being told to stay in our lane.

2. Hesitancy - Glassdoor is too risk averse. There are no signs of big bets or radical changes. We are told that big things are going to happen or but nothing ever seems to be any different. Much like the new leadership its a lot of talk but no action.

3. Transparency - Simply put, I don't trust the majority of our leadership team.

4. Trying to be ""Corporate"" - Glassdoor is trying so hard to be like LinkedIn or Indeed that its walking away from its identiy and literally squeezing the life out of their employees. I'd be curious to know exaclty how many people would leave if given anohter opportunity.

5. Favoritism - This is a new con at Glassdoor and depends on the team. I used to think that our leader valued the team but in most recent months its seemed quite the opposite.

- On boarding and training is far too short and condensed despite the sheer amount of new tools/systems one has to learn.
- Lack of communication between upper management often led to confusion and distrust within the team as guidance was not always clear. 
- Work life balance is extremely poor, many SDR's were working overtime and on holidays to reach targets and push out massive amounts of volume to reach ridiculously high weekly KPI's set out by managers.

-VP and up seemed out of touch often. Especially with the Chicago office.
-Christian seems like a ""nice guy"" but not sure if he was ready to take this on yet. Before Covid, Glassdoor wasn't performing that well. So I don't think a lot of people were shocked when they let 1/3 of the company go, even after saying we were in a good place weeks before.
- SOPS was horrible. CS was understaffing and under trained.
- This was a place to meet nice people, get a paycheck, move up and move on. There wasn't any innovation to sink your career in at Glassdoor (If Glassdoor ever does hire again, I would not have expectations beyond that).

218,Glassdoor,just another dysfunctional tech company,2020-06-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everything in this review, except comments about the recent layoffs and the long term incentive plan, should be considered independently of the effects of coronavirus on the business. 
 
My Glassdoor colleagues are kind, and don’t hesitate to help each other when put in a position to do so.

The compensation is probably slightly above what would be expected at a company of similar size and industry.

The work life balance is excellent, and always has been.

The sum total of the work we do is ultimately positive, insofar as we help people find jobs. It’s way better than working at some pathological social media outfit, or selling cheap trash no one needs.","The first major con should be roundly apparent from reading positive reviews. “No Cons!!” Believe me, there are Cons. We have hemorrhaged talent in the last two years (I will float some ideas why a bit why lower down), and responded with questionable hiring decisions. While there are few, if any, hard-charging bullies and alpha-types at Glassdoor, there are many obsequious and uninquisitive employees.

The long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) is probably broken. Coronavirus has exposed how the incentive scheme as structurally uncredible. Personal performance is uncoupled from our business performance. That's how it's supposed to work, perhaps. But even aside from coronavirus, the LTIP is confusing and probably broken, with lower grants occurring after higher performance ratings, ostensibly due to some sort of adjusted coefficient nested into the grant calculus. My manager was not able to explain the LTIP to me during my performance review. I felt bad for her.

I was in a meeting a few weeks ago, part of which my husband overheard. He later told me, “I think I know what mansplaining is now…” I laughed. It’s true. Meetings often do sound like a fact auction, with enthusiastic participation by men talking over each other. Speaking of meetings, there are too many of them. Rare is the meeting with any kind of agenda or plan. It happened once a while ago; I remember that meeting. Meetings are constantly called, often ad hoc, and sometimes after work has been completed, because those involved have to figure out what was done and why. Often we will reprise a meeting the next day because the previous meeting solved nothing. It’s a negative feedback loop.

It’s not clear what Product is doing or is supposed to be doing; they come across as some kind of wannabe C-suite. The decisions about what Glassdoor's products look like and feel like seem to grow out of wishful thinking, or caricatures of job seekers that don't generalize.

My manager told me in my last performance review that the reason I was not promoted was “politics.” When I asked her what I could have done to earn a promotion (or just a high rating), she mumbled something about visibility. That was disappointing."

While this is 1 occurrence, it's a big one because it points to an issue with senior leadership and how they trust and communicate to employees.

It's no secret that Glassdoor has been struggling to maintain competitiveness. Go ahead, read reviews from the past fews years. The product has evolved minimally and there haven't been actual new, revenue producing products built. It's clear that right now, Glassdoor's current products only matter in a bullish market.

Severance package is decent and you can keep your laptop.","This just isn't the same company it was 4 years ago.  I have loved Glassdoor, the best company I have ever worked for, but as they have scaled in size, they have also lost some sizzle.  I have witnessed this happen to other start-ups that scaled.  Some things just feel different at 1000 employees than at 200.  I used to feel very confident about the direction of the company and it's leadership.  Some of the changes being made right now (May 2020) with Glassdoor, a sister company and the parent company now have me concerned.  If it isn't broke, don't tinker with it.  My advice is to stick with the same business model that paved the road to where you are today.

I am an award-winning, quota-hitting, promoted, top-shelf sales rep who just lost my job to COVID-19.  The sales dept was just gutted - aren't sales teams one of the last groups to go in a reduction in force due to an economic downturn?  You award me for my efforts and success and then you send me packing.  Cut the dead weight instead and keep top performers.  I don't get it.  My heart is broken.

Glassdoor has gone out of it's way to create inclusivity for the LGBTQ+ community.  I applaud their efforts and they have done a fantastic job!  Unfortunately, Glassdoor put too many eggs in one basket.  Black/AA, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, Jewish, Catholic, Christian, etc all take a backseat to LGBTQ+ who is riding shotgun.  Glassdoor, have you ever temporarily changed your corporate logo to include the name/colors/logo of any diversity group other than LGBTQ+?  Would you change your green logo to black for black history month?  Or perhaps add a Cross, Star of David, or Santa hat to the corporate logo during holiday season?  No, you wouldn't do those things.  But you did incorporate the rainbow colors to your corporate logo during pride month.  My advice is to work as hard for other diversity groups as you have done for LGBTQ+.

Lastly, employee salaries are below national averages according to Glassdoor's very own ""Know your Worth"" data and salary info.  They try to make up for it in other areas like office snacks, Patagonia swag and benefits."

230,Glassdoor,Great Culture. Great People.,2020-05-18,5.0,Executive Assistant,"(This review reflects my PRE-COVID experience). Glassdoor hires well and they take their culture very seriously. Due to that fact, I have gained numerous meaningful friendships and mentorships with my coworkers. 

The culture is relaxed, yet highly efficient, and work-life balance is a very integral part of our culture here. There are many days where I'll leave at 5 PM and I will be one of the last few people in the office. 

We have relaxed hours, flexible PTO, and many people opt to WFH at least 2 days a week. 

Working here has been a dream! Free lunch 5x a week. A beautiful office. Great people. Meaningful work. What more could I ask for?","As of recently, things have been understandably difficult. We have had to lay off 30% of our workforce. This situation has NOT been ideal, but I'm hopeful that we will regain some sense of normalcy when this is over. Unfortunately, I also think that we've lost so many long-term employees that things will never quite be the same."
231,Glassdoor,Room for Improvement but Overall Great Experience,2020-05-18,3.0,Account Executive,"Cared for their employees greatly
Amazing culture within your own organization
Great work/life balance
Incredible benefits and perks 
Very talented manager and director level leaders","Of course, the way things ended with a mass layoff that had zero warning was not an ideal experience to go through and not an ideal way to end my time at this company. I think this situation could have been handled much differently and I would have had a lot more respect leaving the company had we not been promised job security over and over. However that does not dictate my entire experience with Glassdoor. 

I do wish that there was more insight and delivery on certain products, processes, and specifics that were promised to us throughout, that we never saw through. The product essentially stayed the same and was not evolving with the industry all the while, having constant meetings about product evolvement and new additions to our company that never came true. This hindered growth within the sales org.

The other thing I wished was improved upon were internal processes. There were massive delays on very simple requests, cases, etc through operations, finance, and other non-client facing teams. As a sales individual it felt as if we had zero support behind the scenes. Everything was kicked back to us in some way shape or form. This puts a bad taste in clients mouths giving them a sense of no support as well and has impacted many renewals therefore taking away revenue from the company. There needs to be tighter SLA's for internal teams, and more of a focus shift to a true sales organization which requires way more support for those teams. Glassdoor's reputation will continue to suffer if there is no support to sales and no support for our customers.

Career progression was tough. Internal interviewing came with a lot of politics and was not the best experience or process. This needs improvement if you want to keep good sales people, path for promotion needs huge improvements."
232,Glassdoor,Company is dissolving,2020-05-17,2.0,Sales,Not many anymore- company is dissolving,I could write a paragraph but I will keep it simple-- just about everything. I will let the other reviews do that work.
233,Glassdoor,"Great Folks, Poor Outlook",2020-05-16,3.0,Marketing,"The day to day was all positive. Cross collaboration was always painless. Always got the sense that Glassdoor operates as a unit, not as siloed departments. This is not a hyperbole: everyone I interacted with was extremely easy to work with. No politics. Just ppl getting sh*t done. 

Work/Life balance is great. I never felt overworked and when life hit you, management was extremely willing to accommodate.

Benefits are pretty solid. Free healthcare for yourself and subsidized healthcare for family. Unlimited PTO that you're encouraged to use. Very nice office/working facility with free daily catered lunch, a gameroom, gym, cafeteria.","*Sigh* it pains me to write this, but...

The Glassdoor we know and love is not long for this world. Glassdoor makes most of its revenue on job ads, where it's a small player in a competitive space. 

It's extremely hard to monetize what Glassdoor's core features: the reviews. The revenue from employer profiles is frankly not enough run a profitable business at the current size. 

The new CEO seems powerless to the board members of Recruit (Glassdoor's holding company). He's an extremely nice guy and definitely cared about the company. But a good person doesn't always make a good CEO."
234,Glassdoor,Leaving the company with a bitter taste,2020-05-15,3.0,Senior Account Executive,"The people at Glassdoor were by far the biggest asset to the company. Everyone on the sales floor was willing to lend a helping hand and share feedback for the betterment of their peers. The sales floor was a tight knit group and had each others backs through good times and bad.

There was also good upward career progression for those who performed at high levels.","This starts and ends with senior leadership. The most frustrating part of the recent layoff announcement was that the executive team simply did not practice what they preached. Throwing an impromptu all hands meeting to deliver such an announcement with no forewarning and then to follow up with no adequate explanation on why is just a bad look all around. 

For a business that is so adamant in urging companies to be fully transparent with their employees in order to be efficient - it was appalling to observe how often Glassdoor leadership left their employees in the dark and trying to guess what was actually happening. 

On multiple occasions, employees were reassured about their job security as well as Glassdoor's ability maintain independence from Indeed. This was communicated despite concerns voiced by employees over red flags that included a consistent lack in product innovation, stagnant traffic to the website, and sales operations teams that were overwhelmed quite frequently. 

Despite the enormous volume of feedback given from front line sales reps to help improve overall processes, this information fell on deaf ears time and time again as there was rarely any action taken as a result. 

For a company with such grand aspirations and a truly superior product, this was a horrible way to end things."
235,Glassdoor,Very very disappointing,2020-05-14,3.0,Customer Success,"The people: The people were the singular reason I stayed at Glassdoor for so long. I love the people I met and it was the best work environment I could ask for!! I loved being able to go to work with coworkers who turned into my friends every single day. 

The office: Really nice updated office in Fulton Market, with free snacks, great views, an amazing rooftop, and free gym. No free parking, unfortunately. 

Career progression: Although unclear at times, I will say Glassdoor did see value in its employees and did hire within a lot. In my time there I had seen at least 10+ people get promoted, including myself, and it was great to see that. 

Benefits: Great health benefits, free food, bonuses, gyms in offices, dogs in office(Mill Valley office), unlimited PTO - however, they took this away for a month and then gave it back. 

I did learn a lot about myself personally and professionally at Glassdoor. It was definitely a great stepping stone in my career, and I will always remember my time at Glassdoor and think of it as mostly positive.

Although laid off, the severance package is one of the best I have seen.","Glassdoor will never be the same. The only good thing about it was the people and most of the good ones are gone. They're probably merging with Indeed - I mean selling profiles to clients for thousands and thousands of dollars isn't going to cut it forever. 

Transparency: Funny this is at the core of their business model, right? 300 people were laid off with no warning. A whole org, gone. They let go a whole org with no warning, and we’re really supposed to believe this was not planned after weeks of reassurance we were going to be ok during COVID. Doesn't seem totally transparent to me. 

Pay discrepancy: Where do I even begin? Throughout my years at Glassdoor there was never a clear reason as to why the pay discrepancy was so vast on my team. People in the same role making 20k more than others, and the professional pay scale they used to determine our pay had the incorrect job description. Also, pay in general is on the lower side. 

Senior Management: 
There is one leader in senior management for CS that should not be there. They have made MANY employees cry on multiple occasions and do not know how to have difficult conversations with empathy. They are simply rude. CS senior leadership was never fully transparent behind why changes were made. I am honestly not even sure what they did all day bc it was most definitely not making the org any better.

The role: There was NEVER a clear idea of the split of work between CS and sales. CS of course got blamed for everything and a Sales director was quoted saying “I wish I could blow up all of CS and start over”.. Really??? They would measure us on KPI’s that they set that didn't even make sense based on our scope of work, and then present those KPI’s in meetings in front of the whole org. Not to mention most of the reports for those KPI’s were broken. The whole CSS team was always overworked, undervalued, unrecognized, and underpaid."
236,Glassdoor,As transparent as a brick wall.,2020-05-14,2.0,Sales,"1. The People. I’m sure you’ll see this in the Pros section on each review as of late. I will always be grateful for the friendships I made while working at Glassdoor.

2. The Experience. We did not have a solidified sales process at Glassdoor (see further information below), which in turn pushed us to get creative and to work even harder to see success. This experience will help me in sales roles and sales management roles to come.","I’ve chosen to list my cons by category. I hope you’ll take these seriously. You’ll notice a correlation between some of these cons and Glassdoor’s recently released “Company Values”. 

1. “We Are Transparent” is no longer true: 

Glassdoor is a company that was built on the foundation of transparency. For a while, we were living up to this and maintaining a transparent workplace. However, senior leadership (primarily VPs and above) completely lost sight of this value in the last year or so. I cannot stress this enough - You CANNOT preach the value in transparency to your employees, and then completely hide details of major decisions taking place within the company. 

For example, Glassdoor leaders, including Christian (CEO) and our Chief Economist, spoke in front of our entire workforce on multiple occasions to reassure us that Glassdoor was going to make it out of these COVID-19 times just fine. They told us we should not be worried, that Glassdoor made financial decisions in the past to prepare for something like this, and that we will protect our people AT ALL COSTS. They then put a surprise meeting on our calendar to lay off 300 employees, including President Club Winners, Top Performers, and some of our most Amazing Leaders. 

What they (Christian) neglected to even hint at was the fact that they had a different plan for Glassdoor - one that makes the company look a LOT different than it did a week ago. They had a meeting with the entire workforce the day after they laid us off to lay out a detailed restructure plan, with prepared materials, which had to take months or even the whole year to plan out with Indeed. Seems pretty convenient that they used COVID-19 as an excuse to execute a wildly different plan for the company. When Glassdoor was purchased, leadership repeated SO many times that we would not merge or start working too closely with Indeed. It is also unbelievable that Indeed did not lay off any employees - they just took our jobs and Glassdoor didn’t even offer reps/managers the opportunity to stay on the team (again, MANY of these laid off reps/managers were top performers).

2. “We are Innovative” …boy, I wish that were true: 

There were zero MEANINGFUL changes, advances or additions to Glassdoor’s GTM product suite in years. Sure, we would come out with some small update or addition to our solution from time to time, but it was never a change that prospects/clients deeply cared about. When entering into a discovery call, there was no way I could respond honestly when a prospect would say “I’ve spoken to Glassdoor multiple times. Your team keeps reaching out about new updates. Has your product changed at all or do you have any new products?” It was pretty embarrassing and made it difficult to effectively do the job. 

3. “We Are Good People” …well, you used to be:

Again, 300 people laid off, NOT based on performance. We are the people that built Glassdoor’s culture DESPITE leadership challenges. We worked incredibly hard for the company, and we made Glassdoor into what it was DESPITE our out of touch leaders. Glassdoor is 1 million percent NOT the same company it was a week ago. If you are attracted to roles at Glassdoor because of the culture, please do not be fooled. The culture will never be the same. 

The video you see in the first tab of Glassdoor’s Why Work for Us section highlights the people at Glassdoor…Ironically it includes many people who were recently laid off. 

4. “We Have GRIT”:

Growth: We were expanding, hiring, and looking to move into new offices in San Fran and Chicago. Obviously, COVID-19 impacted this and Glassdoor is no longer growing.

Results: Leadership knows how terribly they messed up last fiscal year when they made the books for hunter reps. It was an abomination. They divided books based on “spend potential”, which relied on incredibly inaccurate data in Salesforce. This meant that some of our best reps suffered and barely anyone reached their annual quotas. All we got was a small “sorry this was an oversight”, then the message preached to everyone was “keep working hard” …as if that were the issue. Great leaders and reps left Glassdoor because of how badly leadership messed up and because of the direction the company was going. This happened before layoffs were even in question, so Glassdoor was going downhill this whole past year.

Integrity: Most of us feel really let down that Christian and others did not even give us clarity or honesty about how Glassdoor was reorganizing with Indeed - they just blamed everything on COVID-19. This doesn’t ring “integrity” to me.

Teamwork: The time it took to make change or get simple projects done was ridiculous. For even the simplest change, we would have to wait on layers of leadership approvals, “leaders” dragging their feet, and conflict between leaders that have MBAs and those who did not delaying the process. It was so frustrating. 

5. SDR Org: 

While the SDR Org made some progress since year’s past, it was still a mess. Leaders having multiple long meetings weekly to try and make change, only to be pushed off by executive leadership as an afterthought. The SDR Org did not get the respect it deserves. These reps are the future of your sales Org, yet you consistently messed up their quotas, did not provide the correct training and enablement to help these reps succeed, and left everything on the managers’ plates to deal with. To all of the former Glassdoor SDRs reading this post: Know that you are incredibly valuable, and you were the lifeline of the sales Org. I’m just sorry executive leadership pushed you to the side. 

6. Enablement: 

Enablement was understaffed and could not provide the resources each Organization needed to succeed. Training and development were left on the shoulders of each manager at Glassdoor. Glassdoor does not have an official sales process or sales methodology. Therefore, SDRs and Reps alike had to work even harder to develop their own process and hopefully be successful. Luckily, this just made me better at my job. However, it is a disservice to your employees to not provide proper training. 

7. CEO: 

Christian took over for Robert as CEO, and things went downhill. Christian has shown on multiple occasions his inability to lead and get “buy-in” from his employees. From leaving meetings early that he was clearly unprepared for, to poorly delivering the news of layoffs, Christian seems to be in over his head. In one meeting, Christian bragged about creating the culture at LinkedIn…it left such a bad taste in so many mouths. Glassdoor is not LinkedIn, and I can promise you Christian had nothing to do with Glassdoor culture when it was strong – that was 100% the employees. 

8. Things I unfortunately dealt with while working at Glassdoor:

Glassdoor preaches transparency and even released a “Know Your Worth” tool to help candidates calculate what salary they should be making in their given field. This is SO ironic because my colleagues and I were specifically told we shouldn’t talk with one another about how much money we make…at the most “transparent” company around. It turns out this was preached to us because we were not all making the same amount. 

For example, I was being paid less than 85% of my colleagues. Let this sink in for a minute…I had a longer tenure at Glassdoor than any of those colleagues, I had the most experience at Glassdoor compared to those colleagues, and, like myself, these colleagues had zero management experience before entering into these roles. I was also told I absolutely 100% could NOT negotiate a salary higher than a certain amount, then I come to find 85% of my colleagues were being paid above that amount. Shocking for a company that talks so highly about equal pay for equal work.

There were a couple examples of male employees that were acting inappropriately at Glassdoor. I won’t go into the details here, but what I will say was during a full-blown HR investigation into one employee, for whatever reason leadership decided he could stay in the office and continue working while this was going on. Imagine the discomfort, fear, and anxiety this caused the people who were involved in that investigation. For some reason, that always stuck with me. Poorly handled. 

9. Important call outs:

If you would have asked me to rate Glassdoor 1.5-2 years ago, I would have said 4 stars. I always pictured staying with the company for a long time, and I am grateful to a few of the direct leaders I had that always supported me. 

Please do not respond to this review with a canned response. 

Please do not cover mistakes with excuses, and please do not preach about “how well we are being taken care of” post layoffs. A Lot of the information you see above happened before layoffs.

Please do not brag about creating an alumni slack channel…most ex-employees are likely too uncomfortable to post in there anyway due to the fact that Christian is in the channel as well. It would be a much more effective channel if people could connect and speak freely with one another."
237,Glassdoor,Downhill tumble,2020-05-14,2.0,Am,"Glassdoor has given me the best friends and managers I have ever had. The Mangers and Directors really did believe in their team and made work enjoyable. I will forever be so thankful to have met these people. 

Christian, please do not take credit for giving me my friends with your canned review response.","The CEO and Senior Leadership team really left everyone in the dark of how much of a mess Glassdoor has been for the past 11 years. I'm very excited to see how the Indeed merger plays out. It is laughable how the CEO is blaming the layoffs on COVID. These layoffs would have happened regardless. COVID just sped up the process, so Christian can get a fat check quickly when it all plays out. 

Christian, you have absolutely destroyed Glassdoor's culture all within a 30 minute conference call. After you get your payout when the merger officially happen, it might be worthwhile to go back to a Leadership 101 course in college. Perhaps you could even learn a little bit from the amazing Managers and Directors you let go with no warning."
238,Glassdoor,The Wheels are Falling Off,2020-05-14,3.0,Customer Success,"People: The people is the single most amazing thing about this company. Glassdoor truly hires the best and I have been able to foster so many amazing relationships during my time there. 

Culture: While there have been some changes recently, overall Glassdoor had an amazing culture with snacks, open concept office, and new technology to leverage. I didn't dread going into the office because I enjoyed my time there

Work Life Balance: This job really allows you to have freedom into how much you put in and the ability to take time for yourself. I was always encouraged to take PTIO and work flexible hours based on my schedule","Leadership: There have been quite a few changes at the top levels of the organization and it makes you wonder if those have been for the better. Since the turn of the calendar year, it feels like every single month there was a large organizational change that has greatly affected the employees and the business strategy questioning what the future would be for Glassdoor. 


Transparency/Communication: This whole situation showed the true colors for a company that prides itself on being open and sharing the true inside happenings with a company. The last few months felt like something was hidden around every corner and the number of ""political responses"" we received on a variety of subjects was frustrating and disappointing."

Overly complex business processes for a simple product concept"
240,Glassdoor,Lost Sight of Company Values,2020-05-12,2.0,Customer Success,The people. My team was amazing and everyone was so hard working and easy to work with. My manager was always positive and provided ample guidance and learning opportunities.,"Lost sight of the company’s core value, transparency. Pretty ironic for a company that stresses other companies be transparent.

When I first started at Glassdoor in the summer of 2019, I took the job mainly because it was so close to my home in Marin. The idea of a 15 minute commute in the Bay Area was a dream come true. About a month later after I joined, we were told we were moving to a new office in San Francisco in the fall of 2020. It felt like a bait and switch. This was never mentioned in any of the multiple interviews for the job but at least I’ll be close to home for some time before the move. We were told they would maintain the Mill Valley office for Marin residents for some time before the lease ended on the building, so I was relieved. But a contact in the Workplace Experience team said that the Mill Valley office was going to accommodate management and executives, not all Mill Valley residents. Thus begins the journey into lack of transparency.

Shortly into 2020, many of us were told we were being re-classified as hourly employees and our unlimited PTO was abruptly taken from us. There was an hour long meeting where this was positioned as a legal move that was actually in our best interest. But we all saw through that. Those who took very little time off and were planning a big trip or honeymoon were just left in the lurch. After some bad reviews, a few people leaving the company, and some harsh (but warranted feedback), our PTO was reinstated around March. This eventually did not matter at all as 300 people were laid off in the weeks following.

When COVID-19 became a threat to the market and industry, we were told from the onset that we had enough capital to avoid layoffs, that other companies were downsizing. But not us. Throughout February, March, and April we were told our jobs are safe. Even at our sales kick off event, they brought in our chief economist to tell us that we are “weathering the storm” and are positioned to avoid layoffs. This was in mid-April. Fast forward to May 7th where we find an all hands meeting on our calendars with zero notice. In that meeting we were told 300 people, about 30% of the workforce, was being laid off. It was shocking and completely out of left field after what we had been told for months. The icing on the cake was the follow up meeting where we could not ask any questions where our VP said a bunch of corporate speak. There was no exit interview, nothing. Just booted to the curb. Layoffs like this are not just split second decisions, this had to have been considered for some time. So we were lied to and given the false hope, likely for weeks or months, that our jobs were safe. People who have been with the company for years, top performers, and just all around hard working, honest people just lost their jobs in the blink of an eye.

Our CEO. He brags about company culture and the important work we’re doing when things were going well. But in moments of crisis or when asked difficult questions, he can’t speak with any sort of confidence. It was pretty easy to tell when we were not being told the full truth. Again, layoffs don’t just get decided without any sort of planning. So he kept telling us that our work is more important than ever all the while steps are being taken to cut the work force behind closed doors."

Being in the office surrounded by coworkers I considered my friends felt too good to be true. Every manager I had as well as my director were outstanding leaders, senior leadership on the other hand would fall under the cons. 

Opportunities: Account Managers typically don't spend more than a year and a half in seat before being promoted. Glassdoor also gave me the chance to work with leaders and provide input to help improve rep work flow and the client experience.","Deceptive: We had constantly asked for clarity around the future of Glassdoor & Indeed. We were blatantly lied to and told that the future plans in question would absolutely not happen. Fast forward a few months and 300 of us are laid off. Our CEO blamed this on COVID while it was later made to seem that this would have happened eventually for the exact reasons we were assured would never happen, and COVID just expedited it. I could not be more frustrated to know that I might still have a job if it weren't for the future plans with Indeed. Glassdoor speaks so highly of valuing its employees but ever since Robert stepped down as CEO that feeling left with him. Glassdoor has grown immensely throughout the years and it was only a matter of time before it made the shift from an enjoyable unique culture to your standard money hungry organization

Unorganized: Glassdoors internal processes are a hot mess. I have no idea how this company has been around for 10+ years and has yet to figure out an efficient way to renew clients. They are constantly restructuring the job description of Account Managers and Customer Success and the clients are the ones who are suffering. Getting promoted and transitioning to a new book is beyond sloppy for the rep and client, getting paid out on spiffs always takes 2 months longer than they promise, and anytime another department is looped into an email chain, you can guarantee you or the client will need to follow up at least 3 times to get an answer. I'm not sure if there's a part of this org that I could confidently say runs smoothly."

- upward mobility - there was great opportunity to move up within the org if you're performing, indeed.

- benefits + reward - with upward mobility came comp increase and exceeding quota was quite generous and appreciated. benefits were also a perk","- transparency, what we were all about - had once been a pillar quickly became the opposite, indeed. there was no communication around direction other than ""we're a branding company now."" not much of a plan for the company through these times but leadership clearly already had plans in the works. there was never a mention of layoffs once and 300 people were cut off from anything Glassdoor related within 5 hours! quite harsh, indeed

- product innovation - in my 3 years being in direct sales, there was no product innovation. I had sold the same product each year. innovation actually became a new part of the GRIT culture but it seemed to be a few years too late as once a pandemic hit & recession was on the brink, our product was one of the first cut from client's budget --- overall, very curious to see how innovation is incorporated into future product plans because we saw minimal over the last 3 years

- sales operations - books were finalized anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks in Q1. as the timer for quota started, books were far off from being settled. sales requests were rarely completed in timely manner... seemed like a lack of headcount and resources able to get the job done as the current SOPs team worked tirelessly day in and day out

I remember when we started in a smaller office and all really became family. I truly never thought I would leave Glassdoor anytime soon, I thought I would have a long career there. The people I worked with will continue to be some of my best friends in Chicago, and I am thankful to Glassdoor for that.","Glassdoor is built on the principle of transparency. 

Christian, everyday you asked us to go out and fight against out competitors when we knew it was hard. We AEs/SAEs struggled, but we continued to do it, and continued to do it with comradery. We didn't make a ton of money, some of us did, most of us didn't compared to others at competitors, but we loved working at Glassdoor, and working hard because we believed in the mission. 

I don't understand what happened. One day everything was fine the next, 300 lay offs. 

We did that because you kept reassuring us that Glassdoor was going to come out on top, that if we kept working hard enough, we would have endless growth within the company. Christian, you lied to us. You brought on our Chief Economist to tell us that we are going to be able to make it through this, that we were underpaid for years because Glassdoor was preparing for some sort of inevitable downturn. You told us that we were going to be OK, and that we were well positioned for no lay offs. 

My question to you is, why did Indeed send out an email to its employees reassuring that they would not be laid off? How is it that Glassdoor let go of 300, many top sellers going to presidents club, long tenure, great experience, etc, and Indeed did not lay of any of its GTM teams? Was this the plan all along? Did you not fight to even keep your top sellers to merge into Indeed at the least? You did not protect your people, Christian. 

I am very grateful that we got the severance that we did, but the false hope you gave me really crushes me. I still can not believe what happened. I feel like I lost my family and community in Chicago in the blink of an eye. Honesty is always appreciated, and lying to us, leading us on, has lead to massive destruction. The culture you spent years building is now gone. 

I would like to quote something to you, Christian, that I read on LinkedIn:
""Laying off hundreds of people - crisis or not-is a massive leadership failure. 

Slashing jobs to save a company is like saying ""we had to throw some people overboard to save the Titanic"" and then ushering the captain to the only lifeboat. Your ship is probably sinking anyway because you have huge financial execution mismanagement problems...""..

250,Glassdoor,"A Tough Day. A Tough Day, Indeed.",2020-05-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I learned more and achieved more in my time at Glassdoor than I did anywhere else I have worked. Amazingly, one of the worst things about Glassdoor made me a stronger sales professional than I ever thought I could become. I suppose I can address those things in the cons section - so there’s your stay tuned. 

Selling Glassdoor is one of the hardest sales I have experienced. I genuinely believe that if you can sell Glassdoor, you can sell almost anything. That belief will serve me and my 300 laid off colleagues very well in their search for their next play. 

I will be forever thankful for the amazing friends I made at this company when it still existed as the Glassdoor we knew. Even though that company absolutely died stone dead on May 7th, it felt like a special place. The people on the floor are what made it special. 

We carried this place on our backs. Invested years of emotional labor in ourselves, our teammates, and our direct reports. We cared more than anyone should have about a company that sells pictures and videos to people for 1000s of dollars. 

The number of truly talented and wonderful human beings that I worked with and are now unemployed is staggering. I cannot express just how badly Glassdoor messed up by letting these people go.","The reason I was able to achieve even one thing at Glassdoor, is because there is no standardized sales process nor a true enablement team. A sales rep has to hope for a leader who knows how to sell, and that rep had better be a curious person who wants to learn and be willing to lean on your peers. 

Glassdoor is such a difficult sale with prospects usually upset about ratings, calling it a “rant site”, saying people don’t look at jobs on Glassdoor, claiming users just want to see negative reviews. Those preconceived notions were very hard to sell against. 

Thankfully, with the help of my great colleagues, I was able to develop my own sales process that helped me overperform and begin seeing success. 

Eventually, mastering that process and building great internal relationships allowed me to get into leadership where I truly got to see the stunning level of incompetence and miscommunication up close. 

I’ll try and go department by department.

I would post a gif of a tumbleweed for sales enablement if that was allowed. We were each other's sales enablement team. Ironically, not having a true sales process - one where someone can ask “What is the Glassdoor sales process?” and get a very quick, short, concise answer - is what forced me to fend for myself and learn to sell. Enablement was really good at delegating what should have been their responsibilities to the reps and managers. They were also great at being able to string together what few sales events we did have because there was very little budget pretty much constantly. 

Why didn’t Glassdoor commit to building a world class sales enablement team and roll out a standardized sales process for reps and managers to follow? I’ll never know. But they’re still employed so they must be doing something right. 

The product itself barely changed in four years. Eventually prospects will stop falling for “we have more traffic this year” when they ask what’s changed since the last time we tried to sell them Glassdoor. Once every year, the product team would tell us about very small changes they were planning to roll out at some point within the next five years. I can’t wait to see the color of the button in 2027. 

I’m not sure where to start with Sales Development. The name of the org is Sales Development. Develop sales reps. Nurture them. Don’t bully them into low paying jobs that are somehow even harder and more work than hunter and growth roles.

The SDR org was a total mess that rewarded good SDRs by “promoting” the most promising inbound reps into a tier where high Enterprise reps belittled them, refused to flip their meetings, and blamed them for any shortcomings that they refused to do anything about themselves. 

The amount of amazing AEs that came through that org did so through their own sheer will and talent, and frankly not knowing their own value - because these reps could have been making 2x the pay at literally any other sales company. 

Sales ops is rough at almost every company but I cannot fathom a more inept ops team than the one we had at Glassdoor. Their hallmark was consistently building out nonsensical books, bizarre quotas, and never, ever, ever doing any data refreshing. Here’s an idea - consult the actual front line reps before building out plans that 70% of the reps are going to miss. They finally managed to bring in one very awesome person, who we all loved, and I hope she still has a job. I can’t say her name but anyone reading this knows who I’m talking about. Wingman of the Year and well deserved. 

Senior Leadership, I just wish I could understand what value you bring. It honestly feels extremely silly that all of the conversations about promotion paths, job families, and arguing attainment vs. competence were something that occupied so much of our time and energy - and they just took it away from us with a snap of their fingers. When I say senior leadership, I mean sales senior leadership. And I mean VP level and up. I could not have asked for a better director who cared more about our people - but above the director was miscommunication, non-communication, false promises, and patchwork solutions. You and ops combined to set us up for failure. A fiscal year where less than 30% of reps and managers were able to hit quarters. The rep participation rates quarter over quarter were shameful. 

Was it the business or the product? It damn sure wasn’t the people - the managers and reps worked tirelessly to try and bring success to an organization that consistently underpaid and undervalued the talent they had. And now we’re all gone. What a shame. 

The CEO. Where to begin. When I started at Glassdoor we had Robert. And while Robert wasn’t the business person some CEOs are, Robert was a human being. He spoke his mind. He spoke with conviction. He was entertaining. I found myself wanting to work for him. That’s the very least a CEO can be. When he spoke, everyone listened. At sales kickoff, he was a highlight every year. He even came out to get drinks with the sales team despite his insistence that “sales people are the absolute worst.” Robert, cheers man. I hope you’re enjoying time with League of Legends - but when the decision was made to sell to Recruit, it seems like the writing was on the wall. 

Enter Christian Sutherland-Wong. When he wasn’t talking about his mum in literally every single all hands address, he was hiding. I don’t know where - maybe hanging out with Indeed executives. He showed up to the Chicago office maybe 2 or 3 times total in his entire tenure as CEO of what used to be Glassdoor. He showed zero ability to command an audience, bragged to us about inventing LinkedIn’s corporate culture when he was there, and did not remotely understand what we do on a daily basis. It’s no surprise he was able to make the call to fire all of us so quickly.

I remember (maybe 3-4 months ago) when he came to Chicago to speak to our sales team as we trained our reps how to effectively reach out to CEOs at companies in our books. He stumbled his way through a couple sentences of complete gibberish before exiting the room to a bunch of confused faces. He then came back and read off some words that seemed like they were straight off a marketing slide. He was always saying “people need us now more than ever” as he was putting GD on a hiring freeze of its own and eventually, swiftly, and without warning liquidating the jobs of 300 talented, wonderful people. 

Not more than a month ago, Christian told us that this was the beginning of our journey of becoming the best tool in the world for job seekers. Either he didn’t know that this was coming, while COVID was already in full swing mind you, or he’s just a liar. Either way the lack of transparency at a company that stresses transparency for OTHER companies has forever been shocking. CEOs are supposed to be able to navigate current times and be able to set up a company for the future. Apparently asking Christian to look a few weeks into the future was too tall of a task. 

He’s had a very eventful run as CEO of what used to be Glassdoor. If his mission was destroying a company in less than a year, then kudos to you my friend. Job well done."
251,Glassdoor,Transparency except for when it mattered most,2020-05-11,3.0,Account Executive,"I debated leaving this feedback because overall, this was the best job I've ever had for a number of reasons. My colleagues were incredible, and my leaders were even more-so. Leadership was genuinely dedicated to development & creating a world-class culture.","When it was clear Covid-19 was going to have a huge impact on the economy, the CEO told us in April that we were making a few small changes (pausing hiring, promotions, etc.) so that we could prevent layoffs. Fast-forward to May, we get an invite on our calendars for 30 minutes out and are told that 300 of us are laid off. Given that transparency is one of our core values, it would've been nice to have had a bit of a warning that this was potentially coming so that we could have prepared ourselves."
252,Glassdoor,Plenty of potential but heartless leaders,2020-05-11,2.0,Customer Success Manager,"The people are smart and down to earth. My team was incredible. In my experience, my manager really cared about my development, provided actionable feedback, and was always supportive and encouraging. I had work life balance and while we worked from home during COVID-19, our people team went above and beyond to provide anything we needed.","Where do I begin? The last year at Glassdoor has been a complete mess for Customer Success. Culture turned into nothing but gossiping and complaining. Even our Sales counterparts would make constant comments about how bad we had it. In hindsight, it was warranted because eventually it all blew up once the pandemic hit. Senior management is BAD, particularly in CS, and they are aware. They've shared our feedback of them and it's pitiful. They completely lack compassion in every single decision they make and constantly miss the mark. It started to become clear in the last few months that Glassdoor was really lacking vision and the ability to reinvent. Site traffic was down and our customers were bored with our offerings. CS superstars started finding new jobs/leaving. In addition, internally, there were many smaller announcements and decisions being made that were red flags to me. It felt like they were trying to cut costs in any way they could. An example would be, in Customer Success, they announced a re-classfication of employees changed us to hourly workers, and took away unlimited PTO (with no comparable alternative). This was all under the guise that it was ""legally required"" and ""in our best interest"" (so that we could get overtime). We all saw right through it. The announcement was tone deaf and dishonest. Teams started challenging the decision and then some were able to get reclassified and after feedback, they magically were able to bring unlimited PTO back (shocker) shortly before layoffs (meaning they would not owe us much if any vacation time). This is the constant theme of leadership, both in CS and company wide. There is always some shady motive to every decision. The fact that they were able to determine a layoff of 1/3 of the workforce was necessary so soon tells me all I need to know about the future of Glassdoor. They haven't been able to reinvent themselves and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before they are one with Indeed. 

I would have the same feedback if I weren't laid off."

They do such a great job hiring inspiration leaders who really care about the success of their people. I always felt supported and never ran out of opportunities to grow.,"Ever since the Recruit Holdings acquisition, a common feeling among many employees was, ""Are we just going to get swallowed up by Indeed?"". We were consistently reinsured by our CEO, Christian Sutherland-Wong that we serve different missions and will operate completely independently. 

Unfortunately, it feels like the massive round of layoffs was a convenient excuse for Glassdoor to merge with Indeed and our intuitions were correct . They got rid of our very best leaders, presidents club winners, and consistent quota achievers. That shows you where the future of Glassdoor is headed. Wouldn't be surprised if Glassdoor becomes a product Indeed sells soon.

Not once did CSW prepare us for this blindside. It seemed as if we were weathering the storm, but out of no where he emotionlessly let 300 people go."

258,Glassdoor,They will not be the same post-COVID,2020-05-10,4.0,Account Executive,"Gave sales reps 3 months of earnings (base/ OTE commission/PTO) when we were laid off. Proves C-levels truly cared about their employees. The work-life balance, the people, and the solutions being sold made the company one of the best places to work in Chicago. This all will do a 180 once COVID-19 passes.","Laid off ""30%"" of its workforce. Company culture/pay metrics/management will all change from what you see in 2019 reviews. Glassdoor will eventually be taken under from a larger firm in the industry, so if you work for this company, in due time you will likely undergo a company switch."
259,Glassdoor,An unfortunate end but great experience,2020-05-09,5.0,Account Executive,Company really led with its' values to the very bitter end. It was a great thing until the layoffs.,"There weren't any real cons other than the seismic shifts that were happening with the business regarding its partnership with its parents company. It felt like that a lot of the values that the company was supposed to lead with was also being dictated by the needs of the parent company at times. Timelines for internal promotions were seldom truthful because of business needs. Otherwise, I want nothing more than Glassdoor to weather this storm to the best it can."
260,Glassdoor,Indoor,2020-05-09,2.0,Account Manager,"Smart people, good benefits, good recruiting team","It's actually tough to sell a product with no real value for its clients, it's a very expensive platform and we were asked to be inventive to try to show some sort of ROI.
The ""Indeed"" model of selling jobs is not what the Glassdoor community is expecting, we expect transparency and clients are basically paying to hide reviews and put marketing content in front of candidates. I wouldn't be surprised to see you two merging.

In the end, you're just a number, and you have to show appreciation to your management everyday if you want to climb the ladder.
You might see sales reps overly nice with management even though they are not performing, but they will get promoted, don't ask why."

-Great People
-Your reporting manager was often a fantastic person. 
-Awesome Offices","When I started at Glassdoor they were very much a company that wore their values on their sleeves. Heck I would say till this day they still do that to a degree. However, the reason it felt they followed their morals was due to how the company would always have us heavily involved in important topics like company direction. So, whenever something negative happened or we had to make a tough call it felt justifiable and relatable. 

However, Glassdoor was acquired part way though my tenure. I have seen this before and how it can completely change a company and of course feared the worse. However, they said much would not change and little did to their credit. Well that was till 2020 hit us… 

The company stopped talking to us directly and even our managers and continuously made decisions at what felt like a drop of a hat. We often see meetings put on our calendar that were not planned to randomly announce some sort of company wide change. Our mangers would often be aghast as they were cut off from the loop of information as well. Some of these changes removed large benefits, complete reconstructing of our teams and products, and leaning on outside resourcing vs using internal resources. Honestly, things you expect almost like a trope after a company has been an acquired. They also recently laid off a bunch of people with a same day of notice. As a company that is fueled by fantastic people and (was?) is a great company culture you made a decision that prevented us from giving proper goodbyes. This is not something that would have ever happened if it were a year or two ago. Glassdoor is slowly losing what made it unique and I imagine you wait a year or two before joining. I am sure there will be even bigger changes they make down the road that will completely change the shape of the company. Who knows maybe it will be a good company to work for still but I doubt the “people” aspect will ever be the same."

The leaders and managers I've had the chance to work closely with shatter stereotypes by being highly approachable, innovative, and (most importantly) humble. Overinflated egos are virtually non-existent at Glassdoor, and recruiters are trained to value and search for humility in candidates who are hired. I consider my team and managers not only people I deeply admire and respect, but people who are close friends and allies. Executive leadership values the opinions and feedback of every person within the company regardless of tenure, and I have seen them pivot strategy and implement changes based off feedback received by employees that other companies would consider toward the ""bottom of the food chain.""

Leaders are clearly still ""figuring things out,"" but are at least honest about that to employees.

268,Glassdoor,Glassdoor truly lives its company values,2020-04-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The camaraderie at Glassdoor is unparalleled.  I've worked at places where each department felt like it had its own goals and everything was disjointed, but here I feel like we're all one team working towards the same goals. 

The executive team is committed to transparency and it shows. I've been especially impressed at the level of communication that's taken place since COVID-19. This is a challenging time for a lot of companies, and the uncertainty that comes with it can be anxiety producing for many. I feel like leadership has really stepped up to give us frequent updates on the status of things within the company and how they're thinking through problems and ways to be fiscally responsible. 

Early on when I joined Glassdoor, I really wasn't sure if I had made the right decision.  There were a lot of issues on the team I joined and some toxic players. I often felt discouraged and didn't think I had a solid career path ahead of me. But the evolution of the company since I've joined and the way they've stepped up to help employees and their families during this time has been nothing short of inspiring. I am beyond grateful to work here in a career that I love.","We have a pretty meetings heavy culture which can get in the way of productivity.

269,Glassdoor,Glassdoor put it's people first and works to protect us,2020-04-02,5.0,Enterprise Account Manager,"I joined this organization a little less than a year ago and was impressed right off the bat. They are very dedicated to their people and take feedback very seriously.  Working within a growth role, it's nerve-racking to know if targets and quotas are attainable.  I can now tell you. #1. Yes, it is realistic #2. Glassdoor actually adjusts targets if forecasting is off. I have never been in an organization that is proactive in this way or cares so much about doing right by clients. 

However, it is the last few months that have really defined the kind of company Glassdoor is. Starting in early January, the coronavirus was on the radar of our leadership team. Quite frankly, they were messaging about it before anyone knew much about it or cared. 

Leadership also made the decision to have us work from home and cancel travel weeks before other companies. They worked non-stop to provide us the resources and supplies we need. The messaging around this was that taking care of us and our families was a top priority. They have been flexible with everyone to figure out how we navigate this time professionally and personally.","I think there are challenges within any organization.

It was been amazing to see how dedicated this company has been to keeping us safe and healthy. They have provided vast resources to make sure that our transition to home is as smooth as possible.

Early this year, areas of the company were changed from unlimited PTO to 15 days. The CS leadership heard our feedback and fought to ensure unlimited PTO was put back in place.  This is immensely comforting to know that we have flexibility if us or a loved one falls ill. 

Over the past month especially, I have seen our leadership listen and make decisions that are in our best interest and I have seen my peers come together in the face of a lot of challenges.  

This is the company that I fell in love with and I am proud to be part of this.",A month ago I would have said to listen to your employees feedback and take action accordingly but I can now say that Glassdoor is doing this and is a strong example of how a company should respond during difficult times.

273,Glassdoor,Ideal culture turns out to be TOXIC,2020-03-13,1.0,Enterprise Customer Success Manager,"Nice office, great health benefits, good clients, and some really fun coworkers","I thought this was a dream company but then realized its composed of individuals who are resistant to change and forward thinking. The culture has turned around within a year and now is toxic.  People are unhappy and rapidly leaving while leadership continues to distance themselves from problems. 

We strive to be the best of the best (as we should since we are a review site for companies) but fall short in culture, internal communication, vacation benefits, and innovation. 

Front line managers and directors are out of touch with the day to day workload and job duties. They are almost never in contact with clients and lack the skill and willingness to support you with internal navigation and problem solving because of system problems. Employees are rewarded for staying quiet and putting their head down instead of welcoming feedback, new ideas, and improving the status quo. 

Colocation is encouraged by leadership but not enforced for themselves. Without local leadership, the culture will continue to deteriorate. 

Unlimited PTO removed on 2/1/2020 as we are now hourly employees. Work life balance was one of the main reasons people stuck around. But now more and more teammates are leaving each month.  Rollout of this change was poorly communicated caused more disconnect with leadership. 

CSMs partner with sales to service and renews accounts, however there is a huge imbalance of work between the two teams. They have been working on roles and responsibilities for MONTHS and NOTHING has changed.  Again, another way that this team is unwilling to face problems and work on positive outcomes."
274,Glassdoor,CS is not the place to be right now,2020-03-12,3.0,Customer Success,The colleagues I work with are fantastic. My current manager is supportive and  does care a lot. This has made my time at Glassdoor more positive than negative! The people at Glassdoor are all friendly and willing to help each other out.,CS leaders are nowhere to be found.  They do not appear invested in CS people. Managers are not all tenured and sometimes managers are just placed in the roles without the experience. CS people want industry mentors to help us succeed in our job and overall career. Promotions are random and competencies change constantly making it a moving target. It’s a painful process to watch.
275,Glassdoor,Avoid at all costs,2020-03-09,1.0,Customer Success,Used to be unlimited PTO but I hear they’ve now taken that away as well.,"Favoritism, avoidance of conflict by disciplining anyone who speaks up, lack of rewards nor competitive comp (I hear they’ve also demoted all CS to hourly and taken away their unlimited PTO), I could continue. Glassdoor’s CS org is an absolute mess and has been for over a year.

 A certain Leader has dismantled the entire org and left countless employees in their wake. They rule with an “off with your head” mentality. A beloved and well liked leader before them was fired with seemingly no explanation until shortly after they assumed his role. Whatever lightheartedness and trust that was left in CS evaporated over the last six months I was there. After voicing concerns about my manager who was eventually terminated (which was a 16+ month ordeal the CS team had to deal with I won’t get into)  I had the misfortune of being on said leaders radar. 

Our team never had KPIs, and it was always said to be something that was coming. In a team meeting said leader announced they would need “at least a year” to have solid performance metrics, once again postponing them. This was a turning point for me as  they were extremely defensive and combative when we said it had already been almost two years without them.  They just could not understand. No empathy. Fine, another year. 

Despite documented positive performance reviews up until this point, my final review was brutal which also meant I missed out on my bonus I worked hard for.  Then I found myself being invited to a vaguely titled  “meeting” with the leader at the end of the week at 2 pm.  I was understandably very nervous.

During the “meeting” they spent 40 minutes asking me repeatedly “what do you want to do?” badgering me in ways that felt like an interrogation instead of whatever they thought this “meeting” was. They told me things like “people” called me “toxic”. Yes, those words. When someone in a position of power speaks to you that way it has the ability to make you question a whole lot about yourself. It was the low point of my entire career. I felt sick that I’d somehow ended up at a company where they condoned this kind of behavior. 

Luckily I am experienced enough to know exactly what they were doing to try and get me to resign after I’d spoken up one too many times. I fear others may not have been able to take the insults. When I pushed back and asked the intention of the meeting and if they could understand how it would be jarring for a junior staff member to have a meeting with a leader added to their calendar with zero context - once again they were incredibly defensive and claimed I should have known it was coming. (I didn’t, I had some of the highest numbers on the team and great relationships at the office). 

I made up my mind to leave that day and leave I did, but it’s important I call out why. This is still happening. I know others have been called out as well. The lack of professionalism and blatant disregard for feedback has made for a horrible work environment that continues to deteriorate. People work in fear of having to answer to leadership or opening an email with another decision resulting in a major change with zero benefit to the employee. The irony of the company being “Glassdoor” is palpable. I know other departments are better, but I urge you to not join CS. They do not care about tenure, intent, merit, or grit - they only care about egos and bottom lines. I watched countless people leave and my biggest regret is waiting so long before I did myself. I kept thinking things would change and they did, just never anything but for the worse. Truly a nightmare."

More specific to my role, I believe that the leaders in the sales organization have a genuine belief in our mission, and in the value of our products.

I appreciate the investment in organized sales tools, but there is a lack of freedom and resources for individual employees to achieve their own personalized growth strategies. 

At the higher level of the sales organization there is a lack of female representation in the single revenue contributor roles.  The reason for this lack of representation needs to be acknowledged more openly at the company.  See Advice below."

I joined because of the people, the values, and the mission. Since joining, I have experienced incredible leadership, career development, and built great relationships. We practice what we preach and I've seen continued transparency from our senior leadership and beyond.","As a large tech company in the recruitment space, it's vital we continue to innovate our product and what we offer the job seeker and companies we partner with.

279,Glassdoor,RUN AWAY FROM  CUSTOMER SUCCESS,2020-03-03,1.0,,"Mostly friendly people
Nice office in West Loop","Where do I begin.... 

Incompetent managers that can’t really help us do our jobs better- things are always breaking down and we have to face the brunt of it when customers complain. 

Recently switched all of Customer Success to hourly vs. salaried, yet we have the same quota and additional KPIs to meet to make a fraction of what our Sales counterparts make. 

The CS org already does most of the heavy lifting for the Sales team,  (building decks, running calls, and teeing up opportunities) it wouldn’t be that difficult for us to learn how to send contracts out. 

Switching CS to hourly is not going to incentivize us to “deliver great client experiences” instead you’re telling us to view our jobs as a paycheck."
280,Glassdoor,Take a look into senior leadership,2020-03-03,2.0,Account Executive,"Flexible hours, the people for the most part, snacks, company outings","Senior leadership preaches transparency every single day yet hides a lot of things behind closed doors. Furthermore, they don't set up outside sales hires for success. The book of account are a mess, bad data, tons of time is spent cleaning those up day in an day out and they teach pressure selling which causes great opportunities/accounts to never want to talk with us again."
281,Glassdoor,"Great Place, Better People",2020-03-03,5.0,Marketing,"Glassdoor is the best place I have ever worked.  Beyond the great benefits, Glassdoor prides itself on transparency and inclusion unlike any place I have ever seen before.  They truly go out of their way to live their mission internally.  The best part about this place though is by far the people.  It is a collection of smart, caring, and passionate people that make going to work every day a joy.",Glassdoor is still getting it's footing post acquisition and creating the path for what the next 5 years will look like.

282,Glassdoor,Great place to work!,2020-03-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Glassdoor is the best place I have worked so far. It is one of those ""good for the soul"", ""must have this work experience sometime in my life"" types of places. Outside of the opportunity for growth and impact, these are a few of my favorite things:

People: Every day I get to work alongside incredibly smart, mission-driven individuals who have low/no ego. It is such a refreshing experience, especially in Bay Area tech.

Mission: There are few things as impactful as helping someone find a job and company they love. There is a lot of dignity associated with work and being able to help someone on their journey is incredibly rewarding. 

Product: Glassdoor disrupted the market. It is exhilarating being part of a company that continues to redefine the workplace and who gets access to what information. I enjoy helping level the playing field.","We recently stepped into a scaling phase. While there is a tremendous amount of opportunity, there are also quite a few growing pains. We are at an inflection point where we need to mature our organization and operations to rapidly scale. We are on our way but it's not always easy. 

The people that tend to be the most successful at Glassdoor during this phase are curious, adaptable and work well with ambiguity."

289,Glassdoor,A lot of noise and not enough innovation,2019-12-19,3.0,Customer Success Manager,"I am so thankful for all the amazing people I work beside everyday! The people in the Enterprise Sales & Customer Success department are some of the most genuine and fun coworkers I've ever had. 
There is also a lot of great knowledge sharing between peers, which makes work more enjoyable and  interesting. 

There are many pros to working here including: 
- managers that treat you like a real human - they really try to be good managers!
- a lot of autonomy to manage your book of business / client interactions 
- flexibility to work from home a few times per month 
- ability to work on projects outside of your immediate role that interest you 
- cute workplace events that happen at the office (eg. hot chocolate bar during the holidays, drag queen bingo during pride week, etc) and a great Workplace Experience team","The direction Glassdoor is taking seems unclear to me, and the lack of innovation is concerning. The product team does not listen to what the customers are asking for or excited about. 

It seems like directors and VPs are focused on reorganizing how the company works internally more than focusing on innovation. There are constant shifts in KPIs, org structure, and quotas that make everything seem arbitrary. This year, the CSM leadership changed the metric which 70% of our bonus is paid out on, and gave us no way of tracking our progress to reaching that quarterly goal! I appreciate change and trying new things, but it's really concerning when your pay is affected by changes that you can't track. 

With all the org changes come lots of internal meetings that managers are always stuck in. It seems like instead of being on the floor with the individual contributors, managers/ directors are constantly in strategy meetings. Besides team meetings and 1:1s, there is very little involvement/ personal connection between leadership and individual contributors. A lot of first time managers/ directors. 

Lastly, we use a data tool to create custom presentations for enterprise clients that barely works. Our systems are so out of date, that it takes 15 min - 2 hours to download a custom report for a client. This drains a lot of time, and creates frustration."
290,Glassdoor,Loved My Time Here,2019-12-13,4.0,Team Manager,"Glassdoor is…

-making the world a better place by helping people make informed career decisions and by -helping employers attract and retain top talent. 
-providing culture-rich offices and teams.  
-creating life-changing career opportunities for many employees.
-making meaningful improvements to the user experience. 
-supporting employees in new ways with the creation of niche support roles. 
-humble enough to identify what needs fixing and try to course correct.
-growing quickly in EMEA, now with effective leadership across all functions. 
-led by increasingly strong leaders who enable growth and inspire others.","POSITIONING: GD is still often viewed as an Employer Branding site vs. a multi-pronged Talent solution.

VALUE: Customer ROI is highly subjective and often difficult to quantify. The result is that GD account teams feel pressure to accommodate any amount of one-off requests (i.e. people-please) instead of strategically execute on a defined success plan.  

SLAs: Service specifics and value delivery are largely undefined and left open to interpretation

SCALE: many tasks and processes remain manual and time-consuming, pulling employees out of non-core activity."
291,Glassdoor,Sales at Glassdoor,2019-12-10,3.0,,The best part of working at Glassdoor is 100% the people. I made a lot of great friends at Glassdoor the culture and the people are amazing compared to other tech companies which the people seem to be the same type of person all around! People &culture 10/10 would recommend,Money...I would have stayed at Glassdoor forever Bc of the people if the salary wasn’t so low. Hard to get away from that.  Once the acquisition happened as well so many leaders left the company that originally sold me on Glassdoor In interviews. The product hasn’t changed at all much  in years and constantly have all hands on how we made the green button blue now. But if you are looking for great people to work beside GD is the right choice but unfortunately when money is king especially in the most expensive place to live in the USA it tends to be the deciding factor.
292,Glassdoor,Not a good place,2019-12-09,1.0,Engineer,Good location close to home,"Bad management, bad benefits. People not treated nicely."
293,Glassdoor,"Constantly Underdelivering, Equating to Constant Disappointment",2019-12-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Glassdoors culture is absolutely amazing!!! I feel privileged to continuously work with intelligent and innovative colleagues each and every day. The problem is the organization is not innovative enough to keep up with its talent.
The benefits and Unlimited PTO are very attractive.
 More of a ""go with the flow"" type of personality, is required here. Bubbly, happy, positive people are definitely more favorable.  There are many opportunities for growth if you work under a good manager that supports your promotional career trajectory.","I walked into Glassdoor bright-eyed and bushy-tailed with big hopes, dreams, and plans. SMB Org has slowly starting to dissolve those ones by one. Although a culturally progressive company, it's like Glassdoor is stuck in a strange managerial, technological and structural timewarp.

1) SMB Leadership- there have been many instances where leadership has failed to step up to provide solutions to problems that highly impact the business and our contributors. In addition to not owning up to mistakes or errors that negatively impacted these teams. Underqualified Managers, questionable behaving Directors and an extreme trend of protected nepotism that is discouraging. I have quickly lost faith in Leaderships' ability to move Sales and Customer Success in a direction that more sustainable for clients and colleagues. Lacking grit, lacking innovation, lacking leadership qualities all in all, smooth talkers deflectors and reframers, unchanged Glint Feedback year after year with regular over-promised and underdelivers. 

2) HR- is underqualified and ill-equipped to handle difficult conversations and or make difficult decisions. There have been multiple potential legal situations that have been mishandled or miscommunicated. I question their ability to cultivate an obtain psychological safety.

3) FLUFF- there is a lot of caution around communication and tone. There is also a lot of unmeaningful dialogue that occurs frequently that prevent projects from getting done and initiatives or decisions being made. Too many opinions and to much input is sought and given to be decisive and efficient in a timely manner.

4) Comp- Pay is low all around the board.  Pay is not competitive to Tech Industry market standards in the bay area according to Tableau. I am 10k+ under-market and many of my colleagues are much more. Ambiguous performance metrics, more often than not negatively impact comp. I came for the culture and not for the pay... but I'm quickly learning that might have been a big mistake.

5) TURNOVER- Chances of inheriting an unhealthy book and performing extreme measures to ""revive"" it are high.  GD is bleeding clients faster than we can gain them. Also, some need to be prepared to have difficult conversations with your clients about you being the 3rd 4th or 5th rep that they have been introduced to that same calendar year due to individuals leaving the business or lost to internal promotions without transition plans.

6) Lack of resources invested and shared throughout the whole org from SMB-ENT. Also severely understaffed. 

If any of these are red flags for you as an independent contributor, I would move forward with caution."
294,Glassdoor,There is a fine line between fishing and standing on the shore looking like an idiot.,2019-11-26,1.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"The main reason I would recommend working at Glassdoor is the salary and the product itself.
Glassdoor is a must-have solution for any company looking to showcase their employer branding and looking to attract top-level jobseekers.
One Enterprise Sales Manager is a credit, not because there is only really one but because they are human and look after their employees.","The EMEA Leadership team thanks to its inability to do anything productive when it comes to supporting employees. I mean how many leaders do you know who think the best approach to overcome a poor employee survey is to cry about it before terminating the employment of several dedicated employees????
The biggest no-no for new employees is to do what was asked of them and be successful by actually closing business and creating relationships. You are better off doing nothing for 6 months, telling a few jokes, saying yes all the time and offering up pipe-line dreams. 
I wouldn't recommend Glassdoor EMEA to anyone unless you have a history of working with snakes and don't mind the hiss."

298,Glassdoor,Still Feeling the Culture After 5 Years,2019-10-30,4.0,Senior Director,"-I have been at Glassdoor for close to 5 years, and have seen a lot of growth and changes. 

-Taken together, Glassdoor is the best place I have ever worked. The culture is friendly but very smart, without huge egos getting in the way of our mission. My team is like a family to me, and overall the culture is empathetic, collaborative, and positive. 

-As a startup, people at Glassdoor were attracted by our mission to help people find a job and company that they love. Although we have grown dramatically during my time here, our CEO has been a north star for our culture, preserving it despite turnover, setbacks, growth, and successes. 

-Overall, the acquisition of the company by Recruit Holdings was a net positive for employees. Many long-time employees were handsomely rewarded by their cashed out stock options. It was honorable of the company to continue to pay out options after the acquisition, and showed the CEO's respect for employees. 

-Little has changed in the company since the acquisition. There have been no layoffs, no major operational changes, and even a few efficiencies on the engineering side from better coordination with our sister companies. 

-There were substantial pay raises for most employees after the acquisition, which brought up pay to SF Bay Area market rates. My comp today is even or above most competitors for similar roles. 

-We have preserved our great benefits package despite our growth and maturity as an employer. We still offer unlimited vacation, free lunch (in Mill Valley at least) and pretty terrific health coverage. 

-People with families are encouraged to take time off, and work flexibly to make sure their home responsibilities are covered. People work hard, but there is not a ""spend 10 hours at your desk"" culture here -- people work from home, take meetings via Zoom, communicate via Slack, and get the same amount of work done while also creating space for home life. 

-The company HQ is moving to SF in Fall 2020 (finally) which will dramatically improve commutes for many employees and will help us with recruiting SF talent as well. Marin is beautiful, but there is a reason no other major tech players have offices here -- there is no commercial real estate, no one can afford to live in Marin except execs, there are fires + flooding + power outages in Marin regularly, and you are on an island far away from SF making casual networking impossible. It's time for Glassdoor to put on its big-boy pants and finally move into the city like a real company -- that's finally happening now.","-My impression of our Product and Engineering orgs after 5 years here is that they are fairly conservative and slow-moving. We are behind the curve technically in many areas, and our roadmaps move really slowly. I don't know what the solution is, but lack of innovation on product and engineering are a serious long-term problem we face. 

-We are a tiny player in our competitive space, and that's not changing much over time. That lack of rapid upward momentum in terms of our business is very different than in the early years here, and it's sometimes hard to stay motivated without big growth prospects in the future. My team is growing really slowly (if at all) and feels like treading water sometimes. 

-I think we are moving too slowly in moving our HQ into San Francisco. For too long our physical location has been unduly influenced (in my opinion) by where our executive team has chosen to buy homes. Most employees are in SF or East Bay, not Marin, and there is a huge disconnect between the personal interests of execs who would like a short commute and the majority of the talent base who bears the cost of long commutes, lack of quality public transit, and unaffordable real estate for us to be in Marin. If we want to be a real company, we need to act like one and move to where the talent is -- not where our exec team wants to have a pleasant lifestyle (and can afford to live). 

-Our data infrastructure is not great. This is a hard problem to solve, at least with current leadership on the relevant teams. But other tech companies have figured this out, and we could do better. Data is too slow, not well documented, not widely accessible, and hard for product managers and business decision makers to get access to."
299,Glassdoor,Found a job and company I love,2019-10-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Learning opportunities: I feel tremendously lucky to be in a job where I learn something new everyday and where my team encourages me to experiment, learn and develop. I was also able to switch teams internally and I'm very thankful to my managers for giving me the opportunity.
- Mission: I joined Glassdoor because I believe in the mission and it's kept me motivated to tough it out during rough patches at work. Almost every employee can recite the company mission word-for-word and it feels so great to hear positive stories from users who've been helped by our work.
- Manager/leadership: My manager is great, constantly gives me good feedback and advocates for us constantly. I have a lot of confidence in my department leadership; I feel like they really take our feedback to heart.
- People & culture: The people are great and the culture is very welcoming and friendly. I really enjoy working with my team and have a lot of respect for the teammates, mentors and leaders I've met here.
- Work/life balance: My manager & team leaders very actively promote flexibility, making sure we can WFH when needed or that we aren't checking email when on vacation (unlimited PTO too!).","- Small company with growing pains: We're working on getting processes and operations in place to scale, but there are definitely growing pains—priority pivots, under-resourcing, immature formal mentorship/training, etc.
- Technical growing pains: There's also growing pains on the technical side. Data accessibility is a constant issue—#1 day-to-day frustration for me.
- Post-acquisition plan: I think we're still finding our footing. There's been a fair amount of turnover as we reorient towards the next big milestone.
- Experience varies by team: While some teams are doing great, others are struggling. It can be slow to rectify under-resourcing because of budget, management, etc."
300,Glassdoor,Finance Team is Great!,2019-10-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,You will be hard pressed to find a finance team that cares more about its people.  Tons of opportunities for growth in a rapidly expanding global company. The people and culture are wonderful.,They operate at bare minimum staff and are wait too long to open new roles. Work life balance is sometimes a challenge as a result but the leaders are working hard to fix that and build out the team.
301,Glassdoor,"Great place to grow your career, interested to see what's next...",2019-10-08,4.0,Sales,"I spent a large chunk of years growing my career at Glassdoor. From the start my colleagues became fast friends, mentors, and long lasting relationships. It was (and still is) super easy to find a manager who will invest in you, or a dedicated mentor, or a leader from another department that will help you grow your career. Some of the best people leaders are at Glassdoor: intuitive, kind, understanding people, and most who are leading responsibly, gently guiding reps to be consistent and dedicated to success. 

Career growth, especially in the beginning of my time was accessible in every way.  There are more processes in place now, but if you have a strong reputation and work hard, it will get recognized. Leaders have always put my best interests and asks first, building trust and loyalty. 

If you have been burned by managers in the past, come here and gain a more positive experience.","Glassdoor has become an interesting place in the last year. In Chicago, there is plenty of growth, excitement and proactive dedication to culture and unity. As employees move up in the organization, there is more and more flexibility to your schedule and process, especially in sales. This can be good/bad at the same time. 

At the Enterprise level, it was difficult to feel motivated to hold yourself to a higher standard, to continue growing in your sales skills or trial out new processes, which may just be the stage the company is at.

From an organizational perspective, in terms of trajectory, Glassdoor’s future seems fuzzy. I often found myself feeling like we are plateauing. Product hasn’t developed in years (truly), and senior leaders come and go, which can be difficult news to hear in the Bay Area specifically. Tenured employees, including leaders, seem checked out. Yet, I believe leadership recognizes this and are looking to step up their game, but need insight and outside resources to understand as to how to make a large culture shift like this."
302,Glassdoor,good company,2019-10-03,4.0,Sales,"- great benefits (hours, PTO, insurance, parental leave policy)

- little to no training
- distant from HQ, no interactions with senior leadership
- cross functional teams all disconnected (sdr --> ae --> am)"
303,Glassdoor,"Great people, tough job.",2019-10-02,3.0,Account Executive,"Virtually everyone in that office has a great sense of humor and makes it much easier to spend 40+ hours a week there. The sales floor is the most collaborative I have worked on - reps really go above and beyond to help their peers. That's largely due to excellent Sales Managers and Directors. However, when it's all said and done, Monday Moves is the lifeblood of this organization.","Most of the downsides to the role aren't exclusive to Glassdoor, Sales is just a hard job. That being said, reps can feel like they're on an island due to poor communication across departments. Customer Support/on-boarding is lacking for smaller clients, Sales Operations seems to be a department with two full time employees, and I was genuinely shocked to learn we even have a Marketing Department. To Glassdoor's credit, the interdepartmental struggles have been a priority and I'm confident they'll continue to improve."
304,Glassdoor,My Experience at Glassdoor so far,2019-09-26,3.0,Software Engineer(Internship),"- free food, dogs on campus, serene location, reasonably understanding management","- work environment can be a little stressful at times

305,Glassdoor,"Great Company, Uncertain Direction",2019-09-18,4.0,Account Executive,"Outstanding Senior Leadership, particularly in the Enterprise space.  There are wonderful people in every part of the organization - the entire workforce is committed to the company's wonderful mission of connecting everyone with a job that they love.  There is also incredible work/life balance.","Rapidly deteriorating internal processes - particularly Sales Ops along with some functions such as legal and finance - that ultimately inhibit sales rather than enable them.  Some of these orgs are understaffed, too many of these processes exist in slack channels that aren't responsive.  Strategically,  there is too much of an emphasis on the Customer Success and Self Serve functions and not nearly enough focus on further product development and innovation that will help sales land new logos and help account management grow existing business.  Lastly, the LTIPS are not the least bit meaningful."
306,Glassdoor,A critical inflection point,2019-09-18,3.0,Sales Development Representative,"Amazing benefits program, casual office, free snacks, tons of events and happy hours.  Great existing product that works really well, and some of the best people you'll ever work with.","Glassdoor is in the critical stages of post-startup mode.  The acquisition by Recruit Holdings was supposed to provide the financial backing and fuel needed to accelerate the already high growth the company was experiencing.  Instead it's left the organization in a sea of turnover (particularly in leadership) and left boots on the ground employees with far more questions than answers.  For a company who's entire existence is centered around employer transparency, internal communications are impressively opaque.  Changes continue to be communicated last minute and fundamental business issues go months without any updates from leadership.  As someone on the sales team, the 4 departments that support sales efforts (being Marketing, Product, Sales Operations, and Sales Enablement) are all woefully incompetent and mismanaged.  Marketing has no idea how to string together grammatically correct sentences, let alone educate employers on our unique value proposition.  Product has finally pushed forward 1 meaningful update to the solution that we can sell, the first in the nearly 19 months I worked here.  I legitimately have no idea what they do all day.  Sales Operations is constantly understaffed and stuck under inefficient manual processes that keep them constantly behind on their caseload while basic pieces of our Salesforce instance fail to work properly.  Sales Enablement is either spending their time running trainings that are either totally redundant or of little value, or they are doing seemingly nothing at all.  We went more than 9 months as a team without a single training run by Enablement until they were finally able to scrape together enough budget to bring in an outside sales trainer for 1 day.

Meanwhile, the company is struggling to maintain sales volume and seems to have no answer to this problem.  Most managers are still running 1 on 1 meetings with their direct reports that have little substance.  Very little is going on in terms of coaching and development, just a lot of people relying on the same old strategies that no longer work.  As a result, a lot of their best employees have left the company for greener pastures."
307,Glassdoor,Great place to work,2019-08-20,4.0,Sales,"Very strong mission which we all believe in,  working towards more transparency when applying for jobs. The people are great to work with and management are inspiring, particularly the CEO. The pay and bonus structure is strong and targets seem achievable. Really nice offices throughout, particularly in Chicago. Get to work with amazing clients with a truly fantastic product, its enjoyable to talk about Glassdoor all day, especially as I completely believe in all that they stand for.","Lots of people banging the drum here but benefits in the UK need to get better to encourage people join/stay, they currently aren't in line with other tech firms of this type. Most countries outside UK at Glassdoor seem to have unlimited PTO including Ireland, but in London we have only 25 days, why is this?  Maternity pay in the UK is really poor also, which does not support females in this role when starting a family, which ultimately will not support a diverse female environment in the office."
308,Glassdoor,We need a better internal interview process,2019-08-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Opportunities for internal candidates to be interviewed for promotions and cross functional opportunities,"We do not treat our internal candidates the same as external candidates. Not only was it a multi-month long process but the recruiters paid no attention to the process. The recruiter actually missed our first ""interview"" with no explanation. It was a less than pleasing process from there. While they provided interview prep, which was welcomed, there was no follow up after any interviews and no expectations set for timelines or feedback. I love working at Glassdoor but if this was an external candidate, this would be a horrible process and first impression."

313,Glassdoor,"Great company, declining Customer Success Org",2019-07-18,2.0,Customer Success Manager,"I love my team and co-workers. They make coming into work fun! Our benefits are also great with unlimited PTO, a new 401K match and healthcare 100% paid for the employee.","The CS org has evolved quite a bit over the last couple of years, which has been great however leadership does not listen to their employees and there has been a lot of grey area. 

The first layer is our roles and responsibilities. Leadership continues to give us more responsibility while sales sits around all day and only sends out contracts. They are getting paid significantly more while we are managing accounts, building relationships, identifying and tee-ing up growth opportunities, building all of the decks, and owning almost all communication,  all the while trying to hit our KPI's. If we are holding all of the responsibility, we should be compensated the same way sales is. 

The second layer has to do with our KPI's. With the change to MCV, it is completely unreasonable to get our quotas over a month and a half into the quarter. Not only that, but problems that were identified early on were not fixed until after the end of the quarter. During the first quarter,  our management team told us that KPI's would not change anymore because pacing is obsolete and we can only make the target so low and that product adoption cannot move anymore because it would be unattainable, but here we are a few months later and both of these KPI's have changed. On top of that, we were told we are not moving to marketplace pace yet we are now piloting it. The constant flip flopping and lack of transparency does not give anyone faith in leadership."

Office in Marin on water","Senior execs are out of touch, petty and fail regularly at good communication. Leadership at all levels like to talk about transparency but do not walk their talk. No females on board of directors. Executive team very male-centric. Decisions are made by the few at the top while others are left to manage the day to day with low pay and very low team morale everywhere. Favoritism abounds on finance team, with one select group getting very obvious preferential treatment. 

Culture is young, clique-ish, immature. Salaries are low and HR likes to make excuses for not giving people raises commiserate with their titles, promotions, experience and past performance. Lots of excuses why things cannot be done for certain people while rules are bent or flat-out ignored for others.

People with no management experience are promoted without adequate training. 

Overall, the same old same old - there are pets who get the money and the promotions. If you dare raise your voice about a sincere concern or problem, you're vilified. Poor behavior and harassment overlooked if you've been at the company long enough. Members of the leadership team are overly dramatic and have temper tantrums. If you are an individual contributor, you are expected to suck up this behavior. Men are treated differently than women. Favoritism abounds."
318,Glassdoor,Great Place to Work!!,2019-06-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I love Glassdoor. It truly is a great place to work and management cares about each individual person.,Growing quickly and there has been a lot of changes. Some times for the good and some times for the bad.
319,Glassdoor,"A Rapidly Declining Culture, Values and Environment",2019-06-03,3.0,Sales,"Career development & growth: I have been working at Glassdoor for 3 years and have been promoted 3 times which is amazing because once you build your internal brand and perform well, chances are that you will get promoted. Like any other organization you need to play your cards well and build the right reputation and relationships to speed up your promotion track, but overall, movements do happen frequently.

Great benefits & work life balance: Free catered lunch (amazing), dog friendly office (it helps owners and other employees to feel emotionally supported with so many cute dogs in our teams), 401K match (this took a few years but it's amazing that we have it now), very flexible PTO policy as long as you are performing on your numbers, awesome health/dental policies and an ok working from home policy. 

Office location: This is tough for people that live in the city or if they don't have a car to drive to the office, but being right on the water in the Marin county has elevated the company culture and it's refreshing to work in this beautiful ""suburb"" only 4 miles north of SF/Marina neighborhood. 

Lower Management: I have had 4 different managers here and every single one of them were amazing human beings, very empathetic, always supporting reps, passionate about our career and personal development and overall very hard working people that is extremely hard to find in the bay area  especially in Sales.","Upper management & executive team: Leadership is very removed from the needs and struggles of the lower end of the workforce - with the most recent news of Glassdoor HQ moving to the city, I was expecting a more reasonable announcement to get employees more excited and pumped about moving to SF. But, because they are so disconnected with what we need, it was a very disappointing announcement in our monthly all-hands meeting and actually quiet insulting. Yes, we all understand that moving to the city is more beneficial to attract new talent and grow our company. However, just being located in the city doesn't get Glassdoor the ""top talent"" we are looking for - it certainly makes it easier but if we are not considering a competitive perks & benefits package in addition to our ""hot new office in the city"" this will only get us the average candidate that can't get hired at other hot companies/startups in the city. 

This is not the first time that upper management has made announcements without reasonable preparation or understanding of employees needs and concerns. In fact, during the all hands meeting, when we were raising our hands to share our concerns/ask questions, a few leaders were laughing at our comments and making it sound like we were ridiculous for surfacing these concerns which was both insulting and disappointing. Additionally, for a company that always preaches ""transparency"" and ""culture"" they didn't consider for once how people will react to these not very well presented announcements and made it very obvious that ultimately the decisions will be made regardless of the impacts they may have on people's lives and there is no room for review, hence why I am very disheartened by leadership and their decision making process. 

Priorities: If you are an engineer or a technical talent looking for a job at Glassdoor, this is the right time because literally that's all they care about - if you are in Sales or Customer success, think twice because we are not given the right resources or teams to help us success in our roles. 

Customer Success:"
320,Glassdoor,Diversity & career progression: let's lead by example,2019-05-21,4.0,Sales,"Glassdoor UK and EMEA in general is still small - sub 100 people. We celebrate successes and there is a feeling of a close-knit team.  Relaxed working environment and pay is good. Over the years Glassdoor has been slowly investing in core benefits like health insurance and pension. We work with some of the largest and most exciting brands in the world, and we truly are providing a service that helps people make better decisions - Glassdoor's mission is strong and people believe in what we do, which comes across in how we do business with clients. International expansion is the biggest investment for the company, and being in EMEA is exciting. Senior leadership in the US is accessible and bright.","Very hierarchical structure in EMEA, especially in sales - there are Manager, Director, Sr Director and VP levels in place, yet the org is tiny in number of employees as of now. Several of these leadership hires were made externally, without the roles being posted internally to provide opportunity to grow despite this being a widely discussed pain point for employees. ~90% of the senior leadership team in EMEA is male (Director & above). Politics, lack of straightforward communication are becoming the norm, and we're too small for that.  After over 5 years of operating in the UK, Glassdoor continues not to have clear career progression in sales, assuming sales people want to be sales people for the rest of their lives. Lastly, there is no competitive maternity policy in place - 6 weeks partially paid leave followed by statutory pay. This does not attract strong female talent or incentivize it to stay."

First and foremost, the company has an amazing company culture. People are really good to one another here. While people are smart and driven, they also care about making sure that everyone works together well.

Glassdoor is also having a lot of success as a company. Like any early stage company there are ups and downs, but over the 4 years I've been here I've seen revenue triple and the employee base grow by a similar amount. 

And I love Glassdoor's mission and that we are creating transparency for job seekers all around the world.","None really.

327,Glassdoor,"Great four years, but left disappointed.",2019-04-15,3.0,Director,"Overall, I had a very positive experience at Glassdoor. Nine months ago, I would have rated the company 4 stars. 

Here's the top of my ""pros"" list.

1. People - My direct team was composed of professionals who are expert at their jobs, have fun with their work, and are genuinely great people. This extends to the Enterprise Sales and Customer Success teams as a whole. These are the groups I worked most closely with, and it's a talented team overall.

2. Creativity - My leaders gave me a ton of trust to create new opportunities for the company. They trusted me to innovate our approach, and get the job done to grow the company. I believe I delivered by qualifying for 3 President's Clubs in 4 years. I'm very thankful for the trust in me, and hope that I've passed this spirit on to my team.

3. Knowledge - I grew my skills substantially during my tenure at Glassdoor. I was put in several situations where I had to ""figure things out"" in order to drive growth. I had to push the envelope regularly, which grew my knowledge-base over my 4 year tenure. These attributes will stay with me as my career moves forward, and I'm thankful for that.","The company has changed dramatically from when I joined 4 years ago. It was a disappointing end for me, given the highs my team achieved during my tenure. 

Dramatic change is to be expected when you're in growth mode, and especially after an acquisition. However, the top ""cons"" listed here are why I dropped my rating to 3 stars. They definitely played a role in my departure from the company.

1. Senior Leadership - The ""feel"" is dissipating. Everything is ""rationalized"" through spreadsheets, and decisions are made via endless hours in conference rooms. Many key departments are run by an MBA who doesn't have prior experience leading in said capacity. This has created a lack of first-hand customer knowledge, and is causing a diminished connection with team members who interface with customers and prospects every day.

2. Cross-Functional Partners - Team members in other departments are willing to help, but the company is separated into silos. Each department has their own OKRs, and few of those correlate with overall customer success. As a result, time spent selling for reps is greatly reduced. Reps routinely spend hours, and even days, waiting on cross-functional support. Most reps end up just doing things themselves to deliver to customers on-time.

3. Lack of Innovation - This may be number 3 on my list, but was probably my biggest issue. The company continues to push high growth targets...but isn't producing new, monetizable products to drive that. The market is changing dramatically, and the company is falling behind. Even if the revenue numbers look good at an aggregate level, there are significant risks to the business that will manifest themselves over the next 12-24 months if true innovation isn't realized.`"

I was trusted with my work and learned a lot on the fly, which I loved. The Solutions Consultant team is growing and they are doing great things. 

Other pros: 
1. Great manager and direct team

3. Dog friendly office for Mill Valley employees","1. The travel can be intense at times, especially in the busier months
2. Career path isn’t 100% clear, but the team is growing which is positive

332,Glassdoor,Glassdoor changed my life,2019-02-16,5.0,Enterprise Account Manager,"Glassdoor was my first job right out of college. I moved to a new city where I didn't know many people. The reason why I wanted to work at Glassdoor was that I believed in the product and it was something that was useful to me in my job search. Little did I know that a short three years later I would be looking back at my decision to accept my first job at Glassdoor as one of the best decisions of my life. Many of my closest friends were made through my time on various teams throughout the Glassdoor organization. I know every review says it...but the best part of Glassdoor is truly the people.

- Career Progression -
There are plenty of opportunities for promotions for top performers. If you work hard and stand out, you absolutely will be moved from role to role quickly.

-Strong Managers-
I've had four managers at Glassdoor and every single one of them has been wonderful.

-Compensation-
Top performers are compensated like top performers. The ability to both hit and exceed quota is very real and can be accomplished by anyone who is willing to put in the work.

-Benefits-
Top of the line (and free) health/dental benefits with a ton of fun stuff around the office. Snacks, beer, ping pong, and darts. 

-Work/Life Balance-
Amazing flexibility based on manager and position. Employees are treated like adults and allowed to WFH or take PTO when needed.","Any company has cons no matter how great it is. Glassdoor has always done a good job taking feedback both from public reviews and internal feedback and laying out a plan to make changes. However, it sometimes takes longer to accept/see the issues and put into place fixes since we've grown so quickly.

-Sales Operations-
Many of our systems are very, very, very broken. This can occasionally lead to over or underpayments that you as an employee you have to watch out for. This SEEMS to be getting better lately and I know is top priority to be fixed this fiscal year.

-Billing Department-
As a sales rep, your compensation is tied to your clients paying (or not paying) your bills. This means that you are often times working with the Billing Department to resolve payment issues for clients. Our Billing Department is painfully understaffed and emails/Slack messages go unanswered for weeks creating tough situations with clients who expect resolutions quickly."

Overall, happy working here and looking forward to the future of GD.",Seem to be a lot of sales ops issues that take ages to get resolved. Sometimes extra hours are needed to hit target.
335,Glassdoor,Glassdoor takes cares of its employees and their families!,2019-01-15,5.0,Senior Mid-Market SDR,"This review is long overdue. Since I started with the company, I have felt a strong connection to our values and a deep desire to grow with Glassdoor. Local leadership is approachable and always willing to hear our ideas (and  float them upwards when they are good ones!) Growth is possible as long as you continue to put in hard work month after month. Quota is challenging, but achievable, which is the whole point of having a sales quota. 

The benefits for working parents are abundant: GREAT maternity leave, with 100% coverage AND commission compensation (this is unheard of!); flexibility with working from home when needed, and a culture of great people who love your children and embrace them as part of the Glassdoor family. The people who work at Glassdoor truly make our company as wonderful as it is. I am excited to come to work and see friends everyday. Glassdoor has some of the best talent in the workforce and it shows. There are TOO many people here to learn from! 

I haven't even considered any outside opportunities since I have been here because Glassdoor is a company that truly cares about you and your family. THAT, for me, is why I remain loyal to this company and I am looking forward to growing my career here.","At times, it can feel like SDRs are not as important or valuable to the company. Recently, however, leadership has been giving our SDR team shoutouts and if we continue to do that, it will add to the value we bring to the company. SDRs are usually the first voice or outreach to many companies, so investing in more training can improve sales and ROI over time. Sometimes it can be challenging working directly with teams in Mill Valley as a lot of communication is improved via proximity. We are, however, given plenty of tools to help improve this challenge."
336,Glassdoor,Solid company to work for,2019-01-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I thoroughly enjoy my position at Glassdoor. The company is constantly making a deliberate effort to improve their processes and value proposition for their employees.

These involve things like processes and comp plans (specific to sales). Also there is a thirst for new product development that is being addressed, albeit slower than the long-time employees (and customers?) would like to see."

Most everyone is easy to get along with and it is obvious that they share a common goal as well as believe in the mission statement.  The teamwork is awesome across all teams.  It is awesome to have the free food provided as well as catered lunches from time to time.  Having workout classes we can attend and still get paid is pretty awesome.  It is also nice to have the ability to work from home if something comes up rather than have to take PTO.  The holidays are fun around here as they are kind of a big deal.  It is fun to dress up at Halloween and do some other fun things around Christmas.  It really breaks up the days when we do things like this.  Having dogs come into the office has been fun.

There are times where you have to continue to refresh to try to get into a queue you are trying to work in.  This does happen on a daily basis.  You will frequently receive an error message and you just have to keep refreshing until the site decides it wants to allow you access what you are trying to access.  It wastes a lot of valuable time.  It is still hard for me to believe that even after 10 years, there are still these types of issues with the website for a tech company.  Rather than finding a fix for certain types of things, we have become too accepting of finding a way to work around the problem rather than try to get someone to fix it.  It is great that we have smart people who can find ways to work around the problems that we have, but we really need to stop being so accepting of finding these and push for more permanent, functional fixes."

The pay is finally starting to get competitive. Most people there are very nice. Most managers have flexible policies around work hours and working from home.,"Something dark lurks within the waters of Glassdoor's Sales Ops team, and it has the team's members fleeing for their careers.


1) The Only Live Culture on the Team is in our Yogurt

In the most recent employee satisfaction survey, the largest word in the word cloud was ""toxic"". Pressure to perform is sky-high, which is part and parcel of any Sales Operations gig. However, the team's culture has shifted dramatically to reward people who manage up well while undercutting the work and reputation of their peers. People are now hired and valued based their pedigree; Ivy League MBA with Management Consulting is the profile du jour and the only voices truly valued on the team (note: this is not unique to Sales Ops, but proliferates throughout the Operations organization).

Most teams within Sales Ops work in silos and show little interest in understanding work outside of their purview. When collaboration is necessary, tensions inevitably flare. Even team outings are usually segregated by team lines, with the exception of a few open-minded individuals. Rather than encourage cross-pollination, leaders often simply skip the events altogether. We tried a big team-building offsite a couple of months ago. It did not help.


2) I Find Your Lack of Vision Disturbing

Like sand in the desert, our org chart shifts with the winds. By my last count and without exaggeration, we restructured the Sales Ops team no less than 5 times in 2018. Many of those restructures were due to key staff leaving the company (which speaks for itself), but it embodies the lack of a cohesive vision for the team. We almost never talk about team vision, and when we do, there is no follow-through.

Our processes are a mess and everything is manual. There is no documentation because no one has time to document them. We’re told to automate everything, but efforts are poorly scoped by our Sales Tech team and always fall short. Efforts to implement scalable policy are met with extreme resistance from sales leadership. More on that later.

Our Sales Tech Stack is a mess. Salesforce is a disaster, and there are no plans to shore up the foundations there. We are something of an urban legend amongst the CS team at Salesforce, as our implementation is the most cluttered and least efficient that many of them have seen. The result is inefficient process for our sales team and an inability to effect productive change within the environment.
We've recently taken to cycling in old tools that we've already tried and didn't work. We'll see how that goes.

Our priorities shift more often than our org chart. We frequently enter the week with a frantic email telling us what ""the only thing we need to focus on this week"" is. OKRs have been out the window for most Sales Ops teams for the last 2 quarters, and when I shake my Magic 8-ball and ask if that will improve, it always says ""Reply hazy, try again."" Every time. 

I have a ticket in with Mattel to troubleshoot.


3) ""And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the Noise! Noise! Noise! Noise!"" - The Grinch

A key part of Sales Operations success lies in its relationship with Sales. Somewhere between trust and shared vision lies a nirvana of effectiveness and efficiency.

Unfortunately, none of that exists at Glassdoor. Our relationship with Sales is incredibly dysfunctional. And, in spite of my criticisms above, the lion’s share of the problem lies with the inexperience of sales leadership. 

Glassdoor is a strong believer of promoting leaders from within. However, when that is your only method of hiring leaders, you get the Peter Principle run amok. Simply put, there is not a sales executive at Glassdoor that has been anything other than a frontline manager prior to joining the company. And it shows. The decisions made at that level are short-sighted; primarily for the benefit of individual sales reps and to the detriment of our ability to scale. There is little accountability holding leaders to the commitments and decisions they make. Perfect is the archenemy of good. And we learn everything the hard way.

I have seen instances where our lack of experience on the executive team has left us incapacitated when facing the kind of difficult challenges every company encounters during hyper-growth. Every trial our company faces becomes a crisis where the leaders charged with resolution are only equipped to make very educated guesses on the path forward. Again, this is not limited to sales, but it's especially prevalent there."

 - Great feeling of togetherness and people working towards the same goal
 - Management follow through on their aim to be transparent and like to keep everyone in the loop as much as possible!
- Great benefits
- Lovely offices with no shortage of drinks and snacks!","As the EMEA offices are still growing and an unstructured on-boarding means an overwhelming start, but with everyone so willing to help its easy one to get over. New programmes for on-boarding are being focused on now which means a very exciting time for new starters!"
345,Glassdoor,As transparent as they come,2018-11-30,5.0,SDR,"EMEA office is expanding at a rapid rate meaning the buzz about the office is electric. 

You don't  feel like a small fish in a big pond, higher management are approachable and ready to listen, proactive. 

Not your typical run of the mill sales position, everybody within the office genuinely wants you to do well.","To 'smash targets' is almost expected, it's rewarded generously, but you feel that added pressure."
346,Glassdoor,Sales Development Representative,2018-11-30,4.0,Sales Development Representative,"Glassdoor is full of great people who you can learn from. The culture is great with plenty of social events. There are plenty of benefits, from unlimited annual leave, private health insurance, a good pension scheme and pizza on Friday's.. We also have free snacks (crisps, popcorn, cans of coke, vit hits, fulfill bars, pistachios etc). We also have a fridge of beers, wine etc.
The EMEA region is expanding so there are lots of opportunities to learn, grow and apply for new roles.
The location is  right beside Stephens Green in Dublin 2 so very central and easy to get to.
Overall it is a great place to work, the team are all very supportive and are able to have a laugh!","-Promotion timeline has been unclear and vague, so expectations were not set properly for new starters which leads to disappointment and frustration.
-Quota is quite high and can be stressful. You don't get quota relief when you take time off, so it is hard to hit your monthly quota/targets. The workload can be a lot and pressuring.
- If you don't hit quota, your commission isn't great
-Work/Life balance can be hard to maintain at times due to high quota"
347,Glassdoor,Great Company but be prepared to work hard!,2018-11-30,4.0,Sales Development Representative,"- Early stages of growth so an exciting time to be in the company and a lot of potential for growth and progression
- Still a small company so you can feel valued and your opinion matters, even if you're just a new member 
- Not a typical cold-calling environment - more of a consultative approach to selling which helps you learn a lot more about the product / service from the beginning of your career 
- A lot of nights out and company social events to enjoy
- Relatively young team so there's a lot of energy and the culture is great
- Great people to learn off and grow as a sales person
- BAMF
- Pizza Fridays
- Free Snacks, beers, wine, VitHits","- Work life balance can be difficult at times and quota does not change if you have paid time off so this can be very stressful, especially for new starts which causes people to work unsociable hours and weekends
- Promotion timeline and criteria has been very vague so expectations aren't properly set for new joiners"

Robert is an amazing CEO and embraces transparency with monthly all-hands answering questions and giving the whole company updates. He is super authentic and down to earth.

At Glassdoor,  you feel like you are more than just a number and your opinion is valued.

356,Glassdoor,"Great People, Great Product & Great Future",2018-09-03,5.0,Sales Manager,"I joined Glassdoor 2 months ago and have no regrets at all. 

My new colleagues have all been very welcoming, supportive and clearly know what they are doing.  

Not just from my own office, but this includes people throughout the organisation - from the ones I met during the onboarding process in Chicago to my colleagues based in Dublin.

Being in sales, the product itself is fundamental to the pride I feel at work and whether I see a career in an organisation or not.  Since joining Glassdoor I have met multiple clients from a variety of industries and the huge majority have been extremely happy with the product and service delivered.

For me, this is so important and fills me with confidence in the decision I made to leave my last company and join Glassdoor.

I've personally experienced working for a company during its hyper-growth stage and loved it.  My job now allows me to be part of a similar journey at Glassdoor, which is so exciting.

It is truly a great time to be at Glassdoor!","Obviously, when a company is growing at such a pace then you will have growing pains and certain challenges.  But to be honest that is what excited me about joining Glassdoor and what keeps my job interesting.

Each day brings new challenges, but if your head is in the right place and you are prepared to work hard, then the satisfaction of genuinely contributing to the success of a business outweighs any negatives."
357,Glassdoor,Slow and Steady,2018-08-27,4.0,User Experience Designer,"Glassdoor has come a long way in developing a culture where design has an equal part in high-level decisions. They're also developing a legitimate UX team that will help fully support these decisions. The Director of UX played a big part of this by taking a small but very talented team, and helped to not only strengthen the team as a unit, but created a productive cadence and encouraged everyone to communicate the value of design to every stakeholder. 
The knowledge and support I received from higher level designers was invaluable, and something I will bring with me and share with others.","The biggest frustration for me, was the lack of strategy and focus at the top level. This made it difficult for me as a decent UX designer to fully understand the main user goal for any product i was working on, as the scope of the project changed dramatically throughout its lifecycle."
358,Glassdoor,Great Company Culture,2018-08-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The mission and people at Glassdoor are top notch. It's hard to find another company like it!,"Not a whole lot of opportunities to switch to other departments. You're stuck in one career path, and it takes more time than necessary to move up in your designated path."
359,Glassdoor,"Sales - great place if you are positive, patient, and adaptable",2018-08-17,4.0,Account Manager,"* Great People from Peers to Leaders - working here is genuinely fun and the people are awesome! In addition to senior leadership being super personable and humble, I've made some great friends here and am almost always happy to come into work every morning to see my coworkers/friends even though I have the flexibility to work from home! I do not take this for granted as I know what it’s like from past jobs to dread going to work every day.

*  Constant Learning Opportunities - there is a lot to learn in Account Management. From formal Franklin Covey Sales Training to tribal knowledge (and a pretty unique knowledge-sharing sales culture) to working with clients in a variety of industries I am constantly sharpening my skills. Even when you know how to do your job there is ample opportunity to get involved cross-functionally, with trainings, interviews, etc and continue learning about business.

* Managers in Growth - tend to be awesome. I’ve worked closely with all of the managers in SMB Growth and have found them to all be incredible people. I've loved both my managers and they have definitely been instrumental in motivating me to stay at Glassdoor through good times and bad!!

* Flexible Schedule/Travel Opportunity - Managers in Growth are understanding about working from home which is amazing. I don’t use it that often but it’s great to feel like I am trusted and treated with respect. I often feel like I truly am the owner of my own business (my book of clients). Working with clients across locations and industries is really fun and we get the opportunity to plan our own travel to in person client meetings which is awesome!

* Mission - easy to get behind. For all the random tech companies to sell for, I might not be saving lives but maybe I’m helping a company hire people who are :)

* Dogs in the office are the best thing ever, definitely make my day every day!

* Office Location - being on the water in Mill Valley is amazing. The reverse commute is easy, it is serene environment and beautiful to get out of the city and have lunch outside every day

* Food - I genuinely appreciate the daily catered lunch, tea/snacks. They have options for every dietary restriction which goes a long way!","* Culture on the Decline - Our culture has suffered a lot recently, and I'm not sure why or how to fix it. The Fun Committee has pretty much disappeared. Monthly happy hours that used to be a blast have virtually zero attendance. It makes me sad how impersonal/automated company and department wide communications have become.
* @Sales Leadership: Bluejeans Sales Huddles suck! It was way more fun and motivating when we convened in the cafe. I am guessing these measures have been taken to save time/efficiency but the result is a disjointed community and everyone is multitasking, not actually paying attention to the meetings as we would in person. This also takes away face-time with leadership that we really enjoyed! I also feel this way about the Video Company All Hands - which I’m guessing <50% of the company actually watched. I don’t think I'm the only one who STRONGLY prefers real meetings.

* SMB Growth partnership with CSS on Job Ads is NOT working. We need to allow high-spending job-ads accounts to have CSMs. I want to sell my clients the product that is the right fit to help them succeed, but it is getting to a point where i am fearful to move clients from slots to ads because there is a major risk the campaigns will not launch and will not perform as they are barely managed. When growth reps are measured on MCV and selling POCs we are being set up to fail attainment-wise if the trials we sell do not even launch so we obviously can’t prove performance in a short period. Glassdoor is an amazing product when we launch and when educated CSMs are managing campaigns - please help us help our clients succeed!!

* FY19 Sales Changes are a Bummer - We moved from a Bookings attainment model to Monthly Contract Value (MCV) and it has been a nightmare. Even after finally understanding how it works (far into the fiscal year, and I’m sure some people are still lost), it became apparent how flawed this model is. It is not motivating in the way Bookings was and forecasting is a headache and a half. MCV doesn’t make sense for getting promoted/switching roles or leaving the company because there is no way for reps to get credit in these situations and it's shocking that there was no foresight into this. Leadership tries to spin it as that we should do what is best for the business but at the end of the day that is an unreasonable ask - I am a sales person and am motivated by getting credit for what I sell.  Please switch back to bookings in FY20!

 * Forecasting Mess - I know this has been mentioned in other reviews. We switched forecasting tools form Clari to Aviso which has been a struggle since Aviso doesn’t work, deals randomly fall out, notes won’t update etc. I spend 2x as long on forecasting as I used to when we used Clari. This tool was supposed to be rolled out to use at the start of FY19 (April) but it is now almost half way through the year and it is still not working. It’s hard to get excited about promises made at SKO when the result is this far off year after year. How does it take this long?

* Onboarding is Not Great - important note if you are considering accepting a job at Glassdoor: our on boarding experience in growth can be a bit of a “find your own way” experience as training is geared towards new business. Luckily, people are generally really nice and happy to help, but it’s not a hand-held easy training experience last time I checked. Be ready to make your own way, start-up style... even though we are not a start-up anymore which is awkward.

* Billing & Sales Ops are both ridiculously understaffed, which has a major negative impact on sales teams. Leadership/HR if you read this - please please hire more billing people!"
360,Glassdoor,The future's ours,2018-08-16,4.0,Sales Manager,"I’ve been at Glassdoor London from the very scrappy and gritty beginning. I love that the scrappy and gritty culture remains a key component of our identity in the London office. We’re a “small” group of ~20 which for some of us seems like a HUGE group. That said, the size of the group fosters a sense of family and togetherness across teams and functions. Needless to say there’s banter, laughs, singing and a celebration of our individual differences, quirks and the diversity of the very multinational group.

You can generally twist someone’s arm to go for a cheeky beverage or few at one of the plethora of watering holes in the local area. Our shiny new office is perfectly located for after work cheekies and offers up endless options for lunch on the Southbank, Borough Market and Flat Iron Square to name but a few. Summer drinks on the Southbank have been quite the treat these past few weeks.

The outlook for the business is very bright especially since the Recruit acquisition was confirmed. International was already slated to be the focus for this and future years so the news of the acquisition fills us with even more excitement for what’s to come particularly for us in the international markets. Accelerated growth and even more opportunity is clearly on the horizon which makes us an even more attractive “startup” for talent with a desire to make a noticeable impact on a technology company on the upward trajectory of accelerated growth.","There’s a lot of change in a very short space of time which can be overwhelming and is exacerbated by the pace at which we are growing and evolving in Europe. This is both a pro and a con dependent on your perspective. In this environment some will flourish and some will not but it is definitely a period where you need to buckle up and hold on tightly because we’re going places very fast!! 

We are still lacking in some support functions but steps have been taken to address challenges around local IT, HR, Benefits etc."

364,Glassdoor,Absolutely no work life balance. Do not recommend,2018-07-30,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Great mission. Respectable CEO. Dog friendly MV office,Hectic work and crazy deadlines. Expectation from leadership was extra hours of work at nights and weekends. Lack of appreciation for the work. Meager amount of stock options during the performance review cycle. Pay doesn’t match the San Francisco area standards. Overall more work for less pay. Greatest of missions cannot motivate people to stick around.
365,Glassdoor,Very Good,2018-07-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Tons of opportunities to learn, if you give yourself a chance to do so. The company is a bit disorganized in some ways, but for the most part, things are great. Comp plan is incredibly incentivizing, and it will rid the org of people who are ok with just skating by. Opportunity to advance and grow yourself keeps me coming back each day.","Operational issues tend to be all over the place. New forecasting tool has taken a month to get up and running, comp plan has greatly rewarded new business people but painfully penalized growth people. Feels like fire drills all over the place. Glassdoor seems to take pride in feeling like a chaotic start up, but being 11 years old now, it is time to get things in order."
366,Glassdoor,Keeps Getting Better,2018-07-27,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"I love being on the CS team at Glassdoor. We've been through a lot of changes in the last 12-14 months, but it finally feels like we're getting into a groove. Our fearless leader has worked hard to make CS a great place to work throughout the company. He sets clear goals and executes. End of story. 

The partnership with Sales in particular has drastically improved in the past few months. It truly feels like we're on one team now and we feel more love and respect from our counterparts there.","Reporting for our KPIs is very behind. Leadership knows this and is working on it, but it still feels like the bar is set without giving us the tools & reporting to get there. Hard to feel like you're set up for success this way."
367,Glassdoor,EMEA on the Rise,2018-07-27,4.0,Sales Manager,"It's a very exciting time for Glassdoor Dublin, our EMEA HQ.  There have been a number positive changes over the last 6 months, including a new local leadership team, new offices on Stephen's Green, and a great new attitude in the Dublin Office.  

Everyone feels excited about the journey we are on to Help People Find a Job in a Company they Love.  Leadership is very open about the expansion plans and there is a strong sense of belief and togetherness.  We understand that finding local solutions to local problems is the key to our success.","As the EMEA arm of the business, we are still reliant on our US cousins to implement requests which can add to delays in execution, which can be frustrating.  Within the Sales Org, it still feels like we spend too much time dealing with Operational Issues which can restrain our growth."
368,Glassdoor,Account Executive,2018-07-26,4.0,Account Executive,"Very fun environment, that is workin towards a mission of transparency for job seekers. The leadership team truly believes in giving the power back to the people. Great office location and surrounded by people that have worked in a lot of different backgrounds.",Typical growing pains when I was an employee there. Sales team was grown very quickly which caused for some turnover.
369,Glassdoor,A lot of promises but no delivery- Growth Team,2018-07-17,1.0,Enterprise Account Manager,"I went through a lot to get this role at Glassdoor on the growth team. My teammates were really great people and did a lot to help me get up and running. 
-Solid product and mission
-Good benefits
- Fun office atmosphere and perks
-Competitive pay","I  have a lot of them because my experience was pretty awful in the end.  For starters, after receiving the offer, they were tiptoeing around the idea of pulling the offer back but eventually they did not ( I can't remember the exact wording but it was very confusing). They changed my start date 3 times. It took them a month and half to decide whether or not I had a guarantee or not for the first few months I was not on book. Once they did decide to give me one (it was generous) they changed the amount on me 2 times. Training was pretty good but I wish they would have had more of a focus on the growth side of the house. It was set up for new biz.

Leadership had told me they wanted to hit the road with me and I planned a long trip in my territory only to have them bail on me last minute. I performed well on my own but it was just  sign of how upper management effects the day to day big time with their last minute asks. I feel like no matter what I did it was never enough, I brought back a solid verbal from a client that we were going to grow an additional 80% and I got flack for it. I felt really good about all the work I put in and the result was really big for my book and team but the feedback I got was that I needed to push the client even harder.  

This all came to a head when I was let go without any prior warning or notice, despite being lauded company wide just a few weeks before for hitting my monthly quota. Just days before I was also told I had been performing well and had been great a receiving the coaching management had provided to me. I also had forecasted to crush my goal for the current month, so there were no signs of poor performance. Additionally, in the weeks prior to this management had laid out a program that had specific criteria we needed to hit to be in ""good standing"" and it was mentioned that there would be conversations along the way if an individual was not meeting those standards. I never had any of those conversations. 

This was a really shady situation as I was randomly pull into a room and told I no longer had a job at Glassdoor (given no explanation whatsoever about why I was let go). Leadership said one sentence and then left the room, it was gutless.  I do not know who was truly behind this or why I was let go. I went back to collect my things and the entire side of the office was cleared out so I could not interact with anyone. Just a terrible situation while working at a company that preached transparency and living by G.R.I.T.  This was just like a company with a bad GD rating, there were no values I was just a number to them. 

I had two former colleagues in the interview process with GD and had to tell them that I was let go out of nowhere without any information given to me. It did not make GD look very good at all. 

A lot of things were said about this company and my team being a family but frankly this was not my experience based on the results of my employment. Dealing with HR was not pleasant at all either. They shut off my Cobra when they were not supposed to and were just difficult to deal with in general. Oh and I think in general because its a young company, there is a lot of drinking together and for me personally I feel like it set me back not being in that crowd as I don't drink much. 

And of course after all that they just sell the company a month after my termination so that may have certainly played a factor in things as well. Apparently its all about the all mighty dollar and selling out to a foreign company. 

Overall I would say I just wish things went differently, I felt ok most of the time and enjoyed being there and just battled through these issues thanks to the support of my teammates. I never would have thought this company being who they are and what they represent would have treated me like this. Be careful."
370,Glassdoor,Enterprise Account Manager - No Win!,2018-07-17,2.0,Enterprise Account Manager,The greatest part of Glassdoor are the people that I work with.,"For the past 4+ years Glassdoor has been trying to figure out how to organize internally and how to structure the goals. This is still a struggle as no one in leadership has a clue regarding the growth side of the business and how to make goals fair across the teams. I am not sure how many years they are going to try and put a “one size fits all” approach on this until they realize that does not work. There is no parity in size of books, types of accounts, past history on accounts (which will clearly dictate future growth), etc. There is no forgiveness in the plan and frankly the ability to make your OTE is almost impossible unless you are a lucky few. Throughout my tenure here, they keep saying “we messed up” and then do little things to try and correct, but they only correct for those who have already reaped the benefits. Additionally, their is NO support for the ENT growth tier. It has become abundantly clear that unless you are in new business or on the strat team, that your success will always be a struggle here and you are completely on your own."

Flexible hours (good for families)","Transparency and company/team vision have gone completely out the window. This has been an issue long before pre-acquisition...we need a GLINT survey stat. Marketing leadership says that we ""are more aligned than we have ever been"" yet our QBR made it clear that it's not just my team that is getting insufficient direction and support from the top. Everyone is scrambling. Maybe leadership is just waiting for their check to leave. I'm coming up on a work anniversary and then I will be leaving.

Glassdoor only hire the best and if you want to succeed here, you have to hold yourself accountable and be adaptable to change. Managers will always be there to support you, but ultimately you are the captain of your own ship.

This is the first company where I actually look forward to coming into work each day!","Communications between US and EMEA needs some improvement, both from an IT support and operational side. Due to the time difference, things can take a little longer to get fixed/complete which can slow down operations here on the ground. Prioritizing EMEA requests in the US may help speed up processes.

Salary for the Bay Area was a little lower than average, but we were not located in San Francisco so most areas were more affordable. Medical/Dental/Vision benefits are 100% if you are single, but are about average if you have a family.","No 401k match. Next to no food near the office, in the event the catered food was awful or was a day there was no lunch. 

Certain teams have management stubborn to the extent of failure. I was brought in as an engineer assigned to re-architect a underpowered and aged environment, to make it scalable, sustainable, and efficient.

Every step of the way, road blocks from my direct manager included undermining my technical experience in lieu of their seniority, constantly assigning tasks that exceeded a 60 hour a week workload, was completely unorganized in assigning priority to tasks that were newly assigned every week.

For example, a task I was assigned to work on 2 weeks ago that was said to have the highest priority, was suddenly de-prioritized and had another task assigned in its place. However there was an expectation that I would still need to complete the previous tasks with the same sense of urgency, if not more. 

This made it nearly impossible to complete any project, and was told that I had an inability to complete tasks or assignments, which (in their opinion) was a display of poor performance on my behalf. This made it feel as though I should not believe in a work/life balance, and should not only spend time at work doing tasks/projects, but spend a significant amount of time at home doing the same. There was an ""always online"" mentality that stemmed through the team, and it made some of the team members feel completely exhausted in their position.

When trying to own a project or have a stake in decision making as far as architecture and technology used for items that I was directly responsible for, this was routinely made for me. My input was often dismissed, with the reasoning being I had not done my research or that I needed a thorough report written in order to even acknowledge my input as an item of discussion.

The executive management my team directly reported to often had completely opposing ideologies and opinions (versus my direct manager) on priority regarding my tasks, responsibilities, and the type of technology and architecture we should be/could be implementing to better the company. At my resignation, much of the ""issues"" that were reflect upon my performance, were in complete opposition to what I was directly told by the executive management of my team. It left me feeling a little lost, and as though the treatment in my current situation was personal.

I did not, however, see this sort of management or attitude on other teams. I do believe Glassdoor is an incredible organization to work for, that can provide ample opportunity to many different people. I do not, however, believe that my specific department is one of the successful areas of the business due to the aggressive management style that seemingly suppresses creative thought or individual input in their roles, duties, or ability to make decisions for the team."

Great options for daily free lunch if you are lucky enough to work in Mill Valley. Nearly all of the employees here feel passionate about working in an environment of empowerment, collaboration, focus, fun, and friendship.","I've been working 10-12 hour days just to keep up. Executive leadership is a little cliquey and their style of communication can be condescending, even if the workforce is marginally younger. Problems tend to be ignored even when employees are calling them out. Senior management tend to have the only say."

From the top down, GD has a culture of hiring really, really cool people with great personalities who are easy to talk to and work with -- pretty much everyone who is at GD is smart, driven, and excellent. The mission is excellent. There are some real winners among the newly hired leadership, and of course, the CEO is a wonderful guy.","Before you sign up to work here, let's remember that this is a Series H company. Series H. There is a reason for that. Look up the tech companies that have successfully gone public, and look at their series beforehand. Headlines scream that GD is a $1BN company about to go public, but valuation says nothing about effectiveness of the business. And a great mission isn't enough. Valuation is also set by investors, and right now, the investors want their money back. Compared to what GD may have once been, these realities create a different culture with a lot of pressure. While leadership does a good job of shielding everyone else from this, the pressure manifests in covert ways that are counter to GD's principles of transparency. Given changes in the recruiting marketplace, GD's products are not getting easier to sell, and an entrenched codebase make it difficult to iterate productively to modernize the product features. All of the above affects the day-to-day."

Upward Mobility: Specifically in the role of an OSR you are expected to be promoted within a year and my manager has done an incredible job of advocating for that

Supported: I always feel as though my voice is being heard and appreciated. Being a part of the OSR team has been such a fun experience because we are a new team that is figuring out how to meet our full potential. That being said our feedback is an essential part of that process and I genuinely feel like I am a part of something pivotal within the company.",The role is constantly changing and being adaptable is a must.

The people I worked with became some of my closest friends and having that ""family"" feel really allowed me to enjoy my job.","Over the years there were a lot of growing pains. We grew too quick, we weren't all on the same page,  hired some of the wrong people, and had poor communication. From all of that we have learned from our mistakes and ""course-corrected"" and things that were our weaknesses have become strengths. The one thing we continue to hear is the pay is too low, which it is. The one reason people leave is because although they love this company and their job, the pay isn't as competitive."

389,Glassdoor,Worst job I've ever taken,2018-03-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Fairly solid benefits with catered food, gym on site, cell phone stipend, 100% covered health care
- Beautiful location in MV","- Everything else. I say with so much regret how much I disliked working here and the negative toll it had on my energy and personal life. 
- Not a company to come in at the mid management role - no conversations about growth and future trajectory even from HR
- Incredibly micromanaged and siloed work streams - these are two separate issues, but one in the same in they promote tactical and frankly boring job duties. Your job description is exactly your job with no potential to take on more expansive or strategic projects. 
- Did I mention micromanaged? You have very senior leaders pivoting data in tableau and making microscopic decisions that should be happening at a junior level. There seems to be very little trust in senior leaders to delegate and coach to truly have their teams grow.
- All of these combine to create an environment where teams are siloed (no team or company wide bonding events) - I sat across a person for 3+ months on a different team who never said a single word to me. Again, not a team environment where people are friendly, open and easy to work with, making true cross collaboration tough and forceful.

So who does succeed @ Glassdoor now? The MBA/ops crowd who can be particularly aggressive.

Unfortunately since leaving, I've had several colleagues' friends and friends of friends ask for my input on potentially taking a job at Glassdoor post-offer or in late interview stage. With horror, I recoil and say no, to only hear that they too have heard the same thing across their network. That is a huge issue for the company and recruiting - the word of mouth that occurs after someone leaves. I see open roles on the website that have been open for months to a YEAR (including my former role). Unfortunately my experience is the average and not atypical."
390,Glassdoor,Shocked and Disappointed,2018-03-19,2.0,Senior Desktop Support Analyst,- Great culture and talented people in the Chicago Office.  Chicago has some of the most dedicated and loyal people you will meet.  Their hard work will inspire you to become better in your role.,"- Lack of support from the Mill Valley Office. Despite growing from 50 employees to over 200 employees in just over a year and with three office moves during that time, department leadership visited only during office moves (for a few hours at most) and never returned, therefore never able to see day to day workload at site during typical days of operation. IT exec leadership cancelled every skip level meeting (1:1) for the past seven months.

- No growth potential - I was stuck doing level 1 work with no ability to work on bigger projects because I was supporting 200+ users by myself. Support employees in remote sites from Corporate are not listened to, compared to team members based in the Corporate office in MV.

- No Transparency - I wanted to stay at Glassdoor but was told there was no room for advancement unless I moved to MV, after I handed in my resignation they upgraded my position to a Lead title (still in Chicago).  During my time here I was never given opportunities for development as I was isolated from the team. I enjoyed working with the Chicago office and it was extremely disappointing to have to move on to find personal growth and development - more frustrating watching many other members of the Chicago team being given the chance for personal development, growth and additional responsibilities/promotion"

397,Glassdoor,Great place to work... if you like small and scrappy teams.,2018-02-16,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Glassdoor has a great CEO who is smart, empathetic, honest and charismatic. He is an engineer by training who is respected around the company, and that has made all the difference in terms of quality and thoughtfulness of our core products, and our great company culture. 

There is real work-life balance at Glassdoor, if you make a priority for yourself. I work from home 1-2 days a week to make the commute from the East Bay manageable, and management has supported that. I get my work done efficiently, and in 3 years have never worked a weekend -- aside from travel and 1-2 very unusual weekend fire drills. This is a company you can work at for years and have a great life doing so. 

As we've matured as a company, we're paying more attention to training and development, which is awesome. There are possibilities to move around within the company, and there are regular classes to pick up skills and grow as a professional. 

Glassdoor has a great brand, and that makes it fun to work here. People here feel like we are really helping people find a job they love, and that's more like a nonprofit than just another tech company. Glassdoor really has a soul as an organization, and I have learned a lot about culture and management from my time here. 

People are friendly at Glassdoor. Marin is a beautiful place to work. And the free lunch and video games really are great.","Most teams at Glassdoor are small. You might say they are starved for resources. My team hasn't grown at all in years, and it can be frustrating being asked to do more of the same year after year with no additional resources. If you're not in a part of the company that is growing today, it's tough to see a long-term career arc upward. 

In terms of benefits, there is no 401(k) match, would I would like to see happen someday. Otherwise, the benefits are great and management are constantly looking for ways to improve them, by surveying employees. That's great. 

Our headquarters are in Marin because of a historical accident, really.  Now we are split between Mill Valley and SF, because many sought-after job candidates simply aren't willing to work in Marin and have bargained for an SF office. That split isn't great for the company long-term -- we should clearly relocate either into SF so that people can commute in on transit, or into East Bay so people can actually afford to someday buy houses. There are no other top tech companies in Marin (putting AutoDesk aside) for a reason -- it's probably not a sustainable location for Glassdoor long term. 

We are in a very competitive industry and I'm hesitant long-term about our ability to grow and thrive as a company. We are facing intense competition, with larger rivals copying the best aspects of our product and ramping up their investments in marketing. It's a scary competitive landscape facing us right now."

It has been a true privilege to be a part of the growth and maturity of this company and I have been given so many incredible opportunities to further myself as a marketer and as a person. Having the opportunity to gain global b2b marketing experience is invaluable. 

Momentum: I think we have really found our stride in the Dublin office. Things are falling in to place and we are starting to gain momentum. Admittedly, it was a tough transition breaking in to a new market without a playbook and we lacked a few key players to help lead the way but that was all part of the thrill and excitement for me. We had/still have the freedom to try creative campaigns/tactics to find out what exactly works for EMEA. 

People: The people make this office. Having moved to Dublin only knowing a handful of people, my co-workers have become some of my best friends and mentors. I really enjoy and admire the people in both the Dublin and London offices and we all generally share the same desire to win. We work hard and still find time to enjoy each other’s company.","Clarity around the future of this market: This has always been something I have struggled with but that’s part of being a global company. We didn’t have a dedicated person/people that were able to give insight in the long term plan for EMEA. With the recent addition of a few key roles, and dedicated exec buy in, I feel extremely hopeful for the future of Glassdoor in EMEA. 

Resources: This is not necessarily a con but in this office you have to be scrappy. You may not have the immediate resources you need at your fingertips so it’s up to you to go get them. That’s just how it is at a startup within a startup. It may fall on you to reach out to our U.S. counterparts to get access to resources you need and that’s okay."

 - You close sales in 2-3 calls for Small or Medium Businesses.
 - Pipeline is always moving because of the quick sales cycle.
 - Everyone knows who Glassdoor is so when you are on the call it's always warm.
 - Monthly quotas keep you motivated the whole quarter long which creates a fast-paced environment

Great culture for growing a career
 - More than anything, people aren't judgemental. Be yourself and no one will give you a hard time. 
 - Managers have your back.
 - You never feel like anyone is looking over your shoulder.
 - You can expect to be promoted every 12 months if you're doing well and the managers like you.
 - You learn sales methods from professional programs instead of learning everything on your own.
 - People are suuuuuuuper friendly and helpful
 - If you like to drink, the SF culture just seems to drink a ton so get ready for that
 - There's an SF office, a Chicago office, and a few international offices. If you want to transfer offices, live in London, etc. Glassdoor is actually open to it!

Perks and Benefits
 - CATERED MEALS are AMAZING! They've really found caterers who bring you great food every single day
 - Health, Dental, Life is all covered for you and partially covered for family members but it's top-of-the-line insurance providers
 - Work-Life Balance is something you determine with your manager. If you want to come in early and leave early, great. If not, most are expected to be here from 8-5 with an hour lunch. However, if you ever need to leave or stay home or go on a trip, they are super flexible and don't give you  a hard time. 

Leadership
 - They've had their struggles in the past but recognize that and have changed a TON. 
 - The VP of Sales will actually sit in a room with sales reps and ask them what needs to be changed and they actually listen.
 - The CEO listens to feedback and consistently is trying to improve transparency and communication. He's also just a genuinely good guy.","Here are the few I've found
 - This place is LIBERAL. Good for half of you, maybe bad for the other half of you. All of SF is really liberal in general but if you're already living here then you're used to it. People aren't  judgemental if you are republican, but I feel like you'll just hear a lot of left-wing chatter and that might bug some right-wing folks.
 - This place DRINKS! Once agian, good for some, maybe not for others. If you don't drink or don't want to be around people who do, maybe Glassdoor isn't for you. Once again, no one will judge at all if you don't, but there is a lot of that here. 
 - Leadership is still making changes to improve compensation and I would say change in general is a minor challange. 
 - Some leaders don't seem super strong, you know? Like, they aren't the type of people everyone wants to follow.
 - Compensation is enough to get by, but could be better. Like I said, they are making changes to get you more money.
 - If you perform, you'll get promoted. But there is definitely a ""cultural fit"" aspect to promotions as well. So know that to get promoted, managers will definitely have to like you. If you aren't likeable, you might not even get hired so...... nevermind"

We work with the best brands in the world and we've been growing rapidly which means that no two days are the same on the job, regardless of which team you sit on - it's exciting to be part of that growth.  The organization is fairly flat and the executive team in the US is welcoming of feedback, and over the past few months has been communicating with more transparency with the EMEA group which has been well received - we're getting new offices in EMEA that are better aligned to the type of company Glassdoor is, and that's exciting.","There are cons that are  associated with the growing pains of being a start up and they're not negatives as such  but to someone coming from a larger organization those might be challenging - for example, working at Glassdoor EMEA is a demanding job and it is not your typical 9-5. It also requires that you roll up your sleeves and pitch in where help is needed, even if it's not in your direct area of expertise (that means helping with external events, organizing team events to build culture and morale, etc).  If you're not prepared to do that, this is not the place for you, at least at this stage of Glassdoor's growth. 
Glassdoor reacts very slowly to feedback - it reacts, which is appreciated, but it often takes months (and in some cases years) of mentioning certain challenges in order for senior management in the US to take action. We are still small enough - let's not wait until things get too dire.
Then there are cons that in my opinion are preventing strong talent from staying and growing and they are the real challenges of Glassdoor EMEA - there are almost no opportunities for career progression (unless, in my opinion, you are an SDR and move into a sales / account management role) and it is a topic that does not get addressed well enough, especially for a company with the mission of Glassdoor.  It is a topic that many people discuss amongst themselves and there is a general feeling of not being able to progress, but that management is vague about."

Also, Glassdoor has great benefits: bring your dog to work, a full gym and game room, complimentary catered lunch each day are just a few to mention.  In the content department, there is the opportunity to work outside the office, as long as expectations are met.  I loved my co-workers and can honestly say there was not ever any drama within the team and team support was natural and genuine. Very much enjoyed my time there. When the company made a business decision to consolidate operations, they offered a nice severance package and I came away with a much better knowledge on how to go about finding that next job and how to negotiate my salary using “Know Your Worth” on Glassdoor’s website.  The overall best benefit!","99% of my time I spent in front of my computer, and the work was repetitive. I did have the flexibility to clock in and out of projects during the day, but you are still expected to produce a full 8 hours of high quality work. In my position, the lack of creativity did dull my drive and my attention would wander...  This is not a reflection on the company, but a reflection of the particular position that I was in. If you are a people person, want to move around a lot and are fueled by challenges, than another department such as sales, may be a better fit."

After more than two years, I remain as committed as ever to the business because as well as always trying to be a loyal employee, I also believe and understand the mission. That’s of utmost importance. If you don’t believe in the mission here (or are not a good fit), you won’t last very long. This company is extremely agile and can make quick decisions if they notice something isn’t quite right. I like that.

Personally, I work with an exceptional bunch of individuals from my senior leaders based in our San Francisco HQ to my colleagues and friends here in the London office. Our CEO is seriously impressive, authentic and transparent, will give you face time if needed and makes an effort to get to know you. In my experience, the same can also be said for our senior leaders who now come to London/Dublin on a quarterly basis. 

Perform (or try new things) and you’ll be handsomely rewarded. Hide and you’ll get found out.","We’ve spoken and Glassdoor has listened. Both London and Dublin office spaces are being upgraded and the benefits structure is being looked at across both European teams to fit the needs of most. I think HR/senior leaders will be the first to admit that they dropped the ball in terms of setting up a competitive EMEA benefits package when we launched a few years ago, but it’s great that we’ve all had frank and open conversations about putting this right. This was a major con, but slowly we’re getting there. 

In terms of benefits, perks and office spaces, we are still some way off the likes of Facebook, LinkedIn, Expedia, AirBnB, Uber et al. And that’s okay, because we are just not there yet as a business. But, if that’s what you’re after/expecting, simply don’t apply and come back in five years. Our founders also started Expedia, so they know what they need to do to get to that level."
413,Glassdoor,turning into something we're just not,2017-10-04,4.0,SMB Account Executive,"Love my coworkers. Definitely will be life long friends. Like the relaxed dress code and the freedom. For the most part, you get back what you put in.","Where do I begin? Glassdoor is turning into something that it's just 'not'. I chose to begin a career at Glassdoor because of the people, atmosphere, perks, career opportunities, and future manager. Now they're bringing in some new faces from companies that have OPPOSING culture to what Glassdoor is all about. Trying to change us. Couldn't be more clear that all of us are just numbers according to some of the new management here. It is not being received well. You have, and will continue, to lose great employees because of it. The vibes are not what they used to be. Nobody feels job security. More than half of the sales reps are exploring new careers as of late. 

Practice what you preach..... Give your employees a ""Job and Company they love"" because that is what we originally signed up for."

419,Glassdoor,Fear-Based Work Culture,2017-08-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Location is nice, next to land preserve / ocean with wildlife. Lunch is provided everyday, snacks, small gym, yoga and Crossfit classes.",This company does not represent its product. The working environment is one of the most toxic I have ever experienced. HR violations are abound and most do not report due to the fear based culture. Higher up managers are known for extremely inappropriate acts and it is astonishing how it is accepted. There are GOOD people at Glassdoor who work extremely hard and their only reward is to be told they arent working hard enough. Emotional deflation is  common. After leaving Glassdoor and joining another company I couldn't believe the difference. Being in a positive environment where you are supported and not afraid is incredible. My hope is that others escape Glassdoor and find bliss elsewhere.

My goals and the goals of my teammates are clear, and we are encouraged to help each other and teach each other along the way.  My opportunities feel endless here, there is always something new and exciting to work on around the corner.  The benefits are extremely generous: free healthcare for employees, catered lunch every day, an onsite gym and locker rooms, Chariot to take you over the Golden Gate Bridge, and the best view of the Bay right outside your desk window.","The only constant here is change.  If you can't roll with the punches and adapt to new processes, leadership, opportunities or whatever it may be, you might not enjoy the environment here.

This company is ALIVE and filled with friendly, energetic, and smart people who come to work every day feeling both empowered and accountable.

425,Glassdoor,Not a place for middle managers,2017-08-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"You are pushed to bring your A game to work every day. I worked at Glassdoor for 2 years and in those two years I learned more than I did in other companies. They invest in their employees in different ways including training, time off, free food, gym etc.","I have mixed feelings about Glassdoor. This is not a place if you are in middle management and want to have vertical growth. Your chances are extremely low regardless of how you perform. You are pressured from the top to do more and at the same time from your junior staff who are mostly millennials and we all know how challenging they can be. 

On the other hand, if you want to learn and grow your skills, both functionally and personally, then this could be a great place to work for a few years."
426,Glassdoor,Huge Potential in EMEA - Needs Some Major Changes.,2017-07-31,3.0,Account Executive,"I joined Glassdoor because of our amazing values, the intelligent people and the innovative product. It’s been an incredible experience working in the EMEA Headquarters and I definitely got what I applied for. 

The product - Glassdoor is changing the way people look for jobs and so many people I know have used Glassdoor to help them in their job search. It's really inspiring to be part of that - even though we work on the employer side. 

 It's an exciting time to be part of Glassdoor EMEA. In the last 2 years, clients have become a lot more open to discussing Glassdoor and putting budget aside for employer branding. The product is going to get easier to sell and clients are seeing more ROI. The office is beginning to grow again (after some heavy attrition last year) which is great to experience if you are looking to grow your sales career and get access to opportunities outside your primary role eg. Training new employees, being involved in interviews ect. 

The office is young, most people are under 35. There's good fun and there's great banter between employees. It's a becoming a collaborative environment which is great to see and there is a close-nit feel, especially in the SDR team. 

Access to Stock Options. As a pre-IPO company you have the chance to purchase stock (after a vesting period) with the potential to make money if Glassdoor IPO's or gets acquired.","Firstly, there’s needs to be more transparent communication. Some of our senior leaders aren’t really open to feedback and it’s left some employees feeling frustrated and unheard. This has led a number of people to leave. We want to practice what we preach with the product that we sell eg. Read the reviews on our page, take feedback on board, make relevant changes but  that’s not happening in EMEA. This leads to people speaking to each other in private and not giving feedback to management (because they know it's unlikely anything will be done), which creates a toxic environment. It's hard to keep positive about your job when that's going on, even if you're doing well.

The office needs to be improved. There are two separate rooms, and often a bad smell because of a leak.  This separates and isolates some employees, which is detrimental at our young stage when we're trying to build a sustainable culture.  

The benefits and perks don't match up at all to other American tech companies in Dublin. This is to be expected at the stage of growth we are at but it's important to know this if you are applying that there are no free lunches (excuse the pun) or big budgets for team outings/activities! This will be there in the future I'd say."
427,Glassdoor,Frustrating: Such a Good company that can't get Over the Hump,2017-07-28,2.0,,"Free food, great wellness programs, social events, great middle management,. Company invests a fortune in having the best systems and outside training, and travel budget. Easy to prospect since company's can't ignore their profile. Your managers care about you if you put in  effort. There are a couple of easy wins/ one call closes every quarter. The company's concept of helping people find jobs they love is an easy one to promote every day.  At the end of the day, the idea is a heck of a great one that changed the game and made millions of people happy in their career.","Pay and product! Pay:  We gave what you said would work a try and even though personally I've been very successful, but I still see a lot of my peer's dejected and out.  This ""bonus"" system is unfair and a way for the company to with hold money until the end of the year. Add to the fact that you can hit your annual number and still not make our lower than average OTE, not good.

Majority of people still can't hit quota, unless we rob peter (next months pipeline) to pay paul, (whatever the gap is) and hurt pipeline.  You can make good money here in the higher tiers ( but still be underpaid compared to other ENT roles), however, it will take a lot of time to get there even if you're good  In the SMB teir since we a lot out of your control., and the org growing every year doesn't have numbers to a science.

Company always listens and addresses items,, unless the focus groups aren't saying anything, a lot still needs to be fixed. 

Product: we've relied so much on our content we haven't done anything impactful.  People are tired of posting jobs and hoping they get a good applicant, we should be doing more like our competition."
428,Glassdoor,Not what it's hyped up to be,2017-07-24,2.0,Account Manager,"Nice people
Some free snacks/drinks
lunch 3x week via Seamless","When I first started at Glassdoor, they sold the dream, and I will admit it was fun at first.  Comp has changed significantly as we all know we are underpaid (according to our own tool) and no one is happy anymore.  Our comp plan was supposedly changed for the better, but everyone is making less now on this current plan and people are starting to look elsewhere- like competitors where pay is much higher.  For the type of industry we are in and what we preach to the companies we work with, the company culture is no where near where it should be.  The offices are super cliquey and both offices are boring (if you're looking for a fun modern-day office vibe, look elsewhere.)  Chicago is  moving to a new one, however it's in a horrible location (nothing nearby) and not so great area.  We also have no work from home freedom, which most in this type of role would have.  Asking managers for a day off or work from home day is stressful and never seems to be accommodating, but when a manger needs a day off or to work from home- no questions asked."
429,Glassdoor,Great place to work,2017-07-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have really enjoyed my time working at Glassdoor.

We also have so many great perks, benefits are amazing, promotion opportunities are through the roof, and of course, a GREAT opportunity to make some $$$. 

Pros:
 - Lunch on MW & Thurs
 - Catered breakfast for events
 - Snacks on snacks
 - La Croix, Coke, Diet coke, water, coffee 
 - KIND OF unlimited PTO - not really though
 - Flexible work hours
 - Work/Life Balance","This being a ""young org"" will go through its changes, but this isn't really a con. If you can't roll with the punches, this might not be the place for you."
431,Glassdoor,"Finally, A Company That Feels Like Home",2017-07-17,5.0,Editorial Director,"After 15 years in my career, I've finally found a company that truly fits 96% if not more of my needs, wants and desires. It is the perfect place for me in my life right now, professionally and personally. I used to think that a job could only be but so good -- that it could only satisfy two of the three major requirements (pay, people and project). My husband says that he learned in business school that you will, in fact, only ever get two of the three. However, I have found all three at Glassdoor. A great salary, funny/hard-working people and a project or work product that challenges me every day and gives me the autonomy I've been looking for.

It's a senior start-up, as I like to say. Glassdoor has the nimbleness of a start-up with none of the uncertainty. It has the professional polish of a large company without the politics or bureaucracy. It's a great place for those who know what they want and have the drive, passion and mid-career experience to make it happen.","As a member of the marketing organization, I don't experience many of the downsides that others might. Overall it's a very strong organization. However, to provide balance, here are the areas that need improvement:
-Clear focus on business objectives and resources. While there is so much to do with the product and in the space, Glassdoor is only 750 people. Prioritization is key. To do everything we want to do, we'll have to either focus on the 80-20 rule more, or hire more people.

-Location. I love working on the waterfront, but the commute is hard for 85% of the company in Mill Valley. A larger SF office with opportunities to work from there would be great not only for current staff but for our recruitment and retention efforts.

-People of Color. No need to beat around the bush, I'm not talking about ""diversity."" I'm referring to actual people of color in our ranks. We need more. We have diversity of thought, gender, socio-economic status, etc. However, Glassdoor truly struggles with hiring and retaining people of color. It's no longer okay to say that we're not as big as our contemporaries and, therefore, cannot put the emphasis on hiring people of color. It's imperative to our innovation and growth that we invest in racially diverse communities."
432,Glassdoor,Sales Development Representative,2017-07-17,5.0,Sales Development Representative,Great benefits. Great group of people that all get along- have a work hard play hard mentality. Managers always willing to help out in any way.,hard to get promoted quickly due to the amount of people wanting the same promotion.

- Mostly enjoyable people
- Good benefits
- Daily lunches
- In building  gym

Overall a pretty decent place to work.",In a transition period trying to become a bigger player in the jobs and recruiting markets which leads to canned projects on a whim.   The company uses a top-down approach to many projects in order to get buy in.   There also tends to be an excessive amount of planning that leads into a shortened time frame to complete your goals.
434,Glassdoor,They're trying to get it right,2017-07-13,5.0,Account Manager,"This is hands down the best company I've worked for (and I have worked for companies featured on our BPTW list). I'm surrounded by smart, motivating and wonderful people each day. I have a manager who has helped me grow more in the past year then I thought I ever could. 

As you can see in just about every recent review, yes the road is bumpy right now. But, I do genuinely believe management and leadership is fighting to make it right. It's hard to see GD as a start-up but we are still adapting to this hyper growth and I'm trying to be patient with management as they pave the road ahead. 

There are some absolutely amazing leaders and mentors here at Glassdoor. As we grow as a company, current employees are being given a unique opportunity to learn and test their own limits.","Every review before this has mentioned the issues with compensation and quota. It's been really challenging on the growth side. 

Because we're Glassdoor, cultural transparency is king. However, when it comes to logistical and operational transparency that's where things get grey and where honestly, I don't think there is any. 

Communication continues to be a roadblock. Changes will happen and teams will have to wait weeks to find out really critical information like who their manager will be and what accounts will land in their name for the next quarter. It's hard to charge ahead with confidence when you feel like you're being left in the dark with little consideration form leadership."
435,Glassdoor,Still Crazy (fun) After All These Years,2017-07-11,4.0,Director of Jobs and Search Operations,"I have forged some incredible friendships, relationships and memories over the course of my time at Glassdoor, and I don't want it to end yet.  Having been here longer than most, it has been a real treat watching this company evolve, scale and step up to each of the new challenges that we face.  It's never a dull moment, and has always been a fast paced journey, and I am proud to be a part of it.  

People you work with here are generally motivated and hungry to make an impact and show value.  Glassdoor has helped me grow and mature, particularly in engaging and communicating with peers and colleagues effectively, and while many companies may talk about trying to foster an open-sharing collaborative environment, Glassdoor actually puts it into practice.  As in life, nothing is perfect and it doesn't always mean that every single interaction you are going to have here is going to be the most amazing one ever, but we strive to bring a general standard in these types of engagements.  I think it subtly permeates through the org and relieves stress proactively for us, even when feeling like things are going as smoothly as they should.

The culture has evolved and changed, and rightfully so.  You can't expect the company to be the same company it was 5 years ago, when we were a fifth of the size.  Through it all, there is still a solid rock and foundation which innately bleeds green, and it can never die.","Adjusting to scale has been a hard challenge.  Like with most scenarios involving masses of people, it's hard to please and satisfy everyone.  Because we have an open collaborative environment, it's not uncommon to hear those dislikes, groans or sighs of disapproval from some folks.  The challenge has been keeping the course, and pushing harder through those moments of adversary and doing small corrections, rather than tacking so frequently and disrupting our line.

We suffer a little bit from a resourcing and sizing problem, particularly in our core engineering areas.  We want to deliver so much, but are not willing to really push and pony up for the resources for where they matter most.  Moving fast comes at a price, and we haven't figured out which one to pay into, speed or efficacy."

Totally love the vision of helping people find the jobs that fit their life.","The biggest downside, especially for engineering, is the career growth aspect and the ability to move fast towards technological advancements.

There is also a long way to become truly agile especially now that the organization has grown to a decent size. 

The expectation of people should work extra hours similar to being in a start-up does not really gel well with everything else that is not so start-up like.

The other downside has also been the location as the company is growing and it does not help much in hiring local talent."

It is lead by someone who empowers us to be the best we can be. A trusting, caring culture has been created making it a pleasure to come to work.","The size of the company has become overwhelming. Growth is definitely good but along with it you lose the ""family feel"". Teams are segregated into their various rolls and it is very difficult to get to know others at a deeper level.

I think we are all hopeful for the day that Glassdoor takes that next step.","After seeing the ups and downs the past few years it feels like we are coming out of a rut now.  However the attitude and impatience of some of the employees can be a downer on us all and that affects overall moral of the company.  Salary and 401k plans are something we have all dealt with over the past few years and made a choice to join regardless.

I've only been here a few months, but I already know it's the best place I've ever worked. The benefits, the people, the culture and atmosphere are all stellar. The work is challenging in a good way and there's a lot to learn. There are many growing opportunities within the company as well, as the company continues to expand. Even though it's a growing company, importance is placed on keeping a tight knit feel with team huddles involving all offices, good communication, and visits from members of other offices and teams. At a local level, teams are also extremely close and there are many fun bonding opportunities presented both in and outside of the office. Everyone is willing to help each other at work, and there is a laid back atmosphere. Managers and HR are always available to talk or answer questions. Co-workers and management actually care about getting to know you. ""Good morning"" and ""Have a goodnight"" are phrases that you will hear everyday. Flexible hours and the option to sometimes work from home help contribute to a good work/life balance. It's a dog friendly office, which puts a smile on everyones' faces. Free drinks and snacks are available in the kitchen, bagel Mondays and donut Wednesdays, and free fitness classes during the day. Work laptop provided, your choice of mac or pc. Excellent health insurance, dental, vision, FSA, 401k, paid holidays, and PTO.  You keep track of your own time. There are free courses for professional and personal development available for those who are interested. Overall, Glassdoor is a great place to work. We put in hard work, but we have a good time doing it.","Training is a lengthy process, but this is necessary because there is a lot to learn.

- The people, culture, career opportunities, managers and clear company vision motivate me to fully dive into the work I'm doing every day. I no longer dread Monday mornings!
- My managers trust and empower me to continue learning and take on new tasks to help build my skills. I know that my experience at Glassdoor will help further my career in the long run.
- I truly believe in the mission to help everyone everywhere find a job and company they love. Plus, most people and media I talk to love Glassdoor (almost) as much as I do, and that always gives me a boost of brand pride.
- Great benefits and pay: Dogs in the office, free (healthy) catered lunch everyday, cover phone bill, free parking (which is a big deal in the Bay Area), onsite gym, community events (gotta love lip sync karaoke for Pride), unlimited PTO, etc.","- While I love Marin County, it's a pain to pay bridge toll every day. Would be nice to have a benefit to help cover the cost.
- The company has expanded into two buildings in Mill Valley. The second is shared with several other businesses and doesn't feel as much like Glassdoor as the first building."
447,Glassdoor,"Amazing opportunity, incredible people, some serious setbacks recently",2017-07-07,4.0,Account Manager,"Overall, Glassdoor is a phenomenal place to work and would be high up on the Best Places to Work list if they weren't the ones curating the list. I would highly recommend it to anyone considering joining. I would love to see some serious improvement on some tough issues, but what company is perfect? All things considered this place can be a great career accelerator. Come help us get to the next level! 

Pros:

- The people. 93% of the people you'll meet here are genuine, down to earth, kind, good natured, selfless, intelligent, and always willing to help. I've made some friends for life here. 

-Team culture. Largely a function of the wonderful people you'll work with, this is different than overall company culture, this is more about the culture that develops between the individuals you grind with, battling side by side with you day in and day out to get to your numbers. I know this is not applicable to every single team across the company, but all the front line managers that I know here in Chicago aim to develop a fun, winning, close knit team. We truly enjoy each others company, on and off the sales floor. 

- The mission. We're a late stage start up with significant funding from top tier investors that know what they're doing, a recognizable brand name in a large profitable market, and a unique product vision that I can sell knowing wholeheartedly it's in the best interest of my client to invest in us. Transparency, employee engagement, employer branding, diversity/inclusion  - this is the next frontier for companies that value healthy corporate cultures (and they should, based on research connecting employee satisfaction to productivity and bottom line revenue), whether employers like it or not. First it was free snacks, standing desks, and gym memberships - now it's listening to your employees and (at least creating the appearance of) genuinely caring what they have to say. 

- The opportunity. We are a high growth company and if you work hard, succeed in you role, and build authentic relationships with people - there will be opportunity for advancement. That doesn't mean it isn't difficult, you just have to be smart and intentional about how you craft your personal brand and position yourself when the time comes. I will say, the advancement process could use a healthy dose of transparency and over-communication. 

- Work life balance. This actually exists here. Need to duck out early at 2 one day? No problem. Want to take a week off for vacation (with proper notice)? Actually encouraged.  Need to leave work every day at lunch to walk your dog for an hour? Cool. As long as you are communicating your needs in advance and it's not impacting your results, you will have a flexible, understanding manager. 

- Senior sales leadership team. The senior sales leaders at Glassdoor are experienced, communicative, empathetic, and incredibly smart. I believe they have the genuine best interests of the sales team at heart, and I do believe in their vision. 

-Company values. This is subjective, but I'm proud to be part of an organization that strives to make a positive impact in the world.  Filing an amicus brief against the refugee ban. All the research & work we do around the gender pay gap. Making real strides for pay transparency helping working folks negotiate for higher pay. This stuff matters.","-Sales Operations in relation to comp/quota/books. We recently had some turnover in Sales Ops, and for the last 4-5 months the side of sales ops that deals with comp/quota/books has been pretty much a complete disaster area for the growth side of the business, if we're being brutally honest. Couldn't be any worse timing with the transition from FY17 to FY18 and new books/plans being created and rolled out. It's devastatingly demoralizing and unspeakably frustrating when the growth sales leadership team top to bottom either has no clue how sales ops is building books, quotas, and comp plans, or has no say in how they do it. How do you build a comp plan without knowing what quotas and books look like? You end up building a comp plan and sales flow that emphasizes retention, when the quotas actually require much more growth. What in the world is going on? When neither your manager, your director, or your SVP can't/won't give you a straight answer for months and months (the quarter was more than halfway over before we got our quota; we still to this day don't completely understand why we're getting paid out less on our deals than last year), its frankly unacceptable. When we ask about it, we get the response: don't worry it will all make sense eventually and in the meantime the bottom line is you have to sell more into your book than last year (even though there's a new sales motion and some people are struggling with basic living expenses while still hitting growth quotas). Accountability works both ways... If we couldn't give you a forecast for the quarter until more than halfway through, we wouldn't be employed here. If we couldn't explain why we didn't hit our target or why we lost a particular deal, we wouldn't be employed here. And yet we're supposed to be okay with a high degree of ambiguity ""because we're an agile start up."" That excuse for incompetence only goes so far before your top performers are inevitably interviewing elsewhere. I can tell you this - they don't want to. They want to believe in you, sales leaders. We're all looking to you to help us out of this mess, but you don't have much more time. 

-Sales ops issues aside, overall compensation is a slight con. Lower base and OTE compared to similar companies and similar roles. But in reality, b/c of the strength of our brand, you're actually more likely to actually hit your OTE than most smaller companies. 6 months ago, I would have told you it's a lock that you'll make up the lower base in more commission/bonuses. But the changes to the comp plan have made me seriously skeptical of the risk. It also remains to be seen whether the equity plan for recent employees will make up the difference. 

- SMB customer success. Cases take a full day to escalate from customer support to a customer enablement manager. Client emails us with urgent technical issue that requires resolution immediately, but the process takes 48 hours to resolve. AM's have very little visibility into who their assigned CEM is, what CEMs will or won't do, and who they should talk to when there's a problem with an account because CEMs + account assignments change on a quarterly basis it feels like. We get one presentation a year on this, but then in practice it all falls apart. I don't think the problem is the people, they're all great and strive to help to the best of their ability. It's the process and structure that truly boggles the mind. 

-Product performance. Without getting too detailed, some aspects of our products underperform compared to the market and often we struggle to justify ROI with customers. Help us by building a stronger product and improving the type of data we have access to that builds a successful partnership business case."
448,Glassdoor,I love this place! But...,2017-07-07,3.0,Associate Account Manager,"Glassdoor is one of the best companies I have ever worked for! The team I am on is amazing! I feel respected and supported by them everyday. In addition, I am surrounded by other like-minded individuals that push me to be a better version of myself everyday. These aren't just co-workers, but some of the best of friends and people I consider almost family. Our work environment is collaborative which I absolutely LOVE! There is an opportunity to learn and grow not only as an employee, but as an individual. Everyone is very passionate about what they do and there is no shortage of drive (until recently).","There is a reason behind my 3 star review. With an ever evolving business, I understand that changes need to be made. One of the perks of working at GD is an ""uncapped commission,"" meaning if a rep performs well, the opportunity to make more money is there. Recently, we had a shift in our compensation plan that changed this. We were told that the reason quotas being rolled out in April were delayed was due to perfecting the compensation plans, yet we were to find out that the drastic changes were not communicated to our leadership and then to us. Now, we have capped commission and we've removed all bonuses for retaining current client base. All ""bonuses"" that we can receive for hitting our numbers each quarter are already built into our target, rather than extra money we can make after hitting full quota. This is causing those with extreme drive and passion to feel that's not enough - quotas are too high and impossible to hit."
449,Glassdoor,"Growing, Exciting Things To Come",2017-07-07,5.0,Account Executive,"In sales, there are always challenges and GD is not immune. But they seem to be open to feedback and willing to listen. The org isn't too huge so you don't feel like you're just a number.","Not as many perks as some of the bigger companies in the Chicago area but that's going to change with the new building opening in the fall, I think."
450,Glassdoor,Work for Glassdoor!,2017-07-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great environment to be apart of, truly a transparent company. Supportive leaders are within.","Can be a competitive, stressful environment"
451,Glassdoor,Not too shabby,2017-07-07,4.0,Account Executive,"Great teachers, leaders and motivated employees; everyone here has a great outlook and appetite for success. Exciting time to be in Chicago as we are moving to a new office and seeing the company grow has been awesome! 

Free food 3x a week with a lot of opportunity for happy hours and a great work life balance.","The office atmosphere is relaxed, but there are clear favorites in the crowd that seem to be promoted into positions that they aren't necessarily a fit for, just based on campaigning successfully. The pay isn't all that great, they continue to change our comp plans to be ""awesome"" but truth be told unless you're hitting 100% every single month, you won't get the full pay out and there is still unclear and untold terms which makes people skeptical."
452,Glassdoor,Bring Back That Lovin' Feelin',2017-07-06,3.0,Enterprise Account Manager,"There are a lot of reasons I love working at Glassdoor: 
1) We are making a major impact in the landscape of recruiting. The mission to help people everywhere find a job and a company they love is meaningful and is something I feel excited about doing every day. I enjoy the conversations I have with our employer partners and I feel like I'm helping them shape their strategy. It's rewarding work. 
2) The people! What other reviewers say is true... I work alongside the smartest, most hard working and driven individuals. It's a true team environment where we all help and support each other.
3) My managers. I've been incredibly lucky to work for and learn from two really talented individuals in my time here. I always feel they have my best interest at heart, work to remove obstacles, coach me with valuable feedback and push me to be better. While my two managers have been very different, have both taught me skills that will benefit me well past my tenure at Glassdoor. 
4) Add all of the perks like ongoing professional and EQ training, free lunch and snacks, team events, an onsite gym and classes, free health benefits, a beautiful and sunny location, dogs in the office... it truly is a great place to work.","I am sad to say that it feels like the wheels are falling off in so many areas of the business, and it's easy to lose track of all of the things I love about working here. Each department is stretched incredibly thin. B2B Product rolls out half-finished, not well thought-through products, Data Science is understaffed and can't produce the reporting the sales team needs, Product Marketing can't keep up with sales collateral because they have to jump through 100 hoops to get something developed then approved, our Customer Success team is understaffed/overworked/underpaid and managing too many accounts .... it's no fault of the people in these departments, many of them are incredibly talented, it's that we need more of them. 

Specifically for the ENT Account Management group, I can't even begin to calculate the amount of time spent pulling reports and building presentations for client meetings. This needs to be automated so we can our time strategically selling into our accounts. Like ASAP, not ""it's coming."" A number of positive changes have been made this year (i.e. reducing the number of accounts each AM manages, fewer reps under one manager, newly created/to-be-formed Customer Insights team) but if you're looking at this role, you need to be prepared to work a lot of late hours, travel around the country and likely only hit 80-90% of your quota. 

Quotas and Compensation? We'll look past the fact that our Fiscal Year started April 1, but we didn't have our quotas until May, nor our Comp Plans until the first week of July. Quotas are structured with unrealistic expectations of revenue growth when our product hasn't historically performed well enough to justify a larger investment from our clients. Although a number of people on the team were asked their input on the structure of both quota and comp, it was all in vain as it doesn't seem any was taken into account. Comp is below market value and an unattainable quota means you're not hitting your OTE and even more underpaid for working 60+ hour weeks. Not to mention you just plain don't feel like you're winning and successful."
453,Glassdoor,Amazing team and great engineering culture,2017-07-05,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Great engineering talent, always willing to help and easy to collaborate with
- Smart and hard working people all around
- Onsite lunches everyday, beautiful office location if you're in the north bay or SF","- Commute can be expensive if you're living in the city especially GG bridge toll i.e. 6.5$ everyday, company should really reimburse this for the folks who come from SF"
454,Glassdoor,Practice what you preach,2017-07-05,3.0,Sales,"My coworkers are great and I could not ask for a better team to work with or to be a part of. When I started, we had a great culture and really embraced the growing start up vibe. On a team level we are there to help each other every step of the way.","Our comp plan was recently changed to the point where many of us cannot afford to live. We are completely underpaid and under appreciated. Pay us less and expect us to do more? Not really a good way to run a business.  

I would not recommend joining the company at this time. They are so focused on becoming public that they have lost their full sense of what Glassdoor is about. We preach transparency  but recently we have all been in the dark.  Suddenly there is something announced that is a major change. Management says they had no idea, but how can you run a business keeping your managers and directors our of the loop? Sounds a bit fishy."

457,Glassdoor,Amazing Learning Experience - Vision/Leadership still unclear,2017-06-13,4.0,Sales,The people!! You will see time and time again that the people that work for this company are absolutely amazing.  The office location can sometimes have you stranded due to flooding but almost always it is sunnier than the city.  Lunch every day was delicious and it was also helpful to have the gym to workout whenever you wanted.,"The Company

I feel like Glassdoor hasn't quite defined what they want to do yet. Do they want to focus on branding? Do they want to focus on Jobs? Do they want to focus on Salaries/Data? When I was there I wasn't quite sure what the play was, and I think the company is currently struggling with the same questions.  How the product is sold also poses as a risk for the company. Sales people have to sell the vision of Glassdoor using mashed up ROIs in order to get Marketing/HR/Recruiting to invest. I think this is why the sales/cs team is such a large portion of the company (about 1/3 last time I was there) and I think there needs to be some creative thinking as I don't see the large proportion of sales as scalable.

Leadership

I think Sales Leadership is lacking.  Glassdoor is not ready to become a public company if the leaders of the sales org cannot carry a number they signed off on. Leadership consistently ""signs off"" on decisions and then doubles back on this and says they never signed off or were pressured to do so, you will hear every excuse in the book instead of them owning it. This type of leadership unfortunately has percolated to the bottom, where now Sales Reps and Sales Managers think it is okay to do this when they aren't hitting their numbers as well, this is why quotas changed 5+ times during my time there. The culture has turned into the blame game versus grit. Let's be honest, at most Saas companies in the bay area  30-40% of the sales org hits their quotas. 

HR/Promotion Cycle
Glassdoor has a tight budget, don't expect to get promoted even if recruiting tells you that during your calls with them. I had 3 managers during my time and unfortunately this meant I didn't have anyone fighting to get me the salary I deserved. Don't expect anything to be given to you even if you do amazing work."
458,Glassdoor,Not for the faint hearted,2017-05-30,3.0,Sales Manager,"Glassdoor Dublin is home to our super talented and passionate teams including Marketing, SDRs, New Business, Customer Success and HR.

What I enjoy most about the Dublin Office are the inspirational people I work with every day, who believe in Glassdoor and our mission to help employers hire informed candidates at scale.

We genuinely enjoy spending time together both in and outside of our temporary home in Regus; whether that's going for a run at lunchtime or enjoying a couple of pints in the local pub, where we had a great evening with our CEO, Robert, and his wife when they visited the office a few months back.  As pioneers in Dublin, we have the honour of building our flavour of Glassdoor's culture, which is unique to Dublin and it's amazing to see it evolve and grow as we do.

There is a world of potential for Glassdoor in EMEA; don't be naive, it takes hard work and determination - long hours and flexibility and that is not for everyone, and that's ok. Every day I am challenged to find a new way to move forward, find a solution to a new problem that I haven't met before and that's part of the reason I joined.

You need to hold yourself accountable, no one is going to do it for you and it's up to you to find your way to make yourself successful. No one on the team should fear failure, if something goes wrong we share what happened, discuss what we learned and how we will avoid repeating the same mistakes as we move forward.

We are on the crest of the wave in EMEA and I am excited to see what the next 6-12 months will bring for Glassdoor Dublin.","Working for Glassdoor, I understand how powerful reviews are, and my intention is to collaborate on how we can make Glassdoor Dublin even better... 
As a remote office finding our own way, we have a host of challenges specific to Dublin; from IT and facilities to consistent processes and structure which can take its toll on team morale over time. It can sometimes be frustrating when there is a lack of guidance and it feels like we are battling to catch up as opposed to getting ahead of where we should be as the great company that we are.

I am confident that we will get there, as a team... it's what we pride ourselves on as a company, our grit and determination; and we need to see more inclusivity and autonomy to enable our shared success in EMEA."
459,Glassdoor,A Rewarding and Valuable Experience,2017-05-24,5.0,Data Scientist,"I was able to accomplish the most meaningful work of my career while at Glassdoor. Because Glassdoor is a relatively small company that collects a lot of data for jobs, salaries, and company reviews, there are a lot of problems to tackle, and a lot of flexibility in your approach to solving them. At the end of the day it feels pretty rewarding to know that your work can impact millions of Glassdoor users. I always felt appreciated by my managers for the work that I was doing while there as well. 

Glassdoor hires smart and friendly people. I really enjoyed my daily interactions with team members, and can honestly say that I learned something new from my manager or peers every week. I feel that the upper management is competent and is steering Glassdoor on a path to success. 

The mission of the company is noble and sincere - help people everywhere find a job they love. A lot of companies will just publish some corporate ""values"" or ""mission statements"", but I do feel Glassdoor is trying to empower people to make the best career decision they possibly can. 

Location - a lot of people complain that the location in Mill Valley is a negative, but if you live in the northern part of San Francisco, it can be a quick reverse commute. The office boasts serene views of Richardson Bay and Tiburon, and the free parking isn't bad either.","It's really frustrating being a Glassdoor stock/option holder right now. Glassdoor has one of the most restrictive shareholder agreements in the industry. Employees are not free to sell their shares on a private company exchange like EquityZen, nor has Glassdoor offered to buy back a portion of employees' stock (at least while I was there.) The executives claim that the reason for the restriction is so that all employees have some skin in the game, without acknowledging that it's very possible (and common) for employees to sell a portion of their shares AND have skin in the game. It's a fallacious argument, and possibly indicative of some ulterior reasoning and/or motives."
460,Glassdoor,Exciting company where you can make a difference and work alongside great people,2017-05-24,5.0,Partnerships,"I loved coming in to work every day. The team are all so lovely and respectful and the work environment is great. Everyone is very driven about the Glassdoor mission and very passionate about their work. Glassdoor as an employer is super flexible and appreciates the work/life balance of their employees. You also get a lot of opportunity at Glassdoor to use your skills and develop professionally. It's still in many ways a start-up which clearly isn't for everyone but really what difference do you expect to make at the alternative, a 10k+ employees professional network company based in central London? If you want to really contribute and feel like your work makes a difference then you should work for Glassdoor. 

The direct management in my team was very supportive, great mentors and anything but micro-management. Generally Glassdoor doesn't really do micromanagement  which also means you should know to manage yourself. 

Other pros are the competitive salary, great office location, nice team events, progression and autonomy. 

Talking for the London office, I wouldn't say the negative reviews really give an accurate idea of the work environment. There's challenges that come with any start-up but most comments do not resonate with my experience in any way.

I can truly recommend Glassdoor to anyone that is looking for a meaningful job, with tons of learning opportunities, room for growth, amazing colleagues and a healthy work environment.","I had no reason whatsoever to leave on my own initiative for above reasons but the company decided to let me go due to focus shift away from most EMEA markets. Very disappointing and sad but I respect tough decisions need to be made in order to move the business forward - although in all modesty I believe this was a poor decision made by higher management as I (as well as my colleagues in the other markets) build up tons of relationships within industry and media landscape that will be hard to rebuild when focus will be shifting back to those markets. In addition to that we took on so many different tasks outside of our original jobs such as sales, marketing, pr, etc. (which I loved as never a day was the same), while getting paid for 1 which is a pretty good deal for the company I'd say. It's like spending ages on building a sand castle and then kicking it in. What monster does that, no offense. Anyway I'm all for flexible redundancy rules but perhaps in a more constructive way."
461,Glassdoor,Anything in life worth having is worth working for,2017-05-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been at Glassdoor London longer than anyone else and feel that I am qualified to give a balanced opinion based on a number of different team changes and a significant amount of growth over time. I fully believe that Glassdoor is destined for greatness on a global scale and I personally enjoy working here very much. I look forward to every day, I understand and support the mission of the company, I know how I can make a difference and my goals are clear. I feel like I am well supported by my manager and wider team in the US and I also feel like the work-life balance is good. Our benefits program is slowly improving but the main benefit for me are the share options, which I value highly. 
The culture in London is good (in my opinion) although perhaps a work in progress. We get together and socialise pretty regularly. We always have team events in  the pipeline and I enjoy everyone's company in the office. 
Some of us have been around for a while now and, just as with any company, others have left for various reasons. It hasn't worked out for some people, but at the end of the day, that's life. Glassdoor isn't for everyone and some people have probably had a pretty rough time and struggled, but I have thrived here. I feel appreciated by the CEO and in return I feel a strong sense of loyalty. There's no magic formula: if you like your job and you are good at it, you do well.","Let's be honest, we're not there yet, in terms of where I want Glassdoor to be in Europe nor where I thought we would be at this point in 2017. As a company, we're having to re-focus and set ourselves up for success, and I accept that. This is quite normal for a hyper-growth company. I'm not concerned about our strategy or momentum, but it doesn't mean that I'm not fed up about being temporarily restricted in terms of my scope. 

My hours can be quite long and there is certainly a lot of scrutiny and pressure. However, I've always felt that I can take the time I need to recharge as well as have flexible working. 

If you like an all-singing, all-dancing benefits scheme, everything on a plate, easy-sell corporate environment with massive salaries, then Glassdoor is not for you. If you don't mind pushing the envelope and you are resilient enough to rough it a bit on the journey, then Glassdoor could take you into a new league in terms of what you thought you could achieve and where you thought your career could go. You need to see the bigger picture and not get caught up on little things if you want to be satisfied working here. I actually like this in a way because it filters out those that can't, or are not willing, to go the distance."

470,Glassdoor,"Fun, engaging, challenging",2017-04-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"You are given the opportunity to do great work with as much or as little supervision or guidance as you need.  Transparency is high and it really feels like you are being encouraged and empowered to make an impact.  It is an exciting time to be at this company, we are having fun and getting things done!","We have a lot to do and there is a lot of necessary change happening, does not work for everyone.  Some team members are wedded to the past and finding it hard to move on and look at things differently."
471,Glassdoor,we are family,2017-04-24,5.0,Enterprise Account Manager,"-Family: I say this all the time, but the employees at Glassdoor are not just that. We are really like a family--and we genuinely care about each other & enjoy each other. To me, that is the best part about waking up and coming to work every morning. And on top of that, our leadership truly cares about us as well. Our CEO, Robert, may not know everyone's face, but he knows every name (pretty incredible in a company of 800 people).

-Perks: From incredible health insurance to the ability to wear jeans & flip-flops to the catered lunches, we really do have a good amount of perks & benefits. We are pretty transparent with the fact that we may not pay at the tip-top of the scale (it's still pretty good though!), but we have other things to make up for that. Stock options, flexible vacation policy, ability to work from home if needed.

-Autonomy: One of things I appreciate about Glassdoor is that they let you do you. I have rarely (if ever) felt micro-managed. On the AM side, we are truly the leaders of our own book and are empowered to treat our accounts & clients & schedules in the way we think is best. I hear about a lot of other companies where managers get involved in every little issue, call, deal, etc. but our leadership respects our decisions.","-We are still a start-up, so change is going to happen. A lot. If you can't roll with the punches, then this may be a hard place to be. With that being said, we change so much because leadership actually listens to us and our needs & concerns. We constantly make changes to territories, comp structure, support, etc. so we can grow & scale and still provide the employees with what we need. 

-Because there is so much change, it is sometimes hard to get a clear picture on what your career path will be or can be at Glassdoor. Things can pop up really quickly, or you may have to wait several months longer than originally planned to get a promo. We do need to do a better job of preparing people for career advancement & mentoring them to that next step, providing feedback on where they hit & where they miss, and being upfront."
472,Glassdoor,Great people with room for improvement,2017-04-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,They really practice what they preach here - feeling like you have a forum for transparency and honesty is #1. Day to day operations are improving month over month and the work/life balance is great. If you can go with the flow of a startup culture and you're willing to roll up your sleeves and go the extra mile - this place is awesome.,Non-sales departments tend to get the shaft in terms of culture/recognition. Sometimes communication lacks with regard to changes/system rollouts and that gets frustrating.  No talks of career paths (although we're told it's on the way) for non-sales roles unless you really push the subject with your manager.
473,Glassdoor,Great place to work!,2017-04-22,5.0,Senior Account Executive,Glassdoor has overall been amazing experience. The people who work for Glassdoor are truly amazing and care about the product. The Glassdoor mission is clear and product is great. I couldn't be happier.,"Like every startup, there are growing pains. This past year was tough with quotas a bit of a stretch. However, management took note of the miss and made the correction. We are back on path and heading for a great year."
474,Glassdoor,Unfulfilling sweatshop,2017-04-19,1.0,Account Executive,"Glassdoor has attracted some genuinely cool people and the idea of working for a ""Startup"" in a new market sounded appealing.","Where to start... If you are a seasoned sales pro, this is not the place for you. Many have come and many have gone. 

Your CV will get you the interview, your performance in the interview will get you the job and then prepare to forget everything that has made you successful and exist in a world of Sandler and scripted sales, asking nothing but a series of questions to the point where you are making the person on the other end of the phone uncomfortable. You hate when it's being done to you and now you're doing it to others, with your manager listening in! 

You will be assigned a book of 1500 accounts but expect them to be blasted by hundreds of templated emails by the SDR team and burnt. Aggressive American sales tactics are enforced and celebrated at Glassdoor with awards being handed out by the SDR Team Lead. But incredibly high activities have worked in the past for the US market, but we're not in the US market. You cannot conduct this way in Europe and not expect to be burnt.

You are not allowed to go after new business?! This was always the biggest mystery at Glassdoor, new business AE's can not go after new business. Non-stop expansion stories in the Irish media, with job announcement all across the country. 400 jobs in Dublin etc, and the company isn't a customer of Glassdoor, what will I do next?? Nothing, back to your book of accounts. With every major US tech company having an EMEA operation in Dublin, you would think that in a new market, this would be the lowest hanging fruit for the Dublin and London office. But no, when the topic is raised with management the response is ""you have 1500 accounts you should be focussing on."" Glassdoor hasn't figured out how to approach MNC's from beyond the US. 

The sales strategy is inbound focused - Pump the marketing engine full of cash and measure the outcome - organic traffic to free profiles. SDR receive inbounds and are not expected to qualify the lead. They are expected to uncover a Need before passing it to the AE. Again, another big mystery at Glassdoor, why is the success of the SDR and marketing team being inflated?? It makes no sense, the business is hurting the business. You will be forced to work a worthless pipeline and forced to do the job of an SDR. And then you will be asked in 1:1's ""if you asked the correct questions"" or ""did we get enough pain"". AE's are treated like poor behaving volunteers. 

Selling the product is a cycle of rinse and repeat, the same series of questions, the same presentations, dressed up to uncover an incredible amount of pain and presenting on what is essentially a coat of paint on a shop front. You will hate yourself after the first quarter. 

EMEA management are like fish out of water. Inexperienced, incredibly political and emotional. In place to enforce Sandler and ""learnings"",  through call breakdowns, 1:1's and team meetings. Weekly meetings sometimes hit 7 hours per week! Madness. Glassdoor love to enforce the methodology, over and over again. Friday afternoons meant it was time for the weekly, throw my colleague under a bus session, with 15 AE's and managers listening to one of your bad calls followed by a round the room critique. How embarrassing for those involved. Your manager will contact you through IM, Whatsapp and email at all hours, weekends and when you're on annual leave asking about your pipeline. There are no boundaries. The fall on the sword moment will be that they just want to make you successful and that's why they're reaching out. 

No perks to speak of. Typical in the tech industry due to the demands and nature of the business, good companies provide perks to ease stress. Glassdoor in the US provides perks and operate in a world where feedback and concerns are encouraged and acted on - They become better employers by doing this. In Dublin, there is one perk to speak of, a shared Nespresso machine in the shared kitchen of a serviced office. Completely unacceptable for a ""Startup"" who have been trading in Dublin for 14 months, carrying an EMEA HQ stamp. You will be told that business is creating a true startup environment which is something not everybody gets's to experience, (so count yourselves lucky?!). Obviously a complete cop-out. 

Apply for a role if you want to start a sales career in the tech industry. It would seem that previous experience isn't required and that the culture fit is what's most important. So if you can conform to the micromanagement and what I've outlined above, you'll do well.

What a truly disappointing experience."
475,Glassdoor,Flaws in stock option plan,2017-04-12,2.0,Senior Vice President,"The site benefits job seekers and is good for the world. The company is young, energetic and has a good sense of camaraderie.","The stock option plan has several significant flaws that make the stock riskier than other startups. Most employees aren't aware of these flaws. The CEO has been aware of these issues for years and has not done anything about it. In fact he has done one thing to make it even riskier. He has failed the employees in this area.

Glassdoor rejected the first version of this review because I was specific about the ways it is riskier and leads to more tax for employees and exiting employees. So, to get this version approved, I am going to have to be more vague and leave it in the hands of the current employees to investigate and resolve with the CEO.

Without specifically saying what Glassdoor plan has or doesn't have...Theoretically, here is what a good stock option plan puts in place for its employees:

1) a way to avoid paying tax when option holders exercise stock. The way to do this is typically by putting an 83b program in place so employees can early exercise their stock when it's fair market value is the same as their grant price. If an 83b doesn't exist, employees can only exercise when they vest and it is likely that the 409a value has increased and the employee would have to immediately pay tax on the ""paper gain"". This puts the employee in the situation where they have to pay taxes and they actually can't sell the stock to help pay the taxes.

2) a way to get the clock started on the holding period required to pay the capital gains tax rate instead of the ordinary income rate when a liquidity event happens. This can amount to a large savings (i.e. 30%-50%) which is real money. This is also typically done via an 83b program. And...this is INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR MULTIPLE YEARS, An 83b program is one of the ways to enable employees to get the clock started on the 5 year holding period required for QSBS exemption which can mean that NO CAPITAL GAINS taxes are paid. This can be a HUGE savings for employees when there is an IPO or acquisition.

3) the ability to sell vested shares when the employee has a financial need. With many startup staying private for 10 years before a liquidity event...it is likely that employees will have financial needs during that period - everything from wanting to put a down payment on a house to paying for kids' schools, a wedding, or elder care. When a company is still private, the way they can enable employees to meet their financial needs is to not place ""transfer restrictions"" on the stock. This allows employees to use sites like equityzen and Sharespost to sell their stock to a third party buyer. 

If you look on EquityZen's website...you'll see that many bay area tech company employees' are able to sell their shares on the secondary market."
476,Glassdoor,Left with mixed feelings,2017-04-06,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Glassdoor is a good place to work. They have their issues but the important thing is the senior leadership (CEO) is very open and willing to change the direction of the product/company if it comes to that. Robert's office is always open and you can ask him questions (anonymously, if you prefer) during company huddles.

- Nothing is set on stone - things could change. Glassdoor as a company improves upon their product tremendously. They run A/B tests and are willing to pivot their product direction if necessary. I believe that's very important for a growing company to succeed. 

- Coworkers. They are all amazing bunch of people. I have made some good friends while working there. 

-  Company offers tons of perks - gym with shower, lunch, snacks, $50 mobile phone bill credit, game room, free or close to free health insurance etc.

- Dog friendly.","- When I first joined Glassdoor it was the best company I ever worked for. The team was small and we were moving fast but without compromising in quality (i.e by shifting the deadline by a day or two if the product wasn't quite ready). As the company grew, stories became open ended and deadlines became almost impossible to shift which forced us to compromise in quality. There were at least three instances I could recall in the past year where we were given a hard deadline but without ironing out the details of the story or having final designs. In all three of those cases, we either didn't end up using that product or shifted the deadline so we could roll it out all together with rest of the teams.

- Most of us are underpaid. This became clear when we launched Know Your Worth Tool. A former colleague of mine who left Glassdoor had told me about the 30% salary increase he/she got at their new place. 

- My new manager was micromanaging the team. He/she always wanted to know what we were working on (even though he/she was there for the daily standup). My manager would listen in to our conversation with fellow colleagues and provide unsolicited opinion."
477,Glassdoor,"Everything I was told it would be, and then some",2017-04-04,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"They sold it to me as a pre-IPO startup with the opportunity to get in early, and that's exactly what it is. The growth potential here is tremendous, and everyone at the company really does care about you and your goals. Work-life balance, benefits and the office atmosphere are all the best I've ever experienced. Glassdoor has been, and will continue to, shake up a pretty well-established ""job board"" market.  The old models from indeed and monster are going away and Glassdoor will be the first to connect job seekers and companies based on a deeper, more emotional level than just matching skills. Being a part of the team and seeing the value that we are delivering to clients is fun and it's only just starting to catch on. Glassdoor has owned the user-generated content regarding employers for a long time, and once we solidify our spot as the one-stop-shop for job seekers to learn not just about companies, but also find new opportunities, the sky will be the limit and the old job boards will just be trying to catch up.","The only cons I can think of are typical of an organization that is growing like crazy and figuring out how best to monetize their products and audience.  Leadership gives clear direction for long term success, but sometimes the water gets a little muddy during the short term as we and there could be a little more transparency about some of the moves  that have been made.  I think that this is somewhat of a learning experience for everybody, so there are occasional hiccups. It's the small risk you have to accept when you join a relatively young organization."

I think that it could be a good place to work.  The benefits and perks were pretty good.,Management generally does not live up to good values and treat people fairly.  They have an image that they have created of helping to bring transparency to the workplace but that value is absolutely absent at Glassdoor.  I'm most upset by the fact that they pretend to be better than other workplaces and the reality doesn't live up to it.  So basically I hate hypocrisy and that is very present there.

481,Glassdoor,Glassdoor was transparent; now its opaque,2017-03-21,1.0,Account Executive,"Great perks like free lunch, coffee, snacks, dogs, and a very fun culture.","For a company I spent last 2 years of my career working for with passion and dedication, the exit process left something to be desired.  I worked as an Account Executive; when I fell below quota and voiced my concern, little to nothing was done to troubleshoot my performance.  Instead I was put on a “soft” activity plan (make x number of calls, meetings, etc.), but was not told my job on the line.  A month later, I was told that my last day at the company would be in 6 days. 

This appalled me as countless reps who have fallen below quota attainment have been put on a quarter-long plan to get them back on track.  This was the standard as I had come to know it.  

The company I knew for the past 2 years was gone.  It was a place where management had a pulse on the health of their team, making sure everyone was excited to be working there and more excited for the opportunities ahead.  Now it has warped itself into a culture that takes exclusive interest in performance metrics, star performers, and working its teams to the bone with very little concern for their wellbeing.

During my exit interview, HR informed me that performance plans at Glassdoor are not “policy” but a “best practice.”  They (HR) told me that managers at our company have full discretion to terminate an employee if they aren’t a fit for the role and a performance plan wouldn’t have the desired effect.  To say the least, this made me feel discriminated against, as I had seen this same situation (same people, same role, similar quota) treated in a different and abrupt fashion."

If I had been writing this review even just a few days ago, I would not have much to write in this section. However, due to recent announcements of the departure of senior Customer Success leadership I'm realizing that we have not been screaming into a void. Robert and others are listening to us and understand that our toxic and tyrannical senior leader needed to be replaced if we are to ever recover from a hard 2016. 

I have renewed faith in the organization and am confident that we will ""feel the wind at our backs"" once again (to quote Robert from an all-hands late last year). Full disclosure: I had a full schedule of interviews this week that I can now cancel with a smile on my face, as I am optimistic that with these organization changes and a key blocker removed from the equation, we can mature into an amazing company.","I could write a novel detailing the intimidation tactics that many of us endured from former department leadership, but with recent developments considered I have nothing to say other than that I'm excited to stay at Glassdoor!!"

485,Glassdoor,Other side of the coin..,2017-02-22,5.0,Sales Enablement Manager,"2016 was not an easy year for Glassdoor or for anyone laying the foundation for this company. Growing pains have the inevitable cause and effects and some of that has made its way to reviews on our own Glassdoor page; a good reminder that we are not immune to our own solution. Part of what makes Glassdoor so unique is that we WANT to be held accountable. Leadership stands behind the transparency and accountability that are the threads throughout our mission. I call that leading from the front. I appreciate how gracefully this organization has navigated challenging times. 

You should be aware of the good, the bad, the ugly of an organization before dedicating a large portion of your life to them. Glassdoor allows you to do this. Hopefully the reviews you have read thus far support your decision to start, stay, or move on from this organization, and that's a good thing! It means Glassdoor is living and breathing its own vision to help people find a job and company they (truly) love. 

For what it's worth to the reader, I would like to share a story from the flip side of the coin. 

Last week we celebrated the life of a former colleague. Her father spoke of his gratitude for the people who loved her well and supported her living the last years of her life with dignity and pride. Glassdoor was among those on the receiving end of his gratitude. This entire organization, from senior leadership on down, rallied behind this colleague in the most gracious ways and without question. I don't know about you, but to me, it's not where you are but who you're with that matters. These voluntary acts of kindness represent the incredible people inside these glass doors.","Like any company or human for that matter, Glassdoor is not perfect. All you can do is use these reviews to determine if it is perfect for YOU."
486,Glassdoor,Lacks Accountability to reach potential. On the brink of real success if they could bring in some real sales energy.,2017-02-14,2.0,Sales Manager,"Flexible work schedule, strong engineering team, intelligent people. Has the makings to be a great company.","Runs like a small company that has inexperienced sales leadership. No strategic sales leaders.  They can't bring in the industry level leadership needed because they are not willing to pay the salary of what that would cost.  CEO gives visionary speeches of the product, but does not hold his leaders accountable.  Somehow, there has been no sales leadership change when they have drastically underperformed with no plans of how they will change that.  Much of this comes from the fact that majority of them do not have the experience to lead a sales organization.  In my time there, I do not recall I time where I saw a leader inspire and LEAD.  Having a great product doesn't pay off if you don't have the people that know how to sell it.  How can you expect these leaders to succeed when the company is much larger if they can't succeed now?"
487,Glassdoor,Couldn't Ask For A Better Fit,2017-02-13,4.0,Senior Account Manager,"You’ll see this in every review that you read, but the people are what make Glassdoor such a special place. From the moment I set foot through these doors, I was welcomed with open arms. From my manager, whom I would literally follow into a burning building, to my teammates, who are more like my siblings than coworkers. Not to mention all of our amazing teams outside of sales who are often the unsung heroes. Everyone wants to lend a helping hand to get you where you need to be personally and professionally. 

As I mentioned before, my direct manager is a big part of the reason why I am so happy here. Without him I know I would not be where I am today. And that’s true for our whole leadership team. They genuinely want me to be successful here and will do whatever they can to make that happen. 

The last thing I’ll say is that working on the other side of the bridge is pretty great too. When things get a little overwhelming, being able to go outside and walk it out on the bike path overlooking the Bay and Mt. Tam, really help to reset and get back on track. 

Honestly, it’s hard to put into words, but most times it’s just awesome to be a part of this company.","I won’t lie: it’s hard, and some days are harder than others. There’s no getting around putting in the work here. That said, my biggest challenge is the amount of factors that are outside of our control and how that can impact one’s success: where a company is located, how many open jobs they might have compared to the year prior, content issues, a client’s performance, Customer Success, internal processes, etc. These are all challenges we face when trying to hit our quota and it can be very defeating and frustrating. It can sometimes feel like some people are better set up for success than others based on their book of business or their support team.

You’ll likely read some reviews that talk about how our company’s culture is gone. I wouldn’t say that it’s gone, it’s just different. I don’t think we ever lost that Glassdoor family feel, but when you go from personally seeing success over and over to suddenly not, sometimes sending out a few more emails, or leaving one more voicemail becomes more important than a dress up day or monthly award ceremony. Participation is lacking but only because there is a lot of “catch up” to hit numbers. It isn’t just one person who makes a company’s culture, but rather the collective whole, and this past year was rough on the collective whole. 

You’ll also read some reviews about compensation. Living in the most expensive city is not easy. And yes, I would like to get paid more so that maybe one day I can buy a house and maybe even start a family. For now, the office environment and the people are what make the discrepancy in comp bearable, but I do worry that at some point the allure of all that will not shine as bright as it does now."
488,Glassdoor,Great Experience at Glassdoor,2017-02-12,5.0,Senior Account Manager,"It’s the friends that we work with that make Glassdoor great.  In full transparency, it’s been a challenging year, but I stuck it out because of the people here.  It’s hard to leave a company when you love working for your manager and there’s awesome chemistry with your team.  My manager’s ability to coach us to the top and keep everyone happy to be at Glassdoor was the highlight of my year.  Our Director was very hands on as well and never hesitated to hit to road while providing tremendous feedback to develop our skills.  We’ve got great people here at Glassdoor!","There’s been lots of growing pain this past year and it greatly impacted the culture of our Sales and CS Department.  Morale was at its lowest this past year since my time at Glassdoor.  Good news is that our Leadership Team listened to our feedback and is improving the situation.  I’m happy to say that it’s starting to feel like the good old days and we’re getting back on the right track.

If anything it's the constant juggling of many company initiatives while producing a high quality work product. With so much great work to get done, it can be difficult to say no to things and consistently maintain a great work product. Not for everyone and takes self-starters, efficient work management and people that embrace a feedback rich culture."
491,Glassdoor,Proud to work here,2017-02-08,5.0,Data Science,"Glassdoor is the best place I’ve worked at, and I’m honored to work for a product that seems universally loved, by friends or strangers on the street.

We mean it when we say integrity is a core value. For example, we have one consistent standard to how we approve or reject reviews, regardless of whether an employer is a client or not. Internally, through EQ training and leadership culture, we emphasize open communication and feedback.

There are many smart people in the tech industry, but the people here are also generally the most caring co-workers I’ve had, and I think it’s related to our product and mission. Also, I love working with the data science team, and hope that we will remain friends beyond our time at Glassdoor.

I’m a big fan of the CEO’s decision to focus more this year, and I’m optimistic about the strategy. I also like the recent attention to listening to and understanding our users. In the past it had felt like users were mainly traffic numbers.

Work-life balance is respected. We have options for work from home and flexible hours. Some people work nights and weekends, but often this is self-driven.

We still have much upside to incorporating data science into more of our product, especially since we have so much data to work with.","There have been several re-orgs in the Data Science & Analytics teams - the most recent one splits us into Decision Science and Machine Learning groups. Re-orgs are probably common for a growing company our small size, but it takes some adjustment, e.g. how our career paths here change with them.

Though he will still work with us, the VP of Data Science is leaving data science to lead product and strategy here. This is a big win for the company, but a loss for our team. He has been a big force in mentoring and inspiration, working closely with us from whiteboarding ideas and formulas to providing feedback on even our detailed work.

Some departments are more title inflated and heirarchical, and information can be lost in communication across layers or across teams, causing people working on the ground to hear about them late and feel like they have little say.

We are in the early stages of using big data processing technology in data science, and still figuring this out."

My Colleagues: I love the people I work with! Glassdoor recruits and keeps some of the brightest, most creative, friendly, funny, welcoming people I have ever met. My teammates encourage me to be genuine and real and provide the personal and professional support I was looking for in a team. My efforts and my personality have been acknowledged and appreciated here.

My Manager: My manager is incredible. He is remarkably talented at coaching individual members as well as coaching to the team which has made us all tight knit and one another's biggest fans. Personally, he has taught me a process, pushed me outside my comfort zone, and cultivated a confidence in me that I am so grateful for. He truly is a role model and a dear friend. Our entire team sees his tireless dedication to our team, to the company, and, most importantly, his family. He is all around a stellar human that we are lucky to know and work with. 

Our Leaders: Leadership listens! I wrote a review about 6 months ago that was quite critical about where we were as a sales org. This included a critique of new processes that had been implemented that seemed to be slowing us down, as well as the tough quota targets. As a side note, that review was still 4 stars because I love Glassdoor. Anyways, since then, our middle management, VPs, and Exec Team responded to the reviews on Glassdoor, addressed concerns in town halls, implemented a new internal feedback loop (Glint), and, over time, solved for our biggest problems by reducing quotas and giving the sales team the opportunity to earn back lost dollars due to poor initial plan.  

At the first half of 2016, Glassdoor had dropped the ball but I am happy to say that they have picked it up and are running hard toward the goal line. I love this company and am so proud to be part of a an org that REALLY LISTENS and WANTS TO DO RIGHT by it's employees.","Our biggest strength is our biggest weakness: we are a start up. Start up means that sometimes things are humming and jiving and other times things are broken and disorganized. 

Career Development and Training could be improved. Processes are a work in progress. We have been iterating for a few years so innovation to product and positioning is welcome. 

Although there are things to be improved, if I've learned anything in the 10 years I've been in the workforce and the 3 years I've been at Glassdoor, it's that things are not always perfect. I've also learned that really great companies and wonderful leaders seek to learn from those not so perfect times to make the organization better moving forward. Glassdoor and our CEO does that."

Pre-ipo, so they offer stock options to top up the low salaries.","The company is growing so fast that there are a bunch of managers who are obviously inexperienced, incompetent and untrained.  Upper management hires people like crazy, works them hard, then treats them like crap.  They are so intent on improving the bottom line they keep screwing things up then laying people off to act like they're being fiscally responsible.  The incompetence of some of the key managers (even in the executive suite) is truly scary!"

495,Glassdoor,Great Place to Help Write Your Own Destiny,2017-01-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Glassdoor has been awesome for me in my time here. The firm takes note of issues and acts quickly to resolve them. 2016 was the first time the company experienced a slowdown in growth (although still growing rapidly) and seeing the response to this slowdown from senior leadership was incredible to witness.

Robert, Brad and Kate are all studs and it is exciting to work for the vision they (and I) share.","Operational processes are not good. A fast growing company will always experience issues like this, and senior leadership has hired extremely smart and credentialed people to help resolve these challenges. However, until improved, it is still a challenge. (not a dealbreaker by any stretch of the imagination)."
496,Glassdoor,The highest highs and the lowest lows,2017-01-20,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Glassdoor made a lasting impact on my career, and set the bar really high for anywhere else I go now. 
The pros of working at Glassdoor start with the people who make up the company. I made some of my best friends here and became a part of the big family. Sounds cliche but we were bonded under a strong vision and belief in bettering peoples lives through transparency. 
Robert was and still is an amazingly inspirational leader. It's hard to find that type of leader and it's certainly not at any old start up out here in the Bay. I feel lucky to have followed Robert for close to three years during our high growth phase.
Autonomy and a value on work-life balance. We really walked the walk at GD with regards to letting people work how they wanted to just as long as they were getting their job done. I valued the unlimited PTO policy when we still had it.
A brand and belief that is fundamentally changing the way companies treat and engage with their employees. It's really cool to feel a part of something bigger, and in my own small way as an SDR and then an AE I got to contribute to helping spread our mission and change the HR landscape. This isn't something you come across at every company. And it's a big deal and a reason GD enjoys such loyal employees who ""bleed green"" and run through brick walls for their company.","I've struggled with writing this review for 6 months now. I wanted my feedback to be balanced and when I left I had felt a lot of anger that has now subsided. I've been through quite a bit during my almost 3 yrs with Glassdoor and have seen the company change from a crazy fast growth start up to a bigger, more corporate machine.
Some cons that eventually added up to me departing (and it wasn't an easy choice):
1) Not being set up for success in sales. I had a particularly rough go of it with a particularly bad territory but managed to hold on until we flattened it (that helped a lot and all the reps who had territories outside of the Bay Area or NYC started hitting quota). I want to make clear that flattening the territories isn't something every company does and I have a ton of admiration for Robert and our sales leadership at the time for their ownership and accountability in fixing the problem.  Unfortunately more problems persisted along side and afterwards.
2) Constant moving targets. Some of this is to be expected as we are in a fast growth company who in a lot of ways is ""still figuring it out."" The target as of now is hitting an AE2 quota for 1 year before  you can become an AE2. Then, you aren't given any actually better accounts or tools to hit your higher quota. What resulted was a bunch of burnt out AEs who get to AE2 and then falter. The AEs who were able to only sit as an AE2 for one quarter were able to mitigate this effect (commonly referred to by all AEs) known as the ""AE2 curse."" Might be due to point #3. 
3) Crazy rampant politics amongst middle management. Unfortunately there's a couple offenders who treat some of their reps worse than others simply because they didn't suck up to them as much as they would like. We haven't been operating as a meritocracy like we claim to be. It's created a very toxic culture and bred resentment amongst the reps who weren't ""favorites."" 
4) Managers are ineffective. This was the final straw for me. I stayed through everything listed above because I had a manager that genuinely cared about my success and happiness. Once I was placed under a new manager it wore down my self-esteem, self-worth, and made my one-on-ones a constant chess match of who could ""win"" the argument. I no longer had anyone in my corner, in fact, after constant threats and snarky remarks it felt like I had an enemy."

Great mission that used to be easy to get behind, however, as of late, it feels phony being that what is preached is clearly not being practiced.","Sales is a legitimate nightmare. Glassdoor's own ""Know Your Worth"" tool confirmed that we were grossly underpaid (awkward). People have been promoted into leadership that do not possess the soft skills necessary to empathize with or motivate those that report to them. Things are such a mess on the Customer Success / Account Management side that New Business Account Executives are hesitant to sell the dream being that claw backs have become quite frequent. In addition, the politics are endless.

I love our dog friendly office. It's so fun! We're also right beside the ocean which is just beautiful. One of my favorite parts about Glassdoor is our employer's emphasis on employee wellness and work life balance. Unlimited PTO allows me to take sick days without stress and the freedom to work my own hours lets me schedule my day how I like it. We also have a personal trainer on-site 3 days a week. I'm obsessed with her class. But my favorite part about working for Glassdoor is I enjoy showing up to work every day. Although I have the option to work from home some days if I like (I have a long commute), I love coming to the office because my co-workers are my friends. We also have standing desks: major plus. I love you Glassdoor!","I make below market pay, but for me, a job is SO MUCH MORE THAN SALARY. I love my job which is worth more than any amount of money.

502,Glassdoor,Customer Success: Change and Impact,2017-01-04,3.0,"Director, Customer Success","I worked at Glassdoor for well over three years. During that time, I was fortunate to be a part of incredible growth. Being part of that growth, especially in a leadership capacity...was challenging but rewarding. I hired some wonderful people, collaborated with them, watched many of them grow and flourish...had a lot of fun, and learned a ton along the way.

There are a lot of wonderful things about Glassdoor. I moved across the country in 2013 to take the position I did, and that type of a move isn't something I took lightly. I did it because I believed in the mission, and wanted to make an impact with an organization that expressed the need to grow the Customer Success division. At my core, I'm more passionate about the customer than the average person, and I knew Glassdoor was creating something that felt different and they expressed the need to bring in someone like myself with industry experience. I couldn't have been more excited to start. I was provided with an opportunity to help product development, scale multiple divisions all while managing and supporting the Glassdoor Customer. Over 3.5 years in my role, and in leadership, we grew the team from 4 to 55 and had almost no employee attrition. We were able to do this because of the culture we created. Even with flat budgets, under-market compensation and lofty goals of 10-15% retention increases, this was never easy but we were united in the mission and hit our goals.","Even with this success, it was always challenging to work at a company that doesn't provide professional development. I had no leader/mentor focusing on my individual abilities, recognizing strengths (properly rewarding them) and most importantly, helping me improve and my professional flaws. I was hungry for someone to teach me more of what I needed to know to take myself, the organization we built, and the customers I so cherished to the next level.  

It became clear Glassdoor and I had different ideas for my future. I was ready to help continue growing the company, where our CEO preferred to hire from the outside. Admittedly, it was painful given all I'd been a part of. Rather than use my industry knowledge of nearly 10 years and more than 3 within the organization to help continue growing what we had built, I was asked to focus and build out a new division that wasn't part of my skillset, wasn't what I was hired to do and certainly not what I moved across the country and worked so hard for. It was clear this was the beginning of the end. 

Since the new leader was been hired, the CS culture has changed dramatically. Maybe that was the intent? If so, it has worked. The new leadership's actions, behaviors and words are contrary to the spirit of teamwork, and the culture that Glassdoor was founded on. Chastising/scolding individuals in meetings when asked about how changes impact others, and have people coming to me crying on a daily basis at how unhappy they are - I knew it was time. Knowing that our CEO was allowing this to happen and turning a blind eye because it's not an area he knows well, it just takes a toll on you, no matter how much faith you once had in the organization. I left a company and a team I loved because I no longer could sit by watching the team and culture we built change so dramatically. It wasn't something I was on board for and several others since I've left have felt the same. Attrition has gone from nearly nothing to incredibly high (for Glassdoor, and specifically for the past history of the CS team). But like many of the reviews here, maybe attrition is the goal. To turn over the old and bring in the new. And if so, it is working incredibly well."
503,Glassdoor,Just because you can doesn't mean you should..,2016-12-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Love the people I work with, everyone on my team works really well together! I am excited to see where the company is headed.","There is a common english saying ""Just because you can doesn't mean you should""  meaning there are some things that you should not do even if you are able to do them. Just because you are knowledgable in the Glassdoor products and processes does not mean you should be a manager or leader. I will never doubt the manager that I have in their knowledge about Glassdoor, but as a leader they have very few leadership skills. Where are the surveys? quarterly, yearly reviews to give feedback on management? I have to submit self reviews, but you would think that getting feedback from a team about their leader would be imperative. 

I get nervous to do anything that is not how my manager thinks for fear of retaliation. I have had leaders in past jobs that I have learned so much from. I have adapted skill sets, learned about the company how I could move up in them, put together strategic plans to get to where I wanted to be, collaborated etc. I feel like the ""black sheep"" of my team. I am not sure if its because I speak out, but I am definitely targeted or spoken to in a way that my other teammates are not. I definitely don't feel supported in my role. 

It takes days to get a reply to an email and half the time you don't even know where your manager is to ask a question.

Training? Wiki? Useless tools. The wiki is so unorganized and there are so many things in it that haven't been updated in years. It really grinds my gears when I ask a question and the reply I get is ""Did you check the wiki?"" Yes I have.  I am coming to you for help because you are my leader and you are knowledgable but if you cant take the time to help me then why are you in management? I would love to get involved in adapting a better training program, I think its vital to an organization and I believe would lead a lot of people down a better path if they started with better tools and resources. Not only the tools and resources but how to use them in a more efficient way. 

You hired me for a reason and saw skill sets in me that would be a good asset to this organization and team, so when I come to your for help/ express my concerns that I may not be comprehending a task, I need a visual explanation on it or just need some more clarity, I shouldn't feel foolish for wanting to be more knowledgable in my role or for wanting to understand something better."
504,Glassdoor,STILL in love with Glassdoor,2016-12-13,5.0,Sales Director,"After 4.5 years at Glassdoor, I STILL think about how lucky I am to be part of such an amazing company. Why is it amazing? I am constantly reminded that I'm working towards our mission. We are helping people everywhere find the jobs and companies that they love. That means we're helping some negotiate their salaries - even the last $1 for an hour! That makes a huge difference in the lives of people. We are helping them master the interview process, and land their dream job. The reviews genuinely help people make a GOOD choices, and help companies make GOOD choices internally so they can always improve. I'm inspired by this everyday.

Other than the mission, I believe the leaders are so strong. Robert inspires me every time I hear him talk. He's also very approachable at every level of the company. I've seen a sales rep talk to him in the lunch room about changing a small feature on our website - the next day, the problem is solved!

I also think that our sales team and leaders are steeped in GRIT, and that is inspiring. I think that their are always going to be ups and downs in start-ups, change is the only constant, it will always be a roller coaster. But I am happy to be on this roller coaster with such fun and hardworking colleagues. I am always inspired by people who punch above their weight class and take on tasks far outside of their job description to help improve the company. 

From a woman's perspective; I've had two babies while being employed by Glassdoor, and I am so thankful by how supportive Glassdoor was for both. I was welcomed back to work after 12 weeks of fully paid maternity leave, and I was excited to be back. It's also nice to know that they really try to hire a lot of strong female leaders across the org.","I don't think any company can say that they are perfect, and we have all made our fair share of mistakes. I think Glassdoor tries to learn quickly from their mistakes and pivot or change as needed.

We have hired so many smart and gung-ho people in the last year that it has been hard to get everyone up to speed quickly which I would say has caused some ""growing pains"". But I think we are now set up well to scale. 

I also think we could do a better job of creating career paths within certain roles across the org to ensure that we are striving to improve ourselves, and hang on to our best people. For example, creating salary bands, bumps, etc - especially for sales."
505,Glassdoor,Ready to Refocus,2016-12-06,3.0,Sales,"-My passionate, intelligent, and tenacious co-workers make every day not only bearable, but enjoyable. We’re able to laugh and support each other through the hard times while simultaneously celebrating our wins. Grateful for the long-lasting friendships that I’ve made and the camaraderie that is within GD culture.

-I’ve been lucky enough to experience ample support via my personal development and growth; the change and expansion that we’ve been through has provided me with invaluable business and life lessons that I’ll take with me throughout my career

-Robert frequently communicates with the org to ensure we’re all deeply emboldened by our mission and able to keep the long-term goals in mind. Recent feedback regarding unattainable quotas has been acknowledged and addressed with recent incentives to boost morale","-At the beginning of 2016, we embarked to become the number 1 jobs site in the world. What we didn’t prepare for was a complete restructure in our client services org and large pitfalls in our jobs product/performance that we still haven’t repaired. In turn, this has created significant hardships for the growth and CS team as they scramble to deliver recruitment ROI.

-Extreme lack of communication between SOPS, new biz, growth, and client services has led to the development of processes and procedures that pit varying departments against each other. Cancellable deals, growth’s lack of knowledge with jobs, new biz setting false client expectations, implementation attempting to build custom employer brands, CS receiving training for branding conversations that growth is already having are all long-term problems we are currently fixing with band-aids.

-Culture has shifted due to loss of key internal players that added energy and grit to the sales floor. Need to find new way to recognize those that not only perform via the numbers, but go above and beyond to add value to the culture and development of our teams and org as a whole. This will allow employees to grasp on to another purpose even when performance might be low. Due to recent internal changes, AE’s in MV are struggling to adjust to a new morale that is tainted by micromanagement and distrust, which is fostering an unproductive and anxious environment. AM’s needs are often overlooked or put off to prioritize bringing on new business and the lack of resources is impacting the ability to retain."

We've innovated to secure a unique spot in the world of recruiting and I think we'll be around for awhile.","As a sales professional at Glassdoor, these are the dark times...Quotas are wrong.  Very few reps across the board are hitting their numbers which is morally defeating. Combine that with the fact that our very own Know Your Worth tool is letting us know how underpaid we really are, it doesn't feel great. There's been plenty of attrition over the past few months and I suspect more if nothing changes.

Perks:
-Unlimited PTO (if you qualify)
-Free yoga during lunch is great
-On-site gym
-Lunch
-Sweets, treats and soda
-Couches
-Nice people
-Dogs if you like them (I tend to find them distracting)
-Growing company","While everyone is nice, no one has time to help you. We're always being told ""X team doesn't have bandwidth"" and whole programs/projects suffer because of it. Earlier this month we were told to eliminate projects that include other teams because they probably won't get done. The Product and Marketing teams are always overwhelmed with increasing demands for product features and new leads.

There are a few people in every department that have changed. They went from nice and friendly to short and demanding. I suspect it's because their managers/directors are pushing higher numbers down their throats while offering no new tools to meet the demands. The pressure is building and people looking to leave. The marketing department has lost a few and in sales we're losing even more.

Demands and goals continue to increase but we're still stuck with the same product to sell/market. There have been a few improvements, but these are small features that can't justify the high increases in cost, regardless of what the pricing survey says. We're pushing our jobs platform, but it still doesn't deliver. 

I see people from the Marketing team go above and beyond to answer emails or take on tasks that are clearly not what they were hired to do. I understand we're a start-up, but at a certain point employees need clear career advancement and to specialize in certain skills. It's much better to do one thing right than be spread so thin you end up half-assing multiple projects. No one asks you if you're actually happy with what you're working on. There is no communication between Engineering, Product, Sales and CS.

The website needs major work and our customers need help. Customers consistently call in with issues with their profile and CS cleans up our semi-working jobs+features mess. The CS and Growth teams have written reviews explaining this already.

Since I started, Glassdoor has changed. Walk through any of the departments and you'll see it, people are stressed. Our growth is starting to slow down and management is having a conniption. Management recognized that there were mistakes made last quarter but in the same breath demanded we still meet the same goals. That was very disheartening. There is pressure on everyone to pull rabbits out of a hat.

Although the feedback might be harsh, I believe we will pull through. We're a strong and scrappy and we're much tougher than to let a few growing pains shut us down. We still bleed GD Green!"

Customer Success members are held accountable to customers, prospects and the salespeople who manage those accounts. When changes in website profile usability are made (from the front-end and back-end) the changes are almost never communicated with us.

I'm also always amazed how others don't understand how truly awesome that is. Company culture is friendly and quite transparent. Amazing location that includes walking meetings on a trail by the water. A lot of opportunities to maintain work/life balance and improve yourself: fitness opportunities (yoga, crossfit, gym), speaker series, internal EQ training.","Start-up to larger company growing pains that are not uncommon: some veteran employees that are stuck in old ways or not up to increased standard of experience or quality work that new employees have. (Not to say there aren't a ton of amazing old employees too!) Broken processes, not enough heads in key areas (engineering and ops - wow the slow turnaround and backup is crazy), segmented departments or strange reporting organization/hierarchies that need restructuring. But none of this is uncommon at companies at this stage. Glassdoor, and our department, suffers at times from a very junior workforce that is not appreciative of what's before them. Lower morale seen in some recent reviews may be due to changes or restructuring that feels unfair, but part of me feels like you can't get better than Glassdoor in terms of a management team that's trying. Compensation for some positions feels a little low. Meetings, to our own fault really, are out of control. Booked over lunch usually. Maybe there's just too much to do. I suggest implementing an informal ""No Meeting Fridays"" company-wide. Many feel they get the most work done on these types of days."

The physical plant, our people processes and our management are stretching to deal with the growth.  Sometimes things don't go as planned.

- Perks (free breakfast, lunch, and sometimes dinner, Budget for team building events like Giants Games or Glassdoor Olympics, nice onsite gym and free fitness classes before, during, and after work, 4 beers and kambucha on tap, and kayaks/bikes available to check out, communiter benefits, fantastic 100% contribution to healthcare, decent bonus structure)
- Though Leader in employer branding and reducing the gender pay gap
- Lots of focus on employee health, physically and mentally
- Great to feel absense of ownership in the organization and a critical driver to its success","Glassdoor does have some downsides:
- It might have a few years under its belt, but it operates very much like a start-up. The downside to that is that it lacks a lot of processes that other organizations of the same size have in place. It is a positive thing, though, if you want to have input in building processes for your team. 
- Some legacy decisions solved for more short term solutions than for long term ones, resulting in some additional re-work now so we can better scale for the future
- Internal politics are at every company, and Glassdoor is no different. No worse than your average company, but I had hoped a company this young would have less of that
- Run lead with large ambitions. I have never worked longer than my standard hours in my 10+ years of experience. I feel so many of us have such high objectives with less than necessary resources that so many of us are working 10+ hour workdays. 
- Hesitation to change previous decisions even if necessary to keep up with the times."

522,Glassdoor,Growing up can be painful but it's for the best,2016-09-12,5.0,,"Career opportunities: the company is at a really interesting point where we're still growing quickly but are building more structure and process behind our teams. That creates huge opportunities so long as you perform up to, or above, expectations.

Team: the talent varies based on the team, but I'm excited to be working with a group of rockstars, and think the talent level in general is pretty impressive. 

Management: so good, so approachable, so honest, so transparent. I've never worked at a place where execs for the most part are willing to listen to the team, admit their mistakes, and be completely honest about why they're making the decisions they are. 

Benefits: fully paid medical premiums? check. Fantastic lunch every day? double check. Getting to work on the water in sunny Marin? yeah I'll take that too

Work/life balance: this can cut both ways, as some people take advantage of it, but this is a place where you can have a life outside of work. Varies by team, but for the most part the office clears out at a reasonable hour and I assume that it's empty on the weekends since I've never been in the office to take count.","Growing pains: We're trying to grow up as a company. That can be painful. Not everyone is going to be thrilled with the decisions management has made, and some of the harder ones probably weren't communicated as well as they could have been.

Moving quickly: For being the size that we are, decision-making can be really startup-ey. We aren't a tiny startup any more, and need to realize that things are going to move a bit more slowly than they used to. Otherwise things will break.

The people at Glassdoor make working so much fun. Glassdoor becomes family. Some of my best friends are the people I work with on a daily basis. I care about the people I work with and I feel cared for. It truly becomes a family here. We stress out together, we work hard together, we get through things together. You never feel like you are on your own trying to fight a battle, you're constantly fighting with a team of people behind you so you can win the war. It's an amazing feeling to have a company that cares so much about you. If you know the feeling, then you know what I'm talking about.","I would be lying if I said there's no struggles at Glassdoor. There are. We are going through a period where we no longer can move fast and break things (which used to be the mentality). We do move fast and things do break, but at a much slower pace. We have added processes that make things harder to get tasks completed. Things change with sometimes a lack of communication. Things sometimes break unexpectedly. Product may add something that you're confused about or wonder why they did that before the other thing. However, this is a sign we are growing as a company. It's a time of learning.

Overall, I think that Glassdoor is well positioned for longterm growth and success.","From a sales department perspective, there have been some serious struggles for the last several months (quarters?).  I think long term, these challenges will be resolved, but the short term pain is pretty acute and means that I'll fall well short of my on-target earnings.

In the end, we're changing the way people make decisions about where they are going to spend over 40 hours of their life every week. Choosing a job is probably one of the biggest decisions you will make and we are helping people everywhere feel 100% confident about that decision.

I love coming to work every day and I no longer get the ""sunday scaries"" like I used to. Everyone is so down to earth, no one takes themselves seriously, and that came through in training on the first day. That kind of attitude, especially in a sales role, helps me to not get too worked up when things get crazy. 

I took a big pay cut for this role and it was worth every dollar I lost. I love this job and I hope to stay and grow with Glassdoor for many years to come.",We are having a lot of growing pains and that is scary.

We can start off with the culture...unbelievably positive! When I started I was new to the industry, the role, and, truthfully, had no idea what I was doing! Whether it is my manager, desk neighbor, or anyone in the entire org, EVERYONE is SO open to helping you! This company really goes above and beyond to make sure their employees work hard, and get rewarded for their efforts. The commission structure is great, salary is good, and the benefits are absolutely amazing.

One of the components I love is the ability to work from home. While I do not take advantage of this because I love coming into the office to work, I was sick for three days of a week and my manager encouraged me to stay home. I decided to work from home and even then she was checking in to make sure I was getting enough rest and not over doing it. Going off of this, the work/life balance is great!

530,Glassdoor,SDR Mill Valley- A Sinking Ship,2016-08-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The coworkers, dogs in the office, and free lunch are great. This used to be a great place to work a year ago and I believe that it has the potential to be that again.","1. Morale- What you are reading in previous reviews about poor morale on the sales floor is echoed by the SDR team. No one wants to be in the office due to the depressing atmosphere and it is shown by empty desks.

2. Management-  Managers are hardly ever in the office and offer very little support. They take long vacations and spend very little time with their teams. When they do spend time with their teams there is very little coaching.

3. Compensation- Comp is low compared to other SDR roles in the Bay Area. When this was pointed out in a previous review management defended the low pay as being close to the national average. Unfortunately rent and living expenses in San Francisco are nowhere near the national average and the sad truth is that most of the SDRs can barely afford to live on the pay even when they are hitting full quota. When I took this job it seemed like an okay income for a year but raises and promotions are hard to come in this role, you can make more doing the same thing elsewhere. 

4. Quota- Quota is high and it keeps going up. The team members who are hitting these quotas are working outside of work hours making it seem like this is obtainable and forcing others to do the same. Often there are factors outside of the SDR's control that affect ability to hit quota and SQLs are loosely defined and up to the individual rep discretion. Once you have a bad month it is very hard to make up for it and get back on track for promotion. 

5. Processes- It seems like every month new processes and regulations are rolled out and that upper management is trying to make their mark on the program by making unnecessary changes. The majority of these processes have been poorly executed, time consuming, and unnecessary. It just keeps getting harder to earn our measly income to (barely) pay the rent. 

6. Career Advancement- Unrealistic expectations were set for career advancement. My advice to people interested in joining the team- ONLY take this position if you are interested in joining the new business AE sales team. Any other position (including CSM, AM, marketing, PR, HR, etc) is basically unobtainable unless you are really lucky and stick around much longer."
531,Glassdoor,Best Job I've Ever Had!,2016-08-25,4.0,Associate Social Media Manager,"- You will work with some of the smartest, most genuine people ever at Glassdoor. People care, and it shows. Glassdoor is like a family, on the DemandGen team in particular. Everyone is friends and hangs out after work. We celebrate the wins (and handle the failures) together - you will never be alone here.
- Team happy hours are plentiful, the company takes time to celebrate with picnics, holiday parties and milestones. You’ll feel recognized and appreciated with all of the emails teams send around to each other praising each other, BAMF celebrations on the sales floor and how much people are genuinely looking out for each other.
- People here are scrappy. They will drop what they’re doing to help you out. Great people are hard to come by, but Glassdoor truly has a lot of them.
- Amazing benefits - Unlimited PTO (that people actually use), 100% covered health care, fully stocked kitchens and free lunch every day, dogs in the office, 401(k), etc.
- Our Mill Valley HQ is beautiful, right on the water, has tons of walking paths around the buildings and it’s so nice getting out of the city each day and driving over the bridge to come to work.
- We’re building something great, and you can feel that the people here truly believe in what we’re working towards and ultimately believe Glassdoor helps people find jobs and companies they love. It feels good coming to work every day knowing that you’re making an impact.
- Your career will skyrocket here. Young employees are given a lot of responsibility and held to high standards, but if you rise to the occasion, you are definitely rewarded and promoted. This is the best place to start your career, and I'm beyond grateful for the opportunities this company has given me in the past 2+ years.","- Work/life balance is a thing, for some people in some departments. But in others, you’re praised for working well into the night, being online on weekends or working on vacations. It’s not healthy, people are burning out, and we need managers to insist people have a work/life balance again. I’ve seen many people just on my immediate team have to take emergency vacations or days off because they’re so physically and emotionally stressed and drained, and it’s definitely concerning.
- Morale is low right now. Companies go through ebbs and flows, and this is definitely a hard time across the company in terms of turnover and morale. But, as long as people stay calm and believe in this company (and stick through it) I believe it can (and will) turn around.
- Lack of diversity."

533,Glassdoor,"The best place to work, even on a bad day",2016-08-21,5.0,Vice President of Marketing,"Glassdoor is the best place I've ever worked and somewhere I love to be everyday, regardless of the challenges. We are led by an amazing CEO and a top-notch leadership team full of real people who roll up their sleeves, work hard, and really care. It's challenging, it's fun, and it's rewarding.

The entire Glassdoor team is passionate, kind, humble, and smart. People generally remain optimistic and ""find a way"" in the face of any challenge. 

When a company is doubling or more year after year, there are a lot of challenges scaling the business. We are having many of these challenges, and we've made some pretty big mistakes this year, especially in the GTM organization.

Challenges and mistakes will happen at any growing company. It's how you handle these challenges and mistakes that matters. I think this leadership team is handling the pressure extremely well. I've seen many companies going through these types of pains disintegrate. They've become paralyzed, reactive, political. The exact opposite is happening right now. Leadership is coming together, working together, staying calm, and solving problems quickly. I've never been more proud or honored to be part of this team. 

The problems we are having right now are temporary, most of them are not systemic. Some of them are self-inflicted, others are due to late investments in critical areas, but they are on the path to being solved. 

I frankly think our challenges were bigger a couple of years ago. Our product efforts weren't scaling, we had virtually no operational expertise in the company, the company was very divided between consumer and B2B, and there were some key leaders in place that were not a culture fit and were making poor decisions. The leadership listened to the feedback then, and we have solved many of these issues in a very short period of time. Our product team now has great leadership, our business operations team is making a big impact, and we have the right leaders in place. Our CMO and other leaders have done a great job bringing both sides of the business together and working in harmony. 

I'd pick Glassdoor on its worst day over just about any company on its best day. Solving the challenges of a rapidly growing company is what gives meaning to the work. Solving them with great people is like nothing I've ever experienced.","It's inevitable that a company will make mistakes or under-invest in certain areas when growing at our pace. You can't throw money at everything at the same time. When working at a company that is growing this quickly, it does take patience as we have to make tradeoffs in our investments in order to be fiscally responsible (and we are that, which I truly appreciate).  We've had some bad luck in certain areas along the way too. We are now making the right investments business operations, product development, and user growth. In my opinion, key areas we now need to work on are: 

1. Modeling. We still need to improve in how we financially model and measure our business. I think we have a solid understanding of what drives growth. We need to ensure that all areas of the business are delivering on the inputs needed to realize the growth we want. Much of this is in the form of product deliverables, user growth, more operational and enablement support for sales, and excellent product performance that commands a higher price point. It's unrealistic to put expectations of large productivity and efficiency gains on the shoulders of our sales reps without other things materially changing to support that. They are working hard, and they are an amazing team who can get more productive with the right investments - but many of those investments have not been made. We also need to fuel our growth in a more balanced way where we are contributing to the growth from many different areas. We lack the basic visibility to understand the key levers in the model and where we are/aren't delivering. We're too big for that - we've just got to fix this.

2. Sales Operations/Sales Tech. We all know we are short-handed here and are hiring as fast as we can, but it's starting to have a real impact on the business. It's becoming painful and it's becoming a frustration and causing a morale problem because we want to move quickly and efficiently and we can't. Our operational structure was built when we were small, and has not scaled well with our growth. It's not just technology, it's also business processes. Breakages of both are occurring more and more frequently and are starting to have a real impact on the business. We've got to get serious about this and put the right structure in that can accommodate the current business and grow and scale over time. 

3. Investment in our Sales Team. We've grown this team to the point where it's not about just getting it done out of sheer will and scrappiness. We need to shift gears and realize that we have a large, global sales team and we are under-invested in many areas needed to support this team. Our leaders have such aggressive hiring to do that they don't get to spend enough time with their teams. They need help. They also do not have the reporting or playbooks they need at their fingertips to manage their businesses efficiently because no one has had time to build those things. And many business and sales processes have not been clearly defined. Finally, our sales enablement is very light for the amount of catchup that we have to do. We need more investment here. We have no way to know if the training is sticking - and in a lot of cases it is not. This is nothing against the sales enablement team - they just do not have the resources to get the job done properly and they do not have enough input from leadership as to what the proper sales/business processes should be in the first place. Sales reps, SDRs, and Sales Managers are overloaded with so much information and so many constant changes that many of them do not know how to effectively utilize our latest system and processes, which makes it difficult for them to succeed. We are leaving a lot of money on the table due to the lack of investment here."
534,Glassdoor,Light at the end of the tunnel . . .,2016-08-19,5.0,Account Management,"I've been with Glassdoor going on 3 years as a proud part of the Sales Org. Shortly after I started, Glassdoor became my second home. I was surrounded by some of the smartest people I had ever met. I was immediately challenged and pushed to what I thought at the time were my limits. I can honestly say that 3 years later this is all still true, and I have learned more about myself in the past 2 1/2 years than I ever have in my life - both personally and professionally.

The ""you can"" attitude that my managers have instilled in me is something I will be forever grateful for. This is not a general statement- l am talking about every single manager I have had here at Glassdoor. This ""you can"" attitude is now engrained in my bones and I feel like the possibilities and opportunities for me are endless.

While my leaders empower me, my colleague's inspire me. I COULD NOT have gotten to where I am today without my amazing teammates. The amount of collaboration seen on a daily basis is unparalleled. 

When you establish yourself, show you are here to work hard, and collaborate and innovate with your colleague's, you earn the respect and trust of management and with that, I feel far from micro-managed. I end up pushing myself harder knowing that it is MY responsibility to hit MY numbers, and falling short impacts what's on MY paycheck. But not only that, I push myself hard so I can win for the team, for the tier, for the org. This is the type of culture Glassdoor has built, and it still lives from what I see on a daily basis. Who said culture was fading in Mill Valley!? If you were on the sales floor today, you may have felt differently . . .","I reminisce about the ""good old days""  and of course, get nostalgic. We have grown tremendously and can't expect the people and the business as a whole to be functioning the same as it was when we have nearly doubled in size year over year. With change and growth comes frustrations and these frustrations have caused some turmoil personally and across the sales org, all of which have been mentioned in prior posts: CSM re-org has disrupted AM productivity, Quota's seem unattainable, morale is low . . . It hasn't been an easy few months to say the least. 

That said, I do indeed see a light at the end of the tunnel. Every issue mentioned in previous posts has been addressed by the proper leaders. The issues are already being tackled and some, even resolved."

536,Glassdoor,"Great opportunity in general, but it never felt like the right fit",2016-08-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"There was a lot of good that came out of working at GD. There was a strong culture that was clearly defined. Employees were treated extremely fairly, as you'd expect from a company that prides itself on transparency. 

I really liked the head of my department and my immediate manager. They each took the time to understand me as a person and shape the relationship to get the most out of me. Both of them were extremely good at what they did and enabled me to shape my path the way I wanted to. I got to work on a lot of great work and I will always think fondly of the actually core of what I did at GD. Because of my experience at GD, I've gained valuable tools that I will use for the rest of my career.","The whole time I worked at Glassdoor, it felt like I was in Pleasantville and things never felt exactly 'right'. The culture is strong and clearly defined, which is great if it aligns with you. The team is very so homogeneous, that I felt like I was on the outside looking in the whole time. The culture dominated by Tech/Sales Bros, Girls who like dogs/yoga, and lack of ethnic/cultural diversity really turned me off the whole time. The diversity is so poor that I couldn't help but feel like I stuck out like a sore thumb, which made it hard to last longer than I did at GD.

Theres a lot of disconnect between the motivations of the teams and I felt that it added friction to every interaction I had. Whether it be product, sales, engineering, marketing, PR, everyone had their disparate goals and it created mini conflicts all the time. I think in order for GD to thrive, the goals need to converge and teams need to compliment each other rather than fight for resources."

538,Glassdoor,ZA,2016-08-15,2.0,Manager,"Some repeats from other reviews here. A great office space right on the water’s edge, a quick reverse commute over the golden gate bridge, plenty of snacks, provided lunch, beer, etc. Essentially all the perks you’d expect from any startup/tech firm worth its salt. On the whole Glassdoor did a very good job on hiring the right people who added to a shared value system, worked hard (to reinforce it), and as a consequence, developed a cohesive culture. 2 out of my 3 managers were fantastic. The Scotch Club. Finally my teammates, truly good people who made it a pleasure to work at GD. I only hope I was able to do as much for you as you did for me. Thank you.","GD has been fortunate to scale rapidly over the past ~3 years and in most cases hired or promoted the right people to facilitate the next stage of growth (CFO, CHRO, GC, CRO, etc.). Missteps are inevitable in any organization and promoting one of the directors who I’ll give the fictitious name of ""Za"" is one such example. Za simply does not posses the hard and (surprisingly) soft skills/emotional quotient required for the position.

From a professional vantage this director lacks business sense, has demonstrated an ineptitude for sales in general, is void of the maturity and composure required to lead effectively, has advanced cronyism/favoritism, is unable to work effectively with cross-departmental leaders, and disregards the counsel of direct-report, managers who are more experienced and capable.

Decisions can’t be made solely on one’s qualitative perception of the business..that is grossly negligent. Especially, when you are responsible for the livelihoods of 50+ people and tens of millions of dollars. You need to be able to create, interpret, and apply data to your policies/decisions just as much if not more than your “feelings.” In many instances this director demonstrated an alarming inability to do so. One example is the promotion criteria created by this director, which eschews reps' merits for promotion (what proper performance looks like) in place of an regressive, out of touch, idealistic criteria. 

Involve your managers in the discussions that are going to impact and shape the tier. Don’t just hear them out because you think that is what is needed to temporarily appease them then put forth a unilateral policy. Rather apply their good ideas and fight for them. This is what other directors have done and as a consequence they have benefited from the collective brainpower of their managers...this is also business 101. By not doing this you make it seem as if you are hiding something, have a hidden agenda, or are threatened by ideas not of your own making. The most important outcome of this unilateral approach is the tier’s interests aren’t being properly lobbied for.

A cogent suggestion is to let your managers operate with independence instead of treating them as if this is their first job out of college. I’ve never experienced the level of of redundant micromanagement as I did while reporting to Za.

Denying promotions to the reps who closed the the two largest deals in tier's history because you don't like they deal types is extremely selfish. The reps fought hard for these wins and no matter the circumstances surrounding the deals’ pre or post closure you need to recognize and reward the wins."
539,Glassdoor,There are dogs. There are politics. There are free lunches.,2016-08-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,I work with some great people. Glassdoor offers a good number of perks that are great if you can step away from work and take advantage. I have had the opportunity to see a company grow and the good and bad you face through that growth. I have learned a lot about navigating the politics of the workplace which will benefit me in during the rest of my time here.,It's frustrating to try and make a difference when you are constantly cleaning up broken pieces. Great work doesn't seem to be a priority.  The word firedrill is a daily constant. The leadership at Glassdoor use to seem really great and I felt supported by it. Lately it feels as if every team is trying to prove why they are winning by pointing out how other departments are losing and politics are everywhere.
540,Glassdoor,"We're growing up, and I'm proud",2016-08-12,5.0,Director of Product Management,"When I started here a few years ago, we were a scrappy startup, flying by the seat of our pants, growing like crazy, and moving a million miles an hour. It was fun, but it was a mess. As someone who cares deeply about the success of this company, and about our mission, I'm really glad to see us being more measured, judicious, organized, and efficient.

Also, when I joined, the product vision was controlled by a clique of the ""OG"" leaders who had been with the company since the very early days. As we've grown up, we've hired more outsiders into product leadership roles, and developed more of a diversity of opinions. When this change started, people were scared. But it's clear that having more smart people collaborating is making us stronger and smarter and more creative.

I've never been more excited about the stuff I'm working on here than I am right now, and I've never been more optimistic about Glassdoor's future.","The transition to being a grown-up company has been trying at times. Even though we're changing for the better, change is always hard. And some people are unhappy about it (click the ""Ratings Trends"" link next to the star rating above -- looks pretty bad these days). The real turbulence is happening in the sales org and not product/engineering, so I can't really speak to it. On the tech side, we're humming. But churn/turnover, and a small, vocal group of unhappy sales people does take a real toll on everyone's morale."

That is when things started going downhill.  I was placed on a performance plan in January; however, the problem was that I was not informed this was a possibility after Q4 had wrapped.  Talk about being transparent.  Unlike other sales orgs, this ""plan"" was not designed to help me succeed.  In fact, it was the opposite.  AE quotas had not been determined.  So I was expected to hit a certain percentage of an undetermined goal.  Great.  And had less than 30 days to do so from the time I was placed on said plan.  Cool.  This was also my first time on plan.  Fantastic.  I fought to stay and asked for a fair shot at hitting quarterly quota, which still hadn't been determined at that time.  Adding to the sting: the deals I had up-sold (2-year deals vs. standard 1 year) were ignored.  Those deals would have prevented me from being on ""plan"" altogether.   After a lot of back and forth, a ""compromise"" was reached at the end of January that gave me until the end of February to hit quota, which was still unofficial and hand-written onto my plan contract.  I've been in sales for 5+ years.  Being on plan scares everyone.  But my biggest frustration was the lack of professionalism upper management showed. It was as if Glassdoor's focus on transparency no longer applied.  ""Don't tell anyone you're on this plan.""  
At that point, I laughed.  I could not understand how the same company, the company I loved to work for, could expect me to ""be ethical,"" ""do the right thing"" and ""help people find jobs and companies they love.  Are you kidding me? What a joke."
542,Glassdoor,Sad to see Glassdoor go downhill so quickly,2016-08-04,1.0,Account Executive SMB,"When I started at Glassdoor two years ago, there was an amazing company culture, especially amongst the sales org. I had a smart, strategic and motivating manager with a very tight knit team. I was motivated to come to work every day but also had the freedom to work from home, come in early, leave early and significant flexibility with my schedule. My manager trusted me to get the job done and with that, gave me significantly more confidence and motivation to perform for myself, my manager, my team and the sales org. I wasn't focused on quota, because with the support and confidence my team had in me, along with reasonable targets, hitting quota was challenging but realistic. When I would hit my quota or my team would hit our quota, we would always celebrate those wins. It was an awesome environment and I will forever cherish those days I had at Glassdoor. If I was writing this review one year ago, it would have been a 5 star review.","Essentially everything I mentioned in the Pros no longer exists on the sales floor at Glassdoor. My manager and director were promoted and I was assigned to a new team, manager and director. Very quickly, it was made clear by our director that the flexibility in our work schedule would no longer exist. We were not trusted to get the job done in a way that made sense for each individual, we immediately were given strict activity numbers to hit and an outline for what constitutes being put on a performance plan. This fostered an extremely stressful and cut throat environment that still exists today. While we have added essentially no new products since I've been with Glassdoor and hardly any increase in user traffic... Our quotas have doubled each year. Both years, leadership has come back to us and said that they ""messed up"" in calculating those quotas halfway through the year before making any kind of change to those numbers. While I believe my new manager was a great manager with good intentions, there are way too many reps assigned to one manager. With having to constantly report forecasts and because numbers were the main focus for executive leadership, all managers can really focus on is reporting leaving little time to build a team and individual bond with their employees. 

Needless to say, morale is extremely low. Quotas are way too high and salaries are way too low. People on your sales teams can only take so much. This has been going on for 7+ months. Leadership knows about it and has continued to drive extremely high quotas and activity metrics, constantly bringing in more sales bodies, cutting the books of business and limiting spend on small things like happy hours and team outings that build team comradarie and morale. The list goes on."
543,Glassdoor,CS team is in shambles,2016-08-03,2.0,Customer Success Manager,The people in the CS org are amazing. Really good people who you will love working with. Benefits are good too. The intention of Glassdoor is also good. What we do as a job as a CSM is also rewarding and fun. I love helping a client understand they value they are getting from our product. I know the value I bring to the table with my clients every single day. It's too bad that no one outside of CS realizes this value.,"I don't even know where to begin. There is so much that is wrong right now in CS. We have a fairly new VP who has come in and done her best to restructure, to make this team strategic, but there is only so much one person can do when the CEO doesn't see value in the team she was hired to lead. I'm not even sure he sees value in the overall CSM function (because he doesn't understand it), but I think he knows enough to know what we had before wasn't working which is why he hired her, but things have just gotten worse. I had hoped they would get better with an experienced executive in the mix. 

The perceived lack of value is something that stems from CEO to all other areas of the company, and impacts us because Sales sees us as nothing more than simple robots who should be running jobs campaigns perfectly. The reality is that we have too many clients to run all of the campaigns effectively, especially when things outside of running campaigns keep falling on our plates. They really pile things on the CS team.. it is all designed to take things off Sales's plate, but the crazy thing is that Account Managers continue to do the CSM job and don't to what it is they need to do, which is dig into accounts and expand relationships and dollars.

Sales leadership sees us as little more than glorified admins - thus sales treats us as such, and we feel demoralized and totally undervalued. Our AM counterparts push the admin stuff of the job onto us, but won't let go of the strategic stuff that we're now supposed to be doing. They aren't hitting their quotas (as you can see in all of these other reviews) but if the Account Managers would stop doing CSM work and focus on selling and expanding their existing client base, they might actually do that. But Sales Leadership doesn't trust the CSM team to be strategic and handle the day to day for the accounts, and the sales reps certainly don't. 

The best example I can give is the Sales Alerts that go out. These are the most demeaning thing to me and the rest of the CSM team. We are barely mentioned other than to indicate who the CSM on the account is .. and it's not always that we deserve a mention, but even when we did something, it's barely recognized when the manager sends it out. Even worse, when others reply all to this email, it's always ""great job Account Manager"", never, ""good job TEAM"", or anything to mention that the AM couldn't have done it with out the CSM. Something that is supposed to be a celebration of success - OUR success as a team - ends up demoralizing and showing me that I am not valued over and over and over again. It's insulting and I don't even look at the alerts anymore because I don't want to feel like that anymore. 

Because of this lack of perceived value, we are all underpaid. This is a Glassdoor theme though, as we aren't known for paying top dollar. The equity is supposed to balance that, but no one on the CS team has enough equity to mean anything. Again, we aren't valued. We are supposed to be taking more and more things off of Sale's plate so that they can achieve their sales goals - but we aren't compensated for this. We have quotas, but the amount of money we are paid in comparison to the AM team is borderline insulting. CS at Glassdoor is thought of as a cost center, not as a function that both saves & brings in revenue, and this is felt by our team daily. 

People in the CS org are leaving left and right, people who have been through all of it and people who have built it. They're gone. Morale is so low right now and I don't like coming to work anymore. I am not alone. What keeps me coming back is the company mission and the people I work with, those that I'm in the trenches with, I want to see it work with them. I want this to turn around at Glassdoor."
544,Glassdoor,Is it too late?,2016-08-02,2.0,Sales,"A lot of us came to Glassdoor because it provided a unique opportunity to be part of a growing company that would allow us to progress our career while being a part of a culture and mission that you couldn’t find elsewhere. Equity, free lunch/snacks, gym/wellness programs, dental/medical benefits, vacation policy when it included unlimited PTO, beer on tap, dogs in the office, office on the water & company events.

What has kept me at Glassdoor for several years are the people and the culture that we’ve built. I have made amazing friendships and am lucky to be surrounded by smart, driven people who are invested in the growth and believe in the mission of Glassdoor. Sandler/Jim Mitchell training we received last year showed me that Glassdoor was invested in the personal and professional growth of the sales team.","This last year at Glassdoor has changed drastically, we understand that with change comes growing pains. However, as we’ve done in the past, when will we course correct? We constantly hear from our leaders that they ‘hear us’ yet nothing has altered and unfortunately it’s too late. It feels as though it is more than just the sales team where morale is down based off of conversations with other departments. As mentioned in the previous reviews, the culture and morale is shot and a lot of us just feel like a number and underappreciated. It is nowhere near what it used to be.  Leadership changes in 2016 as well as a lack of communication and transparency has adversely affected the sales organization. Not only are we paid far less than any other startup in the Bay Area, quotas are so high, reps are in fear of being put on a plan. When roughly 10% of the team is hitting quota, which includes ramping reps, it takes a huge toll on morale and our personal and professional happiness. We all believe in Glassdoor and the culture has kept us here, but at some point if we aren’t making money and leadership continues to ‘hear us’ but makes zero change, what’s the point of caring anymore?  Reps across the tiers are looking & taking other jobs as we know we are valuable assets at any other organization. In addition, there is little room for growth at HQ and puzzling staff cuts that are never addressed create an optic of uncertainty."
545,Glassdoor,Finance,2016-07-30,5.0,,"Very collaborative work environment, management know how to stick to their agendas and addressing critical issues. A lot of great perks to working here and our staff keeps growing!","The company is going through growing pains and a lot happens fast. At times can be overwhelming, and a lot of our work can be manual. We're trying to implement more automated processes to accommodate the growth and workload"
546,Glassdoor,Worried About the Current Morale & Future Plans for Customer Success Team,2016-07-30,3.0,Customer Success Team Member,"The biggest pro of working at Glassdoor is the intention and purpose behind the product. Our mission is more than helping people find jobs they love, it's about helping employers identify their strengths and weaknesses and how they can succeed as a company in driving new talent and keeping their employees happy. 

When CEM'S/CSM's get on a call with customers and are able to un-surface insights that employers never realized before and are able to strategize on ways to improve their ratings and engage their employee base-that is a WIN and that is what drives majority of the team and reminds them why this role is important and needed. 

Glassdoor as a product isn't the most intuitive so customers need a CSM/CEM to act as their partner and consultant to help them make sure they are getting the most value and ROI. To the surprise of sales and leadership (Robert, specifically), CEM/CSM's drive a lot of value for our customers...and it's not just a matter of pushing CPC's up and down like a robot. 

So when this team gets the chance to speak to customers, uncover insights, drive home value, and be positioned to make an impact-that is a pro and that's what will drive this team. 

Our new VP of customer success-she's trying her hardest, she's trying to drive home the strategic value of CEM'S/CSM's...maybe it's rubbing off the wrong way for some, but at least she is trying to open the company's eyes to our value as a team.","The con's: as of lately, there are many. And the pro I listed above is rarely happening because our CEO sees no value in the CS team and continually pigeon holes this team as CPC bid adjusters with little value to add. This view then trickles down to the sales leadership team who then also treats the CS team as their glorified secretaries and limits the team to make any strategic input with customers. 
But, here's the problem...the CSM/CEM team is over it, if you really think the value of this team is so marginal...then you hired the wrong people. The people on this team are smart, innovative, strategic, and dedicated to Glassdoor...and you give them no way to drive value. 

Robert-you have to read this review and understand that your lack of perceived value of this team has immense impact on morale. You can claim that yes of course you care and you value this team, but we know what happens in those QBR's and we know deep down you just want a team that obsesses over pace and if things aren't perfect and if budgets aren't being spent-that's the fault of the CS team. Did we ever consider that perhaps, Glassdoor growth in terms of traffic could be a factor? Or perhaps that our tool never works and is constantly running into bugs? Or that our search results surface job board and organic jobs above sponsored jobs? There's only so much that can be done as a CSM/CEM and if the goal is to hire bots to sit and adjust cpc's-then you should fire all these people....because they are too talented, too driven, too strategic, and too smart to sit in a company that doesn't value them.  

Morale is low. Super low. People are leaving left and right, and something will have to change to keep this team motivated. More and more tasks are being asked of CSM's and none of them are strategic or insightful...it's more busy work and reports that could be automated. 

The CS managers are not strong. All they do is acquiesce to the VP...and if you want to build a relationship with your team, then they need to know you're fighting for them on their behalf. Too many things are falling on our plates without any insight into the impact of the day to day. This team can't be successful if we don't enable the team to be successful. CS managers are spread too thin, they manage far too many CSM's and are unable to be help their team grow professionally. We should have more managers  who can really help drive value to certain client scenarios and be that advocate. And we should be hiring managers that really challenge and evaluate why we are doing certain things and un-surfacing potential issues (rather than right now, it's all just so reactive)

Performance reviews are such a joke. All we're told all year is ""great work, good job, nothing to report on here"". As a result, the team comes into their performance reviews expecting a raise or promotion and they get nothing. There is no real time feedback and CSM managers have nothing to add. You have to give insight into how to grow professionally and this should be feedback that is happening throughout the year!!! It appears that the only way to really grow on this team is to throw a hissy fit and threaten to quit...which has worked for some on this team, and not for others."
547,Glassdoor,What happened?,2016-07-29,2.0,Sales,"Co workers are the best! Some of the most amazing people I have ever worked with. Can't say enough great things about the people. 

Beautiful HQ office with good health benefits and free lunch. Nice to have dogs running around the office as well.","With so many changes and new upper management it has really put a bitter taste in the mouth of sales reps. Way under paid and unrealistic quotas. Glassdoor can be a hard sale because of content issues that reps have no control over. 

There are too many people on teams and it's not fair to managers. They are never around and to no fault of their own. They are asked to hire more and more as well as sit in endless meetings and do pipeline updates. Managers can't help reps to be strategic or help a rep to develop. 

New people that have been brought into upper management and jumped in without really knowing how our business worked. Feels like they really have no regards for people who came before them . Everyone feels like they are being pushed out in order to make more headcount for the new Chicago office where they can pay them less. 

They are getting very strict about WFH but with negative energy in the office and large egos reps don't want to come in. They just want to hit their number."

We have incredible ancillary benefits including fitness programs and free lunch","You have set us up in sales to fail. While you say that you hear us, you have done nothing to address this issue. Alternatively, you have positioned your middle managers to make us feel like we aren't doing our jobs up to your standards. 10% of the entire sales org hit their quarterly goal last quarter. Really???

The upper management  you've put in place are constantly in meetings (about what??), therefore out of sight. There is no acknowledgement that you set the bar to an unrealistic height. 

My personal confidence is down the toilet. And I'm basically poor on top of that. Please sell me on why I should stay?"

There are plenty of high visibility projects that are being worked on that you can be a major player in, and get immediate notice from the rest of the executive team.  If you prove yourself capable, you will likely be given the opportunity to lead future projects.

The CFO values input from his team, and schedules 1 on 1 meetings with each member of the Finance team to get their feedback and perspective on things.  And the rest of the Finance team leaders are also easily accessible if you need to work with them.

Coming from SF, it’s a great and quick reverse-traffic commute.  And it’s a bright, dog friendly, open office environment that I enjoy heading to each day.","Finance has been operating at a bare minimum team member level, so do not expect the same work-life balance that other teams in the company have.  Until some of the open positions are filled, expect to work a little extra to accomplish what needs to get done.

Finance dependencies from non-Finance teams are a recurring source of frustration, but is something that is currently being worked and improved upon."

He will always find time for you, which really says a lot. Don't think there's any leader that I'd want to fight for more then this guy here!

-My coworkers! So much talent at Glassdoor, great to have co workers that can teach you so much. On top of that, some of my best friends have come from this group. We enjoy each other in and outside of work, and everyone seems to have a great head on their shoulders.

Why?
- Nobody hits quota. Our targets are unattainable. Our books of business are saturated, and we're loosing more accounts by the day due to all the hiring happening in Chicago. 

- Nobody gets paid. Glassdoor is well below industry average (by ten's of thousands) when looking at OTE. Per my last note, nobody hits quota, so our pay is even lower compared to all the companies across the bridge in SF.

- Lack of coaching. The training is great when you start, and even in the first year it was good because manager had time for us. Now days, I find that all my coaching comes from my co-workers. And they're smart, which is great, but my managers who are suppose to be the sales experts have no time to invest in me bc we're so low on their priority list. Their focuses: hiring, forecasting, controlling teams that are way too big for their own good. 

- Company culture near gone. This is the most saddening one bc this was the one part that use to separate Glassdoor from all and above. Mill Valley is a ghost town. Everyone is so worked up about getting on a performance plan and wanting to get paid, that there's no time to smell the roses and enjoy each other like we once did. Additionally, our executive team is so focused on profitiability (which is great, and better then someone who isn't tracking that so closely) that it's taken a noticeable priority over investing in their own employees. I haven't had a team event or happy hour in the last 5 months. That's not the Glassdoor I know...."

-Hot company with a strong brand 
-I really have loved my time here for the great people I am surrounded by every day.
-Strong mission","The review posted on July 7th really hits the nail on the head, as does the review on July 19th (except for the 4-star rating). I’ll try not to be too redundant.
 
The sales floor in Mill Valley is depressed. Truly. The energy that I felt when I first started is long gone. Since I’ve been here I’ve watched our book of business become significantly reduced, while quotas have gone up astronomically. Every month we are told “ this the most important month.” Every few weeks we get an ‘inspirational’ email from upper-management telling us how much the company needs us. These emails are as empty as our paychecks and becoming borderline comical. 
 
There is no career advancement. None. People who have been here for years have not seen a single increase in pay, which is already tragically low to begin with. I get it, we don’t promote on tenure. But, if it were purely on performance then some of your recent promotions didn’t make much sense either. (Those reps still absolutely deserved their promotions but let's not pretend it was actually based on some semi-enforced 'system’). A vast, disproportionate amount of our org promotions have been SDRs primarily to make up for our uptick in attrition.  

As for the cultural undertones at the office… Unfortunately for those of us at Mill Valley HQ it feels like the future is in Chicago. Day by day we watch as our friends and peers slowly dwindle away – either moving away or moving on. Management hasn’t explicitly said it, but come on, we aren’t stupid. We can see the open desks. The struggles ARE NOT a talent issue. The current system is broken."

Number one is that there are great people working at Glassdoor not just in Dublin but beyond. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful and will do all they can to help you achieve and succeed. 

While you will always be busy and it's not 9-5 (some days you come in earlier and go home later), there is always an element of fun and humour in the office. 

Salary, bonus and benefits are great compared to other similar roles in tech startups. 

The role itself is demanding and good organisation around calendar, email and phone calls is key to being successful. Training for everything is provided but you do need to be a fast learner to take it all in.

If you like working in a target based environment then being an SDR at Glassdoor is the perfect job. 

As the company is still so new in Dublin and Europe, it has massive potential for growth and that makes it a really exciting project to be part of.","As a new project in Dublin there are still some teething problems and the office is somewhat 'scrappy' but to be honest that is to be expected.

- Quality of candidate screening process - not a unilateral decision; every one on the team has a say 
- Work/Life balance: Able to leave at a decent hour and not expect a flood of emails in the evening or over weekends 
- Ability to grow professionally: management cares about fostering your talent and giving you opportunities to network, test/expand your skills, increase your responsibilities 
- Working cross-functionally: high likelihood to work with various teams and departments, rather than being siloed 
- On-boarding experience: thoughtful coaching, buddy system, well-paced training materials for sales and marketing staff 
- Visibility and transparency: Upper management is open about their plans/goals/initiatives, and regularly shares feedback and answers questions in bi-weekly company-wide huddles 
- Company events/socials: Fun company happy hours, team lunches, holiday parties, great company spirit - Wellness: Free food every day and fitness classes offered, great gym 
- Pay and equity: competitive pay and wonderful equity package for all employees 
- Dog-friendly policy: such a great way to boost morale and liven up the workplace 
- Quality of leaders/managers: thoughtful and careful selection of our leaders pays off, each executive team leader is respectable, highly motivating and effective at moving the organization forward
- Great internship program and community involvement (e.g. Gratitude Lunch and Engineering After School program)","- Reign in your egos, middle-management: Despite everyone having equity in the company and boasting the ""people first"" motto, many middle-management leaders/directors posses and exhibit some serious egos. Rather than being collaborative, they have a tendency to shut down ideas, speak dismissively.  
- Exec managements limited understanding of B2B sales/marketing: As a marketing team member, it feels as though we are constantly fighting a battle to prove our worth and justify our spend. While, yes, marketing is responsible to generating pipe/bookings, there are countless other impacts that are immeasurable. 
- Not enough engineering support for marketing: Making a minor update to a website should not take over a month. Need to be able to advantageously explore digital marketing opportunities without waiting months for the next open sprint.
- Avoiding personnel issues: We promote being a culture that is humble and not arrogant, respectful and not mean, but there are some employees who receive multiple warnings about being rude, dismissive, arrogant and mean, but still remain employed and/or just get shifted to another role. I'm not sure if skating around the issue is the best way to foster these values.

The PR team is world class.

Glassdoor also allows for a good work life balance (given you are exempt status...), and people for sure take advantage of it.","The culture is shot, the company is no where near being profitable, and the cash burn rate isn't getting better.

Theres no fun and inspiring management, no company cohesiveness, and there is absolutely no shared goals. This company has been torn to shreds by sales culture and has a 'work hard burn out and sell sell sell' feel. Everyone is in panic mode trying to prove how valuable and important their work is to the flawed business model.

This rushed culture makes everyone produce work that they're not proud of, and it shows. Things are shipped broken, just so management can say ""hey we did this, just like I said! Now give me more stock and a raise.""

If you're a manager that wants to build a team and do awesome things, prepare to get over ruled by ""this is the way its alway been done."" If you're an engineer looking to make something you're proud of, prepare to spend half a day coding and a week explaining why you coded it that way.

Lastly - compensation. Don't expect to get any substantial units from Glassdoor. They're just not there for you to take. Plus, the ones you have wont make you any money (there was even a quarter where strike price went down).

563,Glassdoor,The company is good but the management is just bad,2016-05-05,3.0,Software Engineer,"I joined the company as a new grad engineer. Glassdoor is a great company. I can't think of how someone can go through a job seeking process without using Glassdoor. I love the company and it was the reason I chose it over other offers I had at the time. But I wish I could have a better manager. I don't wish to be in another team because all my teammates are knowledgeable and fun to work with. It's just weird how a manger of a hard core back end team doesn't like coding and spent most of his time in meetings without implementing any important piece of code while the company is still a startup. It's ok to be in meetings but it's not right when you are an engineer lead and have more meetings than your project manager. Yes we have a PM. All the team members could see the problem, brought it up but nothing changed. I don't want to go in more details, but I do want to see Glassdoor successful. Look back at the journey I had at Glassdoor, I do realize I learnt many things from my teammates. I'm glad to know and have them in my life. I don't regret my choice, I just wish it could be better for everyone. 

To any new grad: choose your manager for your first job, it should be the highest priority because he/she will be your mentor (or no mentorship at all if you choose a wrong one).","I want to say management, but I can't really say so because I only experienced it in my team. Maybe managers of other teams are better."
564,Glassdoor,I'm home at Glassdoor!,2016-04-14,5.0,Sales,"The new Chicago office is taking after headquarters in terms of culture, work ethic, and passion.  I love my co workers, and it's truly refreshing to work for a company that values it's employees, encourages work life balance, has a great benefits package, operates with transparency, and provides opportunities to those who want to strive for them. Our CEO is also spreading and supporting the message about equal pay for all, which only makes me even happier that I work for a company that is looking out for the best interest of everyone. Glassdoor never promises to be perfect, if fact, quite the opposite.  They openly say that they will make mistakes, and they have, but they will always do what is right by their people.  In my experience, that is absolutely true. I trust the leadership team, and I'm excited for what's next, especially with the new Chicago and Dublin offices! There is nothing but opportunity here!","This is a growing company, which means there will always be a lot of change.  Don't get too comfortable in your day to day, instead be ready for whatever may come and make the best of it. With change comes uncertainty, and that's not for everyone. The only difference in salary/overall compensation is dependent on the location of the office, which isn't ideal because household, living, and personal costs in most cities are not cheap, but I get it. Some are certainly more expensive overall, but it depends on your situation as well."

566,Glassdoor,Growing pains mean you are growing and that's a good thing,2016-04-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people who work here are for the most part extremely smart, driven, and really care about the business.  Their connection to the culture, leadership team, and our mission is clear and helps during those times when the hours are long and the work hard - which they can be in a rapidly   As we evolve, the founders and executive leadership team have been humble enough to admit that they don't know everything, showing this most recently with the hire of several new exec leaders to round out the team.  Work life balance and ease while at work (lunch every day, ridiculous snacks and drinks) are encouraged and at the individual team member level almost expected.  Finally, openness and innovation are encouraged.  We know that it takes a village and everyone needs to be thinking creatively about how we run our business to keep it moving at this pace.","We are growing and when there is immense growth, there are pains associated with becoming a 'grown up' company.  Glassdoor is right in the middle of that right now.  Leaders are doing their best in preparing for the change with changes to structure, processes, comp plans, etc but there is  a subset of the team members who are still attached to the Glassdoor 2012 ways.  Yes, the culture was great but evolution is needed to move to the next level.  The legacy team member base tends to be entitled, putting in less hours, really not connecting to the new mission and goals, because they want to keep the company in its teens.  When leadership makes a change that appears to be painful for team members, those people complain within the office, post on here and as a result things are changed to the 'softer, gentler' old way.  We can't continue to grow where the squeaky wheel always gets the oil.
Engineering resources are low - as is in most companies.  We need a team of people who can fix customer bugs and continue to innovate.  While our Engineers are smart and can execute, the product growth in to the Enterprise space has been slower because there just aren't enough of them to build.
Salaries are lower than market.  This is a known and was acceptable prior because many of those earlier team members got a bunch of equity and the perks were great.  One of those perks is the perceived 'unlimited PTO' which is not really unlimited, it's Open with Manager discretion. This was misinterpreted by team members to mean all the vacation you could consume regardless of business impact.  That's caused some concerns from the vantage point of keeping the business moving as quickly as possible.  Lack of strong leadership led to this and now there's clean up involved to get everyone back on track."
567,Glassdoor,"Value your people, don't knock them down.",2016-04-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You'll never find a more passionate group of people about the product than right here. People want to work here because they believe in what we do and how we're helping others. This is why most of us take the job here, high or low salary.","Someone else said this perfectly: I feel like Glassdoor broke up with me. 

There are a LOT of us who were hired with a promise of certain benefits, work style, and career development. But they have recently just decided to change all this and force employees to go from exempt to non-exempt - even people who have been here for years - based on their job title/status and strip them away of their benefits. Our so called ""unlimited"" PTO is now restricted to 15 days and to make that worse, we're now only starting with 7 days. What if we didn't take much vacation over the years?

But it goes beyond PTO. The majority of us that took the offers took it with everything it has to offer, including the ability to give it our all. That means loving the hours we work outside of the office, no matter how long it is, because we love what we do and we want to contribute all that we got. But now, with a strict 40 hour week (and some departments aren't even granting OT because of budget reasons), how are we supposed to do this? Some of us have huge projects, deals, clients that we want to take full responsibility for...but now we can't. We have to pass it on to other ""exempt"" employees. 

Like someone else said, this feels like we've just got grounded and belittled. How are we supposed to feel that we're valued? People are ACTUALLY saying that they're exempt because their job is more valued, or fancier. This is wrong and this is not the culture we, or I, signed up for. 

We all love what we do, no matter what level we are. I want to love coming into work, knowing that I'm bringing the same amount of value as everyone else. If I don't feel that way, that's wrong."
568,Glassdoor,I feel like Glassdoor just broke up with me,2016-04-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Friendship will be forever at Glassdoor.,"The culture once represented a family, a community, a team that will always have your back.... until now. Our leadership has taken away one thing that made Glassdoor worth fighting for.... Our Unlimited PTO. 

Yes, we aren't paid as high as the average rate on Glassdoor, yes our quota went up, yes our pay was cut, but I always knew Glassdoor was a safe zone, a place where you could call your second home... until now.

Now, I have only 15 days of PTO and I feel like a child who just got grounded by their parents. My work is always done before I leave for the day. I always give my all. However, how can we keep going as an individual/ a team/ a family when management increases our quotas/ cut our pay/ and take away unlimited PTO. 

My heart is broken and I feel betrayed. I have never said a word about the changes at Glassdoor because my heart bleeds green inside and out. 

However, it is starting to not bleed that bright green it used to. When I first started, Green was the only color I could think of, but now it is starting to get darker and darker and I am worried one day it will no longer be green."

-The CEO is a great leader. Transparent, honest, smart, and most importantly, extremely passionate about our mission. Feels like he's not in this to make money, but to change the world of employment. Elon Musk of employment. 
-Pick any 10 people that work here and they will start their own successful company. The talent here is above and beyond what the Bay Area has to offer. I'm shocked we aren't being poached left and right, and offered Teslas to leave. 
-Work/life balance is great
-We will be the next Linkedin one day, and when that day comes, this will be the easiest sale in the industry.","-Compensation will be the difference in top ENT reps staying or going. A top performing Enterprise sales rep who has brought in millions for the company gets paid the same with the same opportunities as someone who was hired yesterday. Why would that rep stay? He/she can make 40% more anywhere else with an immediate promotion, equity, and equal benefits.
-More compensation issues. All the blood, sweat, and tears that went into hitting our best year ever last year was quickly forgotten when I was told I was being paid the same this year with a significant quota increase and significantly more responsibility. 
-This is the hardest sale in the industry, and I honestly think the hardest sale period. It forces the sales team to be the best, and we are, but aren't treated like it sometimes. 
-So many communication issues internally and broken processes. I'm not going to list them because it would take too long."
570,Glassdoor,Glassdoor truly cares,2016-03-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Excellent company culture, work/life balance and growth opportunities. I've never seen so much passion at a company. I've been here for over a year and I still think everyone drinks the kool-aid. People truly believe in the mission and the vision of Glassdoor and are motivated to go to work everyday.","As a pre-IPO company, there are a lot of growing pains, but we promote transparency across the organization so leadership is upfront and honest (at least as much as they can be).

571,Glassdoor,Great team and getting better,2016-03-28,4.0,Sales Development Representative,"Overall, the SDR role has been a wonderful experience.  I came into this job with a wide variety of experiences from college, and a bit of sales knowledge, but am leaving with a much better understanding of the talent space and sales.

Favorite part: The team and individuals themselves.  Every single person that is on the SDR team fits in with the culture, both in work ethic and personality.  I have a relationship with each one of my teammates that allows for new insights, perspectives, and multiple ways to think about our prospects/tactics to make our numbers.  I always feel supported, and that I can ask any of my teammates for help.  Work life balance has become a lot better, and the unlimited PTO is a main reason why I would love to stay with this company for a while.  

The work itself: It definitely can be a grind.  I think its pretty hard for any sales development role not to be.  But managers are getting better at creating games, and rewarding high call/email volume.

Development: A bit of a struggle towards the end.  We do trainings every Tuesday, and when I started a year ago, I thought they were pretty spot on.  I think the growth of the team has prevented this area of personal development as a lot of these trainings have been a bit basic and repetitive. Since a lot of individuals in the SDR role are newly out of college, I think it would have been helpful to use these trainings to discuss different roles in and out of the sales department, professional development skills (articles/sales blogs), or even hear from other managers and leaders within the company.  Learning about Sandler practices, sales tactics and news about whats happening in other industries that could help us prospect smarter.","What to take away:  With a lot of new hires came a definite change in team camaraderie and culture.  Doubling in team size meant new managers, trainings changing, and more individual tasks.  It can be easy to show up, do work and check out, which I know isn’t Glassdoor’s culture, but making sure to do team bonding activities as an SDR group regularly may be helpful to keep morale high in a repetitive role.  Promotion timelines were not originally set when I joined and individuals have been promoted between 9 and 14 months, which is a pretty wide gap.  Good news is that procedures like quota, qualification, and promotion guidelines (if anything happens when you are hitting above your number consistently) are becoming more solidified/clearer expectations."
572,Glassdoor,It doesn't get any better. Thanks for the amazing years!,2016-03-25,5.0,Sales,"The culture is second to none, executive team leads by example and with canny, plus the perks are high class (gym, catered meals everyday, dogs, etc.) The company also invests a lot in its employees (department specific trainings, off sites, team building exercises, etc.) For the most part employees always tend to be happy and work together to help people find a job which GD employees are living - one they love!!",Really nothing other than Sales leadership at some times favors people / reps who fit their ideal mold.

574,Glassdoor,Best Place I've Ever Worked,2016-03-12,5.0,Marketing Manager,"I love this place. The culture, the people and the mission are all things I can really get behind. We just got great new executive management in place and I'm thinking positive about the direction Glassdoor is headed!  I'm on the B2B Marketing team and LOVE the people I work with. We're a collaborative family who have each other's backs and it's extremely motivating every single day.  It's an exciting time for the company and it's fun to be in marketing and see how the knowledge of Glassdoor for Employers is growing! Glassdoor is hands down the best job I've had and best company I've ever worked for!","We are experiencing growing pains, but this is normal for a company growing as rapidly as we are.  I can tell sales is frustrated right now and I feel that pain on the marketing team, but I know the exec team is listening to the grumblings and working hard to make changes based on feedback. Our goals seem extremely high and somewhat unrealistic, but we always seem to get there!"
575,Glassdoor,In at the Ground Level as an SDR in the EMEA office.,2016-03-12,4.0,Sales Development Representative,"It's so exciting to be part of Glassdoor at this early-stage. We literally had to ""build our own desks"" when we arrived as the first 10 people in the Dublin office. This phrase is central to Glassdoor's culture, signifying the GRIT and self-motivation you need to succeed at this stage of our growth as a company. 

SDR's, AE's and AM's all work in the same room so there is loads of collaboration and craic in the office. I learn something new every day; ranging from different sales techniques, ways to organise my day and how best to maximise my hours in work. I also laugh every day which I think is really important. There's a lovely mix of personalities in the office and we work well together. 

 As an SDR we learn everything about our sales process from the ground up and get a huge insight into the business - my previous experience was not in a tech environment so this is so valuable to me. 

We got stock options when joining the company which really makes me feel like I have a real investment in our success. It's great to know every deal that I help create contributes to the value of Glassdoor, which will benefit me and my colleagues in the future. 

We're looking to hire 100 people in the next 18 months so there is huge potential for growth here within the company. I'm already helping in the interview process with potential hires and I feel like my opinion is heard in the office. I'm really excited for things to come. 


There are no structure work hours and unlimited holidays which is fantastic. Even though this does generally fall into a 9-5 work day, it means that if you need to go to the bank or the dentist or take a day, there is no issue. It feels like we're being treated as adults - this is of course all dependent on performing well in relation to your targets - like any sales environment. 

Exciting times!","As SDR's we didn't get to go to San Fran for our yearly sales kick-off and training. This was disappointing because we feel like we missed out on a great opportunity to learn more about our company's culture and values. It's great motivation to get promoted to an AE or AM and go over for more training but it still felt like we weren't as valued as other employees who went over for training. 

We don't get all the perks of other tech companies in Dublin like free food, free gym or employer pension contributions. That's to be expected at our early stage and I'm sure that will all happen in the future. It's something to be aware of if you're coming from somewhere where everything is looked after for you. This office is scrappy and proud to be, it can be tough at times but that's what you're signing up for. 

We don't have employer contribution to pensions yet and have requested our phone expenses form (worth €40 a month) a few times but no word back from HR yet. I'm sure this is all part of the growing pains in such a fast-growing Company but it can still feel frustrating. 

Glassdoor's brand is still growing in the UK so a lot of our sales work is educating companies on the importance of getting engaged on their Glassdoor page. Again, this is expected to be the case in a growing company and it makes passing on good appointments to AE's even more satisfying."
576,Glassdoor,Building a Better Workplace by Example,2016-03-08,5.0,Senior Web Developer,"People care. People believe in the vision, and they believe in their peers, and go to lengths to show both of these to be true. This applies to interns and execs equally; drop by Robert's office to see how true it is for yourself. The culture reinforces itself when you see how hard people work to build something awesome, it's really inspirational.

Flexible schedules. You're adults; if you can accomplish your work, you manage your own time (normal caveats apply, of course -- physical presence is still important, and there are only so many meeting times that will work for most people).

Sweet perks - Free catered lunches, on-site gym, free bootcamp/Crossfit classes (yoga will be returning as well), some health/exercise related partner discounts, ping-pong, arcade games, beer on tap.

Making a difference. Working here gives you an opportunity to positively affect people's lives across the workforce. Even better, it's universally applicable. Is there something that annoys you about work in general that you don't think needs to be that way? Here's a great place to start trying to work on that.

Good brand. People commonly not only recognize but actually like the company, which gives super positive vibes. (Obligatory shout out to the awesome PR team!)","The first 2 aren't really hard ""cons"" as much as reminders that this is a bustling tech company, not a haven of freeloaders enjoying overcompensation and perks: 1) Things move very fast, and change is constant. Employees must be able to keep up. 2) Crunch time is no joke. Engineers might see long hours on a per-project basis, and salesmembers see it with the seasonal business. Other departments likely have similar waxes. I questioned whether the finance team ever left the office for months (during times I was working 11-12 hour days, no less).

Bureaucracy is growing. As the company grows, so come more layers that slow everything down. This is exacerbated by new hires higher up on the food chain since they need to ramp on more things. Zero-to-market time on products has taken a hit.

MVP delusions. Many products are initially built as lightweight as possible, or the ""Minimum Viable Product"" with the intention of filling out later, but... never quite get filled out. This mindset hurts engineering as much as it hurts the product by encouraging hacky, non-reusable code.

A bit behind the tech curve. The product brainiacs (I don't mean that in a bad way; they're just smart) drive their roadmaps with gusto, leaving less time for engineering innovation and infrastructure. There have been some internal drives to address this, but there has been little  penetration."
577,Glassdoor,"Two years in, still loving every day",2016-03-08,5.0,Senior PR Manager,"I absolutely love this company and can honestly say that I am as driven to succeed and passionate about the mission as the day I started. I have experienced huge change in two years which has been a real thrill, yet I feel like I am only just getting started. The camaraderie is great and the people I work with are real friends. In London we are a small team and we look out for each other. 
I really appreciate the opportunity that I have been given and my favourite part of the job is that we are breaking new ground in Europe. 
The senior management team are fantastic and I have a lot of respect for them. I believe we will be very successful and we are going in the right direction.","The hours are often quite long since we always have a lot to do and we have to conduct a lot of conference calls with the US near the end of our working day. The salary and bonus are good but the benefits are not yet up to scratch. 
There's a lot of pressure, which might not suit everyone but I don't mind it. 
There has been huge growth and a lot of new senior hires recently so it does feel like we have lost some of the early start-up vibe at HQ. In Europe we are still scrappy though. 
Overall, the cons are really minor."
578,Glassdoor,Exciting time for Engineering and Product,2016-03-03,5.0,Lead Engineer,"The engineering team is comprised of good people. Large engineering teams commonly have their share of high egos, but, refreshingly, there are no jerks here. There are 2 engineers in my management chain, including the CTO, and they are both people I trust, respect and learn from.

Glassdoor is well-positioned as a business. Users can find open jobs, like they can on any other job site, but they can also discover what it's like to work at each company & how much money they can expect to make, right on the same page. That's a useful & powerful combination. The ceiling is high and the road ahead is exciting.

The core infrastructure team is great. Our stack, architecture and processes used to be quite dated, but we're catching up.

It's a fairly transparent company. The CEO answers anonymous questions every few weeks. I hope that's a channel we never lose.","The usual growing pains - communication, meetings, cross-team care & coordination - all take up time that could be spent coding away to glory."
579,Glassdoor,Strong culture with an amazing mission,2016-03-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Glassdoor has a great culture based off of transparency. There's trust within the employees and trust within the executives to deliver and continue building our mission. Management is strong and work/life balance definitely exists here. Love the open collaborative environment, dogs around the office are a plus, and perks are incredible.","While the office is beautiful, a more accessible HQ would help the employees commute and help attract top talent. A 401k matching program would be helpful too."
580,Glassdoor,"Great company, lots of future and growth",2016-03-02,5.0,Senior Web Developer,"First of all the culture is great, everyone I know are always ready to help, everyone is friendly and mostly in a great mood, that is because pretty much everyone is exited about our mission and vision, I think there is a great future to the company.

Management is very accesible and open, they care for the individual and listen.

There is also a bunch of talent and you can see how the architecture, and over all code get's better and better.","Technology wise they are not on the forefront, you can see this as an opportunity to really impact and contribute to better the code, but some people might see this as a turnoff. Again this is by no means a reflect on the knowledge and talent of devs, is more of legacy and honestly time because the company is growing extremely fast."
581,Glassdoor,An Amazingly Dramatic Time in Sales Org,2016-02-27,4.0,Account Executive,"Glassdoor has changed my life for the better by giving the chance to earn the right here, there is no doubt about that.

You have all the perks of top flight SF start ups that make your day to day easier, but in Marin. Lots of people just do the easy Marin life and you can tell they won't ever leave this place because the quality of life working for a company like this in the north bay, 

You belong to a company who's mission is amazing and brings power to the people. As a sales rep, you often know exactly who and what you need to target in your book, and glassdoor is something no company can ignore. This isn't an organization that counts dials and they try to not micro manage but it's inevitable at times. You have so many outside sources, like candidates bringing up glassdoor reviews in interviews, to keep you relevant and top of mind to prospects. 

Robert is as good as it gets when you think of a top leader to work at the company. His vision we've all joined him on is pretty evident. I get out of bed every day coming in to kick butt and it's easy to do so with him at the top. 

 The vibe is the office is generally awesome as everyone is super eager to help you out, professionally or personally. Some of the most fun you can possibly have at an office is here, but it's not overly fratty or anything like that, that some sales cultures turn into. 

People here are insanely talented and smart, the turnover is low, as glassdoor usually nails who to hire, and people who end up here perform to their manager's expectations.","As far as all the frustrations around comp,Sales op complications, territories and quota, everyone else on here has already said it.  I don't want to echo the thoughts so I'll add some that have been understated.

 We  MUST do something about our comp. It's killing the morale every day here. Yes, BCR's and Quota goes down as revenue goes up at start ups, but the fact that the plans are very sub par compared to the Bay Area, and at best you'll have to do a lot more work for the same OTE. 

 The front line sales team has exceeded expectations every year and told how hard our goals are but how important it is to hit them. So we produce and get not a raise in OTE, but essentially a cut, and at best the same pay with a of a lot more work. Yes, we need to be smart how we run our business (see the horror story that is another SF HR firm) but we can within reason help the team.

Company has been cutting costs left and right, from the desert table at lunch to headcount.  We get that the company is trying to tighten up the bottom line as much as they can but us sales folks who have hit HUGE targets every year were led to believe by middle management we'd adjust for cost of living in 2016.

 I know Glassdoor admit's we can go elsewhere to make more money, and we have stock, but we love this company and this mission. We do not want to leave because we can't afford the life we'd like. And, the stock sales people are given is miniscule compared to others.

As far as selling glassdoor, most people aren't sure what we sell! Seems like it should be an easy sale and a must have for company's right? Unfortunately no, the products are limited and we basically use our amazing and game changing concept to fuel sales.

Second thing anyone considering a sales career here, is your joining a firm who's vastly in the customers favor, and will always lean towards the users ( who don't directly generate revenue) rather than the B2B org.  The solution to sell to firms is really straight forward and simple, but we've struggled (as the whole jobs industry in general) to innovate. We should have lapped our competitors by now, our concept is lightyears ahead of anything anyone else can do but still customers have to opt to legacy platforms because we can't meet their needs. 

This is fine as many other company's are user focused, but the value of the product you sell 100% relies on the traffic numbers our site pulls."
582,Glassdoor,Good Company with lot of passionate people.,2016-02-26,3.0,Lead Data Reporting Engineer,"Great culture , people who are very passionate on what they are working for, Sr Management encourages great ideas. 
Healthy work life balance .",There are few  bad teams who lacks vision or leadership. Cannot hire good talent and going for cheap talent is hurting the company. They make it a big deal when your leaving company as if you are a traitor.
583,Glassdoor,Things are not so good right now,2016-02-22,3.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"Glassdoor is a fast-growing late stage start-up making a real impact in the world - we're helping people find great jobs and helping companies find ideal talent. The people here are awesome, starting at the top with our CEO. Robert is an inspiration to all - he's ethical, passionate, approachable, intelligent, and willing to help the sales team. In fact, everyone is willing to help whenever assistance or advice is needed. 

I love the flexibility of working from home, when it’s necessary – this is a real benefit that matters in an area like San Francisco where traffic can be unpleasant. 

There's great opportunity to advance in your career and get promoted, if you work hard and stay focused. Glassdoor has been the best place I’ve ever worked.","Things have changed quite a bit over the last several months, and it’s sad to say – this place isn’t as great as it once was.

Compensation is now far lower than many similar stage companies in the SF Bay Area (48% below national average for Enterprise Account Executives, according to Glassdoor's own data) and worse, we just received our compensation package for the first quarter of 2016 (2 months late), my quota has tripled from last year and my commission rate has been cut by 50%. This means I literally have to sell 3x what I sold last year to make the same amount of money. Everyone in sales understands that quotas will go up each year and at a start-up like Glassdoor, commission rates will go down – but this is painful. Glassdoor has a model that punishes people who perform at a high level. Instead of rewarding the best, Glassdoor uses a formula that makes everyone’s on-target-earnings the exact same – which means that if you are terrific at your job and have years of experience, you have to sell more 2-3x what someone who started last week has to sell to make the exact same amount of money. It feels like this model is a short-sighted blitzkrieg to cut costs for an IPO, but will lead the most senior talent to quit, which will be much more challenging for Glassdoor long after the ""funding event"" that is ""going public"". It is quite strange considering we preach nothing but culture, transparency, and keeping employees happy - yet our recent actions defy all of that logic. 

Sales Operations has been a true pain to work with over the last several months. It seems like they get thrills on kicking deals back to us after the sale, asking us to get amendments signed and new paperwork completed. This is needed on almost every deal because it's difficult to create a quote and agreement correctly. Now, it takes multiple days of approvals at several levels to process quotes and send agreements - and as mentioned, it still doesn't work right.

There are a lot of questions around territories right now - a major important part of the sales structure that feels like it was neglected. What’s most painful is that the way territories will be divided is based on a scoring methodology that is inaccurate. Many people have of anxiety around what our territories will look like in just a few weeks.

Morale on the sales floor is low; many feel defeated with our new comp plans – with anxiety/ uncertainty about how things will be moving forward. I feel like I am in a bad situation, but when I hear about how bad other reps quotas and commissions got hit, I cringe."
584,Glassdoor,We love Glassdoor but need some more love back!,2016-02-22,2.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"Amazing company and great value add to the recruitment industry. We get to help people find jobs they love and it's a great message!

CEO is a great guy, really down to earth and passionate about our vision

Great people and coworkers. I've made lifelong friends in a short amount of time","1- New comp plan: I'm being told that I need to sell more, while getting less commission. So I basically have to work harder and get paid the same or less (VERY likely we will make less as the goals are lofty). We are regressing, not progressing. This is drastic even by industry standards 

The mid-level managers are going to bat for us and trying to make things fair and keep us happy. But we have no insight into these things and it's hard for us to keep believing that the team has their best interest out for us.  Is there a way to make us more involved in these conversations so we aren't blindsided?

When I'm told as an employee that I don't deserve an increase in pay because of a stellar performance last year and it's going to be harder for me to make the same amount of money. Soul crushing...you just took away all my sales mojo :( 

2. Unable to make decisions in a reasonable time:

Pricing needs fixing ASAP. I understand we are reviewing but this is urgent and has been going on since last year. There are so many layers of approvals that it's hurting us on the front lines. This also goes for territory shifts and changes. I can't tell you the number of times I've heard ""we are doing scoring"" What is the scoring? Can we see it? Everything is in a black box and we only hear about it on Friday afternoons (seriously, every comp plan, quota, territory email).  There is going to be fallout, don't be afraid to address it

3. Sales Ops:

They rule the roost and management has no authority over them whatsoever (seems that way). Aren't the sales team their internal customer? I'm not saying we need world class service, but clear communication, email responses, quotes that work and don't change things without telling us would be nice. 
 
Honestly, I'd rather deal with my cable company"
585,Glassdoor,Recrutier,2016-02-17,4.0,Technical Recruiter,"Great team, environment, culture. Company truly walks their talk.","Lots to do, but making impact."
586,Glassdoor,Trim the fat but don't ruin the whole thing,2016-02-16,2.0,Sales,"There are so many pros to list that I'm afraid this could become an Oscar speech. 

I want to say that there are a lot of really great motivated people that push to bring out the best part of you everyday. Sales leadership is dedicated and down to earth. Managers especially care about their reps and will seldom pass any blame or take credit away from their reps. 

Full snack bar. Catered lunches. Beautiful office. Fast growing company. Team outings. Unlimited vacation.","It really pains me to have to write in this section but something has come up that needs to be addressed. Before a few days ago this section would have been very slim. To be quite frank there aren't a lot of cons. 

Except one...

Glassdoor is a fast growing company and it has growing pains. Often times these pains can be swept aside and easily masked behind a wave of positive attributes. Things are changing. Glassdoor has always been known for underpaying its reps. The carrot that has kept everyone working is vested interest in the company. The company is reaching a point where they are asking too much of their reps without showing good faith in return. Upper management and most likely the board want to squeeze every last possible dollar out of its sales team while paying them significantly less than market value. 

If you look at a lot of reps they aren't even mad at the recent slash in comp plans. They are defeated! Many live and breathe Glassdoor and are huge contributors to reaching lofty sales org goals. Only to see that hard work used against them in the following years comp and quota plans.  

Slashing an already underpaid sales team with no warning is not what Glassdoor represents. We are different than other companies in so many ways. Why do we forget transparency when it comes to the most important reason we all work in the first place? 

The majority of these reps will not make it big when the company decides to go public. We will still be working extremely hard to make this company successful and reach all of its goals. 

Large changes like this come from the top. Can Glassdoor really afford to loose it's top talent right now?"
587,Glassdoor,Account Manager Role,2016-02-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are a lot here! Working with these awesome people everyday is what motivates me to push myself to do my best. Everyone around you wants to see you succeed, and everyday is different, which keeps you on your toes. - Not sure about something? Just ask! All resources are at your fingertips. 

It's a ""work hard, play hard"" mentality within the organization.","The open concept environment can be distracting when you need to work. Invest in a solid pair of noise canceling headphones, it will pay off!"
588,Glassdoor,Great company.  Helpful coworkers.,2016-02-12,5.0,Software Engineer,It's a great company that practices what it preaches.  Management works hard at transparency and helping workers succeed.   It's awesome to work at a company that is helping to transform the American workplace by letting people know what they are getting into.,Training of new engineering employees could be improved.  Engineers may not be familiar with the needs of recruiters that use the site.
589,Glassdoor,Sales... Going through some rocky times,2016-02-11,3.0,,"Glassdoor is an amazing organization that is going places. It is disrupting an industry that has been lacking innovation for years. The people are amazing, work culture is great, and the over all working environment is something all companies dream in achieving.","Read the reviews before this one. Glassdoor has an amazing culture where the people will become some of your best friends. The managers are here for you and will work as hard as possible in order to see you succeed. Unfortunately there is a little disconnect with upper management. When scaling a company, you need to figure out ways to cut costs and become profitable, that's a known factor. But, you don't necessarily do this by drastically lowering commission rates all at once, to the point where the new OTE seem unrealistic. You do this slowly or else you lose the driving force behind what makes your sales team operate; the though that you can make good money if you work hard. Suggestion for those thinking about joining the sales team: maybe wait for 6 months. Management is going to need to create a realistic comp plan that allows for contributors to make money. It will get done but may take some time.  Maybe sit back and think about joining the back half of this year."
590,Glassdoor,Best decision in my career,2016-02-11,5.0,,"Company prospects are strong. Incredible business model and fantastic growth. CEO is humble, intelligent and compassionate. Leads by example. Great company culture.","Nothing specific, but of course the company is going from a transition from being super small and nimble to being a more established startup and is learning how to deal with that. Some people are finding the transition harder than others. But not a big deal."
591,Glassdoor,Still loving every day,2016-02-11,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,I have been with the company for almost 2.5 years in sales (which is a lifetime in the Bay Area). I still am just as excited to go to work today as I was on day one. We have changed a lot and had plenty of ups and downs but there's no place I'd rather be. We operate as a team and support each other no matter what the situation. Leadership is strong and opportunities to advance still exist. That's all good stuff for a company entering its 8th year.,Management has become quite layered over time. What used to take 5 minutes to get approval on now takes a couple days. Sometimes communication breaks down between those layers. This is all part of the natural progression from start up to big boy company.
592,Glassdoor,AE,2016-02-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I'm surrounded by some very talented people across the org from Top down. The culture is amazing and I do truly enjoy coming into the office everyday. We are changing the recruiting landscape and it's exciting to be a part of this explosive growth.,"With Explosive Growth comes challenges. We are being pulled in a lot of directions, have too many meetings and e-mails. Favorites can get away with not having to attend or participate in events which can be frustrating."
593,Glassdoor,Was great but getting frustrated,2016-02-11,3.0,Sales,"The mission at Glassdoor is ""to help everyone everywhere find the jobs and companies they love"" and it is powerful.  Our CEO Robert, when you hear him speak, truly believes in this and it trickles down.  We are transforming the recruiting industry and you can feel the ""magic!""

The flexibility Glassdoor offers is amazing.  Have a doctor appointment?  No problem.  Need a day to work from home for whatever reason, sure - go for it!  Having a baby?  We have AMAZING maternity/paternity benefits.  Want to take a vacation, enjoy it because we don't have a PTO policy!

On the sales side, while there are challenges, I believe that our managers do fight for us.  I have yet to see a manager throw a rep under the bus - they typically give all the credit to reps when it comes to successes, while taking partial responsibility for failure when it happens.  You don't see that too often!","The negative aspects of Glassdoor have nothing to do with the culture, but rather around sales and our processes.  Over my time at Glassdoor I have had multiple territories with different comp plans that just don't make sense. They ask you to sell into regions of the world we don't have a viable solution for, and create products that are impossible to implement and price effectively/competitively.  The reps that cover the major metropolitan areas like SF Bay Area and LA absolutely destroy their quota.  Reps elsewhere, not so much, but have the same comp plan. 

For an organization that prides itself on transparency, this is the most opaque sales team I have ever worked for.  Managers are literally in closed door meetings ALL DAY every day.  Our sales approval process gets bottle necked to certain key directors that are simply never around to approve deals and thus it is an endless waiting game.  Want to know about new products/features that are coming down the line?  Not gonna happen because we aren't told about them until a day or two before they launch (or the morning of)!

Speaking of sales, it would be nice to have a quota when the year starts!  It is now mid February and we still don't know what our Quota/Territories are for this quarter or our fiscal year.  We get the fact that we're rethinking our model year over year, and working for an organization that is in hyper growth mode, but you can only ask so much.  You can't tell us we are behind on a plan, when we don't even know what the plan is.  

We can only take so much ""trust us, your leadership team is doing what is best for you and the business long term.""  The reality is, while we want to be flexible, and do what is right for the company because we believe in what we do here, all of these decisions made behind closed doors, in endless meetings, negatively impact the morale and bottom line of your employees!"
594,Glassdoor,Sales,2016-02-10,4.0,,"Truly a great place to work everyday. I believe in our mission and I love the fast-paced, supportive environment. Senior leadership is incredibly transparent about the business and where it's heading.","With fast growth comes a lot of uncertainty at times, so you need to be nimble and comfortable with constant shifting of priorities, accounts, territories, etc."
595,Glassdoor,Enterprise Account Manager,2016-02-09,5.0,Account Manager,"Tremendous collaboration and company culture that begins from the top (CEO, Rob Hohman) and trickles down to the rank and file (mostly). Glassdoor practices what it preaches in transparency and employee engagement. 

Beautiful office setting in Marin County and great benefits including (but not limited to) catered lunches, awesome game room to unwind, on-site gym (and full-time wellness trainer, and oh yeah FREE healthcare for the employee!

Glassdoor truly does offer employers an opportunity for job candidates to find the jobs and companies they love.","Glassdoor is in true hyper-growth mode, this presents many challenges (but exciting ones) like very aggressive monthly quotas, a book of business that is not regionalized (many reps travelling to same cities which hurts profiltability), and a crowded sales floor that can often times be very noisy and challenging to hold client calls effectively. All of these are being addressed but does reflect the current state of the sales org."

597,Glassdoor,Small Company Punches Above Its Weight,2016-02-08,5.0,Chief Economist and Senior Director,"Glassdoor is a rare combination of a private company doing something that really improves the lives of ordinary workers -- bringing transparency to pay, job interviews, and workplace culture -- and doing it in a huge way around the world. It's like working at ""we're saving the world"" nonprofit, but with private sector pay and benefits. 

As the company has grown over the past year or so, they have done a great job of preserving the quirky, small, tech-company culture. It has gotten bigger and more professional over the past year, but still feels scrappy and with a lot of interesting personality. 

People here seem happy with their jobs. There is a lot of talent here, but not a lot of huge egos. Glassdoor has a very flat organization, with little of the annoying, exclusionary hierarchy you see in larger firms. Everyone has a desk in the bullpen, and people roll up their sleeves and do their own work. I like that. 

It is fun working for a place with such a positive public image. Who doesn't love Glassdoor? 

Working from home is a possibility, at least for many employees. There is really generous vacation and leave policy. The company treats people like adults -- you take time off when you need it. 

The CEO is someone I liked instantly at my first job interview, and is someone I really believe in personally. The real unicorn in the building is him, and the amazing people he has surrounded himself with. I have learned a tremendous amount just watching him run the company this past year, and feel lucky to have been part of this amazing organization. 

I was made a lot of promises when I came on board, and I'm happy to report that essentially all of them were kept. I was basically given the ability to create a new division inside the company, with lots of room for my own creativity and personality. This hands-off approach is essential for a culture of entrepreneurship, and Glassdoor definitely keeps that torch alive.","The Mill Valley location is beautiful -- nice view, video games, awesome workspaces. But seriously, for anyone who ever wants to own a home or raise a family (who isn't already a tech millionaire) this is the worst possible location for a company. Many people are doing huge commutes in from places that are more affordable. This is a major problem Glassdoor needs to solve as it grows -- the should get closer to mass transit, or get closer to cheaper real estate. I believe this will hurt the company's recruiting long-term if not solved. 

If you're not working within a large group inside the company, it is easy to get stuck working alone with no peer group. This is not something specific to Glassdoor -- it's a problem at all small employers that often have a single person doing some business function. Working mostly alone makes it hard to grow professionally, can lead to stagnating skills, and makes it hard to do the kind of creative brainstorming needed for real innovation."
598,Glassdoor,Proud to Be Here!,2016-02-08,5.0,Sales,I have been here almost 9 months and what an experience so far.  This is the first role I have held in the Bay area where i can tell management and team members genuinely care about your success.  It feel good coming to work everyday knowing that I have a chance to learn something new and grow as a professional.  I hope that we keep they same mindset and atmosphere moving forward.,There are some growing pains within the organization.   Things can take a while to develop internally but that all comes with being a rapidly growing company.

600,Glassdoor,Almost too good to be true,2016-02-08,5.0,Senior Director,"I've worked at a handful of companies who talk about culture. Glassdoor is impressively committed to being a great place to work. People are friendly and smart. No surprise for a company that is built on transparency, but there is a great deal of transparency within the company. Regular all staff meetings with open Q&A and sharing of the good, bad and better. And people aren't afraid to disagree and debate. People really are committed to doing the right thing and that means there is a lot of open conversation and real-time feedback.","There is a lot about start-up life that can be frustrating. Some areas of the business are running very fast while others are a little behind. Things are out of synch in places and it's frustrating that we can't be as impactful together as we could. Yet. People work all hours, all days. But it feels more like a bunch of people working on good projects--and not pressure from a boss to work around the clock. And with unlimited PTO, you have the ability to manage your own life as you need."
601,Glassdoor,Best Decision I've Made,2016-02-06,5.0,Client Success Manager,"The culture at Glassdoor is unlike any I've ever been a part of. Everyone is friendly, willing to help and not only believes in the mission statement of the company but realizes the future of the company is a total and complete team effort. The catered lunches, dog-friendly setting and perks around the office are great, but the people are truly what makes this a place where you actually look forward to coming into the office.","The company is growing rapidly and this comes with pains and at times a lack of communication between departments. Aside from these relatively infrequent breakdowns, not many cons to report. Compensation could be better."
602,Glassdoor,Living the Dream,2016-02-04,5.0,Senior Vice President,"Over 8 years in and I'm still having fun. The Glassdoor world has changed quite a bit. But way more good than bad. For me most importantly, what we do matters - helping people find a job and company they love - is a noble mission and one that I believe in. We work with a bunch of really smart people but that also have a genuine appreciation for human beings. We get to solve interesting problems every day and those problems see the light of day as they help our job seekers and employers....and it's working. Being part of a growing company that is succeeding feels great.",We're getting bigger and more complex. It's sometimes hard to know how to get something done.

Great central London office location, fun team events, collaborative environment in the office - Glassdoor invests in each employee's success and happiness, and that's visible in the way people come to work every day, enthusiastic about the job they do.","This is not a negative for me but we are growing rapidly and building the framework of Glassdoor Europe as we grow, and sometimes you end up buying office supplies and snacks in addition to doing your full time job. If you'd rather have a team of people responsible for everything from office management to IT and you're not prepared to roll up your sleeves and pitch in this might not be the right place for you at this stage of our growth.

614,Glassdoor,Great start company with accelerated growth,2015-10-26,4.0,Client Relationship Director,"- The company is growing exceptionally fast and traction in the UK is fantastic with clients always interested in hearing the story. 

- As there is a small team in the UK, the culture is great and work ethic is hard with a real 'family / friend' environment. 

- Get to work autonomously on your book of business and utilise your own strengths to engage clients. No micro-management that you typically find in other american companies in the UK. 

- Earning potential is fantastic with a massive opportunity for the right person to make as much money as they want (as long as they want to work hard). In saying that, you need to want to put in the hours if you want to make it work!","Being a smaller startup, employees need to know the following:

- They will need to do things outside of their normal function (getting office supplies, fixing their own IT issues, data management / generation / cleaning)

- Hard work is required and long hours need to be put in to make it work in a new market

- The culture is developing, so it is not for everyone

616,Glassdoor,Think Twice Before Joining the Product Team,2015-10-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Glassdoor is a great company. I enjoy working with my peers and really like our CEO. The mission of the company is unique and I believe in it. Unlimited vacation and opportunities to work from home make it easy to want to put my all into the job.,"The problem I have with working here on the product team is how the product team is run. It is still run like we are a small startup. I am micromanaged and this makes it almost impossible to contribute my own ideas and solutions. There is a need to better build and mentor individuals. I am most commonly told what to do and when I try to bring my own approach I am shut down and made to feel stupid. I am rarely provided direction or constructive criticism for how to improve my ideas. It is mostly about how I need to do a better job of making sure other's ideas and solutions are implemented. Ego often gets in the way of real collaboration and partnership.

I want to stay at Glassdoor because I think this is a great company, but I don't know how much longer I can work in this environment. I was hired into the company under the impression that I would be able to contribute significantly to the product and grow my career. As it stands currently, I am not growing and it is incredibly difficult to contribute and feel good about the work I am doing. It's unfortunate that the product team runs like this and it is actually contrary to the culture that the company professes to engender.

Think twice about joining the product team unless you like being told what to do and how to do it. If you value your experience and expertise as a product person, there are many other companies in the Bay Area that know how to treat their employees like professional adults."
617,Glassdoor,Growing Pains,2015-10-07,4.0,Sales,"Leadership - Every time you hear our CEO (Robert Hohman) speak you know he passionately believes in our mission and truly cares about employees at Glassdoor. His leadership is what makes GD tick. He practices what he preaches and is as transparent as can be with where the company is heading and what he believes are our biggest challenges are. I have never worked for an organization with a leader as visible and truly committed to the cause as Robert.

Colleagues - There are a lot of great people at GD. Since my first day here, people have been extremely friendly and welcoming.

Benefits - What you would expect from top tech company in Bay Area.","Really feels like we are in that awkward in-between stage as a growing company. I definitely don't feel as confident about the business as I did at the beginning of 2015.

We have also seen a lot of really great, smart sales people leave the org over the last 6 months and that can be disconcerting for the team.

Another challenge is we are first and foremost a consumer site with a mission dedicated to serve job seekers. This doesn't translate as well to our offerings to employers. We regularly work with clients who feel like we are blackmailing them or that GD is a ""necessary evil"" because of the employee reviews. These can be really hard objections to overcome because we have no control over content.

I also think our B2B products are not great. We have not seen anything innovative come through development this year and it feels like the products we do sell are not any different than what our competitors are doing. Results for clients vary greatly and we need to stop selling ourselves as a complete recruiting tool - we do branding really well (soft ROI), but are very inconsistent in helping get direct hires."
618,Glassdoor,Almost 2 years and I'm still excited,2015-10-05,5.0,Systems Administrator,"Almost 2 years into my employment at Glassdoor and I've decided the excitement of working here isn't a phase. I love the management, they encourage employees to grow and learn with the company. And as fast as I've seen things go I've learned just as much if not more. There is no micromanaging in my department, but rather a trust we are all working together to meet our goals. The director of my department has been the coolest guy and knows how to help the team push for success. 1 year in with this guy and he's built an outstanding team to work with.",There was a time when I wasn't receiving the feedback I was hoping to improve. But this was not a short coming of management. It was a time of growth and we didn't have anyone leading our team at the time. Upper management was taking the proper lengths to make sure we got the right guy to lead our team
619,Glassdoor,"Great place to work, but sales culture trending in the wrong direction",2015-09-29,4.0,Sales,"It all starts at the top with Bob Hohman. He is a truly inspirational leader that has created a phenomenal company culture. Every employee feels valued. There are also great perks, like the amazing office, lunch, game room, gym, etc. On the whole, the people are some of the best I have ever worked with. Very smart, engaged, and great people!","Most of my cons are related to the Sales Team. Although it is still a great team, I think the culture of the team is trending in the wrong direction. Other than a few exceptions, the management on the new business side of sales is just ok. It feels more and more like sales folks are just a number. Culturally, the team also feels more and more like a frat party these days. Some of this is a simple fact of scaling a team, but some of it is due to a lack of strong leadership."
620,Glassdoor,Drinking the Green Kool-Aid.,2015-09-29,5.0,Sales,Glassdoor is living proof that you can find a job and company that you LOVE.  I feel so fulfilled and honored to be working for this company.  There is such an authentic excitement and energy that you can't fake here.  We all know we're a part of something special and that resonates from the top down.  I've never worked so hard - yet somehow feel better than when I worked for places that required less of my time and energy.  Glassdoor is the real deal and I wake up excited to be a part of it.,"We are growing like crazy which means things change quickly here.  That’s not necessarily a ""con"" but it does make you stay on your toes.  The workload is tremendous but worth it."

I feel my work is appreciated and acknowledged by upper management. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement and career development. I highly recommend working for this AMAZING COMPANY!","Transportation from SF is a little difficult and limited transportation benefits for my location. There is a lot of clingy people and it's a little like high school during lunch. Parking is getting limited with new hires. Training is also crammed in some days and slower others, this can be overwhelming at times. A larger gym will be more appealing, it's hard for more than 10 people at a time to work out in the small room, but again this is just feedback and I'm grateful to work for this awesome company!"

It really is a great place to go and everyone who works there is committed to making our site great.  Fun events for the family.","Work-life balance can be difficult if you are full time.  You have to be really good at managing your time.  The time-tracking software used in the Ohio office is not great, and you are strongly encouraged to be always working on moderation or a given task.  Don't expect to coast.

Starting from the top, the values of most people in the company are aligned to do what's best for the company and to help each other grow. Most importantly, there's tons of opportunity, and it's mostly a merit based org, where the smartest and most useful ideas/people/initiatives win out.
-Management/executives are awesome- really smart and great attitudes.","It's easy to get lost and ultimately you really have to go after what you want. It's a tough place to work for analysts, the function isn't built out, it's sprinkled throughout the org, which makes it easy to get stuck. As an individual, the more you know and build, the harder it is to expand your scope and function...bit of a catch 22 (often times the nature of a smaller company)."

634,Glassdoor,Great company!,2015-07-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The commute from San Francisco is reverse to and from Sausalito. Glassdoor offers great benefits including: catered lunches, unlimited PTO, a work laptop (your choice), and many volunteer opportunity benefits.","The base salary is a little lower than what I was expecting, but because it is a starting level position there is a lot of opportunity for growth, raises, etc."
635,Glassdoor,Great culture and people but need to address scaling issues,2015-07-10,4.0,Director of Product,"People are fun, smart and motivated. They genuinely like being there. The CEO is very open and transparent about pretty much everything. A lot of information is shared in weekly all hands meetings, and employees do have a good idea of where the company is heading, the challenges ahead, why they make certain decisions (like funding rounds), etc. 

It is definitely a high-potential company. Glassdoor is not going away and an IPO is inevitable. So probably a decent upside for those who stick around. And of course the perks are fantastic. Catered and healthy food, free well-equipped gym with free crossfit/bootcamp/yoga classes, snacks, kayaks to take out into the bay, etc. Location is beautiful, right by the bay with views of water and hills, and running trails all around.

From a product mgmt perspective, the engineers are high quality and take a lot of ownership. Things move pretty fast from ideation to execution.","While I believe that everyone in the executive leadership team is well-intentioned and want Glassdoor to succeed while creating a great culture, I think more needs to be done in order to scale. This is especially true in the product and marketing organizations. It is always hard for founders or early employees to make room as the company grows and to cede control. The shift from being a scrappy startup to a well-oiled growth engine with good processes/practices is not an easy one, but the change needs to be made. For this to happen, senior leaders need to move away from being very hands-on and driving every decision top-down to empowering their employees, trusting them to do the right things and encouraging constructive discussions/arguments. As a product leader especially, you cannot keep throwing terms like ""let's be scrappy"" when you should be driving sound practices through the product org that encourages good long-term planning, roadmapping process, socializing with stake holders, running experiments, etc. And when product managers feel like they do not have clear ownership and are mere foot soldiers when decisions are top down, then they will struggle to excel at their jobs. They will be left to defend ideas with various stake holders that are not their own and that they don't necessarily even believe in."
636,Glassdoor,Great Company & Special Culture,2015-07-08,5.0,,"I'm proud to be a part of Glassdoor!  Our mission of helping bring transparency and value to job seekers is very rewarding.   Here are some other pros:

- The people at Glassdoor are fantastic.  Everyone works hard, and there seems to be a common level of mutual respect between all employees. It's evident we're all on the same team. 

- Senior Management is approachable and open to feedback.  Important changes are generally explained in detail and accompanied with reasoning with the opportunity to ask questions.  

- They also provide Emotional Training, which helps you develop both professionally at work, but also with your personal relationships.  

- Great opportunities for career advancement and growth.","Pretty much the cons are byproducts of the massive growth of Glassdoor experienced over the last year.  

- The more people joining the company, the more challenging it becomes to encourage a fun and consistent culture, where people know and care about each other.

- Many formal policies and procedures are currently being put in place or revamped.  Embracing change is important, but the speed can feel overwhelming and somewhat disjointed at times."
637,Glassdoor,IT Manager / Lead Systems Administrator,2015-07-04,5.0,IT Manager & Lead Systems Administrator,"* Glassdoor is an amazing place to work. I have worked for startups for over a decade now, and the culture is amazing. I can say many companies try to achieve what Glassdoor has with regards to culture, but they just don't quite take it seriously enough. But you have to give to receive. You have to contribute to the culture to reap the rewards. You will be culled if you aren't contributing with your heart and mind. This is because they take the culture of the company as well as it's success very seriously.
* I was given plenty of room to prove my merit and was promoted several times during my tenure.
* The compensation was without compare.
* Free Lunch, Gym, Arcade, Game Room and more.
* Great facilities in the corporate office
* They don't skimp on resources. This aren't afraid to buy you good, high end equipment to ensure you can get your job done.
* They are fast paced and get things done.
* Great leadership. The company has rarely not delivered on what is says it's going to do. They deliver the roadmap, and unless there is a good reason to deviate, they don't.","* If you aren't ready to give it your all this place isn't for you. It's a culture of hard work and hard play. Sometimes it can be a bit daunting, as it's full of driven successful people.
* Communication can be difficult in a startup environment. Sometimes the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing, but this is very common in growing companies, so it's more a just be aware thing. During busy sprints, you may have to send communications a few times to get through as people are very busy."

Never have I worked at a company with so many awesome people. Glassdoor invests in getting you to know your team and it's a huge benefit.

I have the opportunity to solve interesting problems, hardly ever have a boring day and am always learning and being pushed. 

On the perks side we are well taken care of with catered lunches, a gym, gym classes, kegs, dry cleaning pick up, plenty of snacks and happy hours.",Growing pains feel are starting to show but I see a little bit of an effort to keep things moving smoothly. People wear a variety of hats and project owners seem to shuffle so it can be tough knowing who is responsible for driving the project. This definitely slows things down. There are lot of rotating/changing top priorities which come in a fast paced environment. Overall these cons are pretty expected in a startup.
640,Glassdoor,Most Rewarding Experience of My Career,2015-06-26,5.0,Client Success Manager,"Our employees are phenomenally smart and driven, yet humble and kind. Very few companies of our size can say the same. I love this about Glassdoor.

Glassdoor sets ambitious goals and then beats them. It’s amazing. 

All of our teams are endlessly driven, innovative and dedicated. 

We are helping people and changing the world.","Our basic product offerings are quite simple, while their packaging, pricing and value prop feels a bit over-complicated lately.  

Rollouts of new features, functions or internal processes can seem hasty. The resulting technical bugs, questions and confusion can be intense."

I have a really long commute which I have gotten use to and the nice thing about working here is they are very flexible with my schedule. The perks aren’t too shabby either.  Free catered lunch every day, a gym on site, a wellness director/personal trainer, cute dogs to pet throughout the day and snacks in every kitchen.  Did I mention my team?  I absolutely love my team.  I am very excited about the direction of Glassdoor and look forward to everything the future brings.",Communication can be tough sometimes.

I am growing here professionally and as a person because of the super smart, competitive and team-oriented colleagues with whom I work.","Glassdoor is growing fast which is good and difficult simultaneously.  I would like to see better training after our introductory new-hire class (a class that is geared towards all department new-hires).  Moving into a new position, it's difficult to know what questions to ask.  Better training would help prevent costly mistakes as a new-hire ramps.  Playing devils advocate, this current set up really does foster the motivated, driven individual to take matters into their own hands and act to have a positive impact."

I trust those around me to do the right thing and get the job done at all times. There's also loads of opportunity to be had and the freedom to try new approaches to things. I also appreciate the awesome level of collaboration we have across teams (marketing, sales, PR, recruitment, etc.). Our CEO is remarkable and his passion for the company and candidness with employees furthers everyone's belief in / support of our mission.","We definitely are experiencing some growing pains. As we get bigger, certain systems need to be put in place to compensate for folks being stretched too thin or not enough. It's especially difficult in positions where there is only one person in the function.

- Growing quickly and lots of opportunity to step up and contribute to the rocketship ride in a pre IPO company

- Great perks, flexibility and culture.  People understand you can get work done and have a life with competing priorities.  Management doesn't care if I have to work from home to take care of appointments.  Gym, onsite trainers and a new office on the water is amazing.","- ASAP Attitude versus Long Term Value.  We have very high goals every quarter but are still in the early days on our employer business.  We often make strategic decisions quickly based on what's good for sales versus a long term sustainable business that's unique and disruptive.  Also tend to ship minimum value products and move on to the next feature quickly without coming back and optimizing previous releases.

- Focused on Competitors vs Ourselves.  We're in a competitive space and often compare ourselves against the competition.  Totally get it.  But this sometimes overly influences our product and sales decisions and take us down a path where we're talking about and imitating our competitors too much.

- Salaries are pretty low compared to other hot tech firms in the Bay Area.  Need to address this and keep star performers in the company."
651,Glassdoor,Great Place to Work with Some Big Challenges,2015-05-14,4.0,Marketing,"I can't wait to get to work everyday at Glassdoor. It's an environment full of passion, great energy, and smart people. 

Great cultural leader - the CEO sets the tone of working hard, humbleness, listening to all points of view, and solving problems together. He's created a very special company. 

Exciting business - we're disrupting and making the world a better place everyday - it's a mission that everyone at the company deeply cares about. 

Flexibility - everyone works hard, but there's a lot of tolerance for getting your work done on your own schedule, working outside of office hours, etc. 

Strong Consumer and B2B businesses - great leadership and employees have made this company successful. 

Strong performance - continuous performance above target in most areas makes riding on this train extremely gratifying. 

Scrappy teams that ""find a way"" to get it done.","Despite all the amazing ""pros"", several fairly serious challenges have developed recently due to company's roots and massive growth year over year that need to be addressed. This is a very detailed list, because I care. I love this company and I want it to continue to be great. I would like our leadership to tackle these problems: 

1. We work in a two-sided marketplace, and unfortunately, there's a big divide between the teams as well. The company originated on the consumer side, and most of the founders and people able to influence strategy and product innovation place the priority on the consumer side of the business. This makes it challenging to get resources and product improvements to improve the employer experience with our product. 

2. It's sometimes unclear how and why product decisions get made, and although people can freely give their input to the product team, it's unclear how the work is prioritized, when things will be delivered, etc. It feels like the product roadmap should be born from a clear company and product strategy, but it feels like a handful of people are making the decisions based on their opinions, with lack of serious consideration of input from internal or external customers. Some of this may be due to a lack of product or engineering resources - but it's definitely a struggle to get engineering resources on anything outside of what product leaders have planned, which is causing us to ignore many innovative ideas with high revenue potential. 

3. We're unfortunately developing a culture where you have to work hard to get resources because so many resources are cross-functional. The cross functional resources aren't working, because individuals make decisions on what they are going to work on rather than those decisions being made based on a clear strategy from the top. 

4. We need to drink our own champagne when it comes to our culture. In the time I've been at the company, there's been little mention of our culture. We have amazing values stemming from our CEO,  but we need to take advantage of those and get everyone on board - especially some of our top leaders who aren't always behaving in ways that align with the core cultural values that Robert believes in for the company. 

5. Our strategy from the top is very detailed on the consumer side, but it often feels like our employer business strategy is a line item. I'd like to see everyone in senior management put as much thought into the employer strategy and take the initiative to get to know that business and its customers much better. 

6. When entering new businesses or launching new products, we often don't put the strategic horsepower, resources, or dollars behind them. High expectations are set for revenue without the supporting resources or plan, creating a situation where it's difficult to deliver and teams continuously feel like their failing until the product is developed to the point where it provides true value. I'd like to see us define what will make a product and go-to-market strategy successful and get a significant portion of that done before we hold people to revenue targets."
652,Glassdoor,Young. Gifted. Positive.,2015-05-12,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Summary

More than any company I've ever worked for, Glassdoor practices what it preaches when it comes to the art of organizational transparency. For example, everyone has a say when it comes to new hires (a first in my career), excellent work is publicly acknowledged and management openly discusses results, company changes and the future on a regular basis in all-hands meetings. Glassdoor also boasts the youngest worker demographic of any tech company I’ve worked for, which makes it an energetic, fresh, positive, fast-paced, “Let’s try this!” environment.

Detailed Pros

-Supportive—B2B managers and colleagues have your back, let you know when you’ve done a good job, single you out for love in team meetings
-Fast growing and open—management honest about future of company, quarterly results
-Hiring process—taken very seriously, everyone on team has a say, vote and stake in decision
-Smart, bright people—few, if any weak links, which makes B2B run like a Ferrari
-Great business model and mission—helping employers make great hires makes you feel good
-Open floor plan—conducive to collaboration, quick brainstorms, getting things done fast
-Generational—youngish worker demographic comes with less professional baggage and hang-ups, less “We used to do it this way at XYZ company” attitude
-Training—new hires go through serious onboarding
-Dog friendly environment—reduces daily stress, helps lighten things up
-Great benefits—unlimited PTO, catered lunches, gym, team outings","-B2B/B2C divide—sometimes feels like two separate companies under one roof
-Open floor plan—no privacy, often leads to cacophony, hectic environment
-Sales territories—constantly changing, moving targets lead to churn in Sales, disrupting Marketing sales enablement efforts
-Dog friendly environment—often a distraction to business at hand
-Food—more healthy snacks would be appreciated
-Generational—youngish worker demographic can turn office into free-wheeling party"

I've never worked at a better company!","The biggest con for me is the low salaries - 20% or more below market standard. I've asked quite a few times to increase my salary to the market level listed on Glassdoor. There are also many strong personalities leading to high expectations, strong opinions, and a nothing is ever enough mentality."

I feel confident this organization is taking all the precautionary measures to ensure a successful and sustainable business operation.,"Streamlining communication is a challenge in any growing organization. The smaller the organization, the more everyone feels included in the day to day decisions occurring around them. As a company scales, a lot needs to be done and it needs to be done quickly. Communication can get lost in translation, or worse yet, lost in cyber space. To maintain the transparent foundation this company was built on, effective communication will be key."

Added to that, we don't have  free catered lunches, onsite gym, unlimited PTO, dogs at work, video games in the office, a nap room, kayaking at the office or an amazing view out the window!!

..In all seriousness this will change over time and we're currently in a trendy part of London but it's not quite Sausalito. For some reason the business simply wont take me seriously when i ask to be relocated to head office!!

UK Benefits are lacking somewhat but I know that's a matter of time before we're on a par with the US."
657,Glassdoor,Amazing Culture,2015-04-27,5.0,Sales Development Representative,Best work culture imaginable. Everyone I work with could be my best friend,Kind of a grind at times
658,Glassdoor,"Challenging, Rewarding and Special Place",2015-04-25,4.0,Marketing,"- Strong vision which is unique, special and passionately communicated by the CEO nearly everyday
- Fantastic office location, working environments, benefits and perks (lunch, gym, beer on tap, ...). Employees are really well looked after.
- Lucky to have coaching and mentorship from both Mariah in HR and Jim Mitchell. These two people really get people, feedback and how to build/scale a culture.
- Company is going thru significant growth and beating all goals (we can still do better!). We're disrupting a BIG recruiting market and every day feels like we're moving closer towards owning the market and our competition.
- Lots of love and goodwill from customers and the market in general, people really want Glassdoor to succeed and bring a fresh dynamic to the market.
- Incredibly smart leadership team that makes decisions based on data and metrics vs. emotion. This can be a double edged sword because of the detail and depth of analysis but its the right thing to do for the business.
- Lack of egos and this starts with the CEO. I've seen egos destroy company culture in previous companies but at Glassdoor everyone is down to earth, approachable, humble and pretty passionate about doing the right thing.
- Flexible working hours. I wouldn't say amazing work/life balance but Glassdoor does let employees work and play when they need to. If the work gets done employees have freedom to leave early, take PTO and be flexible in when they work.
- I love the young hustling scrappy culture across the company. Its great to see this across all teams who clearly want to make a difference.","- The relationship between B2C and B2B feels like its drifting apart and becoming ever-more silo'd. Doesn't feel like we have common goals which align and unite the two sides of the business so that we're both successful. You can't have one without the other and both need to appreciate that so that we work together to make everyone successful.
- Making a startup successful is not easy, most don't make it. The only constant in a startup is change and quickly figuring out what works and what doesn't so you can improve. I feel this needs to be better communicated as there is often lots of unnecessary complaints and moaning about change. Our company is founded on transparency and feedback, everyone should learn to give and receive it in a constructive way so that we move forward together and avoid the toxic passive aggressive comments.
- Car Park shouldn't be empty at 4:45pm on a Thursday evening. Not quite sure what is going on. I'm all for work/life balance but this is a startup environment where everything counts. We can't have certain teams working flat out and grafting with others leaving early, it just doesn't feel right. Signing up for a startup is about making an impact, working hard and achieving things that the competition couldn't dream about achieving."

660,Glassdoor,Lead Web Developer,2015-04-21,5.0,Lead Web Developer,"Great management, great people, friendly, challenging, awesome food, views are amazing and fun running trails!","Slight commute, but not too bad. Snacks can be healthier."
661,Glassdoor,Sales Development Representative,2015-04-21,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Glassdoor is by far, the best place I've had the honor of working.  They set the bar the high but give you all the tools to succeed.  For an entry-level sales position, the training is top-notch, your coworkers are unbelievably supportive, and you get to have some of the best managers around.  There's no grey area about your duties and responsibilities.  In this role, you really get out what you put in, which is awesome.

The executives really drive home the underlying theme of ""transparency"" here.  The CEO, Robert Hohman, eats lunch with everyone and is one of the most amiable people I've met.  If he doesn't recognize you, he will approach you, introduce himself, and ask you his name.  That's hard to beat.

Bottom line, you get to start and end each day feeling proud of the work you do here.","There is a serious learning curve here so this job isn't for the lighthearted.  They expect you to work HARD and kick butt at your job.  Work load definitely fluctuates, but its sales."
662,Glassdoor,Account Manager,2015-04-10,5.0,Account Manager,"I have been at Glassdoor for 3 months and though I know I'm still in my honeymoon phase, I just want to say that I am LOVING working here. The culture is the best I have ever seen in any company. The sales team is strongly bonded and genuinely enjoy hanging out with each other. We support each other's challenges and cheer on each other's victories. All in all, I am looking forward to going to work every day.","The location is a bit tough- mill valley is not super accessible for everyone. There is some tension around structure of quotas and territories, which are being addressed."
663,Glassdoor,"Good coworkers, long-ish commute",2015-03-27,3.0,,The people employed by the company are selected for positivity and competence. The building is aesthetically pleasing.,"Location is somewhat out of the way. While beautiful, the commute from the city might require getting used to."
664,Glassdoor,I continue to fall deeper in love with Glassdoor everyday,2015-03-12,5.0,Sales Manager,"I've been working here for 3 years now, and I seriously love coming into work more and more everyday. I am confident in the direction that the company is going, I love the leadership, the ability to make an impact, and the impact that our product is making in the world! It feels like we are making a huge difference in the lives of jobseekers - and that is AWESOME.","Some growing pains - communication is getting harder, with all the new people it has been tough to navigate the org at large. I feel like there are certain things that we have to rush to finish, and then nothing happens with it! Sometimes different parts of the company are working on similar problems, but not cross referencing each other to align their goals. The pay could also be better."
665,Glassdoor,Who gets excited to come to work? ME!,2015-02-13,5.0,Account Manager,"Glassdoor knows how to hire quality, hard-working, smart people. It is a strange feeling to get excited to come to work- something I have not experienced in the past. My teammates have become some very close friends- friends who challenge me every single day. I can't say enough about the environment and community that has been created at Glassdoor. It is a pretty amazing place to be and feel lucky every day.","As we grow rapidly, maintaining a company-wide culture is seemingly more and more difficult to maintain. Although each department has their own culture locked down, different departments rarely inter-mingle. I think it is important for Sales to interact with the Engineering for example, or for PR to interact with the CSM/TPM teams, etc- but this doesn't happen often."
666,Glassdoor,Good and not-so-good place to work,2015-02-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Glassdoor is an amazing company - the values they hold and the things they do for both businesses and individuals are really something incredible.  You'll notice that people here truly believe in what we're working for and that makes for motivated, intelligent, and creative workers.  You'll find that on every level - C-suite, manager, or anyone else - that everyone loves what we do.  To find that passion is rare and something to truly hold onto.  

And of course with every tech company, we have amazing perks - catered lunch, snacks, work from home option, stock options, gym.","The biggest challenge here is middle management.  I understand that at such rapid growth at a relatively young tech company, we're bound to promote within - but this can be a huge huge problem if such an individual is not qualified to do so. Because we're filled with such talented and smart people, we tend to be a pretty competitive arena.  And while that's something that can be motivating for people, it can also cause middle management and new managers to always strive to compete with the people they're managing.  This isn't right and doesn't foster an environment where individuals can grow - manager and those under.  

We need a better promotion and HR review cycles/processes.  There are a lot of new managers being promoted that really shouldn't be - just because they excel at their job doesn't mean they're entitled to be a manager.  A good manager should be one that not only excels, but can connect, motivate, and encourage their team members - and do that wholeheartedly.  Some departments - like mine - are seeing managers push down those who have ideas, want more, or just want to know what's going on within the team for reasons that seem like they want to keep their status known. 

I love Glassdoor and what we stand for, but seeing my growth stunted by my own supervisor is making me question if we're losing sight of our culture. We pride ourselves in providing a safe environment for workers to have ideas, to be heard, and to learn - but if we allow individuals to become managers who DON'T truly uphold this value ... then we aren't practicing what we preach."
667,Glassdoor,SAE Hunters Beware!  Sales Territories are horribly unbalanced,2015-02-04,2.0,Senior Account Executive,"- Great company culture. There are a lot of really cool, smart people. 
- Lots of perks: catered lunch, plenty of unhealthy snacks, video games, ping pong, a fitness facility, dog friendly..
- The company is doing very well and is growing like crazy. 
- The commute is only about 20 minutes from San Francisco and there is plenty of parking. 
- Lots of valuable sales training. 
- Beautiful location","The sales territories at the SAE  level are horribly unbalanced. To put this into perspective, only two reps at the SAE tier hit their quota last year. TWO. Those two reps represented New York City and San Francisco. These are by far the best sales territories at Glassdoor, as they are not only densely populated areas, but there is a high level of competition for talent. There is also strong awareness of Glassdoor and Glassdoor employer solutions. While Glassdoor is rapidly growing, many employers, especially those in the middle of the country, have no idea who Glassdoor is, let alone how Glassdoor works with employers. Many employers simply know Glassdoor as, ""that place where people can complain about our company"". As a senior account executive representing these territories, that is a huge challenge. You are less of a senior account executive and more of a new market developer. Your meetings resemble more of a free webinar than a sales meeting. And when it comes time to make a proposal, good luck. Employers who just recently learned who you are and what you do are not likely to move-forward with a big dollar partnership. Most don't even have the budget for it. Get very used to hearing, ""maybe next year"". 

Now, to be ""fair and balanced"" as we say, leadership has FINALLY acknowledged the fact there is unbalance with territories, and at the beginning of this year, they did make a few adjustments. For many reps however, this was too little, too late. We were held to the exact same standards as reps with NYC and San Francisco, and many reps lost their jobs as a result of not hitting their numbers. This is really unfortunate because there are a TON of good sales professionals at Glassdoor. 

My advice: If you decide to accept a position as an ""SAE Hunter"", tell them that you want a fair and balanced territory - anything on the West Coast, or Northeast is good. Minnesota, Chicago, and Denver are also pretty good. If they try to give you exclusively accounts in the South or Mid-West, run far away. You will beat your head against the wall for as long as you can until they fire you for not hitting your numbers. I don't care how good of a sales rep you think you are, you will try hard and you will fail. 

A few other things to note: 

- The sales floor is incredibly loud and chaotic, especially with so many dogs in the office. Be prepared for this. Buy good headphone and use the conference rooms and phone booths. You don't want to jeopardize a good meeting because of this. 

- Take your vitamins. The sales floor is like working at a hospital. Someone is always sick which means that everyone is always sick. 

- The office is awesome, but it's super isolated. There isn't many places to get lunch or go to happy hour. Plus, running a quick errand is pretty much impossible. 

- Make sure you go outside. Too many days I would come-in in the mornings, and not go outside until after it was dark. This is bad for your mental and physical health. Sausalito is a beautiful area, so be sure and take a walk with a co-worker so you can complain about your territory or sales manager :)"
668,Glassdoor,Honeymoon is definitely NOT over!,2015-01-11,4.0,Senior Account Executive,"I come to work inspired every day by the people and the product. In addition, everyone is treated like an adult...get your work done, and no one cares if you've taken time to go to the gym or run some errands. It is incredibly exciting to be a part of a team that is helping to increase transparency in the employment world.","They really need to figure out a fair distribution of territories as it's clear that some people have a much better opportunity than others to succeed. They are working on this, and I'm hopeful that it will be more evenly distributed for everyone going forward."
669,Glassdoor,"Special, special place...",2015-01-09,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"I've worked here for some time now and I really appreciate all that Glassdoor has done for me. They have provided me with extensive training, were patient and fully supportive with my development, and have a genuine interest in my progression. The personal growth I've made in the past months is truly incredible and all the credit goes to the Management team at Glassdoor. They have given me skills to pay the bills!! And the culture.... BOMB.com","The job is very demanding with high expectations and big quota. Getting along with management is important because being a politician bodes well in the office. But realistically these are issues that you will find in any and every tech company. I hate to make Glassdoor sound perfect, but it truly is a great place to work and is a special thing to be apart of."
670,Glassdoor,Great Start!!,2015-01-06,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"This review is after my first month at GD. 

- Great people
- Smart coworkers
- Great learning experience
- I have got to do meaningful contribution in my first week itself.","- Commute is long. But its not so much of a problem for me.
- Still need to improve some aspects of continuous integration and delivery. But the plans are in place."
671,Glassdoor,Great Company,2014-12-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexible hours, great lunch food, free snacks in the kitchen, good people.",HR. Anything that has to do HR/payroll makes me cringe. Very slow process and always unreachable.

It's a great feeling coming to work knowing you are making a difference in the world. I love the people here, I know I am working with the best in the industry. They are intelligent, supportive, and incredibly fun. We have an amazing culture and there is a huge opportunity for upward mobility. The product is awesome, it's constantly evolving to progress in a positive direction. The training program sets you up for success and our managers are dedicated to helping us improve our process and coach us in the right direction. Some of the perks include a gym on site, free snacks, lunches, and unlimited PTO! Glassdoor is a very special place, it's the best move I've ever made!",Sometimes the vegetarian lunches run out quickly.
673,Glassdoor,Absolutely Amazing,2014-12-18,5.0,Enterprise Sales Account Executive,"Hands down the most fun place I have worked.  The entire organization, from product, to engineering, sales, to C Suite are fantastic.  It is exciting to be part of an organization where everyone truly believes in what we do.","Typical hyper growth startup challenges.  Territories shifting, policies changing etc.  However, these challenges, if you can call them that, are dwarfed by how great it is to work with such a wonderful group of people."
674,Glassdoor,Great start for a sales career!,2014-12-17,4.0,Account Executive,"Amazing company culture, they genuinely care about the whole team and encourage collaboration. There was also a good amount of training right after being hired and then weekly as well.","The sales organization has grown quickly in 2014, however, they still have not adjusted for a distribution of accounts with appropriate quotas to represent the amount of opportunity in each area."
675,Glassdoor,Glassdoor is one of the coolest companies ever! By far the best job experience I've ever had.,2014-11-25,5.0,,"Healthy/ productive environment for everyone. Great pay and the people are wonderful. If you're one to prove yourself, there is great opportunities for advancement with the company.","Hard work is definitely necessary because the company is in a state of growth. It's hard to keep up at times, the demand is so high."
676,Glassdoor,Best Job I've Ever Had,2014-11-19,5.0,Public Relations,"This company is truly doing something to make the world a better place and I'm honored to be contributing to the mission of helping people everywhere find jobs and companies they love. 

Aside from all the awesome perks like a gym, catered lunch, unlimited vacation and the ability to bring my dog every day, I just love being at Glassdoor. I'm consistently in awe of the good ideas, smart people and a lovable culture we have here. 

One program I'm particularly impressed with is the extensive leadership training everyone goes through. It teaches us how to successfully communicate with one another. I've implemented learnings from this training in to other elements of my life and it's tremendously valuable.","The performance review process is wanting. After a performance review, regardless of whether or not it was positive, I always feel worse about my job. Compensation and titles are also a problem, based on recent new hires I know I would have a higher salary and title if I were recruited here recently or to a different team. 

There are two companies within Glassdoor: the B2C side (the darling) and the B2B side (the one with a bit of a rude culture problem)."
677,Glassdoor,"Great community, working through growing pains",2014-11-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Benefits are great. Unlimited PTO means that you can have a real work-life balance. The people are generally very friendly and there is a good sense of community.,Teams tend to work in silos which leads to miscommunication and makes it hard to get simple things done. The company is growing quickly and process hasn't completely caught up.
678,Glassdoor,Great place,2014-10-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Get to work from home, good schedule",same old same old
679,Glassdoor,SDR role is a great entry into a sales career,2014-10-26,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Everyone here truly enjoys coming to work every day. I get to work with some of the smartest and most innovative people I have ever met. Very collaborative work environment, beautiful office and great company culture. There is an on site fitness trainer, workout classes, and gym.  Generous amounts of food, free lunches, coffee & snacks every day. Lots of cute doggies around the office. People dress very casual in whatever is comfortable. Lots of fun company events and outings for people to bond. The company is fairly generous with supplies & technology for employees. It is an exciting time to join the company as we are expanding internationally & growing rapidly!

Glassdoor is an industry leader in employer branding, which is a new and developing area for the recruiting industry. Sales team is selling something that we can feel good about, since it aligns with our mission. Accomplishments are recognized by teams, by the sales department, and at a company-wide level. The CEO even comes and hugs sales reps. Managers truly listens to employees and are always working to improve processes or solve problems. There is a lot of very hands-on training, so there is tremendous room for personal growth and skill development. 

The marketing team does killer campaigns to keep a healthy flow of inbound leads coming to the sales team. New SDRs get to work warm inbound leads, so you are usually cold calling people with some knowledge, interest or familiarity of Glassdoor. Tenured SDRs work outbound leads, which is great training on prospecting, getting to decision makers and navigating an organization. There are clear goals & room for growth. SDRs are promoted into Account Executive/Account Management roles. Quota is realistic and everyone is always willing to help others learn or grow. The team has clear rules of engagement that prevent overlap and promote fairness.","There is constant change as part of a growing company, which can lead to some over-communication. BCC and reply-all feature needs to be used less in email threads. Salesforce needs to be cleaned up since there is a lot of bad data. Some teams seem understaffed for the work load (such as IT and sales ops). 

The commute is kind of a pain unless you live in Marin, which most people don't. Right now, the company only compensates for people who commute via bus, but most people drive independently and pay a lot for bridge tolls. Not a lot of healthy food or options for people with allergies/dietary restrictions. Feels like some people are working 24/7 although everyone has different perceptions of work/life balance. 

Inbound SDRs are highly dependent on marketing campaigns, so any lulls in marketing make it harder to hit numbers. Some of the sales reps don't understand how to work with SDRs and should communicate or show more appreciation for our hard work. The office is a little crowded as the company is growing & the sales floor can get a little noisy."
680,Glassdoor,"Not good, not terrible, change is needed",2014-10-23,2.0,Sales,"Cool perks like a good office location, fun employees, free lunches and nice gym equipment and lockers",They mistakes perks for culture. There's no real career path or progression and it's become much too political. The people who shout the loudest get all the praise. I also feel like we're losing focus.
681,Glassdoor,What an amazing place to work,2014-10-22,5.0,Director,"I joined Glassdoor recently and I am so glad I did. Everything and everyone is awesome here. Very very smart and fun people to work with. They really know how to treat their employees. Lots of perks and benefits but you are expected to be great at your work which is awesome. Oh and wait, did I say that the location rocks!","I haven't seen any so far. I guess its very open environment so if you are sensitive to noise, this might be an issue for some."
682,Glassdoor,Excited to come to work every day - even after 9 months,2014-10-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Every day is a learning experience, full of surprises and growing pains, forcing employees to learn from and teach each other. This may be a con to some, but to someone like me who enjoys a challenge and having a fast-paced job, it's a definite pro. 

Other perks: selling a product you believe in, flexible hours, unlimited PTO, catered lunch, and the fact that bring-your-dog-to-work day is every day",My cons are more wishes and first world problems than they are actual cons. I wish we had company buses and skill set building opportunities (ex/ guest speakers or Toastmasters). I think this second point is especially something we could all only benefit from.
683,Glassdoor,Fast paced company with exponential growth!,2014-10-20,5.0,Enterprise Sales Representative,"Glassdoor has been doubling every year in employee size, number of clients, and revenue since I started back in 2012.  It's exciting company and culture to a part of.  With this amount of growth, there's a lot of opportunity to stand out as a leader if you're a top performer.  This has lead to people taking advantage of great upward mobility and career growth.","If you're not self-motivated or resourceful enough to figure how to keep your head above water or get ahead, you could get lost in the shuffle.  That being said, Glassdoor gives everyone more than a fair chance not only survive here, but take leaps and bounds."

Every training we were required to go to was pretty much a waste of time. No company wants to know how long you've been in business, how many awards you've won nor do they want to hear about tons of stats you've made up. They want to tell you their problems and hear how your product can solve them. 

Marketing wants you to talk the clients' ear off. Stop. Your style does not work."

The transparency is present.  
Growth potential is certainly available for those that seek it or want it, especially with the rate at which we are growing as a company.  Jobs, titles, divisions are present now that may not have been 3 or 6 months ago and will continue to evolve as we are rapidly growing and adjusting for growth.
Communication is certainly a priority and constantly being worked on.  
The benefits out-surpass any place I have worked before or have been involved with.
Additional training/education is available by simply requesting it","Being remote from the Corporate office has, at times, been a challenge from a communication standpoint and at times a disconnect.
Orientation processes for remote folks/locations should be considered as much as the process that is present for the corporate office - this is a definite sore point.
Scheduling of company-wide meetings needs to also take into account time zone differences for the availability of those attending.  Alternately secured video recording should be made and available for those who cannot attend and would like to 'see what they missed""."

Meritocracy. Put in good, hard, smart work and you will be rewarded. Sales leadership has worked toward creating opportunities for career growth & financial success across all levels. Promotions happen often & there is a constant focus on learning and development. Constant collaboration among reps is a beautiful thing.
Our mission is clear and we eat our own cooking. Everyone is focused on making Glassdoor the best place to help employers find the best talent and job seekers find jobs they love -- and we love where we work too.","Comp plans aren't always clear. With our growth plan, it can feel like there are hiring quotas. We're attracting amazing talent, but it seems some decisions are made in haste. 
Be ready for and open to change - all the time. 
Dogs in the office and an open floor plan can make for a crazy environment. A steep investment in noise canceling headphones is needed to maintain sanity on the sales floor (some of the dogs are awfully cute though).

If you can get into this company, you not only were an all-star at your last company, but you are likely someone that I would want to hang out with on the weekends.  There is zero ego here and everyone has an understanding that as there is no room for lone wolves at this company.  Team culture, CEO cares.",Bridge toll is not covered.  But free lunch kinda offsets it.  Hiring a lot from the outside.  Make sure you don't neglect the AE's that want to move up
701,Glassdoor,Great company. Great Culture. Great sense of community.,2014-06-10,5.0,,"Glassdoor's mission is to help people people find a job they love and the company fully encompasses that mission inside it's own glass doors. The benefits are phenomenal, the food is yummy, and the people here really care about each other.",The commute is a big one. The new building is great but there are some little things that need to be worked out.
702,Glassdoor,Best job ever!,2014-06-05,5.0,Public Relations,"I love my job, and I love helping others find jobs they love. The culture at Glassdoor is unlike anywhere else I've worked, and it all trickles down from leadership and managers. Glassdoor is an open, transparent and supportive environment, which I truly value. The thing I like most about working here is the fact that I believe in Glassdoor's mission and vision, and I know my co-workers do too. My colleagues are super smart and passionate, and it's infectious.

Located in beautiful, sunny Sausalito, I enjoy riding my bike to work, eating on our deck overlooking the Bay at lunch and taking free yoga classes outside. Work/life balance is good with flexible scheduling and ability to work from home when you want or need to. We have an unlimited vacation policy, and whenever I'm on vacation, I'm encouraged to actually be on vacation - no checking emails or working!

The benefits and perks are wonderful with free lunch daily (salads, sandwiches, soup, daily hot dishes), a beautiful gym with high-end equipment and locker room, game room, beer on tap, Philz coffee, kayaks, standing desks, dog friendly (shoutout to Ruby!), etc. We have good healthcare, vision, dental and commuter benefits (for people that take public transportation) as well. Salary, bonuses and stock options are fair.

It really is the best job I've ever had, and I enjoy coming to work every day.","The biggest downside of working at Glassdoor is the commute (if you live in SF or beyond). Riding/driving over the Golden Gate Bridge every day has its perks so it isn't all bad, but if I could change anything I would move the entire Glassdoor campus to San Francisco. 

Communication between departments can improve (and is improving!), especially as we continue to grow.

Though commuter benefits are awesome, I'd love to see a bike commuter benefit program put into place."
703,Glassdoor,I really enjoy my job,2014-06-05,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working for a company that truly cares about the employees is priceless. Not only does Glassdoor care about us, but the company culture is one of fun and a great atmosphere. Meetings are constructive with great feedaback",There is a lot to be done and not always enough people to do it. Demanding work schedule and challenging opportunities make have a short staffed organization hard to work for in the future I hope they correct this too.
704,Glassdoor,A company that cares,2014-06-01,5.0,Technical Project Manager,"- Flexible working hours (not a typical 9-5 job)
- Culture fit is a necessity -- everyone here is friendly and open
- Very lateral organization -- while there is a hierarchy, communicating ideas and getting resources isn't too much of a struggle
- Open door policy","- Better communication between different departments i.e. engineering x sales 
- While unlimited PTO is great, the longer you have been on the job, the harder it is to take time off -- not sure if this falls on the company but it is something management should be aware of"
705,Glassdoor,A great place to work,2014-05-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very open culture
Great office with great perks - unlimited vacation, free lunch, recreation room, kayaks
Flexible hours/Work from home if necessary
Feel like I always know what is going on with the company, no secrets","Communication between teams is sometimes difficult
Career path isn't always super clear
Could use more traning, which I think is getting a lot better with our new hires"
706,Glassdoor,Best company,2014-05-29,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Glassdoor has an amazing culture. The overall energy in the company is encouraging, uplifting and rewarding. Left alone the amazing office, game room, gym, food, yoga, poker nights and all those perks. I love working here. Best company I worked at.",Nothing comes in mind so I guess none so far
707,Glassdoor,Account Executive,2014-05-29,5.0,Account Executive,"I literally could not say enough praise about this company so far. Management truly knows what they are doing. They are encouraging to you as an individual and create an environment of collaboration amongst the team. Upper management has been able to find the perfect balance between a motivating and relaxed environment. All expectations are attainable, and also rooted in data.","I was initially apprehensive about the commute; but working in Sausalito has proven to be a refreshing, and easy break from the fast paced city. I can't imagine working in the Financial District ever again."
708,Glassdoor,Great  opportunity,2014-05-27,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Great place to work , very friendly people.
Lot of potential growth.
They have a great onboarding process for new employees.",Its in the Mill Valley which is not very easy to commute via public transport.
709,Glassdoor,Great Company,2014-05-17,5.0,Account Executive,"Beautiful location, fast growing website, young professionals, fun outings, good management, better food, Molly Stones is across the street, You can see sailboats from the windows...",Typical start-up environment...lots of policy changes and turnover that can lead to unrest.
710,Glassdoor,Living up to its values,2014-04-25,5.0,Account Manager,"I am literally excited to wake up for work every morning! The people here are smart, curious, driven and highly engaging people. They are people that I want to hang out with in and out of work.

Glassdoor does a great job of offering above-average benefits without expecting us to slave away for 12 hours a day. We have a great work/life balance and they encourage that through unlimited PTO, happy hours, flexible working hours, etc.

We are also moving into a brand new office next week which is adding to the excitement!","Managers are simply amazing, but sometimes it would help to be a little less ""hands on"" (i.e. not taking over unless absolutely necessary). There is also a lot of change, but from what I can see it is all for the better.

It would be amazing if our cell phone bills were comped--I am constantly checking emails & even taking work calls on my iPhone. It is my experience that if work is expected on a phone, it should be covered.

It would also be great if there was a commuter shuttle from the city. But these are just ""suggestions"""
711,Glassdoor,Best career move I ever made!,2014-04-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Top down culture - we practice what we preach. CEO sets the tone - lives and breathes our core values which roll downhill.  People matter, integrity, accountability, passion, ownership and leadership!

Benefits - Work life balance, everyone has stock and is rewarded for their accomplishments - whether you are part of a team or individual contributor.  Competitive salary, excellent benefits, lots of perks, free lunch daily, gym, BBQ's, tons of events, team building, dog-friendly office - one big happy family and growing!

Leadership - you are empowered to take risks, think outside the box.  Alignment on vision, strategy - doesn't mean management always agrees, but with exceptional talent, mutual respect, innovation and collaboration - they ultimately lead us toward the best decisions for the customers, company and staff.

Cool new digs!","Tremendous growth since I started (that's the good part), but change management can be challenging.  Scaling infrastructure, on-boarding new employees so they are equipped for success, implementing new policies and procedures effectively...people don't like change.  Growing up to play with the big boys means changes that are not always easily adopted."
712,Glassdoor,I feel really lucky to work here.,2014-04-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,high quality leadership that is transparent about company vision and strategy; impressive board level involvement; collaborative atmosphere with really great people,"as expected in a fast-paced, high growth environment, there is often a lot to do and not enough people to do it"
713,Glassdoor,Flexible hours and great work life balance!,2014-04-04,5.0,Lead Generation Associate,"Glassdoor emphasis on employee satisfaction, so they are very flexible and understanding with schedule changes. You can make your own hours (depending on your projects and goals) and work from home as well. This company truly understands that employees have lives, and they can change your goals if you're going through a difficult time in your life, or give you more responsibilities if you ask for them. If you show them you're capable, a hard worker, and are invested/passionate about the company, they will have faith in your abilities. Glassdoor is a great company, and they've done an exceptional job with the people they hired and promoted.

Although top level executives tend to be running in and out of meetings all day, they really try and interact with everyone all the time. It's great to see a horizontal structure where if you want to talk to a VP, Exec, C-Level, etc, employee, they are all willing, but most importantly WANTING to hear you out.","Although everyone is very open and nice, it's hard to form some connections with people due to the separation of locations. I'm sure once we move into our new building, it will foster a more open atmosphere where people will engage more."
714,Glassdoor,What a Mess,2014-04-03,1.0,Prefer Not to Say,The idea behind the company,Dysfunction everywhere.  The company is not organized.  Lots of ego.
715,Glassdoor,Inspiring to be part of a company that all job seekers love,2014-03-21,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,The #1 reason glassdoor is so great is because our mission is helping people everyone find the job they love.  This is a big goal and will take many years to clearly become the best recruitment company in the world - so it's fun to have this exciting work ahead of us for years to come.  In the short term - the pay is great & the culture is really fun - a strong IPO looks very probably given the history of our leadership and success of companies like TripAdvisor.,Typical startup issues - a lot of change but our senior leadership is good to guide us thru it all.  Robert & Roop are amazing.
716,Glassdoor,"Motivated, professional people all working together to help people everywhere find the jobs and companies they love!",2014-03-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I love my job. It's such a pleasure coming to work for a company that actually acknowledges and rewards your strengths and encourages you to grow. Every single day I'm learning something new. There's a real spirit of mentorship and teamwork that comes naturally when everyone in the room is after the same overall goal. There's great collaboration between departments, with each department bringing their perspective to the table (and each department is acknowledged for their contributions). My boss, in particular, is the BEST boss I've ever had-- she is friendly, thoroughly knowledgeable, straight-forward, positive, and she goes to bat for me and other members of her team on a regular basis.","Growing pains... we are running out of space, but this is only a minor con since we have a new building being prepped right now. Once we complete the move, we'll have plenty of space and great new digs."
717,Glassdoor,A company is just a collection of idea and people,2014-03-19,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I have been at Glassdoor only for 6 months now.  From the moment I interviewed, to this very moment, I have been thrilled to be here.  Glassdoor has a collection of wonderful people with wonderful ideas.  Our goal is to help people to find the job they love, and as work is such a critical part of our lives, it is so important to be in an environment you love.  I love being at Glassdoor.  I have worked in many places over the years.  I feel like I am home now with Glassdoor.","Every company has cons, we live in an imperfect world.  Nothing of significance here."

There's lots to do and the learning curve is high, but great people and environment makes it ""fun!""

One of the few companies that value their IT Department and Support Staff.","I don't see anything wrong with compensation package and Unlimited PTO may not be all it's cracked up to be; however, this is the first Tech Company that I have been to that's offering it.  Heck, why do I need so much vacation when my job is worth going to everyday?"
719,Glassdoor,Great company full of dedicated employees,2014-03-17,5.0,Content Management Associate,"Great company being led by an extremely talented Executive team. You immediately feel you are part of the Glassdoor family.  You work hard because you feel connected to its success and believe in the service it provides.  Employees work many hours, not because it is expected, but because you feel you are the reason why it has experienced the amazing success it has.  The CEO makes it very clear that Glassdoor is OUR company and and we are an integral part of its success going forward. The benefits are fantastic.  PTO adds up to more than 3 weeks per year including holidays.  Health, vision,and dental insurance are of no cost to you and my spouse is only an additional $50 per month.  There are many fun team building events and you are given one paid day each quarter for community service.","We are growing and with growth there are growing pains.  Content exploded in the past few months and it took longer than it should have to get the help we needed to get it under control. People were given new important tasks to complete during this growth period while the vein of our existence, content, seemed to be drowning.  The good news is it was addressed and we are back swimming strongly."
720,Glassdoor,Fun and challenging place to work,2014-03-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Disruptive technology/community that is changing the way users research and search for jobs.
- Proven leadership team with strong background and no egos.
- Culture and work environment is refreshing. Employees are really taken care of.","- Lack of meeting rooms and desk space, the new office move couldn't come soon enough.
- Sales processes need tightening up
- Vision & Product roadmap not quite clear enough"
721,Glassdoor,Start up on the rise...,2014-03-14,5.0,Account Executive,"The training is extremely informative and the people in every department are open to give you assistance on any questions that you might have.  
I liked the fact that they give you so much training, but allow you to go off and learn from some of your mistakes.  It's a great way to learn and perfect your pitch on our sales approach.
Lots of employee events to keep the team unified.  Also, Glassdoor has a ton of resources for you to use to help deliver the best demos and land more deals.","Since the company is growing so quickly, space is fairly limited.  There are a lot of people in very tight spaces for the time being.
Also, a lot of the information in the SalesForces tool is out of date, so you will spend some time updating your territory to make sure that you are getting in front of the right people."
722,Glassdoor,Talented people all on a clear mission and having fun on the way,2014-03-14,5.0,Senior PR Manager,"Glassdoor is unique - certainly in my experience. There is a tangible vibe around the office where you can feel that something big is happening here. We are disrupting the jobs industry and everyone is 100% behind the mission to help people everywhere find jobs they love. 
One of the great things is that most people, if not everyone, has a stake in the company, therefore we all treat it like 'our' company.

I have joined at a really exciting time as we are expanding internationally and I'm proud to be a part of that. We are still a small enough company to all to get together in one large room, which I love.
The perks are great and the social side of work is excellent. When I joined, my induction was the best that i have ever had in any company. Everyone is friendly, helpful, mutually supportive, talented and real experts in their field whatever that may be. 
My team is amazing and I know exactly what my goals are, what is expected of me, and how my work fits into the overall Glassdoor effort. Senior management are very talented, transparent and approachable. 
Glassdoor far exceeds my expectations for what I thought a job could be like.","There are no real cons other than the fact that I am currently the only person at Glassdoor outside of the U.S. and therefore have no colleagues to sit alongside, but I know that this will change really quickly. The other downside to not being in the U.S. is that my benefits package is not quite the same, but, similarly, I expect that to change, so I am not worried."
723,Glassdoor,The absolute BEST!,2014-03-14,5.0,Account Executive,"Our CEO, Robert Hohman, is heavily involved with everything. He has a open door policy and is more than willing to help any employee at every tier. As is everyone here, pulling together in unison for the greater success of the company. 

On top of being rewarded for your accomplishments, there are many perks:
- fun company events
- free food and drinks
- training
- etc.

I personally love this place!","Nothing at all, except maybe a smelly dog here and there :)"
724,Glassdoor,Convenient and flexible work,2014-03-14,4.0,Data Associate,"Glassdoor treats its employees well in terms of benefits and schedule flexibility. Getting full insurance and paid days off for part time is pretty nice! I can adjust my schedule easily to fit with the rest of my life. I work from home and that has its positive and negative aspects, as any work-from-home job would. This is a company that's growing rapidly and the culture is very young and energized. My co-workers and managers are great","The data work gets very repetitive and sometimes it feels like I'm lost in a world of spreadsheets and internet data.  It often comes down to speed and accuracy of processing, and it's hard to stay passionate about that. Working remotely makes it hard to feel very connected to the company. There's been a lot of reorganization and I've had several managers in the course of a couple years."
725,Glassdoor,People Come First,2014-03-14,5.0,Marketing,"This company drinks its own champagne. Everything Glassdoor puts out there in the world about transparency, building a great culture, providing growth opportunities, and treating employees in a caring and respectful way all holds true inside the company.","It's a fast-paced, evolving environment which might not be for everyone, but I love it!"
726,Glassdoor,It's a great time to be a part of this company...,2014-03-14,5.0,Account Executive,"This is probably the first job I've had where I don't just consider it a place that I have to go every day to make money. I look forward to the people, the environment, and most of all the work itself. We're growing rapidly, and I feel like I got in at the right time to really make an impact and grow our business.

The transparency isn't just a gimmick. The senior leadership here understands what it takes to run an effective organization, and despite growing pains that are a part of any rapidly expanding company, they're still as open with us as any exec team possibly could be.","The biggest challenge at this point is going to be maintaining the company's culture as we on-board more and more people. As long as we stick to our core principles of transparency and inclusion, we should be fine."
727,Glassdoor,"My experience at Glassdoor has been both challenging and rewarding; I have the chance to excel, lead and grow!",2014-03-14,5.0,,Smart people doing good things with state-of-the art technology. Growing in a competitive space with the goal of dominating the space. Working in a beautiful location. Glassdoor is fun!,Commuting to a good job is still commuting. Having co-workers crammed into workstations because we're growing fast is challenging. Not having perfect alignment in management can create tension which doesn't need to exist.
728,Glassdoor,Best job ever,2014-03-14,5.0,Account Executive,"I feel like I learn something new every day and am constantly improving.  The senior management is very accessible and open to feedback.  Our solutions provide great results for the companies that we work with - so you can take a lot of pride in what you are doing and build really awesome relationships with your clients.  It's a very collaborative environment where people drop what they're doing to help you and make sure you have all the tools you need to be successful.  

I think we do a really great job practicing what we preach and being transparent within our own organization.  Every employee at Glassdoor is instrumental to the success of the company and management does a great job to show people that they are appreciated.  I really love this company.","Because of the rapid growth within the sales team, there have been a lot of territory changes recently. It can definitely be frustrating when you have to let go of an opportunity.  But that does go both ways, so for every deal you have to give up.....you typically get one back.  

The move to our new building has been delayed a few times and we are getting pretty packed within our current space.  It's a start up and sometimes you have to be scrappy, but it's hard to find a quiet place to place to think."
729,Glassdoor,"exciting growth with intelligent, engaged, dedicated people",2014-03-13,5.0,Technical Project Manager,"great teamwork. the real, visible prospects of growth mean that we (i) are (am) motivated to give it my all at glassdoor. i am inspired to perform well, feel that my efforts are respected, appreciated, and noticed, and i would like to spend a significant chunk of my career here.

(or at least the next few years!)

the growth opportunities also means that the types of politics that are present in any work / office environment are not present here. what i mean is, sometimes in a place where morale is low, or opportunities are limited, you can see people turn on one another to get ahead, or simply to survive.

at glassdoor, that is not an issue, and so we can turn our efforts towards helping one another, growing together, and excelling together.","tight space as we wait for our new building to be completed. building permitting issues are slowing us down, and it makes for a little bit of stress.

also, this selling point for new hires is a bit farther away than it should be... i hear this should have happened in december 2013 of january 2014. its now mid march 2014, and i think we are looking at early summer?

not the fault of glassdoor management, perhaps, but once we do relocate (a few miles north), i see the morale (already high) jumping to all new levels of high."
730,Glassdoor,Great career move,2014-03-13,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"The sales culture here is fantastic. Everyone is so supportive of our common goals. With a relatively newer company, the team is well invested in the future. We all care about the guy/girl next to us succeeding and it shows. The compensation is better than what I've received in the past and puts me on track to make great money. Everyone has fun working here from sales to legal to accounting to engineering. I felt very welcomed from day one and the on-boarding process is great for anyone looking to join Glassdoor.",A lot of things are still in process or in development. This goes with the territory in any company like this. The sales transition was messy in some cases. Not everyone got a good deal and some did genuinely get the short end of the stick. It was a very necessary change and some reps probably made way more money than they should have last year. This next year will really allow the cream to rise to the top per-se.
731,Glassdoor,"Trifecta - Big Opportunity, Strong Mission AND a Great Culture",2014-03-13,5.0,Senior Vice President,"What is rare about glassdoor is how connected every employee is to our mission. It gives each person tremendous fulfillment that their time here is well spent - we are helping people everywhere find the job they will LOVE. Glassdoor has a big opportunity to disrupt the $100B recruiting market.  Great product with next to no competition.  Lots of energy and enthusiasm.  Still early enough for new employees to have a BIG impact on our future. Strong founding team who are smart, proven and who take the time to get to know the employees. On the path to IPO and beyond.","Depending on where you live in SF Bay Area, it can be hard to get to Sausalito.  Many folks commute from over an hour away.  Of course, once you are there...it is hard to beat the views."
732,Glassdoor,All-around great employer,2014-03-12,5.0,Data Management Associate,"Positive, friendly, intelligent co-workers who are helpful, respectful, and empathetic.  Flexible schedule, can work from home several days a week, great work/life balance.  It's a fast growing company offering a very useful resource with high standards for quality and quantity production.  Interesting research projects which change all the time so it never gets boring!  The working environment at the office is very fun and laid back--we are free to voice our opinions and suggestions anytime.  We are constantly spoiled with free food and drinks :)","A lot of work to do - which is good job security, but I'm glad they're in the process of hiring a few more folks at the Ohio office to process the big data load (which means we are gaining a lot of popularity all over the world!) and maintain our high content moderation percentages."
733,Glassdoor,"Working out the kinks, but still offering impressive opportunities",2014-03-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Glassdoor has a very casual, laid back office environment. Unlimited paid time off, which ensures no one really takes vacation (perception is reality, so this is a positive). If you apply yourself, work hard and can find your own answers, many opportunities for advancement are made available.","Company is rather siloed across departments, making cross-department collaboration very difficult at times. Recent growth seeks to change this, however history has formerly told a different story."
734,Glassdoor,Best place I have ever worked hands down,2014-03-11,5.0,Account Executive,"I actually love coming to work every day! Glassdoor is one of those special companies that you read about, but don't think actually exist. It feels like each one of us has serious ownership in the direction of the company. Here are the best things about Glassdoor:
-Truly world-class people. The smartest, hardest working, best team I have ever been a part of top to bottom. Plus, the people are super fun!
-An awesome mission that we all live by. We want to democratize information about working at companies and we are crushing it. We help people make one of the more important decisions of their lives easier.
-A killer product that tons of people use. When I tell people I work at Glassdoor almost everyone says ""oh cool, I used it in my last job search...""
-A lot of autonomy. This is not a micromanage kind of place. Our sales team culture is: run your business, crush your number, have fun doing it, be a good person.
-Equity. The executives invest in its employees and as a result we are all very invested in the success of the company","We are growing and we are growing fast. I have been here for fewer than 6 months and I have had 2 managers, 3 comp plans, and a whole lot of change. The change is definitely a good thing for our company and for the sales team, but massive change is a fact of life here."
735,Glassdoor,"Great job, great company, huge upside",2014-03-11,5.0,Sales,Glassdoor is a small company with big ideas.  The environment here is extremely collaborative and it seems that all of the people and departments are focused on the common goal of making this the best company possible.  The compensation and benefits are competitive and there is a ton of upside and career growth opportunities.,"Glassdoor has growing pains just like any other startup.  We are moving fast and means that things are not always perfect.  But, if you are looking for a fast-paced, start up environment, this is it."
736,Glassdoor,Good changes are a-comin'!,2014-03-11,5.0,Enterprise Sales Account Executive,"$50M in growth for an international expansion - awesome
48% of people NOW use Glassdoor in their job searching process - awesome
Name recognition ""Glassdoor"" is skyrocketing - awesome
Basically the company is growing like wild fire, which is..... awesome.

In addition, if feels SUPER good to be part of a company who's products actually work! Honestly, I feel 100% confident in selling Glassdoor products, because they have helped every employer I know. And it's great to work for a company where I can come into the office everyday (or work from home), and know that I am helping people everywhere find the jobs and companies they love.","With great growth, comes some pretty big changes. There's been some good and bad changes to the comp structure of the sales team. Things are getting better, but change is of course not easy. 

Communication is also getting much harder across the organization, I'm not always aware what the product teams are working on, or what is coming down the pipeline. Also, finding the right person to speak with about x,y, or z may be hard if you're just starting out here. But at least with Glassdoor we maintain a small org feel, so there are still weekly huddles, and I still feel like I can walk into the CEO's office, and talk to him about anything. That's great."
737,Glassdoor,Best job I've ever had,2014-03-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"From the moment I stepped in the door, I felt like I was home. I come to work every day happy and feel like what I'm doing is actually making a big impact in the company. Micromanaging doesn't exist here. Don't want to name drop a Cheers reference but it literally is the place ""where everybody knows your name"". Awesome company culture, awesome benefits, and you'll learn more in one week then you ever thought possible. Also a great place to make friends if you're new to the city.",High expectations right from the get-go and very fast paced environment. But this is only a con if you are used to slacking.
738,Glassdoor,"Relaxed, Mature, and Fun",2014-03-11,5.0,Senior Data Scientist,It's great to work for a company that is providing real value to the world. It's also great to be working at a place with so much experience. The CEO has been in this rodeo before (and been successful at it) and it shows. He knows what he's doing and the rest of management does too. It's also a family-friendly (and dog-friendly!) environment that respects your life outside of the office.,It's hard to get to from public transportation (i.e. you can't take MUNI or BART to work).
739,Glassdoor,"Enjoyable, Exciting, Busy and Happy",2014-03-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everyone is so friendly and passionate about helping the company. I feel that everyone has an open door policy and wants to help and chat. Even with all the work I have, I never feel like i am alone in it. Fun atmosphere and activities. Great Benefits.","We are in growth mode, which is a positive, but it does mean hard work is necessary. No one is just sitting around, so anyone who is lazy won't be a good fit."
740,Glassdoor,Receptive Management and Supportive Team,2014-03-11,5.0,Business Development/Marketing,"There's quite a few- let's see:

- Expectations are made very clear and there's an ongoing discussion about progress towards goals with a focus on solutions rather than setbacks
- I've rarely encountered any negativity; people are incredibly upbeat and encouraging
- People here work together with a common purpose and are happy to reach out for help or with it- just don't be afraid to ask
- Great transparency about the direction of the company and where your specific team fits into the larger picture
- Even though we are rapidly growing, the people here are always friendly and it feels like a tight-knit community
- The company makes a point to listen to how people feel about the culture here and makes adjustments accordingly
- Hey benefits. . . love these (although some commuter benefits would be nice too)
- No lies about the flexible work schedule; as long as the goals are being met, they don't mind how you get there (no micromanagement shows that they trust their employees enough to treat them like adults)
- Dog friendly office!  Snacks!","Not quite as many here:
- Location is beautiful, but a bit of a trek from the city or the east bay
- Some positions seem to have more room for growth than others and it'd be nice to have more clarity on how to move around from within as well as learning opportunities for those of us interested in continuing in this industry"
741,Glassdoor,Such a great company!,2014-03-11,5.0,Account Manager,"Honestly, I've never been so happy at any other company. I've always wanted to work for a rapidly growing start-up where your work can have a direct impact to a company's bottom line. Glassdoor is the company I've been working for. I believe the CEO and our executive team are leading this company in the right direction, never forgetting why Glassdoor exists in the first place - which is to help everyone find the jobs and companies they love. I often times have a hard time telling my friends how great my company actually is. There's no other place like it. LOVE IT","Sometimes I question whether we are trying to hire people too quickly and we compromise quality. However, management tends to figure out quickly who isn't fitting in well."
742,Glassdoor,I love Glassdoor,2014-03-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free food and snacks and new office will be even better
Great management that is open to feedback
Growing fast so many promotions",many of the cons of a startup is that things are changing fast and someones responsibilities can sometimes be more than they asked for. Some people like that however.
743,Glassdoor,A modern employer,2014-02-08,5.0,Senior Business Development Manager,"Let's me work autonomously and very flexible (as long as I get the job done), everyone at the company have a contagious go-getter spirit!",Being a remote worker in a time zone far away from the head office I miss out on some company briefings (unless I dial in at night)
744,Glassdoor,The pleasure of building something useful.,2013-12-27,5.0,Director of Product,"1) I've worked on a bunch of different consumer web and mobile applications. Glassdoor is the first one where I've had the experience of strangers thanking me for building a great product that made their lives better.  Frequently, I meet new people and tell them that I work here, and they say, ""Wow, cool, I use that. That's such a useful {site / app}. It just helped me {negotiate my salary / prepare for an interview / find a new job / avoid taking a job at a company that would have been bad for me / etc.}"".  

2) It's fast growing and successful, which is exciting. This, combined with the pleasure of building something useful, makes for extremely high morale among the employees.  It makes it fun to come to work every day.

3) I commute by bicycle across the Golden Gate Bridge every day to Sausalito.  It's a short trip, and it's gorgeous. The office is in a really beautiful spot by the water.  There's a really nice deck with a view of the bay and the San Francisco skyline, with a grill and a kegerator full of beer.  There's good quality of life working here.","The down side of fast growth is that we spend a lot of time on hiring and training new employees, which takes time away from ""real"" work.  Also, it's tough trying to get into a rhythm, when we're constantly adding new team members."
745,Glassdoor,"Glassdoor is the perfect work environment for opportunity, growth and great experience!",2013-11-27,5.0,Staff Accountant,"1) Fun atmosphere
2) All the employees are incredibly talented with great personalities!
3) Flexible work schedule
4) The work is very exciting
5) I am surrounded with highly experienced team members that help me grow individually and professionally. My team rocks! My supervisor is teaching me more than I could have imagined. He is always cool, calm and collective- an overall great leader!
6) I work with everyone in the office, the culture is very team-oriented!
7) I love the dog-friendly work environment
8) My team is very supportive and encouraging
9) I could not have asked for a more enjoyable work environment. There is never a dull moment!
10) I enjoy coming into work each day!",The only con is there should be healthier snacks.
746,Glassdoor,Watching the company grow & change,2013-11-21,4.0,Senior Account Executive,"The pay is very good, but likely not sustainable into the future
There are some very good leaders within the organization
The career opportunities are increasing as the company is growing
There is a clear opportunity to be more than just a # as the company is still small enough for you to make an impact
Training is so much better than in the past
Sales employees are treated and compensated fairly
There isn't much ""dog eat dog"" in the sales department
Finally seeing more promotions from within","The growth in which we've experienced is watering down the culture (which was and can still be absolutely amazing)
I feel like hiring in the sales department needs to slow down a bit, particularly in ""enterprise""
Starting this job as a remote rep isn't a good strategy. Reps need to spend at least their first year in the office
I believe we need to promote more from within. A better balance is needed."
747,Glassdoor,The best work experience I have had in my entire career...,2013-10-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working for Glassdoor has been eye-opening... after years of dreading going to work every single day, having anxiety-ridden Sunday nights and clock-watching my way through life - I finally love my job.   Working here is a pleasure and I am motivated every day by the people around me.  There is a team-effort mentality here and I feel fulfilled day-in and day-out.  There are no egos here - incredible intelligence, productivity, performance and even more humility.  From top to bottom-- the positive culture is incredibly strong.  We live our mission.  I LOVE this place.  Don't ever change, please.","Waiting for pay increases can be frustrating in start-up land, but we hope that you know you know who is in it for the long haul with you...make sure to continue to positively reinforce that so you don't lose some of your loyal followers... this is a very expensive area to live in and we want to stay with you!!!!"
748,Glassdoor,Sunshine on the other side of the fog,2013-10-03,5.0,Account Executive,Theres is a tremendous opportunity to make money and grow with the company.,The office is starting to feel really packed but we're getting new offices in January
749,Glassdoor,Best place I have ever worked,2013-10-02,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Pros – I have worked at 5 companies in my career; Glassdoor is clearly the best for multiple reasons.

1) Great culture and energy - the people are amazing!
2) We are growing like crazy - fun and disruptive solution, people are passionate about Glassdoor
3) I strongly believe we have a fantastic solution that is helping people connect with the right opportunities to improve their lives, as well as helping employers find the right people to build better companies
4) Decent compensation/ equity
5) No dress code!
6) Access to execs - can make my voice be heard - I left a review that marketing wasn't communicating enough with sales, now marketing is doing a fantastic job of letting the sales team know what is going on with products and content - great improvement!
7) Sausalito feels like vacation every day
8) I don't feel unnecessary pressure to perform like I have felt at other companies - I will produce more because of this
9) I feel appreciated when I perform!
10) We are moving to a brand new office and will have lunch provided every day!
11) Flexibility to work from home! This is crucial! I was given the ability to work from home a few days a week because of high performance - I probably would have burned out having to commute every day for 2-3 hours","There are a lot of changes with startups: shifting managers, accounts, processes, etc"
750,Glassdoor,Still feels like a family,2013-09-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been working here for almost 4 years and seen it go from 20 to 200 people. Many things have changed, but the culture and a family-like feel remained the same. I had my share of startups and this is definitely the best of them.

- Sausalito is a beautiful location. It feels like you're on vacation every day when you're going out for lunch or just walking by the bay.

- Very strong management and very smart, mature & responsible people. 

- Great culture and family feel. CEO's door is always open, constant company celebrations, internally-run yoga classes, poker evenings with beer, paddleboarding on the bay, etc.

- Unlimited Vacation

- Casual work environment. I go and work from home when I need to","- I lost a couple good friends who were commuting. If you don't live close, traffic can get to you.

- With so many cultural happenings, sometimes it's too distracting from work. 

- They no longer stock my favorite sweet potato chips."

752,Glassdoor,Excellent,2013-08-24,4.0,,You are providing a great service to people all over the world looking for jobs. What other company or job can say that?,I can't find anything bad about this company. The hours are flexible and you work at your own pace.
753,Glassdoor,"Oh, the community!",2013-08-14,4.0,QA Lead,"Many different ways to help employees work comfortably together, including the open environment (several walls have come down at this location), unofficial group activities (yoga, biking), frequent hands-on demos of new features, weekly huddles, and team recognition awards.  For the most part, we treat ourselves as a community, just as we do the user- and customer base.

Other things: flexible time-off policy, inexpensive benefit package, and dogs.","Despite (or perhaps because of) the community feel, I, a work-focused introvert, had struggled daily with working effectively in this environment.  There are few places to escape to if you need quiet time, and if you don't engage actively with the team it's easy to get overlooked.  It has gotten better recently, but I'm certain my career stagnated in the meantime."
754,Glassdoor,Never left my seat,2013-08-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Mostly nice people
Comfortable work environment
Lots of nice perks like healthy food, yoga, celebrations and fun parties
Ability to listen to employees - one example - short company update meetings
Good products","Unbelievably huge workload ... the elephant in the room that no one discussed ... acted like business as usual. Barely left seat for meals, bathroom breaks, meetings. 
Engineering / Product group not terribly communicative about product changes ... got better over time."
755,Glassdoor,Awesome opportunity to work with a fast growing startup,2013-07-02,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"I'm very proud to tell people where I work - because we are truly helping people make more informed decisions about their next job.  The compensation is great, benefits are great.  Robert is amazing/inspirational and rest of senior leadership team is very good.",We don't always know what we are doing - because we are creating a new niche in the recruitment industry.  3 steps forward and 1 step back each quarter but always moving ahead.

Beautiful office location, onsite yoga and outdoor activities, hack-a-thons and tech talks let you demonstrate your abilities and passions alongside day-to-day responsibilities.","As a startup, it's the usual lot of work and project churn/shifting priorities.
Not a lot of quiet spaces to work in when you need to shush the noise and get stuff done."
757,Glassdoor,Love My Job,2013-07-02,5.0,PR,"Friendly environment, plenty to learn, passionate group of fun people to work with. Glassdoor is full of people who really care about what we're creating.

760,Glassdoor,Keep on truckin',2013-04-29,5.0,Vice President,Glassdoor is a rising star. We help people make informed decisions about their work - which is something I am really passionate about. We work with a fantastic group of people that work hard but like to have a great time. The culture really values people with fresh ideas. And our product is working - every day we see stories about how we are helping people find jobs that are a better fit for them and employers attract and retain great people.,"We move fast which is great, but we need to make sure we don't move so fast that we lose focus on the employees that make this such a great place to work."
761,Glassdoor,Senior Account Executive,2013-04-11,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"So far my experience with Glassdoor has lived up to and even exceeded my expectations.  First I would like to review the culture.  I love to come to work everyday.  It is a culture that treats you like an adult.  They expect you to come in and work hard because being a newer company we can have a direct impact on Glassdoor moving forward.  But is very relaxed atmosphere as well.   A break room with tons of food to snack on and breakfast is provided daily.  Also there is a grill outside so you can bring in your own food and get to grilling for lunch.  There is a lot of room for professional development and growth.  Glassdoor provides a lot of transparency in the company, which is important because  that is what we do for our career community.  There is an open door policy where you can walk into any of the execs office and talk with them about pretty much anything.  I also like that the company is really cohesive and there is a lot of collaboration across many departments.  Everybody wants to see the company grow and become a market leader.  There are no egos here which can be a problem with many start up companies.  I would say Glassdoor has already been one of the most enjoyable experiences of my professional career.  I can not wait to spend the rest of my career with this company.","With any newer company there are going to be processes and strategies that need to be figured out.  But those pitfalls are already being addressed which just takes time and collaborate efforts among executives, directors, managers and employees.  The company is doing a great job of taking feed back from employees and implementing it as needed."

Great culture, and exciting work, especially in a period of such growth. It doesn't feel like ""work"" and every day brings a new challenge or opportunity","- Older people: The average age is much higher than most similar Bay Area tech startups. While this has helped establish Glassdoor, there is some inertia because of this, and perhaps the company isn't reacting to new market developments at the rate that it should be. 
- Bureaucratic: Bureaucracy is odd for a company that is so small and relatively new, but because of the aforementioned inertia, there are often several levels of management one has to go to for a new idea to ever reach the surface. At a company that is growing so quickly, nobody ever has enough ""bandwidth"" to spend the appropriate time reviewing such ideas, and so innovation is often systemically discouraged."

My supervisor decided to limit the tasks that I performed to the point that I questioned my status as an employee and initiated a meeting to discuss (Tuesday). Apparently the decision to let me go was made the previous Thursday unbeknownst to me. 

- In this meeting it was stated that I was probably going to be let go Friday (my birthday) if I hadn't taken the steps to open communication about my job status sooner.

- I was let go b/c I do not possess technical skills that were not listed on the job posting, or mentioned in the interview- and was not given the option to learn these skills on my own.

Glassdoor is the perfect place for me to really grow. Senior management genuinely cares about why people work here, and what each of us wants to get out of our experience here - and asks how can they do better. I feel as though I have room to grow, I am challenged daily, and I feel like I have a voice - all things that are not common these days. I like my co-workers, and there really is a team feel here. A company which is built on a model of transparency needs to really embrace that model, and I'm happy to say Glassdoor does from the top down. We are in rapid growth mode, and it's so very exciting to be a part of it. Helping job seekers make the right choice was a big motivator for me, having been unhappy in previous roles - and if I can help someone make a good decision, I'm happy. This is one of only two times I haven't been looking for another job in my career ... being happy at work is important - it makes your whole life better (my husband is certainly happier), and I can say I have found what I think is the perfect place for me.","There is some disorganization in process, but that's to be expected from a start up. If you are the kind of person who needs a firm procedure in place for how to do everything, this is likely not the place for you. If you need someone to tell you what to do all day long, also probably not the place for you - we all work hard here (so we can play hard) - and each person knows their role and importance."
787,Glassdoor,"My time at Glassdoor has been innovative, challenging and exciting!",2011-07-17,5.0,Account Manager,"Some of the best people I've ever worked with.  I genuinely get along with all the colleagues at Glassdoor and have built personal relationships with a lot of them, including those in upper management.  It is a very humble and bright group of employees.  I feel challenged everyday and like I'm helping make a big difference in people's career choices, which is all I can ask for.  I love that the company is built on transparency and definitely lives and breathes these principals, which is so refreshing.  I'm learning so much and am so happy to be a part of something so new and different.","There is a little disorganization in the process and it definitely has a start up feel.  If you are not someone that is proactive in paving your own way in a role than this is not the place for you.  It definitely requires a high level of organization and the ability to come up with new ideas and be proactive.  People are stretched thin, so you need to be able to find answers on your own at times.  It's a lot of work and the 8am calls are tough, but it's worth it."
788,Glassdoor,"Great start-up, poised for the next stage of growth",2011-02-03,5.0,Vice-President,"Glassdoor is a start-up that has proven to meet a consumer need. We have established ourselves as the place to go to research jobs and companies. And there is huge upside from here.

The team is still small enough that every single person in the company plays a meaningful role. But we're expanding which will allow for more career growth.

Our product is about transparency of information for employees. We embrace that value internally. We hold regular meetings where all details about the state of the company are shared.","The fast pace of start-up isn't for everyone.

Be prepared for rapid change and being flexible with your role. Everyone here has to be willing to roll up his/her sleeves and get dirty."
789,Glassdoor,"Best Place to Work, Great Future",2011-01-27,5.0,,"Glassdoor is a really exciting place to work. Even on those days when I'm busy and pretty exhausted, I leave with the feeling that I love my job! Senior management works hard to create an environment that welcomes each individual's input. The work/life balance can't be beat. The challenges are interesting and fun to tackle. I'm constantly energized with the work that we do and the direction the company is headed.","With several team members scattered throughout the Bay Area, California and the US, it's tough at times to keep connected. Glassdoor's also growing so fast so the office space in Sausalito is pretty cosey which means there are often many distractions. Also if you're not self-motivated or you're fearful of letting your opinions be heard, this might not be the place for you."
