Excellent CEO
Strong Brand
EG University — one of the best perks","No experience in other group but EG is pure toxic. For a company who is pushing for digitalization this group seems a bit backward. Internal process is slow. They will be pushing you with high sales target but network is not ready to facilitate client requirement in the first place. So if you were able to close a big sale e.g Core products, 9/10 there is no available facility to cater that requirement. That’s why they are pushing for other solutions (Cloud, Cybersecurity, etc) but their counterpart is slow as hell as well. 

Support teams are being drilled non stop to expedite process — whatever it takes. There is a SOP on how it should be done, but you have to bypass a lot of it for your requirement to be even prioritized. All this inefficiencies inside will take a toll on you and people around you. During my time almost half of our sales team left because it is just not worth it. 

Early morning huddles, wee hours of text and calls from your boss, dead end network availability, low variable pay compared to industry standards —it’s not worth it. 

Globe is great, i honestly believe that. But if you happen to be in Enterprise Group, then goodluck.

485,Globe Telecom,Wonderful World at Globe?,2014-10-03,2.0,Sales Head,"The best reason to work here is that they will train you and push you to achieve your maximum potential. Unlimited wonderful experience from the company's products. They'll give you your tools of work like cellphone with a basic plan that varies depending on your department, laptop/computer, car if you're in the consumer sales group, subsidies depending on your compensation packages, insurance, different types of leaves, and sometimes unexpected rewards or perks. There's an annual event mostly for full time employee and heads. The top level management are great. The CEO is awesome.","Employees working in the head office often receive wonderful perks while those who are in the province do not.
Provincial operation is very different compared to the head office. Favors are often granted to those who are located in the central districts. There's no much room to grow because of corporate politics. Mismatch salary for the old employees (new ones get better packages). Different culture of management below the top level management which is sometimes confusing. Employees sometimes tend to work beyond what is written on their contracts but not totally compensated. If your a contractual employee, regular employees tend to abuse you."
