People in general make you feel welcome!,Only white dudes in their late 20s/early 30s in upper management giving promotions to under-qualified male buddies in Product and Business departments. Huge juniority at a chief executive level reflected in: an unclear vision; a culture of burnout under the label of “GAS” promoted openly by the chief of People himself and an environment where you are expected to give feedback with radical candor to your peers but if you give it to your superiors they won’t listen. It’s a pity. You can find really cool people to work with but it’s just unsustainable to cope with so much injustice.

- Dynamic environment
- Some people are quite advanced technically and possibility to learn from them
- Still has start up mentality where the contributions can make in to production, your impact may actually change how company operates
- Company tries to be inclusive and some good benefits if you live in Barcelona","There are some things wrong with this company and it has a lot to do with its core values. Employees are encouraged to bring solutions as fast as possible, but it actually lowers the quality of the solution. Also, you are expected to bring your A game not only during weekdays but also after work hours too. If you are thinking about getting compensated for your extra hours, you are dreaming.

The directors micro manage and whenever you address it will be wrapped in the paper of ""ensuring the quality of the work"". It's not just the distrust but also amount of stress it creates will wear you down quickly. The work / life balance is just a fancy phrase used by the senior management and it will never be taken into the account when your work is evaluated.

Generally, chaos rules all areas of the work place. There is no integrity in management from top (C-level) to the bottom (line managers). There is no actual time to do work because your calendar will be filled up with nonsense meetings quickly. If you are a talker who can sell a little amount of work as the revolution of the year, you will get rewarded. People who focus on what needs to be done and work in the background will be called out for not communicating enough. Ironically those people are the gears that creates the value.

Immaturity and toxicity. While during a global stand-up meeting the CEO would explain how they are welcoming all feedback, but in a public Slack channel a concern for COVID and going back to the crowded offices can be described as ""toxic"" by the CEO himself. This culture is spread again top to bottom. Your good work will be considered as ""expected"" and ""how it's suppose to be"" while even the smallest mistake will be put under the spotlight. So you will always feel that you are not doing a good job. Eventually, you'll be always afraid that you're going to lose your job as our people officer makes it clear how dispensable you are.

Overall, you may feel like you aged couple of additional years even in your first year. The smile you had in your first months will quickly disappear."

45,Glovo,Smoke and mirrors,2022-01-05,1.0,Software Engineer,"Fancy from the outside, which may help with the CV. 

Some teams and people have a lot to learn from.

Individual contributors and managers can talk and not do much, nice place for slackers and coasters.","New hires are being asked to provide a review on Glassdoor after ~1 month of work, which is why Glovo looks so good on Glassdoor, while in reality, it's a different scene. 

Management has no integrity. They will say one thing publicly and the opposite in private. That's true for all the levels, from C-level down to line managers.

Backstabbing colleagues and direct manager. This is the place where one can't trust anyone, they will use every opportunity if backstabbing a colleague gives them an advantage.

Unqualified personnel. A lot of people unqualified people were hired because the positions need to be filled. Both managers and individual contributors across the company. 

Micromanaging directors. It's considered the norm if a director looks at one's code and reports you for something in there, even if the director has very little knowledge about the work that is being done. Most pieces of advice from my director were misleading, damaging, or irrelevant due to the lack of hands-on knowledge. 

Toxic C-level management. Chief People Officer threatens the employees on company-wide zoom calls every now and then. He regularly produces such threads, then the whole HR hustles to reduce the damage. The CEO does nothing to prevent that. I felt stressed and afraid of losing my job.

Top management is oppressive and tyrannical. Rather than solving problems, they silence them out.  

The company is run by the HR department, not sales or engineering. which creates a lot of problems. HR cannot be trusted. The whole HR org is rotten. 

Very little time to do the actual work. As an individual contributor, I had one day per week to do the work, write code. Every other day is filled with meetings. Most of the time, the meetings didn't bring much value and the people were just taking air time. 

Exclusive environment from all angles. Colleagues of mine had sexist discussions right in the office, one of them is a manager now, the other one was promoted. Diversity hires in engineering are unqualified and cannot meet the bar. 

Top performers are not rewarded. Management doesn't recognize talent and top performers. Top contributors don't get any reward for outperforming. Good place for slackers, talkers, and coasters, not so much for doers and makers. 

The company's business model is to exploit low-income workers. 

Glovo doesn't live up to its values, especially on the top management levels."

Expect gossip and relationship-driven growth, as opposed to meritocracy. Your growth will depend on how strong your boss is, politically speaking.

Long hours and weekends are expected across positions and departments unless you are a developer.

I would say it is one of the best places right now to grow and learn in a fast pace. As Glovo is expandind every minute.","If you are looking for a comfortable role, maybe this is not the best place for you.
Working in a startup may have it´s benefits but also some cons for those who cannot adapt to it´s fast pace. 
Also sometimes Glovo is very demanding in terms of how many working hours per day/week."

100,Glovo,Startup culture,2021-09-26,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Startup culture, very diverse, not formal structure where it is possible to reach out other employees at all levels",Not being structured/still trying to find its way of working
101,Glovo,Amazing Company,2021-09-22,5.0,Sales Executive,Amazing onboarding and super friendly teammates,Information overload during first days but its normal when joining a new company
102,Glovo,Excellent engineering team,2021-09-21,5.0,Software Engineer,"Engineering team is very excellent
Follows good engineering principles and practices.
All the peoples I met so far are very passionate and eager to help each other
Glovo has created a very 💪 culture of humbleness. People are very respectful to each other.","It's growing very fast, Although each team is driven by OKRs and KPI. It feels like Glovo is missing the long term vision and direction."
103,Glovo,Very human company,2021-09-18,4.0,Software Engineer,"Overall, I may say, that this company cares about its employees - this is something which was not easy for me to find on job market.

- For quite some time I was on non-permanent contract with Glovo HQ, but I was still treated as a normal full-time employe: had paid time off, had stock options, etc, even though Glovo did not had a formal obligation to provide all these

- Company proactively takes actions on salary raises, I had no need to look for another offer to negotiate better pay at Glovo

- Flexibility to work remotely, even from another country: interview process, company onboarding and team onboarding were all remote, I got a laptop shipped quickly, etc - but it seems to be changing soon (see cons)

- Direct managers have power within the org, and can take actions quickly: whether you urgently need 2 weeks off for sensitive personal matters, or you are unhappy with something, or there is some inter-team negotiation failure, negotiation of counter-offers, etc. To me, it is an important building block of trust between engineers and managers. Compare this with the orgs where managers are spineless yes-people, caring only about what their upper directors say

- All-hands, Q and A, and other C-level communications are honest, transparent, clear, and near-zero-BS, they are able to acknowledge mistakes and are not afraid of communicating bad news. To me, it is an important building block of trust between all employees and C-level leadership. C-level is able to handle feedback, both positive and negative

- The company is quite data-driven: people of all seniority levels try to support investment decisions, feature decisions, technology choices with data, still not making cargo-cult of it. This makes the organisation quite pragmatic

- Intra-team and inter-team communications are comfortable in terms of tone, people are humble, always have willing to help, or are available to give suggestions

- Strong professionals around you, there are always some opportunities to learn new things. At Glovo you will easily find excellence of all kinds: technical, communications, PR, branding, negotiations, etc

- People Partners are empathetic and helpful

- Ton of effort invested into systematisation, definition and polishing of learning resources: on-boarding is a great example of well-though, well-structured process","The company had been, de-facto, remote-friendly for more than 1y till now, but new ""hybrid"" setup makes it clear that full-remote will not be tolerated anymore."
104,Glovo,Awesome - as long as you're in love,2021-09-15,4.0,Partner Business Leader,I had an amazing team around me and one of the best Country Managers I've had the pleasure of working with - Willem.

One of the best things of working at Glovo is the company's commitment to social values, they genuinely care about how their couriers are treated, about the environmental impact of their operation. They also focus on minorities' issues in their own organization, like Women in Tech, or LGBTQ+ people - pride month was not just a logo change to them, but there were lots of internal events to raise awareness.","With the huge growth there are also some downsides, like some disagreements between teams on who owns which scope, or the issue of new-joiners being compensated higher than long-time employees.

Glovo has been the best place I've worked for (and I've worked for more traditional companies in the past), mainly due to the following pros:
- Accountability and impact: you are given a lot of responsibility, and the impact of your job is really felt and seen in the organisation, product and geography you operate
- Open to mistakes, recognising and even celebrating the learnings. Don't get it wrong: Glovo hires smart people, so even the mistakes are complex, or due to the speed of implementation.
- Brilliant talent all around. I like working with smart people that challenges me all the time and that I can challenge without fear. 
- Company values - walk the talk, particularly Gas (drive to execution), Stay Humble and Good Vibes - it is fun!
- In love with everything I see in Diversity and Inclusion. The journey is starting but is so real and nice to see. I want to see more of it. 
- The CEO: I do not work with him directly, but he is so humble, human and real. People like us. I truly love how his personality and vision comes across and builds this future I believe in.","Like any fast scaling company, there are issues to be solved. If I had to magically fix some, I would list the following:

- Data. Overall inside the company, the data infrastructure is not great. When we need information to take decisions, look into business performance or get insights from data, that is hard and not 100% accurate.

- Culture of entitlement, particularly of the younger generation. There are complainers, not many, but they are very noisy. People that complain about benefits, or just want to cheat the system as much as they can to take advantage of the company. Had they worked in more traditional companies before they would be more thankful. I think we are too tolerant with these toxic people. 

- Leadership skills, particularly in lower management levels. Many leaders are not prepared, and we need more and more training for them. There are some efforts starting now, but we should invest a lot more to cover everyone. 

- Product readiness. The tech team is huge and yet, we do not get some basic features in that are competitive advantages in some markets. Product and Tech are robust now, they need to learn to work faster and better coordinated. 

- We need more HR business partners. The one I work with is great, but leaders below me need more time from them as is very valuable advice and development on decision making."

They have great office conditions and the perks are also good, including free Glovo deliveries and Glovo credits to spend.
You have the opportunity to grow within the company, if you make the right choices.","Apart from being overworking and being underpaid, Glovo's hypocrisy is beyond comparison. One of the core values Glovo holds is Care: but they didn't care for the 100 employees in their HQ they put on furlough 2 weeks into the pandemic - yes Glovo, one of the few companies able to fully operate during March's quarantine. After months in furlough, we passed from ""Don't worry you will be back"" to ""You will not be returning"" to the company, being the only way to fire all these people due to ""Disciplinary Reasons"", even though it was a lie and most people got a Good Performance package before leaving. Also, they can't hire you back because it's illegal. So they hire people for the same position they fired you from, 2 months ago. It really does not feel good. 
Another example: We were working in the office until the very last minute of the lock down, as the VP of People discredited the coronavirus pandemic in one general meeting that week. 
Also, your privileges really depend on the department you're in - if you work on marketing you may have your Friday afternoon off and working from home, but if you work on the finance or people team, you'll be working until 7PM from the office because you are not allowed.
Low salaries compared to the expected work load."

309,Glovo,Very good,2020-10-09,5.0,Financial Analyst,Amazing with the preparation they gave me to face the last university year.,Bad service with intern projects
310,Glovo,Good work environment,2020-10-08,5.0,Backend Engineer II,I have been working as a Backend Engineer for one year. Every day I work with a lot of people across countries & continents that passionate about their work.,So far no cons yet.
311,Glovo,Good but not superb,2020-10-08,5.0,Performance Marketing Lead,Good culture and learning curve,Would expect a higher salary for the amount of hours and responsability
312,Glovo,Supply Operations - Acquisition,2020-10-02,5.0,Operations Specialist,Glovo has good vibes and I feel part of a solid team,"none so far, everything seems okay"
313,Glovo,Exceptional company approach to the developers,2020-09-21,5.0,Software Engineer,"After joining Glovo a few months ago, I'm amazed at their approach to the developers and product. So far everything is great, company is following the best industry standards, everything is well documented, processes are well defined and followed, developers have a lot of space to suggest their ideas or improvements and immediately see the impact. People are helpful, understanding, and very professional. It's total bliss, even during covid times.",Nothing yet came across during this period
314,Glovo,Empresa tecnológica,2020-09-17,5.0,Partner Business Leader,"Its culture values:
1) GAS
2) GOOD VIBES
3) STAY HUMBLE
4) CARE
5) GLOWNERSHIP","1) Lack of processes
2) Lack of communication"
315,Glovo,The worst onboarding,2020-09-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"It’s a young environment, the office was nice","The onboarding was very bad and the initial goals very high. Totally desaligned with the tools and training that I had. I often felt that my work was disrespected and diminished. There is a great focus on numbers and little on people and their well-being. the person who managed the team where I was, was not aware of the most basic tools to do my job and did not have the slightest notion of what it was to lead and manage a team. I felt that sometimes the person who managed me lacked respect and put my freedom of expression in jeopardy and beyond."
316,Glovo,Not as ‘fun’ as it seems,2020-09-15,2.0,Manager In HQ,"1. It’s a transparent place. You will know how the business is performing at a high level
2. People are young and generally nice 
3. Agile workplace where you can work on stuff outside your scope 
4. People share resources and materials 
5. Glovo moves fast","1. People are only a commodity at Glovo. I have never seen so many good people being fired or choosing to leave within 6 months 
2. This is not a 9-7. People boast about the hours worked and there’s a real immaturity here. Working over the weekend will be applauded versus actual results.
3. The culture is like a weird religion. You must ‘fit’ to do well here. It’s easy, just keep using the values buzz words and you’ll do fine, but never ever question them or try to expand on them. See point 1! The values are cleverly written to ensure you never stop working and you never complain as that goes against the values. 
4. Glovo let hundreds of people go during Covid even though as a business we have gained overall due to the nature of what we do (food delivery).  It was used as an opportunity to push out those who don’t ‘fit’ anymore.
5. Execs have very little vision are a young/inexperienced/immature. Glovo is just a good delivery app that is trying to beat the competition by doing the job cheaper.
6. Glovo boasts about being lean and humble. That just means it’s a cheap place to work, you won’t get a company phone and you will likely receive a used laptop. What you will get is Slack, Zoom, Google Suite and company WhatsApp’s added to your personal phone on day one without any question. Your personal phone will now be your primary means of communication in Glovo. 
7. Almost everyone you speak to at a Glovo is planning their move out of the company. Again, is weird to me, but after 6 months, you start to feel used."

Due to the lockdown I joined remotely but I am really looking forward to the new office.

But there is not. They have no idea and in the same department each team goes in a different direction and nobody is happy about the results. Working for this company is painful and pointless and you are valued less than 0. Now 40% of the employees are in unemployment and the company is donating money to ONGs to show solidarity. The pity is they are driving their own employees poor. Maybe they should think about them before donating. But that doesn’t sound as cool I guess.

The work time balance is fair.
Good and open communication from upper management.",A bit understaffed for the number of challenges requiring the team to shift priorities too often. The fast-paced environment is sometimes challenging and you end up dropping projects to focus on urgent matters.

- The culture is nice. Everyone at all levels (starting from Oscar/Sacha at the top) are humble, and pleasant to deal with.
- Very good engineering managers who are both technical (without too much interfering) but also good people managers.","- As a software engineer, you come second to product team. The engineering/product tension is normal and healthy in most places, but if you end up in a team with a not-so-good Product Owner then your time at glovo might be quite frustrating.

- Also product works pretty much in waterfall manner, big projects with big deliveries planned at quarterly levels - plenty of projects take the whole quarter for them not to be used at all.

- It's not really a startup - it's a scale-up in the end of the scale in becoming a corporate. There are too many meetings, and time-consuming processes like postmortems, engineering committees, a ridiculously convoluted promotion process  etc... It's not a problem for me, but maybe for some."

There are many engineering challenges to be solved and lots of features to be developed.
The environment is very friendly and everyone is very committed to push things ahead and getting things done. 
People are humble and collaborative, trying to focus on moving things forward fast without sacrificing quality.
The engineering team is still pretty small and there are lots of chances to get exposure to every tech used in the business and make a difference product-wise.
Very good place to learn new things and get out of your comfort zone.","It's a young company, so there are some of the classic drawbacks of early stage tech companies: monolith (although transitioning to micro-services now), processes still under development, things changing fast.

No party, beers on Fridays or culture day thay they offer can make up for the environment that id found in many teams within the office right now.

Also, there is a campaign within the company to try to improve the reputation of the company on Glassdoor, so careful with positive reviews as many are not accurate.","Very toxic and exhausting environment, worsened by awful managers and VPs who put constant stress on their teams

Unrealistic goals  are set every quarter,  which makes most of the company underperformers and allows them not to pay the bonus they promise in the offer letter.

VPs who do not align with any single one of the values, and a CEO who does not listen to what employees have to say and who sacrifices the company culture for fast growth

Salaries in most departments are sad and unfair.

No space for real growth within many teams, no career path established and definitely no spirit within the managers to help their team members grow (when there is a new position open they will always look outside. People that have grown within the company have been there since start. New people joining now are not given opportunities).

Employees in many departments are not valued, they just want soldiers to use as cannon fodder.

Lastly, the dismissals: they make disciplinary dismissals to employees so that they don't have to offer you a notice period or severance pay, even if the employee has been working tough until the very last minute."

- Competitive compensation.","- No transparency on salaries or bands, at all. Salary reviews are the most opaque, shady I have ever seen.
- Inefficient hiring process which ends up with having to outsource many interesting internal projects to technical consultancy companies such as Thoughtworks or Pivotal.
- Company is trying to become a tech company, but there is no real plan around how to get there. Thinking that you're Uber doesn't make you Uber.
- Engineers which have been in the company for a long time are not being valued as they should. Instead all money, trust & appreciation is being put in new employees.
- Offices are very noisy, impossible to focus.
- Micromanagement. Even in public Slack channels. 
- Personally I don't mind this, but most employees work 10h a day although contract says 8h a day."

424,Glovo,Fast learning experience,2019-07-05,5.0,People Operations,The fast-paced rhythm is the best way of learning and continuously improving. The mix of so many cultures in one company is an added value bringing new ideas and different perspectives over the open topics. Every working day is a new challenge and only the people with open-minded and flexible thinking are the ones to stay.,The lack of knowledge and expertise in some areas for some colleagues can be chaotical sometimes and might require doing often overtime in order to meet the target and deadlines.
425,Glovo,Great place to make an impact and solve big challenges,2019-06-25,5.0,Backend Engineer,"I've been working at Glovo for 6 months and the experience has been great so far. 

The company is in constant expansion (we've grown 10x last year), and opening new cities and countries every week.

In a way, it feels like a small startup: Things move fast, we are constantly A/B testing new features, working on new business verticals and improving our processes. The structure is pretty horizontal and you get to make a very big impact. The team is very talented and always willing to work together.

However, Glovo is also a multinational that tackles big problems (logistics optimization, infrastructure availability/scale, multi-cultural user experience...). Just in my team, our releases affect millions of people everyday and even small optimizations can lead to huge business gains.

To me, that mix between a startup culture and the challenges of a multinational company is what keeps me wanting to come to work everyday.","At the moment, our HQ office is overcrowded. We've had to install desks in chill-out areas; silence and meeting rooms are scarce resources.

By the end of 2019 we are supposed to move to a bigger office, but construction works have been delaying the final date (it was supposed to be mid-2019).

For an engineer, I also think the setup is not good enough. We have good laptops and screens, but I believe we're missing a proper budget for keyboards, mice and chairs."
426,Glovo,The place to leave your fingerprint on,2019-06-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Startup environment - agile, fast pace, a lot of accountability and a lot to be discovered - even with 1200+ employees, and this is amazing. 
It has been a great opportunity to get things that really matter build and cause impacts on the business.
People are always willing to help and I think that is very connected to the ""Stay Humble"" and ""Good Vibes"" we have.","Nothing, but definitely not a traditional company. A lot of autonomy, therefore, responsibilities - not at all a bad thing, but if you are looking for a 9-5 job, and process to follow, this is not the place. 
Glovo is a place to cause impacts."

429,Glovo,"Challenging, Fast Paced Scale-up!",2019-06-15,5.0,Manager,"Working at Glovo means that every day is different, and so are the challenges. You are required to be fully dedicated with your mind and your heart but in exchange are given opportunities to build the future of the company. 

The flexibility, opportunity to build things from scratch the way you believe is right, the talented people and the embracing culture are the things I value the most about Glovo. 

Also, the leadership team is very humble and is focused on listening to employees and keeping the environment and culture as fun as possible.","Like any company at this growth rate, Glovo suffers from a lack of processes which sometimes generates chaos.

Super noisy offices, especially the HQ is not fit for a company at this stage and too many people on such a small area. Feels more like battery cage for hens than a workplace.
It is very difficult to find a quiet place for having a call or even a normal conversation or sometimes a spot for lunch. Way to less meeting rooms. Tables and chairs are way under the standard which most shared offices spaces have in BCN, and way way way under the standard of other companies in BCN. Monitor, keyboard, mouse do not seem to be standard equipment. 
Company keeps promising a new office, but it always gets ""delayed"" ( from will be here in January, to April, June, October 2019)."

444,Glovo,A big disappointment,2019-03-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free snacks and coffee
Transparency
Culture days (parties) every two months.","- Super chaotic: No one  knows what everyone else is doing. Projects are launched with almost no testing and without speaking with other stakeholders. Total lack of communication among departments.
- Lack of guidance: Nobody ever has told me what is expected from me. I have received zero support from my manager or the head of my department. 
- Inexperienced managers: Many people got into higher positions because they have been working for Glovo for a long time, but they've never had experience managing people or leading international companies. You can find senior managers that are 23 years old and for which Glovo was their first job. 
- Zero work vs personal life balance: You can see people competing and showing off about who is the one that stays longer at the office. It is totally normal for your manager to ask you to stay 3-4h more than required to finish a last minute request.  
- Lack of processes and weak data: There is almost no process defined or written. People do as they think and this creates big inefficiencies."
445,Glovo,Former Senior Account Manger,2019-02-20,1.0,Senior Account Manager,Very successful module as a business you will learn a lot as Data driven module.,"Culture and team not supportive at all.
Weak management and not decisive
Toxic people around you and most of time nothing improve due to their attitude and mentality. 
Inexperienced Managers with personal motives"
446,Glovo,No work-life balance,2019-02-16,1.0,Talent Sourcer,"There are many nice talented people who believe in the company.
It can be a good learning experience.","There is no respect for personal life. People often work 9 to 8 and it's common to still see people in the office even on late Friday evening. On top of that you are still expected to work from home if needed and many people don't even respect their holidays and weekends. 
The focus is on being friends with everyone even if it's fake and there is a big gossip culture and your success might depend on your attendance to parties more than your work. Naturally this leads to low diversity in the company as 90% of the people are 20-30 years old with the same background and mindset.
Most people in management position have no experience or training and there are no standards set from the higher management. People don't even understand the company values and interpret things their own way. Working from home on Saturday night is Gas and Positive vibes means you cannot mention every points for improvement - no one will tell you anything to your face but talk behind your back like in primary school.
There are many changes and no stability like in many start-ups but in Glovo it was the first time I saw company firing people for no good reasons.  In HR 4 people got fired in a period of 2 months which was even more strange since at the time there was no real manager in place and the team was understaffed and extremely overworked already so letting people go was putting even more stress and pressure on the team.
The salaries don't correspond to the hours you work. Most of the salaries are around or slightly below the market rate but if you would actually count salary per hour worked it would be a sad image."

But because it was not tested properly, there were many bugs for which hot fixes had to be applied.","- Big emphasis in interview process for Object Oriented programming, but code in some places says otherwise.
- During interview unit testing was stressed a lot, and while working on my tickets I realized I was one of the few developers writing tests.
- Little collaboration for pair programming, transfer of knowledge not good. But with so many performance problems, many fires had to be put out. 
- Not keeping good track of fixes made it easy for similar problems to occur again.
- No attention to comments/questions in development tickets, this makes it hard to advance work.
- Sometimes people made changes to DB schema in PRODUCTION and did not replicate in STAGING environment. Took hours to find out what the issue for the project not compiling was.
- Focus is on producing code and not much on quality.
- No single source of truth, what I talked with one team was different than what I talked with other developers, thus, a lot of time wasted on getting everyone on the same page.
- I tried suggesting 'git rebase' as it is common practice in big open source projects, but instead they kept using 'git merge'. Good luck with gitk, it's a mess :)"
