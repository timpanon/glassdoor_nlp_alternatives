4,GoDaddy,My First week at GoDaddy,2022-04-07,5.0,Senior Global Payroll Analyst,The Onboarding process was seamless. The Recruiting Team was always in contact and readily available for any questions. The Onboarding Training within the first few days was user friendly and easy to understand.

5,GoDaddy,If you're selfish with 0 empathy. This jobs 4 u,2022-04-06,2.0,Email Productivity Inbound Sales Representative,Remote at home job was it...,Everything. Management the worst of all. Sexually harassment. Had to hire a lawyer too. Most uncomfortable job and no one raised an eye to it. Yet they preach strong boundaries and corporate BS. Yet won't let go the manager who sexually harassed me. Ok???? Wowwwww. And if you don't sell the bare minimum which is just as hard to get as a normal amount. You selll your soul. It's awful. And cheat people of money. Too many customers calling called us the new car dealership for websites. We're annoying sales reps and after that being told to me way too much I got out. All of that crap combined made me run out of there actually.
6,GoDaddy,Poorly led,2022-04-06,2.0,Marketing Director,"- Decent pay, but quickly falling behind the market.
- Good caring people.
- Unlimited PTO.","- Prefers to hire externally for all leadership roles. They don't coach and develop talent. Sr Directors and above are business managers, not people managers or leaders.
- HR is a joke and lives on the side of a milk box. Place a tix and get a response a few days later from some random person.
- Decision-making is horrific, literally every single person who touches a project has the feeling that they are an approver.
- Clearly racist and sexist recruiting practices, they'll bend over backward to find anyone who isn't a white male. 
- Highly politicized leadership, from the Chief People officer claiming the US is systemically racist in an all-hands to this post on LinkedIn in response to the recently passed Florida's parent's rights law.

13,GoDaddy,"Great for non-tech people, but US centred.",2022-03-28,4.0,Senior Program Manager,"The company is huge. And though a software company by nature, there are a lot of business/marketing/sales positions to gain skills and experience. Basically a great company to work if you are not a tech person and want to enter IT industry. 
Good benefits. 
There are a lot of interesting people and teams - so you have a lot to choose from once you are in. Everyone values a hard-worker.","Many of the benefits, general good sentiment and opprotunities fall in the US part of the company. Although the company has made many efforts to build equal oppertunities globally, the finest jobs are still in the US. And others have to work twice as hard to get to a solid and interesting position."
14,GoDaddy,Very basic marketing,2022-03-25,3.0,Social Media Advisor,I enjoyed the culture of working at GoDaddy. The managers were great leaders as they were always there to help coach as well as giving their time to help with continuous learning and training.,"The biggest area of concern for me was hard selling customers to invest in marketing which was too expensive for very basic , low end marketing. 
Some businesses were not suited for the product as it knowingly would not bring a return on their investment but you were coaxed into closing and unable to make an assessment off of ethics."
15,GoDaddy,Pros and Cons,2022-03-25,3.0,Customer Service Representative,"Benefits, work from home, pay is OK.","Constant calls from customers with complex issues. Poor training making it difficult to solve 1st call resolution.

The HR is awful as it's all articles and no one to actually speak to. Basically they will pay you a decent wage, but don't expect to be supported alongside that. Opportunities seem extensive, but in reality don't bother"

21,GoDaddy,Doesn't care about employees or customers,2022-03-19,1.0,Website Security Sales,None at this point anymore,"I was convinced to move to AZ to work for this company 7 years ago. At the time it was voted best place to work for in AZ now its not even top 100. At one point benefits were far above anything else being offered now its either on par or below market. Compensation is extremely below market for base pay. Commission based numbers are significantly below market now for base pay. As an entry level job maybe this place is still worth it, but if you are trying to find somewhere that values you and customers long term run very far away. Our products are over priced for what they provide, they are constantly down and despite employee voices saying this for years nothing is improved. We are behind the 8 ball in so many areas. New revenue numbers are being skewed by large amounts of in store credit being used for ""new revenue."" 
Customers are forced to be sold to on every call because GoDaddy refuses to separate sales and support and gives sales agents support overflow and requires us to offer before transferring when they could have rolled the dice and just gotten support. They dont care about anything except the bottom line and wills screw over customers and agents to make that happen."
22,GoDaddy,"Great Company , Same Disrespectful World Of People",2022-03-18,5.0,Hosting Support and Sales,"I loved the culture, job duties, colleagues, benefits, and very decent pay.",The world is full of rude and ignorant people and for some reason those are the ones that call in to companies for help. This is the same of all customer service phone based roles. It is no way specific to GoDaddy in fact if you have to do it might as well do it at GoDaddy.
23,GoDaddy,Great CEO and VP team,2022-03-18,4.0,Senior Product Manager,Great Exco team who are very transparent and close to the everyday of the business.,The Senior team are very corporate and often waisting everyone's time with too many meetings and administration which distracts product managers away from what we should be doing; Shipping products and talking to customers

26,GoDaddy,Mental Health Sinkhole,2022-03-17,2.0,Sales,made a lot of money,very stressful. goals are constantly being increased. bonus structure changes made incentives harder to achieve. very draining on mental health.
27,GoDaddy,Work place,2022-03-17,2.0,Workforce Specialist,Great diversity environment and the many ways the employees celebrate them all. Fun team outings and giveaways when you show your hard work or willing to work holidays.,Leadership does not follow ethical workplace policies and HR looks the other way.

Great incentives and great company culture.",The servers would always crash and we would always have technical issues. The products were usually average but some of them were very unstable and there were no workarounds for them We would usually lie to the customers about getting them fixed when in reality there was nothing we could do.

If you have a good manager & self-motivated, the sky is the limit.","Newer managers are inexperienced in both how to manage employees and projects. No true prioritization for short-term/operational tasks & projects.

I initially applied for a different role, but was informed by my recruiter that unfortunately I'd missed the deadline.

But then politely asked me to apply for this role, which she was currently recruiting for. As it turns out, this is much more suited to my experience and skills anyway. So I am certainly thankful I was asked.

And this basically set the tone for my journey upto this day. Which is my 2nd day of remote training. 

Seriously… from the first interview call with my recruiter. Then the second interview over zoom with the hiring manager. To acceptance of the job offer. And finally onboarding with HR filling out all the necessary information. It's been such a pleasure. No stress. No panic. Just smooth sailing. 

First impressions count. I was impressed from that first phone call. And the guys training us are no different. Spot on.

I can wholeheartedly say, GoDaddy is a company I am proud to be a part of. Not only do they value and cherish their customers like no other company I have ever worked for. But they have also showed me this is also how they treat their employees.

This meaning give just enoughto make it look like leaving was just out of reach. Things started out great when we weren't public. We had contests incentives made me wanna work all the time I was excited to be part of a company with such a great atmosphere that cared. Slowly beginning the IPO announcement of 2015 the once rich culture began to decline. The free medical began to cost money, the goals to be paid compensation were becoming further from reach. What used to be a bonus for customer satisfaction was taken away and replaces with punishment for not reaching once bonuses goals. More metrics were added that weren't paid only used for more reasons to remove seasoned employees after they reduced the amount of vacation Pay for new hires. Bonus changes constantly. What once was weekly pay became bi weekly and bonuses instead of 26 a year was 12. Delay of bonus while being told learn to budget better when employees had budgeted for over 10 to 15 years at a company that changed with a mere 1 month notice. I took a 30 percent Pay cut in a single year. No accountability for sales disputes between sales people. Berated and belittled when any coaching op happened with certain supervisors even after request from HR in tears to move in a company either thousands of employees and all members OK that team with the same complaint no action was taken for almost a year.

If you were exceeding metrics you may receive a $500 gift card from Costco in the month of November.","I started in October 2020, mid pandemic, as work from home with hopes of one day going into the office. GoDaddy decided to stay work from home indefinitely in the department I was in, Partners Support. One draw back of only ever working from home was I never got much opportunity to meet the right people to grow with GoDaddy and climb their corporate ladder. At this place it is not so much ""what your know"" but ""who you know"". They demand high metrics in stats with a sales quota, call handle time, survey rankings, first call resolution, and more. I worked so hard to keep up with the demands of Customer Impact Scores, NPS, and was a top performer on my team and in my department. I did all this without any real help from my Supervisor, somebody who was not knowledgeable or helpful in any regard. I did a lot more work than what I was paid for, and they only do pay increases once a year. In my time with GoDaddy I noticed a trend of them firing many people for not maintaining metrics, and management offered little to know support in how to improve metrics when a person was struggling.

234,GoDaddy,This job drained the life out of me,2021-09-06,3.0,Inbound and Outbound Sales,Great benefits and quality leadership.,"I was hired for outbound sales Monday - Friday. Within the first 12 months I (unwillingly) was moved around and had 6 different supervisors. Sales goals change every month. Daily goal when I started was around $600, it’s now $2,500. Was moved to inbound “sales” working Tuesday - Saturday. They call them “sales calls” but it’s actually tech calls. You’ll need to troubleshoot broken websites, handle billing questions, pretty much anything except people calling in to spend money. GoDaddy does not offer discounts for renewals. Nor do they let sales guides get any type of commission for renewals. So when there’s a long time customer for 20 years and they want a discount, we can’t offer them anything besides new products. This leads to many upset customers who end up leaving GoDaddy for another provider. Don’t expect employees to fight them to stay with us because we don’t get anything if they renew anyways. But we will offer you 10 years of a new hosting plan that you don’t actually need and won’t set the right expectations about how you need to move your content to the new one. Sales guides at GoDaddy are so greedy, they will flip what you sold and sell them something else using the credit from your sale. I once had another guide refund my web design sale and use the credit to rebuy the same exact thing. I reported it to my manager and nothing ever came of it. Didn’t get the sale back and have no clue if he was even addressed for his actions. Other sales guides will sell a customer a product without setting it up or setting the right expectations for what they need to do to set up. In the end, it leads to an angry customer calling back into the “sales” line for me to deal with. I could go on about different situations and examples but it would take forever. I love GoDaddy as a company, the benefits are really good, but the whole sales job is not what I expected and it really took a toll on my life. I left work angry, felt mentally exhausted, and made me realize there are much better, real sales jobs out there that don’t involve technical support or angry billing calls."

I've been at GoDaddy for three years now and really cannot say enough great things about the company. My experience has been what they presented it would be, growth opportunities and employees who really stand behind the company mission. In addition to that, it is a casual, but yet still professional environment. Especially since COVID, they have done all that they can to keep employees safe and provide helpful resources if needed from WFH reimbursements, job security, counseling services, you name it. 

The benefits - dental, health, vision, are all great. Not to mention the PTO is extremely generous. I also feel that they do their best to transparently address pay gap disparities that previously existed, ensuring everyone is fairly paid based on experience and the market average rate, often higher than that.","I do not have any cons. It is a large company so there's a lot to learn, but that just lends to growth opportunities."

I've also never worked anywhere that legitly rewards you for your hard work instead of dangling a carrot in front of you to string you along.

- There is no emphasis placed on creativity or quality of work, just that you ""get it in done in time.""
- Managers are incredibly click-y and there's zero room for upward growth unless you go out and get drunk with them.
- Managers are poorly trained, often much younger (and with less experience) than those their supervising, and unprofessional (have literally seen managers black out in front of subordinates on weekday afternoons).
- Constant verbal abuse from customers that is written off as ""unique communication"" and never addressed.
- If there is an issue, you have to raise it 10 times before a manager will acknowledge it, then usually will just say ""wow this is the. first im hearing of this"" and never solve the problem.
- During the winter storm in Austin, when employees were stressed beyond belief and worried about power/food/safety; upper management insisted we keep working and not worry because ""laptops dont use that much electricity.""
- Low pay for the city and industry
- Annual performance bonus is only 1% and everyone gets the same bonus no matter how well or poor you did that year

Despite having only worked there during the pandemic and remotely, I have felt like my team cares about each other and I feel like our leadership really cares.","The work can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they haven't hired enough for the position.

GD also have a great induction programme when you start which brought together people from all over the world which was so nice to see and feel connected to new joiners. 

Although my role is remote - I do feel like I'm part of a global team. Culturally diverse, fun and driven by great leadership. I am an entrepreneur myself so I love that they also embrace my side hustle (vs seeing it as a distraction).

There is a strong organizational focus on increasing velocity with ongoing and meaningful a/b tests that consistently drive improvements and growth.","Capacity-based bottlenecks that can, at times, inhibit teams ability to maintain velocity.

The one notable thing about the company as a whole is the level of transparency there is various Q&A’s to get engineers all on the same page and this includes meetings with the CEO.",The only thing that annoys me is having to explain GoDaddy doesn’t just sell Domains GoDaddy is much more.

In a relatively short time I've heard the CEO and senior management speak to employees on a regular basis and really engage with a shared goal. Everyone is very easy to work with and you have a real sense that this is a business which is really going places.",No real negatives.

Real commitment to diversity and inclusion - that includes people of different ethnicities, religions, political views, economic backgrounds and education levels- we purposely have major hubs in different parts of the world to bring people with different perspectives together. For example, Seattle, WA, Hiawatha IA, and Phoenix, AZ area are two major US hubs- we push and challenge each others views in good ways. Of course we still have a ways to go- but our actions to diversify- like recruiting in Atlanta and Chicago with work from home teams, and expanding our presence outside the US, are real.",Having to explain the name to people and insist it's not a gross boys club (truly it's not)

They take feedback from employee surveys and act on it and are genuinely trying to be the best they can be, and looking at where they have fallen down and making it better. The company is doing well, bringing in new products and stretching what they do, and I think the total compensation package tends to be well above average if you include all the benefits, which are excellent.","Being a large company, sometimes it's harder to get decisions cleared and made quickly in the way a small company can, which means GD loses some agility at times, which can be frustrating.

From my first encounter with GoDaddy I have had nothing but good experiences. Their communication is fantastic right from interview stage. 
I was super impressed with the extensive training that is provided as part of the role. It’s clear to see that GoDaddy invests in their people right from the start. I quickly learned that they have a strong focus on the people and equality. They have great business values too. One of the first things that impressed me, right before interview stage, is that the people are ‘real’, they’re down to earth, and in my experience throughout my career I’d say it’s very rare to come across that in such a huge company.

363,GoDaddy,Abuse in Austin,2021-06-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Zero zero zero zero zero,"My bosses were verbally, emotionally, and sexually abusive. And before I receive a canned response, HR was well informed and did absolutely nothing to interject, protect me, or remove the situation in any way. Both bosses were promoted after I left. This should say it all but I’ll expand. 

Boss told team we were no longer allowed to take sick days , and if we did they would assign more work that we would be responsible for doing while out sick. Changed the team to this policy one day after I came back from being seriously ill, my first sick day in two years. 

Boss frequently over the years went in and changed my earned commission (thousands per month) to 0 when I was not “friendly” or flirtatious back - then told me that this was the reason.

Boss made many threats to me of varying degrees

So many inappropriate jokes and discussion topics throughout the years it hardly seems even worth listing here, it was deeply embedded in the culture yet exhausting and so uncomfortable to be around day in and day out.

Ceo and corporate is disgustingly toxic - behavior and treatment of employees was gross. Super defensive and dismissive during town halls. Offered (long awaited) holiday bonuses as a phishing test- made global news outlets for being in such poor taste. 

Sales rep sold products we literally do not offer and do not work - all lies

Austin teams incredibly toxic- sales reps, account managers, css and retention all discouraged from talking to each other and bonding with each other. Managers facilitated an environment of near hatred of each of these other teams. This discouraged us from speaking cross team to see how prevalent the issues really are. People were so insanely mean here, it is hard to believe how bad it was. When complaints were made about behavior from employees, managers did nothing. 

During Covid, we were forced to work from our own personal laptops and download all work programs, or buy a laptop. No desks provided. No computers until 8 months in to full time WFH. No stipends. Given old broken dell laptops that can’t do basic functions.

Austin is a complete cesspool that needs to be much further investigated. There’s dozens of reviews with quite serious accusations against Austin. 


Hm I think that covers it. Shout out to the HR rep I talked to frequently who did nothing."

I really do not complain much, but I can say there was not one day, even one hour, that I felt welcomed or comfortable while working here. GoDaddy is 100% predicated upon the perception of what you LOOK LIKE working, not your actual work. They will tell you one thing while hiring you, and then into the prison cell you go, stripped of any dignity you once knew. My 1 year review was conducted by a man I had never met, from a city I don't work in, and was 100% about the perception of me, not my substantive work. When I asked about my actual work, I got an ""oh, it is good."" I knew at that moment it was going to be a 1 way exit for me. GoDaddy has a work from home policy, however, when you used it, you would get a CHAT from you superior from their 16 bedroom mansion with sweeping vista views in the background. It is not a ""walk the walk"" sort of place, it is a do as I say, NOT as I do. That is their golden rule. Also, if you get too good at your job, watch out, you ""will have decided to pursue other options."" Also, my manager was someone who managed us on something she never had done. That was real fun. And then when you finished a project, she would sweep in with ONE edit and take credit for it. While there were some great people there, most of of whom I met OUTSIDE of my department, most seemed very despondent and unhappy. I still have PTSD from my time here, waking up with night terrors. What is unfortunate is I loved my work, but it was stifled by constantly wondering what I looked like doing it. Truly a horror movie in real life. Run, and run fast. Ask Jesus to take that wheel and drive fast."

Performance demands increased despite pay cuts and the inability for our teams to realistically or consistently meet even the original quotas, due to a lack of resources, training, support, and realism from the company. Service fulfillment was also so poor in quality and so different from the services we were told we were selling that many of our few sales were canceled, with customers upset about being offered a service different and inferior to what they were sold. If customers complained, they were placated, but we were discouraged heavily from processing refunds or discounts, and were encouraged to avoid transparency, and continue overselling even as our account management teams were unequipped to handle customer expectations. Any resistance or concerns expressed by employees about any and all of these issues was quickly dismissed, and we were essentially told to be grateful we had a job with GoDaddy at all, and that if we were not satisfied with our pay we simply needed to work harder. Regarding the lack of training, we were told to use unpaid, off-hours free time to supplement our virtually zero training, which could not and did not help when it came to navigating GoDaddy's specific CRM and tools. Our entire staff was laid off after 6 months in June 2020 ""due to COVID and financial difficulty"" despite remaining profitable throughout the pandemic, and all staff, including management, were informed with an email and a video ""conference"" where no questions, comments, or other speakers were permitted to communicate the morning of the layoff, and were told we'd be cut off from all of our accounts and access that day DESPITE needing access to review, sign, and submit our severance and to continue to access our benefits and pay."

There is no hard, unrealistic core goals to meet, do your work, be transparent everyone has fun. Great equity stock incentives annually coupled with a healthy bonus keeps a lot of the people sticking around.","Teams here have a lot of tenure, so it can be challenging to run and manage new initiatives and get everyone to buy-off on things. There is a lot of big titles, but little seen of many SLT's. Would like to see more involvement from above and more championing of new policies and changes from them. Can be hard when you're dealing with members who've been with the company for 10+ years. Also, some of the tools we use are dated and there isn't a lot of options if you're someone who came from the software realm and had the luxury of using new, cutting edge apps to do your work. Not a bad thing just a bit of a shift. Compensation is probably one of the lowest I've seen for the title also, but considering the business is still growing, perhaps it will become more competitive over time."

-Benefits; Healthcare, discounts, ect...","- Upper management doesn't care how you treat the customer as long as you get a sale
- Do & Say whatever is needed to get a sale, even if it's a lie
- Upper management encourages their guides to lie to get a sale
- They keep raising your sales quota to make it harder each month to get a bonus
- Time Off Requests have to be made at lease 6 months in advance
- Upper Management will talk bad about other employees and shame them in group chats to try and embarrass them into getting sales 
- They divide the calls into 3 sections (customers who usually spend money, customers who only spend money once in a while, and customers who don't ever spend money) depending on the day they will route the calls depending on ""your mood for the day"" and that will determine if you get good calls or bad calls...
- GoDaddy will purposefully make updates or ""Auto-Migration"" to get more people to call in when their domain, email, or hosting breaks to give their sales guides a chance to upsell the customer into a different product 
- During training they make you think GoDaddy cares about the customer and the guide is there to help Business Owners get set up for success... Once you're out of training, your Supervisor will encourage you to ""Milk the Customer Dry"" of any kind of money you can get from them... Even if they don't need the product, say whatever you can to convince them otherwise 
- Outside of the 30days of training, don't expect any help with tech troubleshooting, Supervisors don't know how to troubleshoot but encourage you to distract the customer with a ""security consultation"" if you don't know how to fix their issues and ""sell them off the phone"" even if it means lying to them.

The company is more or less chaos from internal IT, procurement to legal and everything in between. (One exception is operational IT (everything that hosts the customer infrastructure. That's run by good people with resources. )

Otherwise, few IT systems in place and it's mostly run with Powerpoint and Excel with a twist of Jira and Confluence. They say they are in a growing phase but it's not really an excuse for a 25 yr old company. Big mistakes are made on all levels every day due to miscommunication and lack of communication.

566,GoDaddy,Don't recommend,2021-01-18,2.0,Inside Sales Representative,The culture of GoDaddy is absolutely amazing (only in the Austin office). It is the best thing about the company.,"I would NOT recommend to someone who needs a stable job. There is NO guarantee that you will be able to eat or even SURVIVE with the base salary. You can work your BOOTY OFF and you can still come away making less than 20k/year. Considering that we work so hard and we live in a very expensive city, it is, honestly, ridiculous that we get paid so little. We understand that commission is what motivates and allows you to get great salespeople, but there are other things that need to be taken into account. If GoDaddy cares 'so much' about their employees, then they need to give us what we need to live if we are proving (through sets, demos, dials, amount of time spent with the company, etc.) that we are working hard for the company and for our home-town heroes. I know that a good percentage of the employee base stays for the culture. If the culture wasn't here, GoDaddy would have a hard time ever really retaining employees and therefore creating an overall weak employee-base. Something needs to change. If we were paid fairly, this would be the best company in the country to work for. Unfortunately, that's not the case as of yet. I know there is a large percentage of the company who agrees, and we have tried to address it, but when it comes to pay, corporate could care less. GoDaddy needs to care about its employees just as much as they care for their small business owners. 
They let go of 200+ people in one day, without warning. We were locked out of everything at 6AM and then they read scripts to us all day letting us know that we had all been terminated."

578,GoDaddy,Upper management is tone deaf,2021-01-12,1.0,Senior Business Analyst,Pay and benefits are decent.,"The company culture is dying. Upper management seems solely interested trying to push up the stock price while systematically gutting all programs which benefit employees. Leadership hosts regular Q&A sessions, but gloss-over, dismiss, or even fully ignore any questions which are remotely critical.
Turnover is getting out of control. Even highly tenured people are leaving due to frustrations that are being ignored. The message is becoming very clear that GoDaddy does not care about employees."

- The work is a bit tedious. You will be doing the same thing every day, every week.

Annual raises are, to put it mildly, a joke.

4. The upper management is receptive to feedback","I know people who have great things to say about the company and while I can't speak to the entire company, I unfortunately did not have a good experience in my team/org:
1. My team and org reeks of favoritism and your efforts and work will most probably go unnoticed if you are not in great, beer-drinking terms with your manager.
2. No transparency in the performance reviews or the months leading up to it even though 'transparency' is touted as one of the top focus for the team. You might also get heavily penalized if you go against any of the favorites on the team.
3. Salary hikes are near 0 and the stock refreshers are negligible
4. Talent is average at best but then again if you are friends with your manager, you will be considered a rockstar and can expect multiple promotions and great reviews.

731,GoDaddy,Great work experience overall,2020-06-26,4.0,Social Media Advisor,I worked at MSH/GoDaddy for 1 year and 7 months. Great work environment and culture great earning potential and excellent place to work for personal and professional growth.,The company just laid off 400+ employees on short notice and provided minimal closure with not much room for the employees to voice their questions or concerns. It was very cold and impersonal which was shocking considering the positive experience I had their and how it felt like a company that cared about people and the employees. Many supervisors were unaware as well of the lay offs until the very last minute. The way in which corporate conducted the lay off felt very cold and impersonal and left some feeling betrayed. Although due to COVID the change had to happen I think they could've handled it with more courtesy.
732,GoDaddy,Don't expect to be rewarded for your successes,2020-06-25,2.0,GoDaddy,"Friendly work environment

733,GoDaddy,Avoid...They'll sell you hard on how great it is,2020-06-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits, you'll enjoy your coworkers, they have a lot of Employee Resource Groups","Where to start here...I think the CEO Aman has been doing a good job getting thrown into a crappy spot/situation, but there's a serious lack of transparency and communication from all of senior leadership. Middle management is just a puppet that definitely plays favorites. They promote their favorites into roles they're not ready for and continuously make excuses for them when other employees step up and challenge the status quo."
734,GoDaddy,High Pace High Energy Job,2020-06-17,4.0,Sales Representative,If you are a consistent optimist and can handle rejection from calling people and can still push through this is a great job for you. Great commission structure if you're at least decent and incredibly great if you take feedback and implement it well this will be great for you and you can keep improving. High energy fast pace so if you're into that then this will be good for you.,"It can be hard to find someone that is interested and if you can't handle the rejection that happens a lot day-to-day then it will not be a good fit. Mindset is huge and if you can't change your mindset to fit in sales it will be rough. Most of the advice people/ upper management give is just blanket positivity. ""Don't let a single negative thought enter your mind"" but don't elaborate on the specifics on how to protect that mindset and how to actually make efforts to stay positive."
735,GoDaddy,A company with heart and passion,2020-06-17,5.0,Sales Specialist,"Great collaborative atmosphere, inclusive and human first approach to everything, candid communication from leadership.","Huge company, so you have to be very intentional about building relationships and moving forward."

737,GoDaddy,Please don't,2020-06-11,1.0,Business Manager,"Health insurance, commuter benefits, coffee, tea, snacks","There are remininents of the classic super bowl ads that continue to define and sadly, drive a big part of Godaddy’s culture. Don’t expect to work on cutting-edge technology or projects that might be innovative, impactful. Totally expect to be constantly fire-fighting at work and putting out fires.

Large presence in Iowa and Arizona makes godaddy’s culture unlike what you find in tech on the West Coast. Diversity is low and inclusivity is scarce at Godaddy. Most leaders exhibit a preference for people who fit certain racial profile. If you look/sound different and don’t fit ‘the profile’, there is a good chance that you will be treated differently. The quality of projects and growth opportunities you get will be determined through that and not your enthusiasm, talent or how driven you are. Unfortunately, racial bias is so deep-rooted in godaddy’s culture that it impacts the success of business. 

Imagine walking into a workplace everyday with - lack of transparency when it comes to cascading information, perpetual instability in org structure and constant struggle to get one honest word out of a manager or org leader. A culture where people are penalized for asking questions, challenging ideas using data and facts or logic in business discussions and expected to be “Yes Sir/Yes Ma’am” people. 

There is no active implementation of policies to ensure fair treatment or mitigate biases. The HR don’t bother to introduce themselves, let alone make themselves available to employees. Incidents that involve coworkers spewing comments about culturally diverse coworkers like “Oh s/he doesn’t understand the our culture in this country..” or “English is not his/her first language..” are not uncommon. Such incidents are common and unfortunately frequent in some teams. Diversity workforce are more often than not treated poorly. Not all teams are as toxic but please research well before you decide to join one. 

Having personally experience a lot of this and also watching some of my coworkers go through it I can only suggest that maybe find another place that values basic human values."
738,GoDaddy,Worst tech job in town,2020-06-09,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Anyone can get a job,"Heavy on policies whether they have informed you or not. Quick to discipline clerical errors.

An ability to solve own technical ambitions for corporate expense.","Unfortunately GoDaddy nowadays is a refuge for corporate leeches, very different from how it used to be, before the company went public. It would not be applicable to regular engineers, they are fine and in a way they are hostages of the current GoDaddy toxicity. I am taking about low, mid and upper management that are like vampires suck blood from each other, from legacy products and what is the most important: from services to customers. The business processes in current GoDaddy are not focused anymore on using better technical means to recognize/serve customers’ needs but instead they focused strictly on how to use corporate inner-play to position a specific manager or a specific group of cronies to have the best access to the corporate trough. Those people will go into any incredibly wasteful spending, any falsification of results, any unadulterated fraud, to complete sabotage of anything positive to customers unless they can personally capitalize upon it. This is a cancer that has been eating the company and any more or less senior worker in GoDaddy, who has an ability or interest to see further then own paycheck and who has own sense of professional ethics do acknowledge it."

Very well connected to the business in the US and senior leaders - engineering, product, marketing etc. I feel they are really putting people first and when you are in status quo, and want change with your role, they do address that and really try to find something you want to take. It's a growing business and really a good place to work at this point if you like action and the dynamic environment.","There are some teams that are really - it is what it is, the leadership needs to apply some creativity around the rotation or opportunities within customer care departments. Also - the company senior leadership changes a lot and strategy changes so we were only doing ""re-orgs"" for 4 of years following the changes.

773,GoDaddy,"The most selfish, greedy company I've ever worked for in my life",2020-03-19,1.0,Inbound Sales and Support,Subsidized Food Trucks.  Great Coworkers and lower management,"I've had the pleasure of filling out an exit survey soon after the liberation of quitting.  Keep in mind, I've never quit a job in my 15 year working history. Below  are some of my thoughts: 

I could achieve my career goals here:

When you fire 10 supervisors, stretch current supervisors who survived not getting thrown in the dumpster to their max, and throwing around management trainees, even if there was a position for career advancement (There wasn't), why would you want to?

I felt valued as an employee at GoDaddy:

It was very clear the ""Seasoned"" employees were being thrown out because we costed too much to employ. They could easily manipulate which phone calls you get based on their algorithms on which customers would be more likely to buy vs the ones that needed questions answered without a selling opportunity. How else can you explain that I sold $30,000 more worth of new product, yet was paid $5,000 less YTD? 

I did a comparison of the amount of money I've made in 2018 vs 2019, and even with all of the overtime I dedicated to the company, I still made less. When I confronted my supervisors, I was brushed off and was told that it was the type of products I was selling and that I should go back on the phones and just sell more. 

The mantra was, sell first, ask questions later.  But when a company's email goes down because an expensive platform change, you end up with a salesman who ran off like a bandit while the customer's business is at a standstill because we convinced them the world was going to end if they didn't upgrade their plan. 


In addition to that, when I needed to take FMLA to have my newborns face sewn shut due to his cleft left and pallet, or when we were dealing with his inability to hear out of his left ear, do you think anybody cared? Absolutely not. The first question was, when will you be returning to work? The multiple physicians have never seen such a outrageous FMLA process and joked that GoDaddy will call and scream at them if I don't go back to selling vs coming to my son's appointments. When I got back, do you think anyone cared to ask how I, or my family was doing? If you think the answer is yes, think again. I was greeted by higher sales goals and lower paychecks.

I am proud to have worked for GoDaddy:

Absolutely not. My biggest mistake was not realizing how much money I was hemorrhaging. I've never worked for a more greedy company in my 15 year working history.

I would recommend GoDaddy as a great place to work: 

Absolutely not. GoDaddy loves to toot their ""Fabulous"" work from home life balance and their new ""Make Your Own Way"" slogan until you stop earning the company money. The 3-4 weeks you're given off are useless until you cash out the hours when you quit, as you'll never get to use them anyway. How can I make my own way when I can't get time off, and I'M BROKE?"

Unlike a traditional AM role, there is little autonomy or flexibility for Account Managers to manage their own books. Outreach to clients is highly regulated and micromanaged.  Book sizes also continue to grow beyond a reasonable capacity, which negates the ""Dedicated Account Manager"" model. Overall, creative solutions and a consultative approach are not encouraged, and the reactive nature of the role is frustrating and unavoidable. 

Account Managers are held accountable for product shortcomings (which includes frequent outages) and often work overtime to handle the immense workload. Management rarely provides any support, and they are often absent due to their exclusive unlimited time off while their team is struggling, both mentally and professionally. 

Account Managers are held to rigid metrics including attendance, while their managers outwardly do not have any measurable criteria for success. There have also been HR reports of inappropriate behavior within the department, and nothing was done. This is disappointing for obvious reasons, but especially for a company that prides themselves on their values and mission of ""empowerment"".

- No micro management

- Work life balance is excellent, awesome benefits, unlimited PTO and can work remote whenever required","- Not many, but since a lot of the teams are remote, you have to take the initiative to bring everyone on board and communicate better."
831,GoDaddy,Unlike Any Other Big Co.,2020-02-07,5.0,Tech Support Agent,"Different in every way.  I've had a couple of nice jobs with solid F200 companies to compare GD to . At GoDaddy, no pretense, no stuffy-ness, no ivory tower governing. No nonsensical big speeches with incongruous behavior from managers; on the contrary, so far, they've spoken less about how fantastic they are, yet I see it in employees temperament, I smell it in the culture, it oozes from the supervisors without them chanting anything. Come as you are-be yourself- treat others the way you want to be treated, with decency, courtesy and respect-tend to your position and duties, with your customers, and enjoy the benefits. Work hard, play hard, and you'd better be good at both, they mean it, and I love it!  I had teachers during training that actually cared; about me understanding all the material, about me passing, setting me up for the best possibility for success. Although I've experienced similar support previously, at GD, it seemed organic, authentic, say, even altruistic if I may. At graduation after 5 weeks of training, I got to meet the person who vetted and recruited me; that was special too.","I wouldn't know. Every long term employee I speak to looks content, satisfied, even happy. But that there are so many long term employees says something to me. High turnover I guess happens in all companies.  I was at one company previously for 9 years. I'm more curious to know what keeps people at one place a long time. And I'm glad to be finding out for myself. I'm in my first year."

They understand that this specific role isn't for everyone and provide the opportunity to transfer departments after your first 90 days on the sales floor.

Work is challenging but fun. There is some chaos around priorities and planning, but there is a lot of good work that still needs to be done here because it's still a small company.

It's one of those high energy environments that embodies that ""work hard play hard"" mentality. Yes you are expected to work hard, meet metrics and all that, but they also value work-life balance and having a good time while you work. It is possible to achieve both. We work with people in different time zones & schedules of their own so understand that if you're not able to accommodate the customer, be prepared to potentially miss out on that sale. There's always some incentive going on for sales & performance, rewarding people that put the effort in and are able to achieve results. If you are confident in your ability to sell, then this can be an incredible and very rewarding position. There are certain performance standards that must be upheld, but they  aren't unreasonable and can be pretty forgiving. The people are cool, the money is good, great benefits, and the opportunity is high. We all have the same hourly rate, are given the same tools, have access to the same leads; it's up to the individual to go out and make it happen...which is something I can appreciate. As someone with a high level of education and respectable work history, the money I make here absolutely blows any other salaried position I've had or are available to me out of the water.","This job can be extremely rewarding if you are performing well, or pretty underwhelming if you aren't. But then again this is sales - you're not getting paid some luxurious fixed hourly rate no matter what you do, you are getting paid to sell a product and are compensated in direct proportion to your ability to do so. The office can be loud and full of distractions...while it doesn't bother/affect me personally, I understand that it may it not be for everyone."

I was pushed into a role I did not want as my old job was shared out across all teams (before moving overseas). Correct training was not provided for my new role, my training consisted of me showing the other agents how to do my old job before getting back on the phone, learning nothing of the outbound role.

The company hired 100's of new employees to a role that has no stability and placing agents on a personal improvement plan just for having a bad month. 

It amazes me how a company can spend so much on pointless events, drinks and snacks but will move inbound roles overseas because it is cheaper.

**Used to** 
Payout better, have more cool perks like cheap cafeteria food, time to play foosball, mini golf or air hockey,  have awesome Christmas parties, money prizes, etc.","Okay, here's a quick inside look run down of many things that went wrong...
GoDaddy **was** awesome when I started, but really went down hill over the 2 years while I was there and is getting way too greedy. It used to be a really fun job where employees were happy and a great happy work environment and that lead to pleasant customer experiences. Customers were a lot happier and it made consulting enjoyable as you could build rapport with people. GoDaddy shareholders bit off more than they could chew this year though and  it made for short conversations with customers, less personable, longer hours and more about just making sales and hitting quota many times requiring overtime. It really stressed people out and makes the customer feel like we just want their money because we have quota to hit for the day. It really stank too because they cut our monthly pay % and made it harder and harder to reach payout tiers for a livable wage. Towards the end, I was making about 2k less per month than when I started. Instead of just paying us what we earned, they would ""reward"" us with cop out door prizes and pizza parties, which consisted of getting a piece of pizza and getting right back to work. Which is lame and sneaky. Also, good luck changing your shift or moving to another department in a reasonable time period. I was a top performer and tried to move 5 times and was only able to move once.
- Too many Kool-aid drinkers and passive employees/managers too scared to speak up for the customer/employees.
- Terrible communication between upper, mid management and HR all have horrible communication between each other. Meetings were almost always very short noticed and cut into our already stressful day.
- Constant stress, several people around me were often going to the doctor and having health/anxiety issues because of this (thank god for good health care). This contributed to the already somewhat high turnover rate.
- Felt helpless in my position/unable to really help the customer. I often sided with the customer as GoDaddy is far too overpriced for what you get and helped the customer even though it might come out of my pocket. 
-  Questionable business practices. Very slight of hand and bait and switch company policies both for the customer and employees. They aren't outright dishonest with you, but they keep you in the dark just enough to not tell you a lot of things and then you're to blame because you didn't know the things they didn't tell you, so you end up paying the price. Literally. But that gives them the scapegoat, so you can't win. Didn't appreciate the sneakiness. I work here, who do you think you're fooling?
- This lead to several gas lighting incidents. One day the answer was X and the next week it was Z, but then if you tried to bring it up and say wait a second, the answer used to be X, they'd say no it's always been Z. It was always the employees fault, never GoDaddy and that really annoyed me they wouldn't take responsibility for their faults.
- Half of my calls everyday were furious customers or customers wanting to move their stuff to another company, which ate up a lot of my time and really stressed me and others out because we had quota to hit. Whereas when I started my first year, I'd get maybe 1-2 bad calls a day.
- I just became a number. Screwed a few of my other top performing coworkers and that was really the straw that broke the camel's back for me. When a company quits taking care of it's employees, the employees stop taking care of the customers and I didn't think it was fair to myself or the customer, so I left."

When us staff work so hard, this is a kick a in the teeth and then he struts around like he own's the place that he seems to know nothing about. However, when we have site visitors he's here  at all hours, that is the only time. As soon as they disappear, so does he. Recently we had our commission structure changed so significantly that it has altered our quality of living. How was this announced???? It wasn't, I found out when I got my wage packet whilst Senior Management were too scared to communicate and hid in their office. Disgusting treatment of staff."

He was right.","That was 8 years ago.  Go Daddy is now on it's 4th CEO in that timeframe. Their new corporate mindset is only on profitability and no longer the people that made it a great company.  Sales goals have gone up every year while the bonuses continue to be reduced.  Sales calls are now purposely routed to agents without sales goals, that do not work on commission. The majority of employees do have sales goals and struggle to hit them now.  If you fail to reach your goal 2 months in a row, you will be fired. 
The majority of tenured employees are now gone as a direct result. 
Upper management is disconnected and manages only by numbers they control through the calls they route.  See for yourself and give their number a call as a customer. You will see the difference."

All while only getting paid for 40 hours because OT is not allowed. No one wants to be bombarded in the ways they train you to treat prospective clients, making clients wait days and hours to even hear an astronomical price. You will not make a sale until your second month there, and at that point, maybe 1 or 2 while they threaten to fire you unless you do better. Not nearly enough to pay the bills, do NOT waste your time unless you still live with Mommy and Daddy and have no real bills. Employees are miserable and drop like flies constantly, they all wear a fake face around the new employees and it's painfully obvious. It's all a scripted show, even the way the recruiter talks to you, all a scripted monkeys act to make the CEO richer. Leadership and most senior employees are immature and very cliquey. Our entire training class, adults trying to make an honest living, was treated like a group of children. The entire training class were not even invited to their company wide holiday party, as if we were being hazed and humiliated for being new, purposely not included in the COMPANY HOLIDAY party, like freshman at a new High School because we were ""too new to hang out with anyone yet"".

This is like the preschool of tech jobs in Austin.

The culture has fostered an environment of young people who are coddled and have probably never had experience in the professional world before, and you will find that out quickly at happy hours, on slack, or from multiple stories that go through the grapevine (leads and managers included).

Working here, I never faced real challenges, and mediocrity was encouraged because at the end of the day, all that your manager cares about if that you made quota. Your ""creativity"" will be depleted and that will be celebrated because you did your part in making generic posts all day long until a customer decides to cancel because of the lack of quality content.

Overall, I didn't feel like I was learning anymore. Many coworkers don't have any other experience besides this place, and that shows in their knowledge of the industries and general professional processes we should be well versed in. Don't drink the kool-aid when the recruiter calls you."

948,GoDaddy,A Sales Baptism By Fire,2019-08-06,3.0,Inside Sales Representative,"If you are fresh out of school or wanting to break into sales, this is a pretty good start. I worked here for over a year and though it wasn’t my first sales job, I learned a ton. Training is pretty hands on but after that month you are on a team of 12 people with one direct manager and are pretty much on your own. You will be making 80-100 cold calls to small business owners on a daily basis, setting up demos with them and closing deals. You are responsible for the full sales cycle. If you try hard, ask for help, attend lunch and learns, and don’t make excuses you can make money. You will meet some really nice people of all different ages and backgrounds and sales skill level. Sr. Managers really try to incentivize reps to perform through daily cash prizes, festival tickets, and team boat parties. Consistency is key at this job if you want to get big paychecks each month. Health benefits are great since the GoDaddy buy out. They only hire from within and there is room to grow your career. However...","This will be long but very in depth.

This is not an easy job and is designed to reward those are willing to sacrifice personal time. 

There are 2 different sales floors. One is specifically for Brick and Mortar (B&M) businesses and the other is for Service Area Businesses-SAB (Roofing, Lawn Care, Realtors). The B&M team are very limited in who they can call and are at a disadvantage compared to the SAB team who can call anyone. However, they are separate in the sales compensation stack ranking.

They say they provide you with leads. True. However, the leads they provide are terrible, (if even serviceable). Usually they are business owners who have been called 6+ times before. You have to source your own leads from a GoDaddy lead queue (very time consuming) and this must be done after/before hours on specific days.

The stack ranking is separate for each department but is pretty similar. If my memory is correct, each month both floors have the commission broken down by the top 20%, middle 30%, and a bottom 50% of all the reps on that floor. The top 20% (highest earning reps) make 125% of their commission. The middle 30% makes 100%, then the bottom 50% only make 75% of their commission on their next months earnings. So if you have a really terrible month and are in the bottom 50%, that means next month you could be having a killer month and be in the top 20% but still only make 75% of your paycheck. The pay is the exact same for the SAB floor except that they add at 0.9 multiplier to all of your earnings before they add the 125, 100, or 75 percentile to make it more “fair” to the B&M floor. Except they don’t give it to the B&M floor, the company just eats it. 

I have had excellent managers/Sr. managers and have been on great teams. I have heard horror stories about other managers sleeping with reps, having favorites, and being strict on taking bathroom breaks but depends on what team you are placed on after training. It can feel like high school with all of the attendance rules. 

You will have to be comfortable selling a product to businesses that might not need it. And once you close the deal the account gets passed to the Account Team who is alarmingly understaffed and consistently under perform because of the staffing issue. This causes the business owners to cancel the service. That means you pay back the deal you earned on a later paycheck or it can mean no residual earnings depending how long they have been a customer.

Base pay is very low $20k. Your paycheck depends on the deals you make, ranging anywhere from ($299-998) so you need to start making deals fast. 

Because everyone is there after hours to make money the line between personal/professional life is very thin. Alcohol and drug (not just marijuana/pens) use is rampant. Everyone sleeps with each other and there is relationship drama that you will know about because it pours over into everyone else’s work life due to the lack of personal/work life separation.

This is a work hard/play hard place. It’s straight sales party culture. If you don’t want to be involved in the craziness/office politics just keep your head down, work hard, ask for help, and don’t go to the team/after work outings!"

If your good at the job there is great opportunity to make 70-100 K because the compensation plan is set up to reward producers and eliminate dead weight (as most sales orgs are).","So most of the reps who usually complain about the company are often times people who just didn't really produce at the end of the day when things boil down to it. I had a fairly successful career during my time at MSH/GoDaddy missing out on President's Club by a few spots so give that some thought as you read the negative portion of my rating. I would say overall Main Street Hub was a great first job but was not a job I would ever consider a long-term career with. The attrition rate is terrible as on average more than 90 percent of your classmates from training will most likely be gone before their first year. There are many reasons for this ranging from low base pay, unstable monthly pay, monotony of job, inexperienced management etc. Since the company is trying to keep expenses down they essentially hire a mass of recruits for their training classes with the hopes of finding those 1-4 reps who can really be a producer. They offer a low base salary to ensure that they don't invest much in the other 40 plus reps who they know will no longer be with the company a year later. Since commissions are the only way to really survive the sales floor can get very toxic at times because since the GoDaddy merger your only allowed to call into the GoDaddy clientele. Since more than 40 percent of GoDaddy's Customers do not have a physical location that alright hits a significant portion of the eligible customers you can call. In order to compensate for the limited number of leads they had management had to really restrict the number of leads the reps had as well making sure the same leads were called repeatedly to ensure they weren't being wasted. As we were saying before, since the company relies mostly on people who are either new to sales or are just starting out their journey the same issues come up with entry level managers since a lot of them just don't have much experience leading teams. The company can sometimes make the mistake of assuming that a great rep will make a great manager and this is just not the case. I think ethics could also be a question at times as the product only seriously works for maybe 5 percent of the clients we call but when your manager is call-coaching you through a close they are going to make it seem as if this is the product that will be the be all end all for that business owner even though you know full well the best case scenario is that the business owner will not have to worry about spending time on their social media anymore. After merging with GoDaddy they opened the company up to calling Service Oriented Business so that was a market segment that had a lot of opportunity. As a result tons of businesses were being brought on but the company was not hiring enough Account Managers to help manage the increased load. This led to many account managers being spread thin as they were forced on so many more accounts than they were used to as MSH. This definitely impacted the overall customer experience of our product because the content team could not just invest the time in an individual business leading to very generic content and review responses."

973,GoDaddy,Great place to get your foot in the door in sales,2019-06-15,3.0,Sales Representative,"This is a great place to learn a fair amount and grow some thick skin in the wake of a collapsing office structure. View it as nothing more than a stepping stone to more palpable yet lateral jobs in sales that require experience. If this is your first sales job, you will learn a lot about the transactional process and even become inspired by the businesses you work with. 
The management is young and full of energy, and you will probably make some of your best friends here. Commission structure is modest (but only 10% of people really benefit from this) but it barely offsets the HORRIFYING 20k base. 

There are occasional happy hours subsidized by your manager’s dime, if you’re lucky.","Extremely maniacal expectations. Your work hours are 8:30-12, 1-5:30, and during those hours, you are expected to only be dialing, which the occasional (quarterly?) one on one coaching session with your manager. There is excessive amounts of pressure from management, with virtually no contact to upper level management beyond the sales floor. They absolutely abuse the ambition of their reps (this is no fault of the senior management in the sales office) and do not pay you for the “not mandatory, but if you want to be successful, you better show up” trainings, which makes the occupation of management incredibly exhausting and they’re left spinning their wheels. There was a lot of promises made to reps during the acquisition, which inevitably fell flat. Half of the floor is left calling into the same batch of leads with business owners who have already expressed disinterest and yet, we are still calling them every 60 days to beg for their business. You are able to source from these leads, but only on your own time. The resources that are available to you to be successful are overwhelmingly only available before or after shift, which perpetuates the lack of work-life balance. The company is divided between two radically different floors, and alcoholism and drug abuse is rampant for the sales reps and management. 

Don’t even get me started on the actual process...yes, you will learn valuable cold calling and communication skills, but you have to be downright offensive at times. I can only imagine the burden to a business owner who gets called up by a random stranger, claiming to have a relationship with them (also the communication between this office and the Scottsdale office is a joke, GoDaddy has done literally NOTHING to educate their account management of the acquisition or our sales process, leading to many reps being burned by mistrust from the clients). They are bringing in an incredibly high volume of clients that the account management and content teams can’t keep up with, and our retention is purely thanks to high pressure sales, auto renew, and an excessive amount of red tape to cancel. I’ve had nearly 80% of my accounts cancel within a year, and I’ve put a ton of work into setting the expectations that the company demands we lie about. We oversell the entire process, and fail to perform for our customers roughly 95% of the time. We knock it out of the park for others, by the grace of god in case someone asks to see an example of our work. If you are looking to HELP local businesses, get far FAR away from social media marketing. GoDaddy Social, Outbound Engine, Kakui, Yelp ads, Dr. Genius, etc. are all designed to make their money in up front contracts and DO NOT PERFORM TO RETAIN CUSTOMERS. 

The warning system is assanine and you can make the company $5000 one month, and lose your job 2 months later. They do not care about your track record, and they will make you feel absolutely inadequate if you cannot suck it up and finagle some desperate business owners. You will be fired for not making money off their recycled, garbage leads and you will be ridiculed if you cannot invest your life into this company."

This IS NOT the same company that people brag about all the time. Dont get me wrong, they have LOTS of benefits.

1023,GoDaddy,Sales Call Center Pretending To Be Technical Support,2019-02-24,2.0,Hosting Support,"Great offices and amenities such as full gym, supplemented meals and decent benefits.  
Very casual work environment and dress code (jeans, shorts, flip flops).
Friendly and supportive co-workers.","GoDaddy's success was built on a reputation of fantastic customer service and 24/7 tech support.   Arguably, GoDaddy may have started as a discount domain and hosting company, but what set them apart was their world class tech support.  Today you can find cheaper hosting plans and cheaper domain registrars but you are hard pressed to find 24/7 support.  Yet the current management seems to be doing everything in their power to erode the very thing that set GoDaddy apart from their competition.  New sales are all that matter.
GoDaddy's management has consistently diminished their technical scope of support while adopting a ""up sell over support"" mentality.  As I write this, there is not a single tech support department option for their customer base.  When a customer calls in for technical support the ""tech support"" team is required to attempt to sell them a new product, regardless of their issue.   Their customer base is frustrated and starting to wise up to this pathetic, ""Jiffy Lube"" sales tactic.
Meanwhile, employee attrition rates are shockingly high.  My training class had roughly 20-25 people in it.  Within the first 6 months, 14 of those employees have left and I know at least 5 more (including myself) are actively looking to leave.   That is an employee attrition rate of well over 70%.  Rather than retain employees with a high level of technical skills, GoDaddy's management chooses to increase sales quotas, which leads to higher employee attrition and loss of their customer base.  GoDaddy is in a downward spiral and management is failing to address it.  For all the new sales they are brining in, much of the potential profits are being squandered on new employee training costs.
If you are looking to join a sales call center - no tech experience needed! (or wanted)  This is the job for you.
If you are serious about your tech career, avoid GoDaddy at all costs (at least the ""Hosting Support"" role)."

I was so excited to finally have my vacation time double after putting up with there Bull Sh*t for years it's finally going to pay off, WRONG..... Ok real truth, over the years their pay scale has dwindled to a trickle. Their commission Scale, a joke YES Commission, not bonus scale.  Commission scales almost always over forecasted then they reel it back the next month when they realized they made a mistake. Don't worry about the people that did not hit their ridiculous minimums. They write you up on performance issues and fire you. All, because of management's mistakes.

 THIS IS NO LONGER A TECH SUPPORT SERVICE!!! THEY ARE SALES, REPEAT SALES COMPANY. They push out products with severe flaws they de-educate or dumb down their customers.  This customer may have an actually good product they are using and are told it's obsolete and force them to an unproven, bug filled, cookie cutter product that doesn't even replace what they had. Result now new site makes you no money and you lose any SEO your site ever accrued. This only costs you business, TIME, money & this will be pushed on you every time you call in for help to a simple fix. They knew about severe bugs and continued to sell it for years. Keep in mind this was no small bug if you had an online store and your customer orders and the inventory didn't update so now your selling the same ONE -OF A-KIND product 10 times before you realize what's going on. Then you get to go into Customer recovery mode apologizing, refunding money, avoiding building bad reviews all because they want to make a 3000%  profit on a bad product for their shareholders. 

Majority of the new hires are barely high school educated with zero technical support. Let alone no experience running a successful business, internet marketing, SEO Results. BY THE WAY, THEIR CREDO IS FAKE IT UNTIL YOU MAKE IT in training this can take 6 months!!! I don't want anyone recommending problems for my business because they can't properly train and or keep good agents. Let alone they are de-educate you or dumben you down. Now you have paid the price of ignorance and starting all over again for no reason just so they can get a few pennies in commission. All you're trying to do is succeed. When you call them they have been trained to fake their lack of knowledge, skills, and abilities as long as they do it with confidence

How about after two years developing Carpal Tunnel Issues. Then company including upper management and Inhuman resources ignore the fact you injured push it off. All of their attendance and workman's compensation or leave processing is done by third parties that cant return a call or email. They lie to you tell what to expect then deny a well-qualified absence documented by Doctors. In return can cost you your job. Not to mention the last two years of my career at Godaddy I was transferred to a brand new department promised a 25% increase in pay. Every 3 months VP of Sales and support would come down give some lame speech how they are working on a budget and can't afford what they promised for over two years.

Titled ""Great Values - Awesome Team - Fantastic Learning Environment + Development"" it wasn't even a very good attempt by them to appear real as 1) Even the most positive job experience will leave you with areas that you believe can be improved. 2) It is a blend of those two particular peoples communication styles. 3) ""Senior management door always open if you have any question or you need help on anything (even if they might incur in overtime to finish their own tasks)"" is an obvious response from someone who has suffered a hit to their ego and just had to respond. 4) The part about massages ""(yes,massages!)"" just reeks of management trying to be ""cool"" and pretending they care."

I really don't think they pay us enough to continue cranking out ""creative"" content day in and day out. My takeaways from this position were how branding for businesses at scale could be improved greatly and how to properly communicate across different departments.

I think since the recent acquisition, there's still a lot of room for improvement and growth considering this was only a start-up at first (MSH), but this salary isn't sustainable for someone who lives in Austin. 

If you go out of your way to go above and beyond, just know that you aren't being compensated for that work and you'll only receive a high-five. I know our managers can't do much on that end, but there are very little incentives to want to do more than the bare minimum.

Lastly, I took this job thinking that there would be much more room for growth, but I haven't learned anything new than what I've learned in training. That is the biggest disappointment to me above all else. Granted, I have been here for less than a year and I am a bit impatient. I just think I expected too much from this position."

You have close to 200 clients who pay anywhere from $100-$500+ a month, grossing usually at least half mil per year for the company, and you'll be getting paid <5% for it. What great margins they must have! The work load is a lot until you get used to it and it is tedious beyond belief. Another thing I've seen a lot and WHOLEHEARTEDLY agree with is that the amount of customers you have does not allow for any creativity. It's extremely unsatisfying to leave work every day knowing you produced much less than your best work because you're pressured to get so much done. What a life.

If you are, you can just ask to get things taken down a notch for you. I also love how everyone chooses their hours.

I’ve read plenty of reviews that claim Main Street Hub purposefully lures in college students with false promises. This is, in part, true.

Before I became a Community Manager (now titled Content Specialist), I was told there would be numerous opportunities for professional development through special events with public speakers, internal teams, and promotions. From 2016 to 2017, I witnessed those opportunities evaporate as my internal team was disbanded, there were only two public speakers over the course of the year, and pay remained stagnant.","The Content team increased book sizes multiple times knowing that their employees would only be able to stay afloat by producing sub-par content. Unfortunately, nearly all of my coworkers sincerely cared for their customers and were often dissatisfied with the work they had to deliver due to unrealistic time constraints, poor tooling, and mismanagement.

I came on with a hiring class of ten -- two years later, two of us remain. Big picture: I’m thankful for all that I’ve learned, but I feel awful knowing the core of this company, Content, is treated so unfairly and underpaid.

I get a couple bagels each week, free coffee, occasionally fun team-building events (we waited four months for a holiday/Christmas party this past year), a chance to join the larger GoDaddy team, the chance to move into a spacious office on the east side of town, extremely smart coworkers as well as extremely sad coworkers that can sense their squandered talent."

So, if your not good at sales you won’t be making much money and will likely not have a job for the long term. I started 11 months ago in a new hire class of 15 and including me there’s only 4 of us left. I know a lot of people that left could not keep up with the sales requirements. So if your not good at sales or if you don’t enjoy talking to people with technical issues and convincing them to buy stuff this job is not for you. It is a phone job so you will be talking to some angry people which can make the job stressful. Since it is a phone job your going to be glued to your desk for your entire shift minutes lunch and breaks. 

With all that said it’s not a bad place to work it’s just really not for people that don’t like having sales metrics they have to meet and if you don’t like talking to people all day long your going to be miserable."

1078,GoDaddy,Like the first house you buy - great place to start and great place to retire,2018-11-28,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"If you're starting out, GoDaddy is an awesome first company - you get a good balance of ""do grunt work to get better"" and work life balance / not getting overwhelmed. Other engineers are generally helpful and supportive, so you won't feel like an idiot / feel like you're bothering somebody by asking for help

If you are terminal in your career (e.g. senior software engineer), GoDaddy is also a great place to work.  As long as you get your work done (bonus: most of the work you do isn't challenging anyways), you have good work life balance and decent benefits. GoDaddy is hands down one of the best places to rest and vest.

After Blake took over and instituted culture change, the company has made great strides in hiring diverse software engineers - you should definitely apply here if you are a woman, LGBTQ, or an underrepresented minority

Fast promotions - with a supportive manager and if you do enough ""visible"" work (or if you're really lucky and are on a high-profile team), you can get promoted relatively fast. I have seen new college grads become senior software engineer after 2 years","Eroding benefits - for example, first, PPO100 got axed, then PPO90 wasn't fully covered (but PPO80 was), then -- surprise surprise, PPO80 wasn't fully covered either

Pay - despite what management tells you, your pay is just a bit under market. I wasn't significantly underpaid, but just enough to make the stay vs leave calculus favor staying

Product - some teams toot their own horn but ship really underwhelming product/features

Silos - company-wide, each location generally operates as its own silo (e.g. SF vs Sunnyvale, Scottsdale vs Gilbert vs Tempe) as well as each org (hosting, domains, productivity, etc). Even within orgs, in general, teams operate siloed off from each other

WLB - some people really live up to the company value of ""live passionately"" to the point where sometimes you wonder if they're even pulling their own weight

Fast promotions - should someone with only 2 years of experience really be a senior software engineer?"

5. Health insurance used to be free and now no longer is but it’s way more affordable than most other companies","Where do I start?
1. Culture change - jobs being outsourced overseas even though Godaddy originally stood for keeping support local 
2. Career pathing - a member of care has an extremely hard time making the cross over to technical Corporate. There is barely anymore career pathing and majority of the TC jobs are external hires. It’s become a who you know club versus how hard you work, how qualified you are and results 
3. Job postings, every job requires 5-7 years experience even though it’s labeled entry level
4. Continuous over turn in customer care. They are constantly downsizing support teams to make PNL and they have a rush to rehire for busy season. 
5. The supervisors and managers in Iowa are paid the same as sups and manager in Arizona where the cost of living is much hire compared to Iowa. Here’s an idea: change the salaries of Iowa employees that reflect their cost of living. If an employee from Arizona was promoted to a position in Kirkland their salary would have to compete with cost of living. Why isn’t the same for Iowa employees? OR! Shut down Iowa. 

Im sick of seeing hard working people who deliver results never get promoted, never get interviews for position they are qualified for over external
Hires who know nothing about Godaddy culture, it’s product, employees or customers who also don’t bother to learn any of that.

Don’t work here if you want to advance into management or any kind of technical corporate positions."

There has been tremendous growth but company overall is very poorly organized. When you get hired you think you are becoming part of an excellent company. The enterprise management system was poorly implemented and there’s very little support for all of the issues that are constantly surfacing.

What they fail to tell you is that you will be stuck on 3ed shift 10:30 pm to 8:30 am or 9pm to 6am including weekends for a min 2 years and you can only get 1st shift 8am-4pm or 9am-5pm if someone quits or gets fired and NO ONE is leaving if they have that shift.  Must maintain 96% ready status or they will take your bonus, which can be quite large $500 to $3000 a month.  So you end up working through your breaks, (you add that you took your break but still stay on the phones)  sitting for 9 and a half hours is tough.  Very high sales quota per day, start at $100  then end up having to hit $1000 + every night, which is hard when something breaks and 99% of the calls are upset customers, which happens a few times a month... think about it if you don't sell $1000 one day the next you have to sell $2000 and on and on it goes, seems like they don't want to pay bonuses as they have SEVERAL ways to take it.  The worst for me was one day I went to clock in and my computer wasn't working and I had to move to another one, causing me to clock in 30 seconds late (good thing I was always 10 min early) but my sup said he would fix it and he didn't because he forgot...I lost $2300 because of that.

I saw many people get jobs as managers they didn’t deserve. I saw people that were way more qualified than their counterparts yet someone else with 0 knowledge would get the job. This shows friendship in the workplace goes a lot further than merit. 

During OVERSEAS to: Mexico, Colombia, Philippines, Ireland, Bulgaria. Some people were selected without interviews and got sent there. The people that got sent were always good friends with the managers but did not have much to teach. If you call GoDaddy and notice how bad the quality has gone down it is because they can’t train anybody. The people in those positions are below par, very friendly with upper management tho. 

They don’t really care about the customer. I always sold really good, but without the need of lying. Many people there just lie to get sales, then someone else has to fix it.

At one point I was fired, given an exit interview, and escorted off the premises.  The next day I was called and asked to come back in, because they had accidently confused my employee number with another employees.  They literally did not bother doing the work in make sure they were firing the correct employee.  The amount of stress and emotional anguish that caused me cannot be put into words.

CSR's are not, under any circumstances, allowed to to hang up on a customer.  On several occasions a furious customer threatened to kill me and my family.  Not only did my supervisor refuse to take over the call, I was not permitted to hang up until the customer did.  Meanwhile, I was being disparaged to my face by my team leader for being on the call for too long instead of taking new calls and making sales.  The call where my life was being threatened.  That I was not allowed to terminate.  Wrap your head around that.

I applied for a half dozen promotions.  Given my attendance, performance, and numbers, as well as my education background, I met all of the criteria.  Each time I was written up several hours before my promotion interview, and then informed that as I had a write up, I was not eligible for promotion for the next six months.  A supervisor noticed me distraught the second or third time this happened and was finally honest with me:  because I was in the top tier of sales each period, the company would not advance me, as they would be losing the money I was making in sales.  Again, wrap your head around that.  You literally cannot be promoted if you do well.

I developed severe depression due to the constant stream of passive aggressive insults by a team leader, eventually filing for and receiving FMLA.  Once I was prepared to return to work, I was informed that I could not until I sent a letter from my Doctor explaining my period of absence.  I did so.

They took a week to process it.  I again tried to return, and they told me I would need to get a second letter explaining my absence during the week from the receipt of the original doctors note.  I did so.  They took several days to process that, and requested an additional note to explain my absence during that time.

This happened several times, until finally my Doctor advised me he could no longer continue to provide notes as it was a waste of his time."

I pointed this out and how the campaign I was on was all do not contact accounts meaning it was actually illegal for us to be calling them.  On top of this midway through the month they called a department wide meeting where they gave the entire department 2 weeks notice to move from iowa to Az or take a 10% pay cut because we were doing to well, otherwise we would be choosing to resign from godaddy.  When we switched departments they did not honor pre planned vacations that had been approved they told us they would but they ended up not being able to.

This has led to a high turnover of staff, with several employees joining and leaving in the space of two years (some of whom left without even securing new jobs).

- no compassion towards family bereavements
- disgusting attitude towards anyone who is returning from medical leave no matter how serious
- casual racism 
- favouritism towards  staff where they are given liberties if they are in the good books
- discrimination against those suffering from mental health problems 
- disputes are usually over petty matters with childish reactions displayed such as passive aggressiveness

They make it impossible for new agents to make it between this new Wow experience where you have someone in India listening to your calls looking for the keywords in every call making sure you attempted to sell a customer on that call or 20 questioned them to get more information out of them. They then say ""we want a consistent experience"" while the inconsistency comes from lack of training, new agents simply don't know about our products they are hiring people without tech backgrounds and without any knowledge of our products then given a total of 80 hours of classroom training to figure out all of it and it simply is not enough since half of that time is learning how to sell. Now you are forcing out agents that are doing the job well because you are requiring them to read a script change how they approach situations even if their sales numbers are fine their CSS is fine. Worked there 5 years, never had an issue hitting sales numbers never had an issue with customer service scores and I know more than 90% of the people that work their simply due to experience at this point, yet my jobs on the chopping block because I don't want to prod the customer and have awkward conversations based off ques from a script."

1162,GoDaddy,Sales Job Strict Metrics  Now Outsourced Overseas,2018-04-24,3.0,Bilingual Customer Service Representative,Very good modern-looking environment.  Good trainers. Looks good on resume. It is a well-known company and a diversified work environment with a liberal atmosphere.  Cubicles are decent for the work performed.  Small gym for employees.,"This review is strictly about bilingual Spanish/Portuguese employees. Both Spanish and Portuguese-speaking departments have been relocated to Monterrey Mexico and Bogota, Colombia, respectively and leaving many bilingual employees without a job or with a handful transferred to other departments, if they qualified due to skills and tenure with the company.   Inside the  Portuguese/Spanish departments you'd find some nepotism and who knows who type of mentality.  

The Brazilian department ended up with empty desks as most calls originating in Brazil were being answered by an office in Colombia.  Undoubtedly a cost-cutting move. Most agents meeting daily sales goals  - every call a sales call motto - would have those some goals increased by supervisors. If you sold $150 a day, it would now be $250 and so on.  Each one-on-one meeting would remind you that to ""keep your job here""  you had to meet this or that new goal,  creating more pressure on employees to sell more and more.  Bonuses were offered if  you can have near perfect metrics and they are very strict numbers. 

Many people were simply giving notices or quitting altogether.  Others tried to unsuccessfully transfer to another department. Lots of goofing off going on in the Portuguese language support, disguised as ""part of the company culture"" resembling a bunch of 12-year olds horsing around, many times the horseplay involved  the supervisor and  a so-called coach.

Weekly  team huddles were generally held  smack in your work area so while you are on the phone with a customer, your supervisor is ""dictating"" so you cannot hear or talk to the customer without background noise. Not sure why they couldn't simply go into an office for such meetings. There were plenty of empty offices within 25 feet.  

Team meetings were more ""do this or do that if you want to keep your job""  as if employees were living in the 1950's with the supervisor dictating orders instead of motivating and appreciating collaborative efforts.  In essence, nearly everyone feared losing their jobs.  

Calls could be brutal in terms of unhappy customers but that's most call centers.  If you take the time to read the other reviews here, you will get an education about what working at GoDaddy is like.  It went from great to so so-so to  just another job.  It keeps changing for the worse, in my opinion.  

The food in the cafeteria  became worse and worse and food workers were way too slow when you are on a 30 minute lunch. Not to mention the times your work schedule gets messed up and they allocated lunch when the cafeteria is already closed. Bring your lunch bag with you!  

I doubt you will see GoDaddy hiring many bilingual agents that reside in the U.S.  That's pretty much over. In my opinion, GoDaddy had its glory days now it's just another call center with extreme metrics and a turn-style door.  You are just a number and treated as such.  Of course, sooner or later, being just number equals zero."

I've seen people let go who truly wanted to help but couldn't turn it into a sale.
You will be asked by angry customers to fix problems beyond your control.  Example would be Wordpress.  This is not a GoDaddy product, but since a few people know how to troubleshoot, entitled customers will call and expect you to fix their mistakes.  You will have to deal with verbal abuse.  I found out turning the volume down in headphones on those people helps out a lot.  If a customer asks to speak to a manager, your manager will do everything in their power to NOT take the call and force you to deal with it.  You can not hang up on a rude, angry customer.  They will tie up your line until you find a way out of it.  I actually figured out two ways to disconnect on these people and I was never caught.  This was my experience."

Nope, sales has to troubleshoot. My supervisor wasn't helpful, my teammates weren't helpful, basically as soon as you get out of training you are on your own. It was such a joke, they say that everyone works as a team but I've never felt more isolated in a job environment before. I guess it was tougher as a woman, from the office I was in and my experience it was a real ""dude's club"".

I've  also been called stupid by multiple male customers and had to stay on the line with them and my sup told me to diffuse the call. Again, are you kidding me? Your employee is being verbally abused and being call derogatory names and you want them to stay on the call? That's how you enable customers, they think they can get away with things like that now. Congrats, GoDaddy, you've produced the meanest, laziest, useless customers on earth because you allow your reps to be abused and spoon feed these customers.

3. They went public as a company and ever since they have been pushing many many changes that have negatively impacted the environment, culuture, pay, and morale for employees and even customers....well at least the ones in the trenches. 
4. They provide good pay for how physically demanding the jobs are not and excellent benefits but it is just barely enough to keep working there until the rare chance to find some place that compensates the same for the level of work required.

Product roll out is a joke, quite often many products are setup so wrong and the vast majority have no clue how to support.   They quite often justify the selling things to customers as solutions but more than not those in itself create more problem due to absolute lack of care given to education of products and how things work. The only thing that is measured at this company that matters is if you can hit the sell button.  The leadership in place as well only role is how to find ways for you to sell more than things."

They change constantly and if you ever miss one according to them it's on you even though everything about their system is flawed!!!! The vast majority of people they screw over are on bonuses. Everyone who misses metrics for calls per hour missed with the same number 3.19 instead of the 3.2 needed. None of the management thought that was strange or ironic!! They never bothered to look and see that some people were handling two to three times the amount of calls as others on the same shift!!!  When they finally figured it out over a year later and removed that metrics did they return all that bonus money withheld????  No, because that would 
 be too easy and the right thing to do. 
When Bob ran the company he took care of the employees because they would take care of the customers!!! When they went public that stopped being the case for employees and customers. Training is awful and they farm out a lot of their services overseas for cheaper less reliable working for nothing subcontractors that have never talked to or dealt with the customer to have any clue what they want which only leads to headaches hassles and unhappy pissed off customers!!"

*Very cut-throat mentality.  Supervisors are doing daily competitions among employees to see who can get the most sales and winner gets a price.  They are always putting employees, and specially teams against each other. 
*Every month sales quota seems to increase.  No one is happy because the stress is overwhelming.  It is so overwhelming, that you will inevitably begin to do sketchy and unethical means in order to reach your daily sales goal.

-$2 meals

-amicable time off

-2 free beers a day in a speakeasy","This is a sales job. As echoed by many on these reviews, it does not matter where your survey scores are, as long as you're above minimum. The employer replies insist that it's a consultation job, both sales and tech support, but the calls are all determined by a ""queue"" system (in this company, you're skilled to take certain calls, excel in one field like css and first call resolution, and you're skilled for and take more tech calls, make big orders or have a high conversion and you're skilled for sales calls.) If you don't sell a customer a product, you didn't help them. It's as simple as that. ""If you have to downgrade something, why didn't you convert them on something else to make up the deficit in profit?!?"" Is what the sentiment really boils down to. This job is literally all about gaining the trust of the prospect, and then using that trust to make a recommendation and then sell it.

This leads to harder calls for some, and lap sales for others. I've yet to determine whether it's supervisors who manage this system, or managers/upper management that determine this, but I do know it exists. I've experienced many examples of taking calls before others based on the queue boards we have available that show us how long we've all been waiting between calls, and when this happens they're predominantly tech calls.

They've started rapidly expanding non-us support, having agents in manila, philippines start taking calls/chats with customers. This, coupled with ever increasing sales goals makes me wonder if they're trying to force US support out aside from the top sellers in an effort to avoid having to provide severance packages to US employees. To be more specific on sales goals, we moved to an all new sales target model in q3 of last year. your goals are all based off of new products you sell, and these goals have consistently gone up to between $50-$100 per day, per month, with the official reply being ""we're still testing the waters to see how customer care can handle it."" Upper management doesn't care that this is affecting how much we make (bonus is based off tiers, higher goals = harder to make more) and they especially don't care that it may determine who does or does not keep their job.

Regarding poor performance; because of lofty sales goals, somebody in upper management had the genius idea to come out with a coaching plan called ""be extraordinary."" So aside from hitting our minimum metrics, if we consistently perform/score low on certain aspects of our job, we may get written up because we're ***at risk*** of missing our minimum numbers and may get written up for missing minimums. Yeah, that makes sense.

They provide a user voice forum to take suggestions from the general employee population, but lately we've just been told no time and time again. There was recently a suggestion fueled by 3000 votes (a person can place up to 3 votes per topic) to bring back bi-weekly bonus payouts, we were given positive delayed responses for about 5 months, and then ultimately told no. Through numerous brown bag sessions this has been brought up, and at the last one we were told to stop asking about it or else everybody would be moved to salary with no commission/bonus. Since that 3000 vote, there have been several other posts about moving back to bi-weekly bonus, but they've all been shot down. In terms of employee wants, Godaddy seems to operate on a give/take basis. They may give us something that we request and vote for, but then they'll take something away, and then take something else away or change something negatively that'll impact the customer care population. With the combination of changing to a monthly bonus payout, and additional tinkering of phone queue's, I literally took a paycut of $15,000 a year. They don't want to move back to bi-weekly bonuses because it means they'll have to pay out more both to accounting and us, it'll be easier to tier higher and make more with lucky sales, and they'll have less control over how much we make because tinkering with sales goals won't affect bonuses as much as it does with the monthly model.

Lastly, advancement is a frustrating grind. I don't want touch too much on this to protect my anonymity, but in the multiple years I've been here, I've havent moved up at all and I've tried at nearly every opportunity I've been qualified for."

1254,GoDaddy,Toxic workplace where hostile work environments are tolerated and rewarded,2017-11-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"No dress code, subsidized lunch, free snacks and beer.","Speaking in general terms, this is a company that is heavily in debt and lacks a cogent mission.  Despite going public in 2015, the organization remains controlled by private equity and largely serves as a vehicle to extract value to enrich its venture capitalist shareholders and executives, rather than operating as an enterprise that legitimately seeks profit and market share.

Speaking in terms of my personal experience working here, this is a company that touts a dynamic culture that celebrates diversity, inclusiveness, and respect for its employees.  In reality, nothing could be further from the truth.  Beginning a few months into my employment, my supervisor began subjecting me to a textbook hostile work environment. As an experienced professional I had been well trained in this topic, but I had never been on the receiving end of it personally until GoDaddy. This person began the harassment with subtle comments like ""where do you want to be in six months"" that escalated in the following weeks into daily cycles of personal insults and disparaging comments related to my ability to ""work with millenials,"" thinly veiled threats to terminate my employment, constantly shifting priorities, withholding of needed resources, and the arbitrary assignment of impossible tasks and project deadlines. The harassment seemed to be linked to the supervisor's plan to secure a promotion for himself/herself by a specific date. The supervisor ensured there were no witnesses to these communications, which occurred in weekly one-on-one meetings as well as impromptu ""walks"" in which he/she pulled me aside to walk the GoDaddy grounds outdoors or in an empty office building on the campus out of earshot.

After several months of steadily worsening treatment, I reached a breaking point at which I could no longer effectively perform my job under the impossible, demoralizing conditions this supervisor had created. I reported the situation to HR, expecting they would address it. Instead, HR conducted a sham ""investigation"" in which they asked me almost no questions, interviewed individuals who never witnessed anything, then summarily concluded that they ""were unable to substantiate"" any of my statements. HR took no action whatsoever against the supervisor, nor did they make any effort to place me under a different supervisor or department.  So, I was left with no alternative but to give my notice and leave to remove myself from the situation in order to protect my health and sanity.  GoDaddy subsequently rewarded the harassing supervisor with the promotion he/she had been seeking."

you are required to sell at least $576 of new sales per day to keep your job, you have to have at least a 8.6 customer survey and be available for calls for at least 96 % of your shift.  Godaddy give over this persona of being all about customer service with a one stop care center when all they want from you as an employee is to root through the customers account while resolving their issues and sell them a product! Godaddy used to be a great place to work for but its all about the sales and if you miss out on any of your metrics you are put on a p.i.p ( personal improvement plan) i.e SELL more! Goaddy's big concern is having all their customers on Office 365! push it sell it sell the addons sell sell sell, the prices are low until the customer renews and by then its too late. you do make a bonus thats if you sell their products and if like me you dont have accounts taken off you and bigger sales moved over to another department!

Managements says one thing then does the opposite, example - they say we are expanding positions in a department, 5 weeks later tell over 300 people they lost their jobs to outsourcing and can apply within for a new position or leave.  we use to pride ourselves in USA based help. No we are moving out to Manila, Mexico, Brazil, India, Etc.... If you decide to work here be prepared to work your butt off for a pay check then for its requirements to change in 30 days so its harder to get the same pay.  They hare something called contribution which they change every 1st of the month so the tiers for pay change. Bonus manipulation at its finest... to control what pay outs they expect."

1325,GoDaddy,Good culture but runined by too many ex-microsoft hires,2017-06-22,3.0,Software Engineer,Modern technology stack at Godaddy!,"There are too many hires from Microsoft at Kirkland who bring in bad culture of stack ranking and passing judgement on people. Promotions are hard to come by for engineers who do all the hard work and ship products. Honestly, we don't need managers who are not technical contributors. They contribute nothing than bringing down employee morale. It seems company is run by people who can ""talk"" than who can contribute in some departments in Kirkland. Test org managers are pathetic (""SDETS"" or SDET ""people managers""). They are now having inflated titles like ""Senior Directors"" or ""Directors"" with ZERO technical skills and ZERO github contributions. These are harmful to company's growth than Blake realizes. I used to be proud of GoDaddy's values and engineering culture and feeling increasing disheartened by some of the new management from Sunnyvale and ex-Microsoft hires. GoDaddy's culture and employees are amazing and don't need such ex-Microsoft hires to steer company. We need people with good values and good technical skills for growth. 

Also, please fix the promotion system where managers talk senseless on what employees need to bring to get the next level promotion - cross team collaboration, visibility, joining forces are all the buzzwords soon tend to lose value if you're not appreciated. I used to value great work life balance and some test manager especially here and upper management are pulling GoDaddy 10 years back."

Godaddy will provide all the tools you need. Godaddy is inclusive and supports the LGBTQ community, Veterans, Women in Tech and encourages volunteerism in the community with paid volunteer days off! The medical benefits ore unmatched! The CEO and other upper management are very hands on and can be seen around the office daily. They do not lurk in the shadows like some other companies. As an employee you'll get to talk to them directly on many occasions.","The company has moved away from an ""America only CS base"" that was promised by its founder Bob Parsons; to outsourcing mostly overseas thus causing customers to have a bad experience just to save the company money. In result this also obviously translates to a bad employee experience as many were forced out of jobs they excelled at. This also creates an atmosphere of constant worry ""am I next?"""

This company is the definition of ""It it doesn't make money, it doesn't matter"".

No drug testing.","Nepotism, favoritism and highly questionable hiring practices abound. The company cannot seem to decide whether they are a financially responsible, publicly traded organization or a frat-boy mentality sales-focused call center. Promotions seem to be based on who you drink or party with over qualifications or skills. Recently started sending a LOT of jobs to foreign countries. Management seems to be managing more experienced workers out in efforts to hire cheaper and less knowledgeable friends into roles. The DNA of the company has changed drastically since going public in 2015. This is not the company it once was (read the 2016 & 2017 reviews). The call center side of the organization has had multiple leadership changes (most of them terrible) and seems to be treading water in regards to the culture and environment it once had. The pride of working at GoDaddy is gone, and it's just a sales, sales, sales call center job these days. Systems and technology are a mess. Leadership seems to be living in the past and the good workers are leaving at an alarming rate. Even the people who try to stay are having their jobs sent to the Philippines or Europe. The call centers are out of space in Arizona, so future hiring just looks to replace the smart people who leave. Limited opportunities for growth in the U.S."

As a software engineer there are plenty of resources and enterprise level assets behind me, but at the same time, I'm encouraged to take chances, learn on the job, and generally just be happy with what I'm doing. GoDaddy really focuses on making us feel comfortable at work. They provide an awesome lunch every day, they have super sexy modern offices with ergo everything including standup desks. Agile is a HUGE focus for engineering and it's actually practiced and applied in the correct way, not just having a ""standup"" every morning. Decisions for the most part really feel like they come from a current objective and sound horizontal structure. The last thing I'd say is that the management culture is fantastic. My boss is one of many development managers I know that just kicks butt. He's super respectful and supportive while also driving us to succeed, all while being a great friend in the work place.","The only cons I can think of have to do with the rapid growth of the company. As more and more people are hired as we grow, I think that it dilutes the growth of the culture by a small amount. I'm really grasping for straws here though, as I've worked for Amazon, Microsoft, and a few startup companies. GoDaddy by far is the best enterprise work experience I've ever had.

Even though the CEO and most upper management is focused on equality in the workplace, almost all leadership positions are held by young, white males. Middle management ignores upper management values. Single parents are pariahs, if they can't work 24/7 they can't get promoted.
GoDaddy leadership is so sales-centric, they literally tell people to find another job if they aren't hitting top sales tiers. GoDaddy loses skilled, caring, experienced representatives every day to supervisors who tell them to quit because they don't pitch products and blind sell on every call.
They've also made it so their representatives can NEVER have a Mon-Fri shift, because they felt it was a good move. Meanwhile, all of management works only Mon-Fri."
1340,GoDaddy,A company that grew on me!,2017-06-15,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The company had a bad reputation for their sexist super bowl ads and supporting SOPA a few years ago. I have to say it changed a lot and not only in surface. Recently I attended a ""how to be a male ally in the workplace"" training with the CEO, followed by a ""LGBT 101"" webinar a week later. The company matches donations year long, and even triples donations once a year. 

All middle management I had to deal with in engineering has been exceptional. Tolerant, open, listening. I currently have the best manager in my career.

My team is composed of highly qualified people that inspire me and from who I can learn a lot. We are constantly adopting new technologies to make our lives easier as engineers. We don't rush work, we do good stuff.","I am not crazy inspired by the products I am working on. We're not making war weapons, but we're not saving the world either. It's pretty neutral. That said, I'd probably feel the same for about 95% of software being written out there. So it's not just a GoDaddy thing, it's more a capitalism thing :)

I'd have to say Go Daddy has challenged me in ways I didn't know I was capable of.

I am beyond grateful I have this job with this amazing, in so many ways, company!","Learning tech support has been most challenging for me.

There are plenty of customers that are clearly mad at the products/rules and situations completely out of our hands will be blamed on you. Supervisors are not very knowledgeable, as they were probably reps for only a couple of months and have little experience. Oh, and God forbid you ever need their assistance as they will do anything to not take sup calls.

Great Health Care benefits.,"Although they brag that hiring is done internally, there is little to no movement. If you think getting hired as a rep is going to lead to a career off the phone good luck with that. GoDaddy is crawling with talent that will never be properly used and will have to leave the company to find a true promotion. Huge disconnect between Senior Leadership and front line staff.  Little to no control over decisions made that effect role. Rather than providing a decent base wage have to depend on bonuses, which get taxed heavily.  Very little flexibility or control over shift. Life happens and sometimes you can't know two weeks out you'll need time off, but GoDaddy has little flexibility for that."
1376,GoDaddy,The best I can say is... it's alright.,2017-04-26,3.0,Hosting Support and Sales,"GoDaddy has a lot of Pros to it. We have friendly people to work with, great insurance, they pay a majority of your food costs on-site, wonderful atmosphere, and plenty of room to work at your desks (it's not a cramped environment)

They're also very flexible about the usage of Sick Time. As long as you're not abusing the freedom you have. You can live freely knowing if you need to go, you can.

They pay out a commission on all products sold, but you must meet your metrics to qualify for the bonus (See Cons)

It ultimately appears that they do care for their employees to an extent.","There's quite a few cons to GoDaddy. Mostly the metrics, it's a sales gig no matter what department you're in. If you're on a phone, you're expected to be a sales man. So for people in Hosting Support where they came to GoDaddy to put their technical skills to work. It all goes to waste as you're constantly trying to meet your metrics. 

Metrics are high and hardly changing. The employees on vacation or approved leave are no longer accountable during that time. However; those at work are still hooked to the ball and chain that is the dollar.

Another flaw has to be the ability to progress within the company. We always have openings, but you are tied to your metrics for any position change. Just to advance within ""certifications"" here -- you have to have a required number of customer contacts before you're even allowed to take the 'test' to advance. So for those people who've been in IT for years, they still have to talk to THOUSANDS of people before they can ""prove"" they have server knowledge and skills.

It puts the employees who care about the customers and want to help in a crappy situation. 

A highly annoying con of being a phone-based employee is that you have no clue about any product or Front of Site changes until you stumble upon them. They send out newsletters daily with quick updates and blurbs. However 9 times out of 10 there's been additional changes that you won't know about. Until you're leading a customer there and look like an idiot when the method to get to or access something has changed. You literally have to backtrack the customer and find the new location or why it didn't work. 

GoDaddy is always changing, but only project/product managers and above are aware of these changes. If you're on a phone, you'll find out by yourself, randomly.

Biggest issue: Metrics."

GoDaddy brags about it's ""numbers"" (percentage of female workforce) in the press, but doesn't invest the energy into evolving their company culture to be more inclusive of women.

As a woman, it is a constant battle just to be taken seriously at GoDaddy. Racial and ethnic discrimination are also issues that go un-checked by HR, even when these problems are reported through the correct channels.

You must schedule vacation time three weeks in advance leaving NO room for emergencies. Your sick time DECREASES with every single minute for minute you may punch in late to work or back from lunch or early for any given reason. If you miss your numbers in the same 12 month period of a FINAL written warning (regardless of what the warning or circumstances are) you are out the door. And your metrics are all in play against you. You might make your numbers, but if you spent one minuted too long in the bathroom and your ""phone time"" is less than 96% you will NOT get paid any bonus/commission you may have earned. The turnover there is unbelievable. Then...if you miss your numbers twice in a 12 month period and are fired, they deny you unemployment using the excuse that you were able to make the numbers before so now, you are just not trying or interested in making them. All a LOAD OF CRAP! Very unfair, unreasonable and unattractive company to work for. I do NOT recommend GoDaddy.

GoDaddy doesn't care one iota for its customers, either. It's all a guise and completely about what else they can sell to the customers. The outbound calls are made on the muse that they are checking in on the customer. But the truth is it is only an excuse to try to sell them something else.

If you've always avoided sales and expect to learn that skill and grow in it don't waste your time. Coaching consists of sage advice such as ""ask more questions"" and drawing stupid graphs on white boards. You'll be expected to provide exceptional service to the customer, but at the end of the days that is not at all what matters. The almighty dollar is king and if you don't jump on board with that notion you'll be be gone fairly quick. Do just enough to make the customer go away, but make sure you sell them something before they do. Scare tactics commonplace to ""help"" the customer improve their business. The general customer you speak with has been conditioned to think email is free in general. That said the majority of calls are email password resets and walking customers through fixing email client issues.

I believe in many cases the upper management like August and Blake really do care.","No Career Longevity:
The culture changed from people caring about their jobs and building a career at GoDaddy.com to people that come from Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, etc to job hop and leave after 2 years. If you aren't an executive or job hopper and you actually care about the company or your career at GoDaddy, you get stuck at the bottom rung.

Bad Raises:
Have heard managers / directors say things like ""I don't give meaningful raises because everyone Job hops anyway, so its a waste to give people more money. ""

Bad Promotions:
In the last year, I think everyone that has gotten a promotion has been a new hire; those people rise quickly. Long term employees do not.

Bad Director Level Decision Making:
Because most of the management is new, they don't actually know much about how GoDaddy works or about domains or the purchase path.  And because their goal is to work there for short period then Job Hop, they make decisions that try to get product to market ultra quick, and make themselves look good without knowing anything about how it works. It just makes life tougher for the customer who end up with a crazy user experience and the developers for having to deal with chaos having long term necessary projects dropped in favor of something ""sexy"" right now.

Bad Developer working Conditions:
The company started to go agile and the correct direction about 3 years ago, but have completely gone backward recently with a lay off of several Product Owners / Scrum Masters / QA, in favor of managers and directors micromanaging. 

Internal Politics:
Because of new cultural phenomenon as the result of the above mentioned problems there is a ton of in-fighting over ""moving cheese"".  I heard a director once try to get another director's project cancelled because ""the JVM had bad garbage collection"", despite Java being the preferred framework at GoDaddy. At times working here is just humours. 

If you aren't in the ""Good Clique"" your not going to make it there. It's more about who you know than how you do your job, which is a newer thing.

Constant Reorgs:
Because people at the top leave so frequently, I have stopped bothering to learn the names of people at the top. If you go more than a month without a re-org affecting your reporting chain or how you communicate with another group it is a miracle

Despite all f this it's possible to thrive here at GoDaddy. If you would fit in at Microsoft, but are willing to work for less maybe because you are not as good then you are an ideal developer for GoDaddy."

Most long-term managers forced out. Massive cronyism with new management. In the old days the company was very good about promoting from within. Not anymore. Tons of new hires at the VP+ level so them and their bros can cash out on the IPO.
Tech departments are very bureaucratic. 
If you figure out a better way to do something, good for you, no one is listening. 
Massive technical debt that no one upstairs cares about paying. Well, if they do care, no one will give you the resources to do anything about it.

I almost forgot. The performance review process is arbitrary and upper management manipulates it to avoid giving raises. Reviews can get downgraded if your team/department has ""too many"" good reviews. 

Preemptive rebuttal: I know this is true about reviews, I witnessed it firsthand."
1452,GoDaddy,"Came for the food, stayed for the party",2016-11-30,5.0,Inbound Sales and Support,"Excellent Benefits, Melting Pot Culture: accepting of all, Lax dress code, Pay, Stock options, 401k, Position Options. I joined GoDaddy over 5 years ago and started as a customer service agent. A friend of mind said they were hiring and I needed a job while I finished my last few college classes and tried to figure out what to do with my life. Little did I know what it would turn into and I would be here for the longest time at a job in my life. While bonuses have changed and prizes are as rampant as they used to be, the core underneath is still the same. GoDaddy has given me countless opportunities, allowed me to stack up my 401k like a boss, buy a house, and travel the world. If you are in the customer service side of things, you will be expected to hit metrics and make sales. It's a business, they want to drive revenue. But if you take care of the customer, and simply do your job, you will not only make customers happy, but be happy yourself. I mean where else can you wear sandals shorts and hats to work and still make a living out of it (not that I would ever wear sandals). The environment is lively and full of every personality, creed, orientation, and view you can think of; and they are all excepted! When you walk through the doors everyone forgets who you are, where you came from, what you've done. It's one big family. Most of the management now, are people that I have grown up with here and walked the path with, which makes it all the better to work with/for. I wouldn't call it cronyism or nepotism, but rather the decisions and hiring is made based on the knowledge and understanding of a character they've seen and known for years. From people who have never gone to school, to others with masters degrees, we have it all. If you are looking for a place to grow and make lifelong friends while your're at it, you found the place. You've never worked a day in your life when you love what you do.","Same cons you will find at every company. You will find people you dont know. You will encounter changes that you dont agree with. Management will make decisions that you dont understand. But hey, that's part of business. People are still expecting to make $150k arguing with customers and slide through the day doing no work. This is a publicly traded company, they aren't interested in making you rich for doing nothing. Huge disconnect between C3/TC."

1458,GoDaddy,Was hired and whole team laid off within less than a year,2016-11-14,1.0,Web Designer II,"Benefits were good and started first day, which is great because they wouldn't have hired me for long enough to use them otherwise!","Basically exactly what another reviewer from October said, to an exact T.
Multiple rounds of layoffs, of which I was a part, so we could outsource a big chunk of the department's work to South America.... sure felt valued after that.

The only reason I am writing this review is because GoDaddy's response to another reviewer is flat out WRONG and full of FALSE information! Don't lie to people... admit you messed up in this department. NO ONE should have to work for the broken mess that is ""Professional Web Services""... just admit you messed up, because you did. 

Let's pick apart GoDaddy's response to the above reviewer, because I literally cannot believe they have the gall to post this right now:

""In response to changes in the website industry and best practices we changed how we're structured and how we can use creativity to better serve our customers.""
There are no changes in the website industry that require you to lay off a bunch of employees and outsource jobs to South America. Sorry, but try to invest in your employees and not be cheap. We were beyond good enough. 

""We now leverage industry standard themes for WordPress and Woo vs. creating our own from scratch, which impacted the team that used to build these for us.""
THIS IS A FLAT OUT LIE. GoDaddy NEVER had their own themes created from scratch. They used an existing framework (not including the name though I would like to) to create Child Themes that they basically skinned to look pretty, but were terrible for the end user experience... but all the same the GoDaddy responder here clearly has no idea how the system even worked... That framework was awful and it's good you aren't using it anymore, but custom themes from scratch? That never happened.

""We encouraged all impacted to consider other roles in the department and worked to place all interested.""
Not true. We were told we could take a job paying significantly less, or apply to other positions we never heard back from that would have paid the same. Basically there was no choice for us. No one that was laid off is still there because you did not make it possible.

""Our new approach has been better for customers as updates and support is present to keep sites performing, vs. having to attempt to support our own themes in a world of ever changing plugins and apps.""
Also a lie! All you would have had to do is update the framework, the theme (again, not naming the one specifically) you used for everything, to keep your own ""themes"" (child themes) up-to-date. It is NOT THAT HARD - but you never did ask anyone who actually knew before you laid them all off, did you?

""We do strive to be creative and scrappy, and leverage the best technology when it comes to building sites that are awesome for our customers and help them active their objectives online.""
LOL ""best technology"".... I'm sorry but if GoDaddy cared for PWS about best technology, they actually would have hired expensive senior developers to build a custom framework from scratch so they could be selling their own product instead of selling a million copies of Genesis, that were probably not all correctly licensed in the first place now that I think about it...

""Our creativity is displayed in the current and future functionality we're able to bring to customers site, combined with great design, that we never could before.""
This doesn't even make sense. How can you have any more creativity or functionality than before? You are still using themes. Also you laid off all the higher level creatives - your remaining staff do not even have design degrees for the most part! They are cheap hourly labor who know how to press the right buttons in WordPress. Shame on you GoDaddy. I literally never worked for a company that sold WORSE quality websites to people as you do. Past and future, anyone reading this - pay a freelancer or a web dev company, not the WordPress sweatshop that is PWS.

""We have launched new career paths and teams involving higher degrees of web technical skills, and now feature career banding and training for our teams to be able to build these skills.""
LOL you LITERALLY laid off the most technically advanced (though I'm sure you just saw us as expensive) people in the department. Your department head isn't a designer OR developer and doesn't know the first thing about either topic. So unless you've hired a bunch of new highly skilled people, which I know you haven't since I watch job listings, you are straight up lying through your teeth right now.

Moral of the story - DON'T DO IT! I was offered 2 other jobs at the same time as my position with GoDaddy, and I took the job with GoDaddy for the benefits and perceived stability. It was literally my worst ""professional"" working experience of my career. This department is a train wreck. And no you will not learn and grow - the only thing you will learn is how to make absolutely awful sites and convince clients that this is ok. Just don't do it."

Accruing time off is average at best but actually using the time you accrue is worse.  You nearly have to schedule a year out to use it.  Many employees get FMLA in order to use vacation time.

The company has done a full 180 since I started 3 years ago.  It used to be a fun, energetic, exciting environment every single day.  There were bonuses, prizes, recognition, and willingness to help everyone get better.  If you had ideas they were welcomed.

Now its a complete and total poop show.  Lower management doesnt know what they are doing and are quick to discipline instead of assist.  And if they dont like someone not only will they do what they can to get rid of them but they will LIE LIE LIE to get it done.  Senior management is clueless as well and several high ranking members are selling off stock in droves.

If you have health concerns, save it.  They dont want to hear it.

If you have an issue with your superiors do not go to HR.  They will make it worse.

No trust, no love for employees.  They cut bonuses so that high earning agents are forced out and are replaced with agents that will make less money but just be happy to be there.

Several jobs shipped overseas.

The customer service is at an all time low.  It used to be the pride of the company, but they dont care about the customers now.  If they did, they wouldnt be getting rid of employees that made them appear to be so great.

Go Daddy is no longer what they once were, nor will they ever be again.  They are money first, and if you arent part of the Good Ole Boys club you are dispensable.  Its amazing to me how many people get recruited into departments because their best friend is the manager or director.  

Moving up is nonexistant unless you are willing to take a huge paycut in the meantime.

Culture is ruined.  What used to be the most amazing place, and a place I looked forward to going to every single day has turned into a breeding ground for negativity.  The only people that dont complain are the new employees that dont know any better.  They dont know what it once was."

It feels like a family.","GoDaddy has gone downhill extremely fast within the last 2 years then they went public and it all became about money and making the people at the top the wealthiest while taking money from the employees who helped get GoDaddy to what it is. In the last month, well over 15 people have quit from a department of 45 with others from other departments joining them. I've never seen such a mass exodus of people. They are running long-time employees out the door like crazy and it's incredibly disheartening. The anxiety, stress and constant dread my coworkers are experiencing cannot be categorized as ""healthy"". Many people are being told that if they don't like it, they can leave. It's very rough and only getting worse. I'm looking elsewhere as well. It's very clear they no longer want employees around who have been with the company longer than a couple of years and that's upsetting. All of this just to pad the pockets of a few people. They've also outsourced to the Philippines and India, something the original owner vowed to never do. The outsourcing is directly taking jobs from people here in the US and sending them abroad where they don't have to pay people as much. It's very sad. The company is losing a lot of people that have been extremely loyal."

Most people are sick for a couple days and then you have no time left for any emergencies. The management staff is horrible after you get out of training there is no training there's no improvement. Anytime I would ask my manager for help she would just give me an attitude and tell me to figure it out myself. The commission structure changes constantly and they try and figure out any way not to make you money and because behind on their budget for the year they've decided to raise goals on unfairly so they don't have to pay out Commission.

Now it's strangers who own a 99 cent domain and a $12/year website and now it's going to be $124, and you are the guy who gets to break the news because we span their emails with 'deals' / 'updates' that they don't really want or need.

And there is a long history of concepts / slideware driven goals - which are not grounded in any dev estimation. Vision for nirvana is easy, understanding what it will take to deliver on a vision is crucial to building the right team, setting goals, making informed trade-offs and so on - and that work is too often left out.

There is a large disconnect between the company mission and the product deliveries. Teams aren't measured against delivering capabilities which bring the mission closer to reality - it's all short term balance sheet impact, all the time. That's sad and makes it an uninspiring space to work. The competition is going to crush this company."

- They recently started outsourcing their chat support to the Philippines.

- Holiday parties have been reduced to just a cheap attempt at capturing what was once the best day of the year (when Bob was around he would give out $1 million to employees but since going public they started to replace that with giving out cheap gadgets that the company gets in bulk for corporate discounts with affiliated companies).

- The supervisors and management are good at pushing you to sell products and services that customers may or may not need but they will not take the time to ever address serious concerns from their direct reports."

Any positive feedback on this website is Godaddy themselves .,"All i have to say is, if you are a lawyer in workers compensation, then you should look into this company. You would make TONS of money. I would compare them to a sweat shop, that offers you less and less pay the better you do. Their board of directors are the scum of the earth and will do anything to make a penny. They take away your breaks if you are falling behind. They find new ways to cut your pay and fill their pockets with it. I worked their 2 years ago, and still have friends that work there now. NO ONE likes working there. No one. If you work there, i promise you , you WILL quit. This is the type of company that doesn't put ANY value on their employees, and then try to mask it by having terrible ""catered"" food, and telling you that you can come to work in a shirt and shorts. Well, you can do that at alot of companies. My favorite is them trying to sell you on the work life balance. LOL Try showing up ONE minute late. You will be written up and on a 90 day probation. Your team leaders are afraid of their superiors who apply pressure. It comes from up top. Either way. I have worked for many companies and I swear on everything i love, that this is by far the WORST company i have ever had the displeasure of working for. Ever since Blake Irving came along, the company has turned away from their employees and more towards their board who are trying to get rich off your enslavement. I have so many stories with this company that you wouldn't believe. They are insanely careless with workers compensation laws, not only that, but if you complain, ,they threaten you that there will be no upward movement in your career if you don't keep your mouth shut and just do what you're told. You will also get written up. They are horrible people at the top of this company. stay away from them.  BTW, i'm not some bitter shmuck. I started in Customer service, and got promoted in 3 months to CDT, I was ranked #7 in new revenue and 18# in overall revenue when i was there.

It seems that if you are not 'in' with the higher ups, you don't move - you don't get promoted.

Worst part was how they always tried to spin how the pay cut was good for you and your family haha.  They stopped treating people like adults and started treating everyone like a number.  It made me really sad to see a place I imagined spending my whole career at, dive bomb down to a bottom of the barrel call center.

There is no job security, they can let you go for any reason at any time. If you're a top seller? You can do no wrong. Attendance policy is a joke. Don't ever get sick, you won't have a job because of it. You are now accountable for your sales construction if you have scheduled vacation!

You can listen to music at your desk, and if you do not work on the phone you can wear headphones and stream music or bring in a music player.

The medical benefits are really great, pay is also great.","Sometimes departments are dissolved or outsourced and the employees are expected to find other positions within the organization when there may be a lack of desirable positions or positions for which they quality, or other departments may have a hiring freeze. Typically to start at GoDaddy you must go into inbound sales and support and while a background in sales is not necessarily required, not having the ability to catch on to that skill will hinder your ability to thrive as meeting a sales minimum is required. Even if you find your way into another department which does not require a sales minimum, there is a possibility of things not working out with that department and being required to go back to inbound or find something else. Currently the reactive chat support department is being minimized in the US to be staffed mainly in the Philippines for example."

2. Nice facilities 
3. Some cool perks like discounts and deals for its members
4. A few cool people rolling around in there and a few great managers, too","1. Super high pressure about sales even when you're on a graveyard shift. They don't acknowledge shift differentials enough. There are simply times where tech support is more in demand vs. people calling to purchase. 
2. You get 0 rewards and incentivs for tech support calls. You get a little multiplier if you hit a certain tier of bonus, otherwise, nothing, so people get really frustrated with customers who need more help. You can have a 10/10 customer satisfaction ranking for your entire time there and it means nothing if you didn't hit your sales quota that night. They say they care about doing the tech support right but the only thing they EVER talk to you about is sales, sales, sales, sales. 
3. The part-time stuff is a mess. You have a few good managers and if you're lucky, you overlap with them. The other part of the time, there will be 30+ people with one overworked, stressed out manager and maybe an assistant. If you absolutely need a supervisor, you are forced to wait, usually to the point you're irritating your customers - and no matter how long it takes for you to get someone, you are supposed to make small talk with them to try and sell them stuff. 
4. Scheduling: In my experience, scheduling dept is the worst about returning emails or fixing things unless a supervisor goes down there to fix things personally. Emails don't appear to be effective at all. 
The recruiter glossed over some of the finer points of moving around within the company. I think if I had avoided inbound sales & support and just waited for the  position I'd originally applied for (it wasn't opening up for several weeks and I needed money, to be frank) I might have had a different tune about GoDaddy, because I think I might have liked it otherwise."

I found some things shady, the old mantra of doing right by the customer has faded a little. I spent years explaining to customers that in the 15 years I had been a customer godaddy has always given an in-store credit for any unused time on certain kinds of products. During my last few months I had to hear many old time customers complain about the change. I was not allowed to explain the loopholes that would allow them to get what they needed. I had customers call in who had purchased 5 years of a given product that was not optimal for their needs and have to turn around and tell them 30 day refund.

Like all small companies that grow large, it has gone through some ups and downs. If you roll with the punches this can be one of the best career choices no matter what position you take. I have worked in 8 different departments during my tenure. You can grow and move anywhere within the company. Just put forth the effort and great things will come. 

Pay and benefits are incredible. Depending on your department with a good amount of effort top employees make $100,000+ each year. I have for at least 8 out of my 13 years or darn close to it. 

Cash and prizes alone has equaled to nearly $75,000 for me personally. Name another company that is willing to give that much away to just one person. This company has given away millions to the employees and to help great charities.

Do what's right for the customer and feel good about yourself no matter what the outcome. 

The company is only as good as the employees. Without us the customers wouldn't come back. That is why I have stayed this long.

GoDaddy is a great company to work for if you like talking on the phone for hours on end and reaching ridiculous sales goals. A lot of money can be made here.,"GoDaddy values sales more than anything. They call it ""consulting"". I don't understand how it is consulting when a GoDaddy customer does not need most of the products GoDaddy sells them. I was horrible at sales, because I did not want to con people into buying crap they don't need. I like sales, but not the way GoDaddy wants its' reps to sell. GoDaddy also has a ridiculous attendance policy and a lot of people got canned or are on final written warnings because of it. Their policy is, you can only be absent if you have sick hours, otherwise its a final written warning. They do not even go through the standard process of a verbal, written, and then final written. The management in part-time is a disaster. It is not their fault, it is the company's for having one or two managers to a bunch of employees. Customers are on hold forever and get mad at inbound for having to go through multiple people just to transfer them to the department they wanted to go to. For some reason transferring customers to hosting is a big deal, although hosting makes sales off of them. I will never quite understand that. I would not recommend working here for your sanity.

You will have that time marked against you.  Not on the phone enough minutes of the day?  You will not get the bonus you worked so hard for.  They schedule group meetings, but that time counts against you being on the phones.  Like I said, a sweatshop.  You have to screw over customers who call for help.

So the only successful people I knew were the aggressive salespeople. The job is basically working in a phone room taking inbound calls... Calls that are being made because customers are in need of technical support.. not because they need help purchasing. You will get lucky every now and again and have someone calling in to buy (but that all depends on sheer luck). I guess I just wasn't very passionate about helping people and then having to try and sell them some BS internet products that they didn't need towards the end of the conversation. To each his own, though. If you're good at sales and don't mind being on the phone all day, go for it! You'll definitely do well here. Just wasn't my cup of tea."

Those who excel at this quickly find their way to promotion to advanced departments and supervisory roles, but those who struggle with sales in a technical support agent role will often feel stuck until they get frustrated and quit or become expert salespersons.

Once a person has proven their sales acumen they have the opportunity to work in nonsales departments and receive further professional training that is not focused on increasing sales.  I worked here for 5 years and was able to meet quota consistently enough to be able to move into an advanced department but was passed over several times because my sales were not as high as other candidates.  Other than this narrow-minded approach to human resource management Godaddy is actually a fun place to work with lots of energetic people and a laidback tech industry vibe.

To make matters worse, Directors and Managers change roles like a carousel.  Often time these people have their own little cliques which ends up putting you in a game of career Russian Roulette should your next boss hate your last boss and think you a part of their rival clique.  The coup de grace is that they are always tweaking compensation resulting in less pay for equal or better performance.

Godaddy loves to show their new call center with all the fun stuff to do...and there are people in the company that get to play around with those things and probably absolutely love their job. But those arent the people on the phone--those are the management and programmers. When you get a job on the phone you get 17mins per day off the phone and if you go over that then you will be put on a plan and eventually fired. And no Im not exaggerating when I say 17mins...they watch you like an absolute hawk as for how much your not taking calls and you get 17mins each day of time off the phones.

Solidly performing financially, stable growth, and job stability","Roughly two years ago, after the company was sold, the Network Org had a complete management change which included a lot of blatant cronyism within the team. People were hired without following long standing interview/review processes simply because they were friends with the new management. Many of these people were given senior roles, were arrogant, self-important, and showed absolutely no concern for the existing team, their tenure, knowledge, or experience. 
Since then, the Network organization has suffered a catastrophic loss of talented, experienced and tenured personnel - this despite countless individuals expressing their concerns to upper management and HR. It is a sad shell of the team it once was, and it is likely due to executive managements unwillingness to accept that they made a terrible mistake with the choice of leadership for the team.
The organization used to be proud, technically savvy, and agile, accomplishing some incredible things under tight timelines, budgets, and in an innovative manner. It now seems like it can't get even the most basic of things done and the new management seems to only care about avoiding making decisions and responsibility."

GoDaddy offers competitive pay and a flexible schedule – 2 must haves in my book.  There are many ways to get recognized, whether it be by your peers, or managers. The health benefits are amongst the best in the area. The quarterly offsite team building events help keep the team strong and focused. I get to compete with my CEO in weekly Fitbit challenges.  Plus, everyone knows we throw a rockin' Christmas party.

Very good company to work for if your not in C3 (sales) or PWS (Professional Web Services). Does have a history of under paying but you do get great benefits. 

I enjoyed my time on the sales teams in 2006 and my time in QA for three years. My six years in PWS was a mixed bag of enjoyment. 

Company gave options of taking a lower paid job or 2 weeks of pay for every year of service when laid off.","Overall Company 

Major changes when the company left hands of the founder. No longer cares about the employees as much and no longer gives good awards / bonus. Xmas party is a shell of its former greatness.

Company likes to promote friends of managers then employees with skills to bring to the table. Company has always had problems with career paths.

When company went public they gave $200 worth of shares to everyone not in management or development. You also did not get any more for years of service or past reviews. 2014-2015 felt like upper management main goal was to hire friends from other company's to enjoy the shares instead of the employees that had work hard for the last 8+ years getting the company to were it is now.

Metrics that are given to employees do not align with the best needs/service for customers. 


PWS Department

Company started to out source website builds and lying to customer that it is all done in house/ in the states. A team had been laid off for cheaper and less skilled employees to handle web design projects. The department always made a lot of money but hurting customers and employees was a better choice to make even more money.

Employees had been switched from hourly to salary to benefit the company when work load was high.  Senior management had threatened a whole team of the department to not take legal action on Go Daddy or they would lose there jobs. Also the same senior management made threats of killing off the team if improvements had not been made to key metrics. They found out he had the incorrect data and understanding of the role of the team.They did apologize to the team for a hour but 2 months later canned the whole team anyways.

In a meeting we had been recognized for being under staffed and two new employees had been added and shown to the team. During the same meeting two members had been removed from the conference room and fired during the same meeting."

1664,GoDaddy,A Haven for Developers,2015-12-28,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The current management team has aggressively taken on changing the culture to to allow it to operate in the fast paced tech company it now is. Adoption of open source and open stack infrastructures has greatly expanded the opportunities inside the company. They are providing training tools and encouraging developers to grow and expand their skill sets. Adoption of Agile is working to allow developers to concentrate on the work at hand rather than the constant distractions that are normal in IT. They encourage the ""fail fast"" approach typical of internet startups, which leads to thinking outside the box, creative design discussions, and some pretty awesome solutions that will make millions of of peoples' experiences better. That's pretty exciting.","It takes time to change the culture of a 5000 person company and the word is not out to everyone.

Fast pace and more of a thinking person's game. You'll need to hold up your end of the conversation when the ideas start flying during design or backlog refinement. It's not going to be the right environment for everybody."
1665,GoDaddy,SALES and...........tech support?,2015-12-26,2.0,Inbound Sales and Support,"- Health Insurance
- Decent Base (30k)  
- Potential to make good commissions if you're lucky, or if the algorithm decides to give you a good sales call.  
- Good facilities for a call center (wanna be silicon valley)
- Great learning experience, even though you basically train yourself in everything
- Some pretty cool people to work with
- At first drinking the kool aid is fun, then it becomes depressing, because you are so demoralized from your high expectations.","Where to start.....  Just because Tech companies are considered ""progressive"" do NOT be fooled, GoDaddy is a public corporation, and the ONLY thing that matters if the CORPORATE PROFITS and the shareholders.  Do not for a minute, think that the employees are prioritized in this company. 

The ONLY metric(s) that matter are $$$$$$ and calls per hour.  CSS (surveys) can ONLY hurt you, and your job depends on the ignorant and cheap clients who review you, often negatively because of COMPANY POLICIES.  The new surveys don't even let you rate the rep anymore, now the customers only rate the company.  So good luck to the future reps, they sure will need it.

First off, third shift employees get completely shafted.  They expect a $2/hr raise between the hours of midnight and 6 am to compensate for all the lost sales due to dealing with international callers (India, Southeast Asia, Australia and England) who are difficult to understand, cheap, technologically illiterate, and overall rude. 

When you get hired and placed on third shift, they keep insisting after 90 days you can switch.  I heard this over and over in ""training"" aka used cars salesmen lines to memorize, but in reality, there is a queue so long that barely anyone is able to leave third shift.  They will literally spend copious amounts of money hiring and ""training"" new people that they place on 1st and 2nd shifts, yet the highest grossing sellers on third shift are queued up for over 6-12 months to try and switch to a daytime shift.  Makes no sense whatsoever.  

Metrics, metrics, metrics.  Like many others on here, the fact that they expect you to hit minimum sales every two week period without any guarantee of fairness in regards to the types of calls you receive, is ridiculous.  Instead of hiring people for just tech support, they force the tech support reps to SELL SELL SELL.  So in reality, nobody wants to solve tech problems, because their JOB is on the line if they don't sell enough.  So instead of finding tech solutions, it was drilled into us during training to find a SALES solution to TECH problems.  Basically, if one of Godaddy's terrible products is having issues, our managements recommendation is to pressure the client into buying a different product, that this time, will ""fix"" the issue.  What usually happens, is one rep convinces the client to buy a product, does not help them set it up, does not get it working, finishes the call, gets his or her commission, and then the client calls back all pissed off, and now the tech that received no commission on the sale of the product is forced to deal with the angry customer who is now pissed because GoDaddy's management has instilled into its reps to basically just sell products customers don't need, and the reps are the ones who have to deal with the customers screaming at them on the phone.  

In addition to being screamed at and cussed at, you are literally NOT allowed to ever hangup on a client.  So, basically, for $15 bucks an hour, your expected to take all the abuse and anger from clients due to the new ""vision"" the company is pushing.  Oh yeah, and when the servers crash, don't expect to be able to offer anything to customers losing thousands of dollars, because the most godaddy will do is credit them a couple months worth of hosting.

So, if you enjoy ripping people off, being treated like garbage by clients and supervisors, having only 10 seconds between phone calls, troubleshooting email on phones with elderly technologically incompetent people, and a constant pressure that you will lose your job if you DO NOT act IMMORALLY, then by all means, this is the place for you!

Edit:  To those of you who think I am complaining because I couldn't make the sales, that is incorrect.  I hit my metrics every period, and bonus-ed well.  What I did not do, was go home everyday feeling like I helped people.  It felt more and more like I was sacrificing my values just to make $50,000 a year.  As someone with a four year degree, and now a better paying and more satisfying job, it is not worth sacrificing your values for a median pay job."

Training seems inconsistent for management in general, which can have a detrimental impact on your career path. Very large schism between Technical/Corporate and the Customer Care Center (C3). Technical/Corporate get the benefits that the company brags about, while C3 has a very short leash. It also takes forever for some departments to complete their hiring process (had one position, for example, take over 4 months total, between application, interview, and the job closing).

1671,GoDaddy,Love where you work?   Yes I do!,2015-12-11,5.0,Customer Support Lead,"I have been with Go Daddy for more than 4 years.  I love what we do as a company.  One of the things that impressed me right out of the gate is the desire to do what is right for our customers.  While we do have an environment where selling products and services to customers is what we do, we are also allowed and encouraged to help people get the right things for them.  If we see something that is not right, it is also encouraged to bring it up and fix it, when it is possible to do so.  
As a woman in a company dominated by men, I have never once felt passed over, put down, discouraged, or in any way treated negatively because I am female.  My contributions are considered on par with those of my male counterparts.  In fact, I feel I can be more ""me"" here than at any company I have worked in the past.   
The people make this company great.  While we are not perfect, we work to overcome where we fall short.  That's the best I can ask of anyone.","Just like every great relationship, we have to continually keep working on our internal communication.  In most cases it is good, but there are times when it is not, and that can cause frustration.  (this can be said for every company I have ever worked)."
1672,GoDaddy,Inbound Sales & Support,2015-12-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great base pay and commission potential. Awesome work culture with plenty of perks like 100% company paid benefits.,Lack of support from managers at times. Managers play favorites. Often disorganized processes and poor communication of changes.
1673,GoDaddy,No longer trying to attract top talent,2015-12-09,1.0,Customer Development Representative,"Good benefits, employee stock purchase plan, love the people i work with","This place has gone downhill bad. It all started once Bob parsons sold off, and the new VC firms came in. When bob started the company, it was known as THE place to be. His culture was amazing. Once he sold, it went away. No more money given away at the holiday parties, no more fun contests, and the commission structure has been cut repeatedly. We are all very aware another cut is coming soon in coming months. When i got hired, this was a SALES position. Now i spend HALF, not an exaggeration, HALF of my day taking inbound technical support calls. I am an experienced sales rep with 10 years of experience, I should not be taking technical support calls. Because I am unhappy taking tech calls all day, along with everyone else in the department, it causes me to sell less. Sales suffers because were doing tech support, and tech support suffers because were trying to make sales. Theres been rumblings from Executive management that the agents shoudl not be making more than their supervisors. Well every sales job, the TOP reps will and should make more than the supervisor. Godaddy used to want the TOP sales and tech talent in Arizona. Now they are pushing out people who have been here for 5 years, because its how a corporation owned by Venture capitalists works. They want to hire new fresh reps who would be happy to do tech support and make $65k a year... when in reality the top reps were all making over 100k. Now all of the top agents are leaving godaddy, and leaving the department of CDT which used to be the place to go. So many top reps have left, and despite the pending reply from management to this post, they dont care. They are trying to push us out, because we know how it once was. they dont want unhappy employees who used to make 100k but now make 65-80. They want new unexperienced sales agents happy to make 65k. 

Also, there is no where to go once you get to CDT (sales position) you can go into management if you brown nose and join the boys club. Many of the supervisors give you sales advice but i was on the phones when they were agents and they were horrible. 

It is clear, this is not a place attracting talent... That has shifted to companies like Zenefits, salesforce, citrix, and insight.... It also just so happens that these are the companies all the old GD employees are going. 

I referred 10 NEW employees to GD in 3 years, because it was an AMAZING job. i have reffered 0 in the last 2 years, because i would never recommend someone having to experience what myself and my colleagues have experienced."

The benefits are great compared to many comparable companies.  There is a rather casual nature to the job which opens up a lot of opportunity for fun, which the company is happy to provide.","Leadership is not often picked for their people management skills, but more who they know.  You seem to be better served rubbing elbows than you are working on the skills to perform your duty responsibly.  For those who feel a duty to assist the company and your fellow workers by taking on additional responsibilities or to pilot a new program, don't expect to be compensated.  I have first hand experience of this as I have been on a pilot team for 1.5 years providing advanced support for a specialty team.  We have also taken on the additional responsibilities of an entire department that was repurposed without any additional compensation as previously promised by now 3 managers and 2 directors.  We have each been recruited by other departments, and when the notion of moving elsewhere comes up we are told to stay, things are getting close to being finalized and it will be worth staying.  Once the open positions are closed, we get the disheartening info that we are no closer than before.  Unfortunately we have been promised grandeur and let down each time by our immediate supervisory staff and their superiors on numerous occasions."

- Work can be challenging and there's tons of knowledge to pickup.

- One of the few places to really be trained in DNS. 

- Excellent company name for the result in IT.","- Extreme micro-management of metrics to keep your job - very stressful (they time you down the minute and second of you not being actively on a phone call working)

- Forced sales (minimum dailies or you will be terminated)

- Lazy middle management. (I've frequently had Supervisors and Leads flat out tell me they wont take a customers request to speak to a Supervisor, and to go back to the customer and keep trying. Later on, I was written up for not transferring a customer to a Supervisor)

- Technicians badly underpaid unless they are good at sales for commission. ($16/hr where industry normal for that job is $35+)

- Going downhill since they went public. (they're already cutting commission structures, perks, and other things that made GoDaddy so amazing to work for now that they've gone public)"
1681,GoDaddy,Review On Godaddy,2015-11-29,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The thing I liked most about working at Godaddy was being able to work for a high tech company that utilized many aspects of what my prior experience consisted of.  I liked working for a company that was growing rapidly and it also had a lot of talented people working there.,"Some of the things I had issues with was having to sit is a seat for 8.5 hours a day.   It really takes a toll on ones body.  They are very much metrics orientated and constantly monitor your calls, talk time, sales goals and overall call review.  I can see how this helps a company grow, but I thought it was a little overkill.

Another issue I had was they pay you a low hourly rate and then the most of your earnings are commission driven.  This allows them to be able to lower your department's commission levels any time they want.  And usually when a new supervisor gets assigned to your department, they feel they need to modify everything to justify them being hired for the position.  Usually they like to lower the department's commissions.  I think my department had about 3-4 reductions in the time that I was there.   I'm sure the VP's weren't having their earnings lowered.

Their moto when I was hired is ""we work hard and play hard"".  I just felt we worked hard.

I think the owner of the company Bob came to visit our office once in all the years I worked there.  He really should have come to visit more often just to give everyone a little motivation.

Even at Christmas time, they spent millions on a Christmas Party.  I personally felt it was more for promotion of the company name.  I would had preferred to have not had my commissions constantly lowered. 

The company made a Billion dollars in sales revenue and it keeps going up each year.  Why lower all the employees earnings who helped you get there?

These issues mentioned above are consistently felt by most employees.  Don't rely on your periodic ""confidental"" review questionnaires to be accurate.  We know you track everything."

New ownership/management seems very committed to best practices in software development.","I worked in the Denver office which closed in May 2014. I understand that this happens in business, but it didn't sit well with me and I eventually left GoDaddy later that year.

I initially started only meaning for it to be a part time job, however, the culture and atmosphere grew on me an I decided to make it a career. They are really good at promoting within and give you training to get to the next level in your career. However, I am more excited at what they have done for the veterans and military members of the company. 

They are really making great efforts to hire, recognize, and take care of the veterans employed there. Most recently, they awarded Veterans Day as a paid holiday to Veterans. They also have a great internal affinity group run by veterans and civilian supporters.",As with all growing companies there are somethings they still need to work out but I know they are working on it.
1688,GoDaddy,"Make a Real Impact, Support Personal Growth",2015-11-17,5.0,Product Manager,"When I first started researching GoDaddy as a place to work, I quickly learned about the company's efforts to improve their hosting products, to focus on solving customers' problems, and to support the success of small businesses. GoDaddy is currently very focused on driving positive change at the company. My hiring manager and I had an amazing first conversation, and she told me about the efforts GoDaddy was going through to create a culture of fearless employees, working hard to listen to customers and build great products. I was hooked. I wanted the job! I ended up going through 12 interviews before getting hired, and everyone I spoke with echoed the same sentiments as my manager. GoDaddy was a place in the midst of change, and your work here was going to make a difference, make the company a better place. Choosing to work for GoDaddy was one of the best decisions of my life. It is the best job I have ever had. Not only because I get to make a difference everyday, and drive real change at a company, but because I am constantly learning, and growing, and my team supports me in my path to become better. When I started at GoDaddy, I was a program manager on a large company wide project. My first year was certainly not the easiest year of my life, but it was the most rewarding yet. We built a team, grew to work together as a family, and accomplished what seemed almost impossible at one point. I learned so much in the first year, and after only 11 months at the company, I was promoted to a product manager position. I don't think I would have been able to reach the position I am in so quickly at any other company. The culture at GoDaddy is really focused on growth and fearlessness. I may not have been sure I could do the job at first, but my colleagues believed and supported me, and most importantly gave me the opportunity to show that I could.",Some offices are better than others as far as facilities and perks.

1689,GoDaddy,Level 3 Hosting Support,2015-11-17,3.0,Hosting Support,"I've been at GoDaddy for 5 years and I have to say that we have great benefits, great vacation plan and some good people","Where to start
-When giving any critical feedback to processes you're told you're being negative
-GoDaddy, once in the door on the call center floor(management will refer to it as a Customer Care Center, and it was about customer care back when I started, not so much anymore), doesn't seem to place people where their strengths lie. 
-Management is quick to become offended and try to force you out. 
-Upper management will say that they have an open door policy, but there is so much of a good ole boys club atmosphere within management that nothing is really neutral. 
-This is a sales position. Like do not apply if you do not want to be rated almost completely on your ability to sell. 5 years ago I heard ""so what's best for the customer"" all the time, now a days when people ask questions regarding calls it's ""what do you have in the cart""
-There isn't a real HR, you send an email which gets a response in 24-72 hours
-Training has become so lackluster that our newer reps are afraid of our hosting products.
-The only employees who move up now a days are the ones who are strong in sales. I get that it's a business but our customers are craving support, not sales
-Issues which are being resolved by our admins have no timeframes given, due to the fact that we are judged so harshly on customer satisfaction scores(and they have no dispute process) this is insane. 
-No direct extensions for reps. We're ""consultants"" and you can be fired for revenue BUT we only have an email address for a customer to have us call them if they want to think about an offer. Due to call queues, outbound calls by some reps are discouraged(unless you're a high revenue rep.)"

The work-life balance is great. I never feel obligated to work past 5 or 6 o'clock each day. People come into work, work hard and then leave at a reasonable hour so that they can spend time with their families/friends. Another pro is flex time, which accounts for all of your personal, sick and vacation days. All of those days are just lumped into one one. GoDaddy does not have a set number of vacation days (for corporate employees). So if one year you need 3 weeks off and another year you need 8, that's fine. Take what you need. As long as you get your work done, that's the most important thing.","Despite the fact that GoDaddy has a new CEO and has done a 180 as far as its image goes, the public still has a misinformed idea about the company, what it does, etc. GoDaddy has done a good job at trying to improve, but unfortunately still has a long way to go to really change public opinion.

There are also a lot of fires that come up from day to day, which can detract from the bigger picture. Sometimes these are good, but many times they just distract from some of the more important opportunities."

The company isn't without it's share of downsides. For one, if you want to move into management, be ready to give your life up. Now, it is a call center so you have to be flexible with your hours, and I knew that going in. What I didn't sign up for is having to take my work home with me constantly. When they say you're going to live your job, they mean it. I can't tell you how many times I've had to spend my nights and weekends slaving over a monitor making sure everything was being held together. It wears on you and your relationships... so just be ready if you want to take part. 

Also, upper management is incredibly disconnected from the floor. This may always be perceived to be the case in these environments, but that doesn't make it right. Decisions are made constantly that could have a near 50% impact on an agent's salary and compensation, and they're done without rhyme or reason.... or if there is one , that message is not communicated effectively to Sups or Managers.

Training is called ""the ranch"" consisted of quick training.  Total of 5 days instructional (including two half days hooked up to another rep to listen in on phone calls). 
After you pass ""the test"" on day 6 you are thrown on the phones.  

In 6 months I have seen a lot of people come and go, including supervisors/leads.  One sales team can go thru several supervisors/leads in a year.  Each supervisor has a different style or set of expectations.  I've seen supervisors that will penalize you for asking a question regarding tech support that can be found in the ""vault"". For every product there is an article that you have to read in order to troubleshoot a product.  

With any call center, customers can be very difficult.  Can not disconnect on someone who is being inappropriate or who is cussing you out.  Same people who are angry at GoDaddy for their products not working are scoring you on your customer service.  They can take out their anger and frustration that their business is down due to some sort of malfunction even though you provided impeccable customer service.   

Sales matrix is difficult to achieve when call volume is low.  Trading schedules is difficult to impossible.  Calls are manipulated.  If your sales are low, you are filtered tech support calls.  If your sales are high you are filtered sales calls.  End of month or bonus period a great sales person will get tech calls.  Makes it difficult to get the higher bonus tiers or you will watch your bonus level go down because you didn't answer enough calls (can miss a bonus by just one phone call).   Reps will try to dump a tech call as fast as possible to get into a sales call.  One can find themselves working overtime to try to meet sales goals when call volume is low.

Job is easy as hell.","Just thinking about the place gives me a ton of anxiety so....

Yep, it's a call center - loud, uncomfortable, unhealthy, impossible to not bring the stress home.

Corporate is always hired externally. The days of internal promotions into corporate are over. If you are in sales, you will always be in sales.

Only 2 15min breaks and a 30min lunch. Otherwise you are OBLIGATED to be on the phones for 7hours and 24minutes. If you dip beneath this average for long enough you are fired. That's always fun to watch management chitchat/watch movies in their office/take 2 hour lunches all day when you can't even move!!

That being said, leadership loves to initiate witchhunts - especially towards more intelligent, higher performing people. The losers up top want to keep their cushy positions! 

You will get burnt out very fast - I've heard of multiple suicides/sudden deaths over the past 2 years. Someone left the Tempe building on his lunch one day and blew his head off. Other people just drop dead.

The customers are ""special"" and are getting more entitled by the month. Have fun getting screamed at by someone who thinks you are their slave because they bought something for $12. 

You have to get permission to leave your desk to ask questions. Like in kindergarten. Have fun buying new clothes for the inevitable 10-50lb weight gain.

Lots of people come to work high because it's so stressful. 

HR is completely worthless. Most of the time it's better to read through the policies and do your own research.

If you are a woman, forget getting promoted into leadership unless you play the game really well (or are willing to be in an entry level position for 3x as long as the guys)."

Double-time and a half when you work holidays. Great employee pricing on majority of products. A-lister's performing at the holiday party.","Favoritism. If you want a promotion, you need to befriend you management or be exceptional in sales. This still holds true if you're looking to move to a strictly technical role. Despite they tried to make specialty departments like Hosting feel like where 'technical experts', they just wanted you to know enough so you could sell the product. Newly added technical assessments are given to those who are wanting to advance in the department. These assessments include things Godaddy simply doesn't do, support or train you on. That's without mentioning that the 'right answers' aren't even accurate or purely subjective. Leadership doesn't support your growth and only allots you time to complete the required assessments because they can't sacrifice the potential sales you could be making in turn for you trying to advance.

Before going public, changes to the daily metrics only tightened more. Being required to be on the phones 96% of your shift (not including lunch or breaks) is simply unrealistic after being previously set to 82%. You carefully taking notes after you call to better the customer and the future employees next time they call in, only hurts you unless you can do it under 30 seconds. Nearly had my employment up for review once they had made that change after never having any trouble prior to. 

Where great customer service use to be something awarded with in bonuses, now is a requirement to keep your job. If you get a couple customers that submit zeros because they simply don't like the company or because you were doing your and following policy, could result in your employment being up for review. Management isn't willing to go through the effort in order to see if the score is actually based on your performance or if the person just intentionally put all zeros. They feel the law of averages should work it out.

Yes, there is the holiday party, but their giveaways and incentives to work holidays and overtime are now null. Aside from the Costco Contest (which is a sales based contest), only rumors of prize giveaways linger around. No more Wii's, Xbox's, Playstation's, big screen TV's or cash prizes being awarded to those volunteering for holidays. Only items like Godaddy snuggies are given to those who work on Christmas Day these days.

They also have amazing incentive prizes and bonuses IF you can hit the sales numbers.,"Don't quit your previous job until you pass the test at the end of training!! After accepting a position at GoDaddy, you go through a week of training. Most of it is about how to try to sell the products offered. You briefly learn a little bit about the products, but not enough to really help a customer know the pros and cons of the product. Let alone how to fix something if it goes wrong. After that first week, you'll take a test on all of the products and being able to navigate around in the various system platforms. If you pass the test, you go onto the next phase of training. If you don't pass the test, you are walked out the door. Training is too focused on the aspects of selling, and not enough on learning the products being sold and how to use them or fix issues with them. Most of the new hires are placed on 2nd shift. There are limited team leaders on 2nd shift so good luck getting help when you need it because they are busy helping someone else or doing their own thing. Some of your seasoned colleagues will try to help you with issues, but most won't. If they aren't on the phone taking calls, it goes against their ""on the phone availability metric"". If you don't hit that number, no bonus. If you don't meet your sales metric, no bonus.  So most new hires are left with angry customers sending in surveys on you stating you ""don't know what you're doing."" or that ""you took way too long on the phone."" Kinda leaves a new employee feeling pretty defeated by the end of the day. In the sales aspect to get the bonus, you have so sell a certain dollar amount in the pay period. Don't get too excited if you've met that bonus status quota though. If a customer decides a product isn't a good fit for them or they just don't like the product and decided to return it, that amount is deducted from your quota. So you're never in the clear on the sales metric until the end of that time frame.
Hope you get good team leader. Most are pretty nice, but there are a few that have no business being in management. My team leader was horrible. He was not willing to help any of the new hires, and even when I had questions (work related with a customer holding) he didn't have time for me, because he was too busy making weekend plans with a co-worker. When I tried to asked another person in management for help, my team leader  reprimanded me stating that all questions needed to go through him and that I was not to ask other team leaders for help. 
When I chose to leave the company, HR and management did not care to hear my concerns or frustrations. They wouldn't even have a meeting with me to try and make things better. When I turned my badge in at the front desk, the greeter there said, ""This happens a lot more than you'd think. People walk out all of the time."" Clearly if this is the case, there are issues that need to be addressed to have employees happy.
The building was nice, but the office equipment/desks/chairs were very out dated and uncomfortable."

In the year and a half that I worked for them they changed their expectations more than that. Dropping css (customer serv. Surveys) and raising the bar on others so it makes it more difficult to hit. 350 per day Keep your seat min seems like it should be easy to hit, but can be challenging, with late shifts, and long wait times in between calls, also when you try to get with a supervisor or lead and they blow you off because they are playing with their nerf guns running around like children while we sit on the phone with a customer on hold trying to get them to do something as simple as getting approval to send them to the hosting dept because they changed the scope of support, and took away our hosting support team resources. This does not change the fact that you MUST make your sales and push the customer to buy products that are deeply discounted which does not help the sales aspect.
There is also NO accountability for the guys that supposedly ""ROCK"" their sales, because they will tell the customer anything they want to just to nail the sale. I can tell you I took MANY calls where the customer was upset because the rep who sold them something didn't tell them honestly that it does not support what they are trying to do, tough to up sell after following those kinds of salesmen get done with em. (I was shadowing a ""ROCKING"" rep and heard it first hand) But sups and managers don't care about that as long as you make their bonuses. When I tried to say something about it I was shot down immediately. 
As far as getting help with your sales? Yeah fat chance; they take you to a one on one they say every week for 30 min? hog wash, i was lucky to get one a month, not to mention my team had no sup for over three weeks because they were changing their sup structure: when they did get you in the one on one it was the same thing every time, ""You gotta get them to commit to an up sell, you have to close a sale on every call"" using examples of themselves when they were on the floor doing 1000+ per day LOL.
Long story short, high pressure sales, high churn, high stress (worrying about quota and expectations ALL THE TIME) so be prepared for almost losing your job on a regular basis. This is ""the norm"".
If you don't mind High pressure reverse cold call sales then this is the place for you!! If you don't mind watching your sups play video games, ping pong, nerf dart guns, jacking their music loud so your customer is annoyed and you can hardly hear them, while trying to calm a customer down from the jerk who sold em something that does not work for their needs then this is the place for you!!

-Some flexibility with when you can take breaks or lunch depending on supervisor
-Subsidized, healthy on-site lunches. $2 for a decent sized meal, $5 for double meal.
-Pretty solid benefits package for an hourly job, despite being incorrectly or inadequately described during the hiring process and training.","-No opportunity to change shifts even w/satisfactory performance unless Supervisor and Manager approve
-Horrible shift choices for new employees, often getting stuck with shifts that contribute to a lack of success
-Recruiting strategy is to only tell half truths about job requirements, expectations, and ability to move up in the company
-Very cult-like mentality, especially among Supervisors and Managers.
-Management will seek retribution through various indirect methods toward employees that criticize or discuss areas of improvement for the company in any way
-If you don't get along with your manager right away, you should quit immediately and try again in 90 days because once one manager doesn't like you (whether they have a good reason or not), half the supervisory staff doesn't like you.
-During reviews, management will ""subtly"" suggest you quit while providing bogus advice on improving sales numbers even if only for one month
-They tell you it is not really about sales numbers, but it is ALL about sales numbers
-Used to provide bonus incentive for excellent customer satisfaction survey scores, but got rid of it. They then lowered the minimum standard for that score to something I felt a monkey with a banana phone could achieve and implemented a minimum call per day standard (because greater number of calls per day = more sales). This forces employees to choose between meeting minimum call per day requirements (which they must reach in order to get a sales bonus) and actually satisfying the needs of the customer. Unfortunate that the employer would put their associates in a position that incentivizes them to drag the company's reputation through the mud.
-The only customers who appreciate your help are the same people that yell at you while you explain what Internet Explorer and Google Chrome are to them.
-I was asked if I'd like to interview for a position in another department after a manger from that department sat in on some of my calls. I said yes. The following day I was told I would have the opportunity to interview and was given three times to choose from during the following week. The next day that manager decided to message me letting me know that even if I passed the interview I would not be considered for the job because my performance metrics were not sufficient, but that I could still interview if I'd like. This happened despite the fact that they openly stated they would be ignoring performance metrics for transfer applicants for anyone in their first 90 days, which I was.
-About half the employees I spoke to believed that there was call queue manipulation, which is speculative, but doesn't seem unlikely
-Human Resources duties are handled by a 3rd party offsite company with no direct line leaving employees very vulnerable to the whims of management and their interpretation and application of policies which change almost weekly"

But anything in question or if you see another alternative for addressing something they provide a forum for you to share your idea and other employees to vote on it. I've shared and voted on many ideas and can vouch that those, indeed, do get looked at by the appropriate people."

They outsource leave and paperwork to Matrix (3rd party) and after jumping through hoops and completing my paperwork THREE times, they claimed they never got it. Godaddy supervisors are of no help either. Not one single supervisor (8 different sups in a year) knew who I reported to as I was listed on a bilingual team whose supervisor was second shift. The biggest issue was that being 3rd shift, no HR reps were available to us. I waited around most morning after my shift to speak with them but they rarely are in their office.

Good Employee Assistance Programs--therapy, childcare discounts, etc.","They want you think that GoDaddy is awesome but it's really high stress. They OWN you. They can put you on a set shift (Tuesday-Saturday from 8-5) and then change you to a COMPLETELY new shift (Sunday-Thursday from 3pm-12pm) with one week's noticet. If you don't like it, then you are suggested to find a new job.

Your work environment is a low wall cubicle where you sit for 8+ hours a day with an uncomfortable headset on. They like to pretend like it's not a call center...but it's a call center. The leadership is unqualified and doesn't get things accomplished. They promise one-on-one's for employee well-being and performance initiatives but it doesn't happen unless you are in trouble. NOT FLEXIBLE AT ALL! Yes, you get 4 weeks of vacation but you work all holidays if they fall on your schedule and only one person per team of 20 can have a day off at a time. Therefore, if you have a vacation coming up, you need to get it approved at least 8 months in advance and even then there is no guarentee that it will be awarded to you. Most schedules require working a Saturday or a Sunday or 2nd/3rd shift--good luck trying to get off of that by the way and don't you dare believe them when they say you will move off it eventually. Shift bids are based on metrics so if you are consistently good but don't have a great bonus period, you won't get to move. 

Despite what the company wants you to think, GoDaddy's customers SUCK. They are rude and clueless and the worst part is that when someone starts calling you names OVER and OVER again, you can't hang up on them. Supervisors always say that if you feel threatened or are uncomfortable being on the phone that you can always give the call to them but when it comes down to it, they won't take it. Instead you get to be verbally abused by at least 20% of your customers for the day and then punished if you need to take an unscheduled break so you don't freak out on them. Speaking of breaks, you get 3. 2 15 minute breaks and 1 30 minute lunch break. You also have a team meeting every day that lasts for 10-20 minutes. All of your time off the phone is tracked and if your phone availability drops below 82% (which is very easy to do) then you lose your bonus.

By the way, GoDaddy's e-mail fails......A LOT. So when there are e-mail outages, you get to take calls from people upset that they cannot conduct business. Good luck selling anything on those days....but just so you know, you're still expected to."

- Holiday Party is pretty awesome
- The Tempe facility is pretty cool
- Blake Irving seems like he is trying to right the ship","- Everything is sales, very little focus on tech. Even managerial staff in tech focused departments (Hosting, SSLs, etc.) have little to no tech experience and were bred for sales.
- Micromanagement of employees to focus on sales over technical review. Including giving wrong information to customers with little accountability
- C3 (tech support) has no ability to ever get off the phones. At the time fo my leaving there was a 5 minute rule. Everyone (including advanced tech support who were contacts for normal agents) were forced to go on the phones and take normal calls and be pushed to sell. If you are in C3 and want to be anything but a manager get out.
- Managment is not able to give recommendations to employees for any other company. They have a rule that if you leave the company they can only tell other employers that you are no longer working there and the final position you held. They cannot say if you were a good or bad employee or if you were fired. Why would I stay with a company that I have no chance of moving to anything besides middle management in a non-tech field and I wouldn't even get a good letter of recommendation.
- Constant raising of sales goals over all else. Most employees are required to meet a $350 minimum in sales daily (more if you are in sales focused positions like CDT Outbound marketing) but managers who are paid on how much the team sells push for a higher sales rate. This will include talks about how you may not be a good fit for this company if you can't exceed the arbitrary sales goals.
- Management will literally play games in front of employees and refuse to help with problems. This will include a makeshift bocce ball course in the CDT office, a putting green, and impromtu football throwing over cubicles. Employees are so stressed about meeting their utilization (92% when I left) and meeting sales goals that it is a slap in the face.
- Dude bro culture. Managment is 99% men. Don't be a woman, POC, or queer person in C3 or you will get no support and expect to feel ostracized by managment. CDT is the worse for this because it is all men."

There's not that much positive to say, so I just need to write some more to meet the 20 word minimum.","* If you're in the Call Center you will be treated like a second class citizen (unless you can make tons of sales, at which point you'll be treated like Prince of the Second Class Citizens). There are two divisions at GoDaddy: Customer Care Center [C3] and Technical/Corporate [T/C], and the company acts accordingly: T/C gets everything and C3 gets the shaft. You WILL have a sales quota, despite what they tell you during the hiring or training process.
* Gross, visibly unclean workspaces (one time they finally steam-cleaned the carpets and cubicles in the call center and it smelled like dirty, steamy feet in there for days afterwards).
* Toxic, poisonous culture full of know-it-alls.
* New investors are creating a good ol' boy network of their friends and forcing out longtime employees to do so.
* Arbitrary review process that changes on a frequent basis and is easily manipulated by the company for THEIR benefit (i.e., finding a way to give you less of a raise at review time).
* Company is slashing real benefits and replacing them with ridiculous things like skate parks and pedal car tracks (they're just marketing themselves to the new generation of employees they want, i.e., very young people willing to work for less and overlook silly things like good healthcare or vacation).
* Company has wasted $$$$ on some weird open plan office that looks like it came straight out of an Ikea catalog. This has basically created a high school cafeteria atmosphere and no one gets any work done. I watched someone fly a noisy quadcopter around the office for over an hour while disturbing everyone else in the process.
* Company typically fires a few people in most departments every July or August to make their numbers for the year look better. Several people in their Networking department have been let go to make room for friends of the investors, and more are exiting on their own since none of the new people running this department know what they're doing and are creating a terrible work environment. Also this summer they ""laid off"" several employees in their datacenter support department, then made the remaining employees work 80+ hour weeks to compensate, and then 3 to 4 months later are finally admitting it didn't work and are desperately trying to hire more. Somebody probably got a bonus for that though, because it looked okay for at least one quarter. 
* Upper management (especially C-level) is more interested in perception management and playing the cool guy game through personal branding.
* Mid level management basically run their own personal fiefdoms.
* Lower level management is utterly clueless, unresponsive, and spends most of their time in meetings hiding from their employees."

""Full insurance"" but less is covered, your employee costs for Rx went up in some cases 5x, and you can only use your vacation if you book it WAY in advance and they don't decide something is a black out day or holiday even if you've had vacation approved).

They were right, it is the only thing (although that is not what they wanted to portray during training). That is all you will hear during your workday.  Between management, coworkers on break...the topic of discussion ALWAYS revolved around sales. The only way you can provide ""world class customer service"" is be selling something.  I always prayed for a huge sales call right away to take the pressure off for a day or two (depending on the size of the sale), but even if you are selling enough but the team isnt (or the average order size isn't high enough to stroke your managers ego), you will still be pressured and micromanaged.   

I was bullied by management, and saw/heard other members of the team verbally harassed by management while on the phone (with a manager announcing  that a particular person was providing ""world class tech support, not world class customer service"" as he stood behind the rep while he was on the phone with a customer) because his sales were not high enough to stroke the ego of the manager. 

I was on the phone once and had a supervisor grab a mouse out of my hand to load up the cart in the customers account to renew products at max term.  problem was that the guy wanted to shut his account down completely.  I managed to get him to at least maintain the products in his account until they expired.   But, I was written up when I took my headset off and napped at the manager when she grabbed the mouse from my hand during the call. 

They would tell you that there would be no queues (tech support, sales etc), but when you get 3 or 4 calls in a shift in regards to a product where you maybe have received that many calls altogether, and when the majority of your calls are similar in nature (either all hosting related calls, or calls from people wanting to buy something), it was quite obvious people were placed in certain queues to take certain calls.  

I think it was changing around the time I left, but they had a hosting support team but yet we would get a lot of calls in regards to hosting.  If the problems were advanced, we couldn't direct the customer to our advanced hosting support team and we had to play ""telephone"".  it is hard conveying information you do not understand from the advanced hosting team to customers who are irate because their website is not working.

1882,GoDaddy,Amazing benefits and atmosphere,2014-11-15,5.0,Customer Development Team,GoDaddy has a great benefits package including a lot of vacation time and great healthcare. The atmosphere is very fun and energetic.,Working on the phones can be very draining and if you are good at sales it will be a pay cut to promote into a leadership role. It has changed a lot in recent years and seems like the amount of micro management is going up.
1883,GoDaddy,"""WAS"" a great company!",2014-11-13,2.0,,"1. Some great employees haven't been let go or fled the company.....yet.
2. Free healthcare if you're single but for salaried employees they lowered the quality of the health plan offered.  
3. Employee outings.
4. Free coffee.","1. Unlimited vacation policy that more often than not translates to less time off...and there is no vacation day carry-over.  
2. Tenured employees just disappear with rumors of them being forced out.
3. There isn't much independent thinking in upper management.
4. IPO is senior level management's priority.  Unfortunately it only really benefits them.
5. HR presents all employee benefit cuts as a good thing for employees.  LOL!
6. Employees are worried about losing their jobs.
7. Meeting, meeting, meetings and more meetings but less communication.
8. Low morale in many departments.
9. Hard to be motivated when benefits are cut and the threat of being let go is constant."

It was a good place to work. learned a lot about large scale development.","owner sold out, all of the things that made good company to work for started disappearing, a lot of people who worked there for a long time really got screwed in many ways.  Along came the investors, and it was all about the numbers game.  Many products where cancelled, people were secretly either forced out ""you have 30 days to find a new job"" or let go.  Their main goal was do it under the covers and they made employees sign documents saying they would not discuss any of this, or would not get any severance.  They then started hiring younger folks, willing to work more hours for less.  The new building has things like a skate park, slides, and go karts, so take a guess what age range they are targeting for that ??"
1885,GoDaddy,Used to be great.,2014-11-11,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"* Unlimited vacation policy.
* If you are a new hire you will probably be paid well, to start anyway.
* Work life balance is OK depending on your team and the time of year.","* This company seems to have lost its respect for the people who built it. 
* Ever since new management has come in, benefits have been getting worse and worse. 
* New hires are getting way more stock options and better pay then most of the engineers who have been here for years.
* Management favors employees that then brought with them from other companies, treating everyone else pretty much like crap. This is causing experienced engineers who have been at the company 5+ years to quit. 
* Management seems hell bent on changing technology stacks all over the company without a real clear vision with what they want to replace it with."

Subsidized lunch, hot food even for overnight employees.","Terrible attendance policy. Most places use a point system for attendance, but with godaddy you accrue hours. Due to this, a new employee within their first 90 days CANNOT TAKE ONE DAY OFF. I was sick one day, and immediately put on a final warning due to only having 5.5 sick hours available. Accidentally returned from lunch one day 5 minutes late, and was pulled aside and told my employment would be put up for review. 22 days later, with no further issues. I was pulled aside and terminated."

GoDaddy has been very good on training and continuing education benefits.,"Growth here is difficult, as that when people into certain positions that makes it very tough to move into something else cause they tend to stay there for a while. Work life balance isn't too bad, expect a lot of on call and some late nights when things have to be fixed or updated. The job can be stressful at time, but the end it pays off.

1895,GoDaddy,Incredible Journey,2014-10-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"In the time that I've been with GoDaddy, I've seen the company evolved from just a few hundred people to the organization it is today. There have been a lot of changes, but at the core, I've always felt valued and appreciated for the work that I've put in. The company vision is sincere and everyone really is focused on helping small businesses. The people at GoDaddy are all there to get stuff done and work their butts off, but folks are appreciated (and compensated) well for it. Some reviews mention difficulty with work-life balance, but in my experience it's really been about making sure that my stuff was done or that things would get done while I was out and owning that outcome.","Lots of change so, if you're not ready for a seriously dynamic environment, it might not be the right place for you. If you enjoy a start up feel (with all the good and bad that entails) then it might be great."
1896,GoDaddy,Great Benefits,2014-10-03,2.0,Technical Support and Sales Representative,Incredible benefits.  Insurance and 401k start from day 1.  Good vacation time given.,"Not worried about the customers.  Email or servers could be down for days or more but we are pressured to sell because ""these are people that don't ever call in"""".  Their main concern is not what works for the customer but what we could lock you in for.  Leadership and HR are a joke  to the titles."

Don't quite your other job until you to thru the training and passing the test.   Their school doesn't teach you to be successful in the test they give you after a one week school (was a two week school).   They keep telling you people with MBA's don't past the test.  There is a problem if smart educated people can't pass the test!  If you've hired someone that you think is right for your company you don't let them go because they failed a test (that they took serious)- you've not done your job as an employer if they failed.
You have to start at the bottom to work up to the job your interested in and qualified for."

I am empowered, supported, and given the tools and development I need to succeed and given the freedom to make mistakes (although I try to avoid them when I can!). I learn from everything and I am given the latitude to try new things. I love working at GoDaddy because of the challenging work and the PEOPLE. Our culture here is fun and the people are like family to me. I am always learning and constantly growing because of our amazing culture and the people here are supportive, fun, and intelligent. I am ALL IN because of the amazing culture, the opportunities to learn and grow, and because of the people. Great job opportunities. The culture and values at GoDaddy are positive and inspiring - we're here to make an impact and I feel a sense of pride.",We are still building our internal infrastructure - so we're scrappy - kind of like a start-up at scale. It's cool because you can make an impact and not feel like a COG in a wheel at a bigger tech company. GoDaddy still has a smaller-start-up feel - which I love.

What company honestly does that? Hardly no one. Vacation, commission, PTO, and so one. Also they have great opportunities to move up in the company, even within your first 6 months! Plus, they know how to really throw an amazing holiday party!","If you don't like a work environment that has you sitting in front of computer, on the phone and inside a cubicle for 40 hours a week, this job isn't for you! Also, if you are someone who doesn't like jumping through security hoops and has a hard time dealing with difficult customers, don't even think about it."

I have said this since my first job ever ""when an employer changes the pay plan the house ALWAYS wins."". The cheap food sucks. There is always one out of 14 metrics that stops you from even interviewing for the next rung on the ladder. They sell domains but do not pay on them!!! I sold $3,000 in domains in one day (ZERO commission on that) and my boss kept walking around smiling stating that it was a great tear booster. I would love to boost his tear count."

Usually a few shifts to choose from. Great holiday party. People are pretty great. Good vibes.,"Everyone works 1 weekend day, but that's common with most companies. Call center so it's back to back calls. Gets draining after a while. Not a fan of being a sales rep & tech support. those should be separate in my opinion. Training is okay. They teach you a little bit about the products. Hated the hosting  calls. Nothing like that was taught in training. You kind of have to learn as you go."
1915,GoDaddy,"Fun company, lots of benefits but...",2014-08-20,3.0,Internet Sales and Service Consultant,The cool thing about this job is that unlike most call centers they dont give you a script. You can pretty much direct the call however you'd like. They also have what seems to be a very good incentive plan.,"This job sounds great on paper but after working here for a month I realize its not all that its cracked up to be. This is the first job Ive had working in a call center. They provide a month of training but only about ten days of it is with your trainer and the remainder of the training they have you on the phones as an attempt to ""give you a feel of the real thing"" However, upon the completion of training and starting my actual shift, I quickly realized things were alot different when you were doing the real thing. First off, if you're working in the inbound department you have to deal with tech calls all day. The idea is someone calls in with a tech problem and you are expected to somehow turn that around and make it into a sale. As a new employee, I sometimes become frustrated with the tech questions people call in with for two reasons. One being that I dont feel I had suffiencient training to enable me to assist some customers with confidence. In training they literally have told me,""If you dont know the answer just tell the customer you are going to review their account while you place them on a brief hold, and then freak out, and come ask someone"". Which brings me to part two, whenever I dont know the answer I attempt to ask my supervisor who looks at me like Im a complete moron, its as if he expects me to know all the tech stuff when no one has even taught it to me. SELL, SELL, SELL. Thats all they seem to care about. I've literally had my supervisor refuse to answer a question I have until I load a product into the customers shopping cart to offer them. Not very helpful when Im busy stressing over a tech problem."
1916,GoDaddy,Amazed I made it this long,2014-08-18,2.0,Inbound Tech Support and Sales,"Great benefits, 6 weeks time off (if you can get the time off approved), very liberal dress code, lots of opportunity for overtime,","Very sales focused through out the organization, lack of career development, lack of accountability for supervisors, the call center floor is dark, poor ventilated with no windows."
1917,GoDaddy,Good benefits but draining/toxic environment,2014-08-13,2.0,Technical Support & Sales,"Great benefits.. The medical benefits are great. Very low/few copays. You do not pay for your insurance but you pay for your family's coverage.  Lots of vacation time, six weeks, but you'll need it.","Management does not understand the products or the needs of our customers. Constantly shifting metrics and a ton of micromanagement. There is big mismatch between what we are expected to support and the training and knowledge resources that are provided.  Very rigid attendance policy leads to employees coming in sick, which means you catch bugs from people coming in where they're contagious, so be prepared to be constantly sick."
1918,GoDaddy,Overrated place to work.,2014-08-13,3.0,,"Decent benefits, like tuition reimbursement, good insurance and 401k.

Very good benefit package
Career growth potential
Fun culture
Mostly laid back managers","In this role, you will be live on the phone with customers on your seventh day. You will not have a full grasp of the basic functions of the CRM ordering system. This goes over and above your being a novice at the product line, which includes more than 60 offerings. Unless you are a skilled actor, or very versed in internet tech at the outset ( this is not a  requirement to be hired, by the way), customers will sense that you are new and unsure. This can be a harrowing experience for the customer and especially for you, until you learn. Of course, during this time you will still be expected to sell product and have the credibility of an internet expert (at least in the perception of the customer)."
1921,GoDaddy,If your looking for a sales job this is for you!,2014-08-09,2.0,Technical Support & Sales,Great free benefits from day one great Christmas party.,Ive work in IT for 12 years and this is nothing close to technical support more like sales support.

1924,GoDaddy,This place is a joke,2014-08-02,2.0,Inbound Sales and Support,There is a very laid back atmosphere with great coworkers and $2 meals. Training is the best part of the job.,"I've never worked in a more stressful position in my life. There are a dozen metrics to follow and the only thing that matters is your sales. The supervisors and trainers want you to believe that selling is the same thing as customer service. 95% of the people that call in are pissed off about their product however you're still required to sell them something. You're often required to break the rules of the company in order to get a measly sale.  There is a kind of hipster cult mentality that almost makes you sick. Promotional opportunities are pretty much non existent due to the fact you have several hundred people from the sales floor applying for the same position. Overall its just a glorified call center. PS: don't trust the recruiters when applying to this place, they will tell you anything to get you through the door as they have to meet a hiring quota to keep their job."
1925,GoDaddy,Worst work experience of my life. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY.,2014-08-01,1.0,Technical Support and Sales Representative,"It was beneficial to learn about DNS, MX records, IP addresses, web building, and all the little intricacies of what makes the web go-round. All this was TOUCHED upon in training that lasted 2 weeks (they're trying to cut this down) which is NOT enough time to know how to do your job.","All they care about is sales which is SO hard to do when people are calling in because the products they purchased aren't working. It doesn't matter if you have good customer support. The guy next to you can be treating a customer like crap, but as long as he makes a sale he's the model employee."

There is definitely a light feeling at work and the days can go by fast because its so busy.","Although I have heard its changing, I was poorly under paid, and management was worthless. Often management is hired externally, when they need to hire from within. There is really no opportunity to grow or move up, and they are cutting all corners before IPO"

Stop treating your employees like they are stupid.  They can see right through your lies.,You used to be able to work hard and be able to see it on your paycheck.

Everyone is just ""I don't want to get fired this week"" - not excited or thrilled to be there anymore.  After almost a decade there the new management killed the spirit.  Sales agents must be shady in order to even dream of the bonuses that used to be incredible and reachable. Money Grubbing is the best word I  can use to describe the management now."

The people are friendly and the management staff shows genuine concern for the well being of their reports. Hourly employees are often eligible for prizes and incentives from competitions along with commission payout for meeting metrics.,"GoDaddy is metrics heavy in many departments; they fail to recognize individuals who give 110% if they can't meet 'x' amount in sales or interactions. Those in the salaried positions are excluded from all contests, and the compensation offered isn't generally much higher than an hourly employee may be able to earn in many positions. There are learning opportunities for advancement, but the instructors are often under-qualified or the material is sub-par."

Smart operations system and quick resolving issues to satisfy the customers. Great support from supervisors and senior team members. Opportunity for personal growth and cross training. Great  biweekly sales bonus. Great food in the cafeteria for lunch and dinner time. Opportunity for overtime double pay.,No room for promotions; forced sales to clients in order to maintain minimum sales goal. More sales oriented than customer care.
1938,GoDaddy,"Good opportunities, but very stressful",2014-06-25,3.0,Business Intelligence Analyst,Benefits are excellent. Opportunities to learn and grow are great. Fun company and they compensate their employees well.,"However, because they only hire from within, management often has great technical skills but lacks management skills.

I learned more than I'd ever thought I'd learn, especially considering this we my first tech support job.","Notice I said ""some"" supervisors?  Yeah probably less than 20% of the management is nice like that.  I had 2 supervisors while I was there and the 2nd one was so awful, she was the main reason I left Go Daddy.  First of all, DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.  In training, they make it sound like sales aren't that important and everything will be easy and it's not hard to move up or switch to a different department.  This is a total and complete lie.  I tried to switch departments 5 times, and was denied every single time.  Also, this is completely a SALES job.  They pretend to care about customer surveys and tech support, but in my whole time there, the only thing I ever got in trouble for was low sales numbers.  They NEVER cared that I had consistently had the best customer reviews on my team and the least complaints, ALL THAT MATTERS IS THE $$$.  Combined with the constant verbal abuse, managements' complete lack of knowledge about the products they push us to sell and the insane amount of time you're expected to be on the phones, it made for one of the worst job experiences I've ever had."

- Work with friendly people.
- Catered lunch every week day.","- The management makes inexplicable, moronic decisions and doesn't offer any explanations for them.
- It takes FOREVER for the company to do ANYTHING.
- The company wastes so much money doing unnecessary things. XBox One and Nintendo Wii U in all the break rooms is nice but...seriously? How about you keep those and hand out those yearly bonuses you stiffed my department on last year?
- Treatment of employees is completely unbalanced. Office and call center works are treated fantastically. If you're a member of the company's security or facilities team, you can go screw yourself. If you work for security at Go Daddy, you will do the exact same job (and more) as someone who works in guest services. But guess what? Guest services employees get yearly bonuses and other perks. What does security get? Nothing.
- Go Daddy is run by a bunch of damn hypocrites. They're supposedly all about empowering small businesses. But I've seen them boot out multiple small businesses who did contract work from them and outsource that work to one big corporation.
- Suggestions and issues you go to management about are ignored.
- There is a complete lack of direction from Go Daddy management. I've been here I while now and I'm still not completely clear one my responsibilities. Management doesn't seem to really know either."

Managers are picked on the basis of who has been there the longest.  There are constant insults being hurled in order to meet unrealistic deadlines.  Annual reviews are pure fiction.  In order to save money everyone is rated low.  People leave like the place is on fire but there is no effort to replace them.

- Company is trying to go public.  This means no money for anything.  This will only get worse as we get closer to that acrid goal. 
- Work life balance is non-existent in my department.  My boss expects an answer any time, day or night.  Emails are often sent at 9am, and you'll get questioned about why you've not answered them already.
- Promotions are non-existent company-wide.  The company has hired externally almost exclusively for the last year.  
- ""Old School"" Go Daddy folks (people that have been here more than 5-7 years) will push you to cut corners.  Any pushback and you'll be labeled as ""not agile"".

Good benefits.,Nearly all the top executives were snagged from other companies and all within the last year or two. Its hard to know who everyone is. Departmental and organization changes are rampant and there is a lot of bad communication.
1957,GoDaddy,A Polarizing Company To Work For,2014-04-25,3.0,,"There are good benefits and there are always opportunities for growth. Some professional training is available. Remote work is a possibility. Decent pay also exists - if you're worth it or you are in the right department. Changes have made some things much less draconian than the past. The company's reputation to general public is improving. The company has implemented constantly available time off depending on team role and staffing. Brand new C-Level staff with new direction means there are some good steps in the right direction - like getting rid of bad PR. Occasionally they will fire someone who is useless. Even call center sales and support can make good money - if you do what the company wants. Typically a smart person's decision will outweigh a dumb person's. Your immediate superior is most likely on your side, even if he can't do much about the problems you are having. The company has expanded internationally and into several markets and are doing a reasonable job doing so. C level management has gotten rid of the risque marketing and put some thought into it. If you are in the right department, you may have an excellent career.","If you are NOT in the right deparment for special treatment, you may be in a bit of a bind. Internal promotions mean that you won't get a corresponding pay raise for work opportunity. GD is a place that tends to train you to do great things, and then stand idly by while you get competing offers much higher elsewhere. There are some of politics at high levels making decisions detrimental to lower parts of the company. If you anger the wrong person for the wrong reason you may be looking for a job sooner than you thought.  Some of the managers, developers, and IT operations staff in critical departments are not very bright, and they impede workflow and good decisions. Some departments have become borderline useless because of this. The sales and call center staff work hard but nearly all of the attention and fun contests go to them even when they have done nothing to warrant it. Brain drain is very evident especially if you are in a department the company doesn't care about. If you are of significant value to the company, they will work you for every ounce of skill that you have - and never take action until they are nearly forced to do so simply to keep a service running. Professional training isn't consistent and varies in quantity, quality, budget, and the approver's mood. A lot of teams are understaffed and overworked - you are supposedly allowed to have flexible time off, but if your team is suffering, they can't afford to ever let you take it. Middle management and upper level direction is questionable at times. Most departments don't work with each other, choosing to silo services and foster blame instead. You have to fight for every budget you have, but will get blamed for problems caused by lack of budget.  They will cut infrastructure, cut the team's staff, or refuse a competitive wage to a team, and then they act surprised when a product suffers half a year later. They also have a bad habit of throwing good money after bad supporting a bad product (or paying for bad product from a vendor,) and will axe good products if the revenue numbers don't match up. Occasionally you will spend more time fighting for the opportunity to do things that are good for the company more than actually spending the time to do them."

Figuring out how to work with such a huge environment was challenging and I had ample chance to feel accomplished.,"Part of GoDaddy's success was that the highest levels took a deep interest in what was happening bellow them. This has it's plusses, but it negatively affected in that every level of my chain of command directly contacted me for information, often the same.

While Bob ran the show, you truly felt valued as a an employee. You felt like you were an important part of delivering value to the highly valued customer. You were also encouraged to come up with new product concepts based on your experience in the marketplace and suggest ways to improve existing products. Team pride in delivering value to customers and having fun were the highest priorities. Every year the company flew-in all who were directly involved with software development for an annual TechFest in Arizona. This was an awesome opportunity to meet people in person whom you only had electronic interactions with. It was also a wonderful learning/collaoboration opportunity. Peers presented exciting new technology and provided resources for future use. There were so many valuable presentations that you could not attend them all. Eventually the presentations were captured via digital video so you could access them from the company intranet site.","Once KKR started to drive the company more and Bob Parsons faded away to the Board of Directors, uncertainty drove a dog eat dog culture. Directors in different geographic locations became more concerned about building their corner of the company and less concerned about delivering value to the customer. Re-orgs occurred more frequently and some new managers did some pretty shady things to end careers of great people. Some employees were even reprimanded for using their free time to take part in company-sponsored new product idea submission opportunities."

A lot of very smart hardworking people are sad to see it go. But, most of us hold no hostility towards a company that is simply changing quickly and likely slated for great things in the future. It's their choice. Though most think it was a mistake for obvious reasons.


So to the perspective employee: This is a wonderful company in many ways! Good benefits. Great work life balance! Pay is above average. Stock options. Relaxed dress code. Game rooms, beer fridges, unbeatable vacation policy, amazing facilities in the areas they decided to develop! Depending on the department, it is a bleeding edge tech company. Departments where that isn't the case are going to change / are changing.


Given recent events there are two very important questions you should ask: 

1. What value does my department have to the company? How do you measure it?
2. What is being done to improve this location (x location) and make it ""a center of excellence?""


Working at GoDaddy is like watching a great TV show with an amazing story and great characters. But, in this case the writers aren't afraid to kill off half the main characters and start over multiple times for no apparent reason. I'm not just speaking to the Denver layoff. Make sure your character / department has staying power. This company gets better for you the longer you are here. More opportunities, more money, more chances to make a difference the more tenured you are. There are many reasons for that, but mainly it's a matter of just getting familiar with the business and getting to know people. GoDaddy is the kind of company where if it makes sense to do it - you are most of the time free to make a difference and a change for the better. All that however strongly depends on your department / location combination.","I've had few complaints here. But here they are...

1. Under-qualified middle management in some departments. Home grown managers. Some are good, some aren't. This is improving.
2. Under staffed network teams. Simple changes take months. This is NOT improving.
3. HR so understaffed and/or just un-involved so much so, they are viewed as non-existent. NOT improving.
4. Recruiting has been getting better, but still throws a lot of bad fits over the wall. This is improving."

The only problem is that means we are pulling in people from default tech places like Silicon Valley and Seattle who don't really know about being a registrar or hosting company. We are losing our distinctiveness as the highly-empowered newbies make us look like the companies they left.

Also, people are quick to criticize GD from the outside. However, the things they say are almost always completely unfounded.

The benefits (vacations, medical, etc) were among the best of any company in the nation. I got an MSDN account. The pay was very competitive. The Christmas party was always spectacular. And in my team's case the quarterly team bonding experience was pretty nice. Most of the more general organizational facets of the company such as the HR orientation process, IT getting software installed, and having a system of collaboration were pretty solid. Celebrating its successes, GoDaddy was full of surprises. One time they even brought a marching band to stomp through the offices while we were working.","All the pros don't make up for how frustrating the experience was for me as a developer. 

The company grew a few years ago very, very fast, so people who had no business being in senior management--some of whom were incredibly crass in demeanor and somehow that looked good on them to the top brass--ended up in senior management, and people who were already in senior management likewise had their egos stroked in seeing the company explode in success those years ago. Technical executives had very little technical understanding of the technical decisions they regularly made. There seemed to be little appreciation among the leadership for practicing humility. One week I sat in a room adjacent to a very senior technical executive and he would be yelling cuss words at the top of his lungs all day long, apparently in ""conversations"" with people on the phone. 

We had desktop computers, no laptops, as we were adamantly discouraged from taking our work home (although we could remote in from our personal computers at home at night). 

The internal enforcement of security was an absolute nightmare, probably the worst part of the experience of working there. I couldn't even so much as check for current drivers for my computer on Dell's web site without the head of security e-mailing me asking me what the heck I was doing on Dell's FTP server. Social networks like Facebook were banned, any attempts to try to access caused an alert to a senior manager. Visiting the call center with an iPad or other laptop/tablet device in hand would get me stopped at the door as some security jerk would start yelling at me red-faced for attempting to enter the call center with such a device in hand, even though I was entering to meet with individuals who were going to be working with me to develop software for said device. 

All outgoing e-mails even to HR were closely monitored by my own boss. 

The amount of red tape and waiting involved in setting up servers and the impossibility of arranging for a debugging environment that more than slightly approximates just one of the production servers made it impossible to produce a stable product. I had to beg for many months, well over a year, to upgrade my workstation computer from Windows XP, even as we were developing locally but deploying the product to Windows Server 2008 (at the time). 

Bugs we had triaged were piling up but every time a new set of bugs were found by customer service *those* bugs ended up taking priority. Older bugs rarely got fixed and architectural design flaws that created so many bugs to begin with couldn't be readily addressed. Refactoring was completely disallowed; the biases of QA managed the development decisions and not the other way around. 

Egos both among senior management and among developers who had seniority was overwhelming; one group of developers had a hissy fit that our team was not using their several years old, home-grown, undocumented data architecture, built for another time and even under an old abandoned company name.

The usual rules of brown-nosing and very long term seniority were the only means to see the hope of climbing a ladder. Most people who were actually ""senior"" were employees before the company's big boom, and that was it, no more promotions to be had, promotion is not measured on whether you know your stuff and/or can lead well but rather whether you were there in those early days and/or you kiss up well. Most leadership role opportunities were made by someone being promoted or fired and were usually filled by in-house candidates on the basis of being ""yes men""."

These perks were unbelievable.","And then it all started to change. Health and dental insurance companies and plans changed to be more cost efficient. They still have subsidized lunch but it's worse than cafeteria food. EAI's were cut. You don't accrue vacation time anymore, you're just supposed to take time off when you need it (because that system surely won't create drama). It seems wrong to complain because there are still perks and it's hard to find a company that offers so much but when everything keeps changing to offer the employees less and less it affects your perspective at work, especially when these perks are the best part of the job.

The rest is a mess. Too many changes, too many managers, too many competing ideas and not nearly enough communication. Teams and people get moved around and there is no on boarding to help. Management has always made ridiculous demands from workers but it's getting worse. Employees don't feel valued or secure. People are quietly being let go, others are quietly being bullied out.

Vacation time: Lots of vacation/personal time.

Pay: This is the biggest disappointment with GoDaddy and what ultimately changed my rating from 5 star to 3. When I first started sales people were rewarded for bringing in big revenue for the company, as they should be. This is how Bob Parsons had structured the business. With the new investors on board, pay has been slashed in all sales departments over the past few months. 

This change has led to very low morale around the offices, and has led myself and many others to start looking elsewhere. The focus of new leadership seems to be on spending millions to acquire new business that they believe will integrate with GoDaddy. The problem is that it isn't working and they've cut employee pay to fund these ventures. This used to be a place where sales people with some tech knowledge could do really well for themselves.

The only giveaways I ever saw were a few $5 DVD's from the Wal-Mart value bin. The job description that the recruiters give is about as false as you can get, the job is completely sales based. Customer satisfaction plays NO factor in your job here. Only the top sales people are considered for promotions/advancement. The atmosphere is not relaxed at all, managers hover behind you waiting for more sales to be made.

It really is a soulsucking position, if you are not ready to lie on every call in order to make your minimum required metrics to keep your job, don't bother applying. It seemed like people were fired daily here, you would see security escorting people from the building frequently. They say they hire so many individuals because of expansion, but in reality its just huge turnover. The micro-management is really unbelievable, meeting 14 different metrics and reviewing those metrics on a weekly basis is exhausting and belittling. 

Management is mostly comprised of the scum who were able to sell enough to warrant a promotion.  Their only job is to point out how inadequate you are at your job, and push you towards more sales.  Angry customers sometimes want to speak to a manager - I didn't meet one supervisor who willingly assisted an employee with this, sometimes asking us to inform the customer that they were very busy and would have to hold for at least ten minutes.

The call centers themselves are an embarrassment to a company of this size.  They are small, overcrowded, in a state of disrepair, and using technology from over a decade ago.  If you enjoy working in a loud, 2x2, dirty cubicle then this just might be the place for you. The chairs are torn to pieces, cubicles are falling apart, phones are filthy - nothing you'd expect from a Fortune 100 company that has been praised for the care of its employees. That is nothing but a marketing stunt.

Never in my life have I experienced a company as dismal as GoDaddy, and with any luck this review will help dissuade others from having to experience the same."
2007,GoDaddy,Once WAS a great place.,2013-09-26,1.0,Internet Sales and Service Consultant,"One upon a time...:
Under the leadership of Bob Parsons, GoDaddy.com was once a great place to thrive, make an impact, and make money.  With most startups, the company culture and directive will change for the good (for the most part).

The call center environment once consisted of monetary incentives.  Sales challenges were set and if it was met individually, you'd have a chance to spin a wheel for more money.  Sometimes they even had a money blow machine you can step into.  Bob would even pay for a trip around the world and or college degree.  

Not a lot of requirements to get hired or moved up:
If you don't have a college degree, no worries.  You'll move up real quick.  A majority of C3 management consist of non-college graduates.  Many top sales representatives  also are equipped with a GD/Highschool diploma.  However, they're able to make six-figure salaries easy.  If you fit amongst the ""boys club"", you'll accelerate in management.


From an overall company perspective, lining up proven Silicon Valley based executives is a positive.  I do have confidence that GoDaddy will sort its way out.","Currently:
The C3 enthusiasm lacks authenticity.  As if they were trying too hard.  There are obnoxious team chants that are allowed, that are disruptive on calls.  There pretentious team banners placed around cubicles as to engage team rivalry.  Sales challenges are still around but the prizes don't consist of money.  It consist of getting a chance to throw your boss in a dunk tank, or winning a candy bar or soda.  Gone are the days for weekly monetary incentives.  

Lack of Experienced Leaders:
Nevermind the guy with the MBA, or the 10+ years of enterprise sales experience.  A management team that consist of high-school/GED educated individuals run the customer care center.  Top sales representatives consist community college attendees at best.  

C3 management lacks the professional maturity most sales and tech organizations have.  Partially this is due to the lack of business acumen many supervisors have.  There is an emphasis to make things fun, therefore making team chants and yells.  However, working on the phone, it has become difficult working a deal with a customer when you have supervisors and employees yelling ghetto chants (things that you may often here as a background vocal on hip-hop songs). Quite frankly, its unprofessional when talking to customers on the phone while your there is unnecessary ghetto yelling in the background.

Hire from Entry Level:
A majority of sales hiring is done from the entry level up.  Entry level starts at $15/hour + commission.  If you are a tenured sales executive, you have to take a dramatic pay cut to work up to the elite Executive Accounts (know as Premiere Services now), and or other specialty sales teams.

Constantly Re-Evaluating Sales Commission Structure:
If a particular specialty sales team starts making more than management, their sales quota is re-adjusted to get them back under $100k.  One specialty sales team averaged $150k/year for several years.  With a recent adjustment to the commission structure, this team's OTE was cut down significantly.  I've seen this occur in other sales organizations and is a natural progression.  However, the dramatic change resulted in a negative attrition to many of their top performers, thus leaving the company."
2008,GoDaddy,It's go time- Means it is time to leave Godaddy.com,2013-09-26,1.0,Technical Support and Sales Representative,They have good medical and give lots of a vacation that you can never use.,They just cut their support and sales employees' pay by 60%. They gave everyone in support and sales the same amount of stock shares whether you have been there for 1 year of 10. The shares may amount to $1000. They all of a sudden do not appreciate their employees and continually make cuts to their pay. The venture capitalist firm has changed the culture to one of bad moral and who wants to be here anymore. The CEO stated the whole company is based on their employees and he wanted to create a great culture here. Then he cut the call centers' bonus structure. Don't listen. They do not value their employees. It was better when Bob Parson's was running the show even though he did some jack ass things in the media. The company gives you a boat load of vacation that you can never use. It is like working in a prison camp.

Then things started to change.,"When the company brought in the new investors, the employees were forgotten. Bob Parsons always made sure they had been rewarded for hard work, recognized for what they had done. The new investors took this away and turned the company back into basically a glorified call center. People couldn't get out of there fast enough, myself included. GoDaddy also called themselves ""lean and mean"" so let many of the creative people go and kept the phone sellers. Again, a phone center."

PTO is great and the attendance policy lets you use your sick or personal time instead of being written up if you need to miss work.,"It's not a very technical job. It almost feels dumbed down.

Lots of work hook ups just ask the supervisor that got a floor rep prego in Iowa.,"Pay for anything less then top tier sales people.  If you possess poor to above average selling skills this is not the place for you. In order to generate more revenue sales came up with a great idea to cut out bonuses for the ability to help someone in one call so they wouldn't have to call back.  The more times you call the better chance you have of getting someone like me on the phone to sell you services.  Management is selective in the rules they enforce based on sales, or overall likeability.  Being a good seller I myself was placed on two final warnings for being rude to customers.  I also was top 20 in the company for sales for nearly 24 months straight hence the flexibility in how much they would tolerate.  Before doing away with there attendance policy great sales people would be allowed to get 4 to 5 occurrences,while an average seller was gone on the third."

Mr. Irving taking over as CEO of GoDaddy.  THEY MIGHT be getting better.","First off, before they ""terminated"" me for not being able to UPSELL to people who DON'T KNOW THE HOW THE INTERNET WORKS, let alone what a domain name is, I was actually re-leaved to get fired from this place. Although my floor manager said I was ""so amazing with helping the customers solve their problems"" your job is 100% dependent on how well you can upsell, regardless if you can actually solve your customers problems with their websites.  Every call. Don't believe the lies and BS they throw at you when you first start.  They flat out told me the job wasn't ""a sales job"" at my time of hire, which was in November.  Things may have changed based on the job description I've read, they at least tell you have to sell now.

If you have morals as a person, and actually care about people, stay far away. But if you ""Don't give a f**k about the persons technical issue"" as a successful salesman on my team told me, then this is the place for you. I was disheartened to see people call in, 6,7,8,9, times a day to get told some total BS from a rep that would just try and sell something.  (I'm not kidding in the slightest)

Decorating your little team area, and playing with nerf guns all day, is so childish and un-professional it proved to me the attitude of this company. Nor playing all these neat little sales games like free DVD's of movies nobody cares about, to the person with the highest sales for the day.  They have to do stuff like this to make you THINK your job doesnt suck.  Oh, that money machine they tell you about, where they put you in a machine and let you grab for money, never saw that operated once.

To the supervisor who told me after an extremely pissed off customer had his website shut down and never given a reason why, who after he hung up after the sup put him on a 10 minute hold told me ""Good. F**k him. Take your next call.""  That says something. Those are the peoples attitudes who are supervisors, that I was supposed to be seeking help from.

You cannot move within the company if you start out as a customer support rep and cannot meet the sales numbers, which is about the stupidest stuff I've ever experienced.  Why have a person who is great with hosting, DNS, and technical issues stay in a 100% sales position, is beyond me. 

The fact that 95% of your calls are from customers expecting technical support, and get a person trained to upsell (whose job is dependent on how well they sell) is astonishing. Beyond my comprehension as a college graduate actually.

I really hope Mr. Irving turns the company around, cause I have a feeling if it doesnt, something is going to happen.

Oh BTW, don't ever take the powershift on the weekends, just FYI."

Never offer a year of hosting always suggest the 10 year plan. 

Great bonus structure for sales
No set script for sales and rebuttals
Subsidized lunches and dinners from local restaurants","The teams are extremely micro managed which is to be expected in this kind of environment. The problem is that the managers and team leads do not understand the metrics and there is insufficient communication between executive management and team management. The metric directives come from top down and they are which means most of the people setting the metrics have do so with little or no feedback from the team leads and supervisors who for the most part worked their way up from sales and support.

Unrealistic metrics which team leads and management do not understand
Very limited room for advancement"
2034,GoDaddy,"Exciting, rewarding, liberating place to work!",2013-05-03,5.0,"IT, Software Development, Internal Tools","Quite some time ago I left a 2 star review and felt as though my time at GoDaddy would never last more than 1 year at most. I was probably miss-hired/miss-led and that alone made me pretty upset. My working environment wasn't any better and nothing about GoDaddy made me want to stay. I was thrown into a company that was in many ways in complete chaos and I literally felt as though I had made the worst decision of my career. I immediately started looking for other jobs. I found a few, but was hesitant to make the same mistake twice, so I never left. Here I am a few years later and everything has changed.


I've never been more happy, excited and motivated working at any company as I am today. Some changes came slowly, for instance, Denver has a new office, better organization, and slowly changed from an outcast little remote group to a growing hub of recognized professionals and leaders. I have for a while thought about revising my review. More recently many drastic changes for the better have been made and I must change this review to reflect what's really going on here.


I think the biggest thing is that all road blocks to individual and company success are being aggressively hunted down and destroyed by our leadership. GoDaddy is poised for something great to happen and I feel fortunate to be a part of it. Aside from the working environment being drastically improved, here are a few other things that are great:

 - 4 days off a year for company sponsored team building events
 - Regular free food and drinks
 - Game room, relaxation areas with TVs, etc.
 - No dress code
 - Better benefits, health, growing financial incentives
 - Employee paid education, certifications etc.
 - Up to date hardware
 - Adoption of industry standards, agile dev approach, and very cutting edge, aggressive technology adoption
 - A new vacation policy that is by far the best I've seen/heard of at any company in any  industry. Literally, when I tell my friends they think I'm joking.

GoDaddy is poised with new management to be the next big thing. Our new CEO has a wonderful vision and new direction. Some of this was revealed in his latest interview which you can easily find available via a quick search. Not sure what all I'm at liberty to say. So, I'll just leave at this: At least interview here. It's worth your time!","You still have to actually work. :)  There are some long hours ahead and major growth. That could be a Con. However, I think most people are very motivated and feel it will be worth it.

A caution: GoDaddy is still a bit of a startup environment in many ways. They are less structured than say a large engineering firm or government tech contractor that has been around for the last 30 - 60 years. Some people really need that structure and those people generally leave before long. I wouldn't say GoDaddy is un-structured. But, they focus first and foremost on getting things done and removing road blocks.

Also, there are still things that need improving as I'm sure our management staff is aware. Titles are the one thing that comes to mind. This has changed in some departments already. But, titles aren't very industry standard like: Dev, Senior Dev, Senior Dev II. Etc. etc."

2040,GoDaddy,Starts out great and then....,2013-03-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Initially, I started with GoDaddy shortly before a holiday.  I watched someone win a large television.

The work environment is sales based but commission is not earned or given, instead bonuses are gifted.  Then means is it is very possible to have your bonus removed for a variety of reasons, under the guise of not meeting ""expectations"".  Over time these standards change, so remember, ""change is the GoDaddy way"".   Expect to lose your bonus at some point in time.

Work environment is 24/7 so to get a holiday off you must request far enough in advance with your vacation time.  No vacation, then you must work the holiday.  Too many people request the holiday off before you, expect to work the holiday.  Call in sick and earn demerits.

The rules of the day are hard and fast.  If you come in late due to some well published freeway accident expect to earn demerits. 

There are around 2000 employees in the Phoenix area, but, I believe somewhere between 20-30 THOUSAND people have been employed at GoDaddy.   This is around a 90% turnover rate.  These numbers are estimates because GoDaddy being a privately held company is not required to release the data.  I expect these numbers to be disputed. If you do seek employment at GoDaddy just ask how many employees are in the Phoenix/Iowa centers and then look at your employee number.

The holiday party at the end of the year is a blast, but will only last as long as Bob Parsons is willing and able to pay for it himself.","The travel policy is horrible.  You will often find yourself in a situation where you won't have a place to sleep.  The travel policy states that the preferred method of booking travel is to use a ""PCard.""  However, when you apply for a PCard, you will be declined if you're not at the executive level.  The Security department is hell bent on catching employees doing something they consider to be insecure.  You will be reprimanded the moment you go outside of their strict policy no matter how harmless it is.  Talented employees either quit, or are let go, and useless ones are promoted or moved into a position where they can do less damage.  This results in a lot of high paid individuals who have a difficult time getting the most basic tasks completed accurately and on time.  The motto of upper management seems to be ""keep your head down and mouth shut.""  Bringing new ideas to the table, or suggesting improvements will only result in a target being placed on your back.  There is a very strong ""Good ol' Boy"" network of leaders that are impervious to new talent, ideas, or rational thinking."

I worked night shift and had half the calls but I still was expected to hit same dollar amount as day workers when they got all the calls from high paying businesses. The system was messed up. Also, they select who gets the good sales calls. You may not believe it at first but after a while you will catch on. They use an algorithm that pushes calls to good sales people and the bad ones get all the tech calls which doesnt allow for sales which equates to bonus checks. I never hit bonus. Couldnt afford to pay for family and bills. Had to quit and find another job. Dont buy the whole ""best place to work"". Im sure they pay someone a lot of money to say that. I also didnt hit my minimums which you are required to do in your first 6 months or they dont let you go full time. Nor do they give you time off till you hit your minimums. Since I was working the night shift, it was hard for me to hit the minimums. I worked there 8 months before I got a day off. Then I called in sick to have a day off and got written up. Lame-O"

Get used to the ""Good 'ol Boy"" culture and you will NEVER, EVER, get a ""straight"" answer-- on anything. Learn to tolerate: ""Well, you could have/should have/would have said/done ________.""

Sell your Momma's soul if you have to if you don't want to be fired. One guy on my team got fired three days before Christmas because he wasn't selling-- and he was a WHIZ at hosting calls. Ever since the merger, the employees started getting.....squeezed....to put it nicely. Middle management got shuffled around before I left and I wasn't encouraged by the experience. Non-workaholics need not apply-- they are downright anal about the amount of time you spend on the phone too. Please note: Any bonuses or other considerations that you receive (INCLUDING YOUR BONUS CHECK) are termed ""discretionary"" and can be taken away from you-- retroactively even-- at any time. I did in fact win a contest ($300) and spent about half the money. At the time I had about half the money left on the card when I was discharged. I found out later that they canceled that cared THAT day when I was dismissed. Word to the wise. 

Talking to people on the phone is in another world. You still get to meet some great people but you also get to meet some real losers-- and they already now that you cannot hang up on them without getting FIRED in the middle of your shift. True story....there was the guy who called me up with a business idea and really wanted some advice: ""Seriously. As a man would you consider buying adult gear-- used-- on the Internet? It would be washed, of course."" No joke. And of course he didn't even buy anything after wasting a good three phone calls worth of my time. Another guy (from another country I will not mention) called me a thief.... Quote: ""The only breach in my security is when I'm giving you my credit card information over the phone."" End Quote. Yes, he called me a thief. Okay....I wasn't happy about it but it was ""customer service""-- suck it up and drive on. Then the pinhead insulted my intelligence and said: ""Nothing personal."" Man to man you call me a thief that's fine because I know that I'm not. Don't think of me as an idiot....calling me a thief is 
*personal*. That's the stuff you have to deal with on the phone at GoDaddy. And EVERYONE 
starts off on the phones. Last I heard they changed the guidelines for QA (They lie...ALL the phone calls are ALWAYS recorded for the ENTIRE phone call) but at the time I was juggling FIVE different metrics-- sales ($350 per day on average, minimum), average call handle time (14 minutes or less on average), and First Call Resolution (around 80% if I remember correctly and that means that each customer can't call back for THREE days to qualify) to name a few.

Ya really wanna know what the job is like? You go to McDonald's, right? Say you order your meal and you get back to your table. Come to find out, your burger isn't quite right-- so you come back to the counter. My job was to fix your burger if possible-- (that's not a given) and at the same time sell you some fries (renew your products) or better still-- sell you a shake (a product that you didn't order in the first place, ""new"" business). AND....you have to do that in fourteen minutes or less AFTER you get the customer in their account (they ALWAYS lose their password). Now that's not all! Regularly you get these calls from well meaning but techno-retarded people that think they 
know something about a computer. They buy WebSite Tonight-- a template based editor for building web pages. What winds up happening is that they try to use it and make a mess of it-- then the call you up and EXPECT you to build their entire web site for them because they are convinced that they are paying YOU, YOUR salary (so they think). Are you supposed to? No, of course not, and management will chastise you for doing it. Technically you are ""taking food off the plate"" of the Dream Design Services Team. SHOULD you have to do it? No, of course not. BUT....you CAN'T hang up on a customer or they WILL fire you if they catch you doing it. Whaddya do? You wind up building at least a web page (there goes an hour of your time that you might be talking to someone who might want to buy something) JUST to get them off the phone.

If you still want the job-- pluck your liver out without anesthetic if you have to but get off the sales floor. It's a meat grinder. Just before I left I was talking with one of the security guards and at the time he commented to the effect of that he saw two people get fired EVERY day for the last year. No wonder why he wanted to leave at the time."

-DON'T SPEAK YOUR MIND. If you tastefully disagree with any of their ridiculous ""OH MY GOODNESS GODADDY IS AMAZING"" opinions or politics- as mentioned in previous reviews,they are very open about their prejudices against you.

-They do not play well when you try and switch your schedule.(Again, two people on my team quit because getting a schedule change is pretty much equivalent to pulling teeth), Even to the point of challenging you that you shouldn't ""need"" to change your schedule if you been doing the same one for so long, they won't even attempt to give you new schedule options if ""they"" believe you don't need one.When challenged  of course, management pretty much dug up something ridiculous on them threatening their job."

With the exception of a few, most managers (above supervisors) have zero compassion for their people and could care less about them. It makes for a stressful and de-moralizing work environment."
2078,GoDaddy,Good pay if you work hard and know how to hustle,2012-08-11,5.0,GoDaddy Sales and Support,"40 hours of hard work, fair pay, and leave your work at the door.  Great benefits, great job for busy bodies who work to make it happen.  Great products with loose refund policy - all tools given to give every customer a great experience.","Advanced based on who you know, not what you've done.  Unfortunately those that move up are those who know how to schmooze, not necesarily those that are the best at what they do, or most respected by coworkers. Bonus changes every year - although 80% will make less from the structure, arrogantly spun as a GoDaddy positive.  Uneducated management."

The hiring process was quite detailed and I felt like they were going to invest in me.","My manager, after finding out my political views did not align with hers, during an offsite lunch, did actually make plans to fire me before I even received a machine to work with (another con, they were not ready to have me working on my first day.)  I heard her one day actually say so.  I should have, but didn't file a lawsuit.  She also used a particularly nasty vulgarity repeatedly against the female gender."

Loyalty goes all the way.",2012-07-28,3.0,Engineer,"Good pay, if you're saavy and can make the right moves. some friendly, genuine people amidst a see of sharks.","Cut-throat culture with people stepping on each other to chase few rewards and praise from management. Constant fear of being fired. big talk about innovation from the grassroots but reality is a strictly management led regime with tight deadlines on crappy products, very little actual innovation.  Loyalty is rewarded more than merit."
2082,GoDaddy,CxO leadership not effective,2012-07-25,1.0,Manager,"Cheap lunches, Lots of technology, fast paced.  Average to high pay.","Senior management only wants ""yes"" men working for them.  You cannot contradict or challenge any of the unrealistic goals or demands without punishment.  And don't think about proving your point with valid logistics or evidence as it will only annoy them further."
2083,GoDaddy,Rapid change,2012-07-23,3.0,Senior .NET Developer,"Good pay, benefits are still good, and work/life balance is the level you set.","Culture is that of a marketing firm, and not an engineering tech company, so that is good or bad depending on your role.  Benefits greatly diminishing w/new owners.  Not a good sign for employees when every year the head of benefits gets promoted."
2084,GoDaddy,It was very inviting and training oriented company.,2012-07-22,3.0,,They train you well and want you to succeed.  Gives you great customer service and salesman skills.,They push sales a lot and it out weighs your technical abilities that you offer to the customers.

HR became too big for their britches and one complaint from one person about anything and nobody could do that one thing anymore. for a company that hosts many sites that huge numbers of people find offensive and are known for having ""edgy"" pushing the envelope commercials, i feel it is rather sad that if one person thinks that someone might be offended by something someone else is doing means no one can ever do anything similar."

2090,GoDaddy,Purgatory,2012-06-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Commission is good. If you're good, there's absolutely zero pressure. When you're very, very good - you can pretty much get away with whatever you want.","The management is mildly insane and waffle back and forth on making key decisions. Their recruitment process is laughably bad. Most of the people there have absolutely zero talent in their respected area. Though, given the amount of time it's been since I was there - that may have changed. One would hope."
2091,GoDaddy,I enjoyed the experience in being there,2012-05-03,4.0,Inbound Sales and Support Representative,"Good pay with benefits, great pay if you're more of a salesperson than a support representative, never felt like I wasn't part of the team","Some people were more focused on the sale than the assisting (not something that Godaddy themselves promotes but commission can cause that to happen unfortunately), all about the metrics more than it is about the quality of the work that you do."

2093,GoDaddy,Highly volatile and reactive workplace.,2012-04-22,2.0,,"Good base salary and benefits package, including 401K match.  Very generous allowance of vacation days starting with 3 weeks in Year 1, 4 weeks in Year 2, and 6 weeks in Year 5.  Employees are generally smart, friendly, hard-working, and career-driven.","Highly volatile and reactive workplace where the most neutral comment or suggestion can result in, or put you at risk for, termination.  Despite new CEO/leadership and infusion of private equity, management dysfunction continues and with higher stakes for all.  Many quality employees have either been terminated or quit in frustration."
2094,GoDaddy,Great benefits good hours but advancement is nearly impossible unless you're a favorite.,2012-04-12,3.0,,Great benefits great vacation time. Steady hours and is a good start to learning technical support for future jobs.,A lot of favoritism and only the favorites tend to move up. Too much focus on sales goals that appear to be high and told we could achieve bonuses easily but a little fishy how it's the same people getting sales calls and not tech calls so they constantly get bonus. Management has ignored my wish to gain skills to move up.
2095,GoDaddy,"Educational, stressful, sometimes out of control but always rewarding.",2012-04-09,4.0,Email Systems Administrator,"Benefits package, high tech playground, plenty of learning opportunities. Flexible work schedule in that I can work from home for part of the day and come in for the rest.","At times it feels that minimal expenditures relative to the amount of business and money the company generates are almost always overlooked due to budget constraints. This happens with many companies, but it's frustrating nonetheless."

2097,GoDaddy,Stressful if you're not sales oriented,2012-03-23,4.0,Inbound Tech Support and Sales,"Great benefits, co-workers friendly and easy to work with.","This is a sales job. Don't be fooled at the interview thinking it is mainly tech support with consulting. Any career movement is based on numbers and sales is the most important thing in this position. You never see any contests or numbers on the board concerning any tech support it is all sales numbers. For instance, never a contest or kudos on how many customers you helped successfully set up Outlook...all contests and recognition (if that is important to you) is based on how much you sell. You cannot move to another department unless your sales meet or exceed metrics and can be fired if sales are not met. If you're great in sales then an excellent job otherwise not so much."

They offer great insurance, 401k, and vacation.","You'll need the insurance and vacation, as you will check your life at the door when you first walk in.  The workday never stops, and neither do the emergencies and stress.  Go Daddy is a ""good ol' boys' club"" -- if you can grease up the right people, you'll be fine.  If you don't take that seriously, you won't be fine."

If you have career aspirations and don't live in Phoenix, don't bother, very cliqueish company.  KKR buyout resulting in lots of changes for the worse.

2101,GoDaddy,NOT a great place to work,2012-02-22,2.0,Manager,"Great pay, but since they overpay people most are left completely priced out of their market.

2104,GoDaddy,My time here has been slightly stressful trying to advance my career.,2012-01-12,3.0,,They are very flexible on the corporate side with work hours and sick time that you need to take. Benefits are good. Get a lot of vacation time which is great,Career advancement is difficult if your career path is going towards a position that you have no experience in. Most positions now require 5+ years of experience where in the past they would hire an employee with the skills to do the work and mold them. Now they have a jr development program with a few intern like positions for career advancement but there are only a few for all of the employees to fight over.
2105,GoDaddy,This job is what you make of it,2012-01-07,5.0,Inbound Sales and Support,"The best part about this company is the almost every little step you take to do your job better is rewarded. The Sales and management team have put an extraordinary amount of time into devising a system that rewards you for positive action. At my last job I found (also a call center) i found that my taskings were increased on a monthly/bimonthly basis, and that my pay was actually being decreased!!!

 Any job is hard if you do it to the employer requested standard, and all companies will steadily raise the bar to increase your performance. However, not all companies compensate you when they raise that bar. The money makes it worth while.","The only negative aspect is the strict company policies. These are fairly unbending unless you have a valid reason (including evidence) of extenuating circumstances. However, the fact that i get compensated fairly probably has alot to do with the fact that this company will remove undesirable employees  like a malignant tumor if it finds you to be lacking in a substantial work or personal ethic. At the end of the day, do your job and you'll do just fine."
2106,GoDaddy,"If you need a job they are always hiring, if you want a career look elsewhere",2011-12-27,1.0,,The people you work with are nice (at the peer level). The benefits are decent as well - but count on using your vacation time to get your weekends off since almost everyone works a Saturday or Sunday.,The company however runs more like a circus act with high schoolers in charge - and cocky attitudes and misguided concepts of business to boot.
2107,GoDaddy,Limited growth or advancement opportunity in IT,2011-12-27,3.0,,"Decent compensation
Decent benefits
Great Holiday party","Limited advancement opportunities in IT
Limited opportunities to take outside classes
Limited communication between teams, though there is some minor work being done on this issue."
2108,GoDaddy,Good job if you do what you're told and nothing else.,2011-12-01,3.0,Technical Support and Sales Representative,"Good company, obviously big so pays you on time. Team-based work so there is healthy sales competition. They teach you a lot of stuff. Has high potential for sales but quotas are kinda unfair, given that about half of what you sell is kind of unnecessary. (10 year domain registrations...etc.)",Pretty unfair promotion tactics. You pretty much either have to be a very pretty female (rare in tech industries) or work there for a ridiculously long time just to get to the middle-management arena. Your bonus gets taken away from you if you don't meet quota. Unrealistic sales expectations.
2109,GoDaddy,Worst job I have ever had,2011-11-17,2.0,NOC Analyst,Medical benefits were very good,Employee's as a whole are very dissatisfied with their working conditions and management. Morale is low.
