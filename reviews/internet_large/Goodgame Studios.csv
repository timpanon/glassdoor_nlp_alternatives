29,Goodgame Studios,Soul-less corporate game mill,2019-07-02,1.0,Software Developer,The people here are friendly. They are reasonably helpful when trying to share information cross-team.,"Goodgame Studios is a soul-crushing grind of a job. They are obsessed with reproducing an uninteresting game across multiple formats and markets. They expect a game which makes X dollars to make the same amount of money in a different format, despite massive differences in feature-parity. They take an already mediocre game structure and make every action within it time-delayed unless you spend real money. The company enforces very strict attendance and lunch breaks of thirty minutes. They have several teams using the same server for development, so if one team is changing the server configuration it hamstrings the actions of the other teams. They resist any changes to software development approach and they demand new features rather than addressing any of the numerous technical debts they have accrued. They continually fork old projects rather than unifying and standardizing a single project approach. They seek to cut corners and maximize deliverables without any regard for the ramifications of those corners being cut at a later time. They have a terrible and depressing cafeteria which produces food which is both expensive and bad for you. They consistently claim that there will be celebrations of success but in my time there they consistently deferred those celebrations over several months. They have an interruption-driven software process — software developers are expected to drop everything to help with non-essential tasks which are rarely scheduled. Like far too many software shops they have an open-office approach so that the room is full of noise. There is a strict expectation of being in the office rather than any flexibility around working from home. If you are not in the office it counts as a sick day. The unwritten expectation is that everyone works overtime. They lack any engineering managers — they expect developers to self-assemble and they have non-technical project managers in place who demand deliverables but don't understand any of the technical rationales for why things take time. They exclusively use PCs, which as a software developer was very surprising. When I gave notice no one seemed surprised nor was I asked by upper management why I was leaving. Working there was one of the most depressing jobs I've had in nearly a decade of software development."

35,Goodgame Studios,Not the best place to work at,2018-12-30,3.0,Software Developer,Some sense of organization and transparency. Quite competitive salary if you really push it.,"Often very stressful and toxic environment. ""Flat hierarchy"", but still a lot of hierarchy. Always speaking about being short on budget. Very corporate structure when it comes to asking for software/hardware, even though it feels like a startup - people are expected to handle the dishwasher, close windows before leaving, almost non-existent cleaning, etc. Often sounds like management has no real control over deadlines or what should investors expect. No bonus system or clear development path. Even though it's an English-speaking company, you better learn German, cause you'll hear it more than English."
36,Goodgame Studios,"A frustrating, mixed experience.",2018-12-18,1.0,Customer Support,"Welcoming office environment, free cereals and fruits, colleagues are (for the most part) genuinely great people. International working environment is a huge plus.","Management of all levels run the gamut from apathetic to downright narcissistic (apart from a few isolated cases), products are absolutely riddled with bugs that the company refuses to invest time in to repair - instead, updates and new features to games are rolled out without proper testing. Players are wise to these practices and often state this, but complaints seem to fall on deaf ears. Company culture is exclusively profit driven. Salary is poor by both industry and national standards.  Training was almost non existent."
37,Goodgame Studios,"Can really recommend, but might not be for everyone",2018-12-10,4.0,Frontend Developer,"There are really good developers working here. The general attitude in the company is cooperative and processes are up for change if needed.

Payment is good for the gaming sector, but other sectors pay better. If you are in for the money, other sectors might be better for you.",There is a tendency towards micro-management coming from higher-up management. Be prepared to constantly fight for your teams independence.
38,Goodgame Studios,Good company to start a career,2018-11-02,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Friendly enviornment and colleagues from all around the world. Good facilities and conditions.,"Salary is below industry average, especially in costumer relations departments (CS, CM) and QA."
39,Goodgame Studios,Solid Employer,2018-10-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Although GGS is now almost 10 years old and no longer really passes as a startup, the company has preserved many positive cultural aspects of a startup. The lines of communication are short, decision-making processes efficient, the room for manoeuvre is high, the team spirit is very good, the interaction friendly and non-political. The top management has also matured and is no longer making the typical founder's mistakes. All in all, a very pleasant environment.
Since the restructuring 2 years ago much has changed for the better. In retrospect, the extreme growth of the previous years was rather unhealthy. In the meantime, a more sustainable course is being pursued and great attention is being paid to the cost-benefit ratio of expenditure. 

The cooperation with other studios within the Stillfront group is slowly picking up speed. The exchange of experiences is extremely valuable and enriching.","Flexible working hours in different departments mean it can sometimes be difficult to schedule meetings.
No charity work that I am aware of."
40,Goodgame Studios,Like,2018-10-19,5.0,Software Developer,"The offices are bright, modern and well equipped. Some of the hardware is a bit outdated, but it is replaced upon request. Unfortunately staff are not evenly distributed, so it is very busy with the developers and very empty in other offices. Here you should distribute the staff better, then everyone has more space.
There is a cafeteria where you can lunch at Euro 4,00.  I think the price ok, but the portions could be a bit larger. There is free fruit and cereal, coffee, tea, and whatever we need otherwise. For Snickers  and other snacks there is a vending machine.
Workload varies, overtime absolutely fair compared to other gaming companies. Leads are always prepared to take one's personal situation into consideration.
No political behavior among colleagues, no choleric bosses, no discrimination. Very good communication culture.","I have to enter 5 words, so....

Many good people left but also a lot of dead weight and many toxic people who were constantly casting a dark shadow over de office.

The goals are clear now. People are focused. The results are starting to show. Management is now trusting the right people and letting them work.

It is fun to work at Goodgame Studios once again.","The restructuring left Management with a trauma, a fear of repeating mistakes. Despite the massive savings achieved and most departments being extremely optimized, they still look for ways to save.

The result is:
- terrible coffe
- terrible catering service
- no sports
- little fruit and vegetables
- aging hardware

Benefits are being reduced or removed without any compensation which will lead to unsatisfaction and the exist of essencial people."
53,Goodgame Studios,STAY AWAY!!!,2017-09-10,1.0,Senior Game Developer,Good company to good teammates and friends.,"Completely disastrous management. Kai and Christian are the worst managers I have ever seen in my life.

They had luck in the beginning, and then, after that, every single place they touch goes wrong

Sounds crazy, but it's true. They don't listen to advices and think they know what they're doing. Instead to help, they stay in the way, making things even more difficult.

They play with people's life, bringing families from other countries to just release them after few weeks. It's sad, but it's true, there's a lot of people that can confirm this.

If you talk to employees, they have a lot of histories about game cancellations, an incentive of the competition between studios, which led to the creation of similar projects that were ""cannibalizing"" each other.

They've implanted a feeling of ""save your lives"" inside the company, mainly because people start to notice that their advice wouldn't be listened, and they weren't able to spend their time developing the best project possible, but just trying to keep their jobs."
54,Goodgame Studios,Worst experience of my life,2017-09-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You can meet nice people, friendly and willing to work - at the beginning. However, this positive attitude changes very quickly, due to the poor and incompetent behavior of management.","It seems that my previous review was deleted after the company request to remove it. Another reason to make Goodgame Studios the worst company to work for, they simply try to hide the truth with brute force.

Thousands of lay-offs should be already a clear sign for those looking for a job, that this is not the company where one wants to apply to. You can find competent people in some departments, but those in key positions have no clue of what they're doing or even the industry they're in. But they are there to judge you, so if show experience and competence they have no technical skills to be objective and will end firing you for asking a raise. I was witness of such behavior.

My previous review had much more to say, but clearly they prefer paying lawyers to fight against bad reviews rather than improving quality of their products.

This is what you will find at Goodgame. Stay away, for your sanity and for your own career."

Hamburg is a wonderful place to live.","C-level made a lot of crazy bad decisions. Growing way too fast (over 1200 people on just two several year old solid games' revenues), spreading too thin without expertise, hiring too junior, not selling up when they should have (and now it's too late), giving way too much power to one hit wonders in the company who failed over and over to reproduce. 

Like the Roman Empire, this led to a miserable couple of years where they downsized 75% of the staff, and naturally most good people jumped off the ship. Graveyard now.

There were months were they hired like 50 people - less than 2 years ago! Turned out that such insane growth is not sustainable at all. Still of course they claimed to be sustainable.

Specially after getting some manager, director from industry, which is managed top down, hardly promote the creativity, or empowering the employees. 
In their eyes employees are resources. Which means they can be chucked away if you are no use any more.  It happened last November and this year.

What happened next could been seen by everyone. The management defined the core value top down, instead of living it by example. Give the employees the cub with core value on it, dose not hast any impact of culture. The best way of using the cube is the door stopper. (If you were in empire office then you know what I mean.) 
  
The other thing to define the core value is that employee will measure all the doing in the company with the value. If the management cannot live the core value, they will lose their integrity as manager, which is the most important asset for them. Without integrity you cannot build trust, let people follow you as leader.  If you cannot lead people, the easy way to fix that is to build more hierarchy to manager people.
And it was what happened during last and this year."

Why would they bother hiring new folks anyway and sack them a week or 2 later? I think the answer is simple. A mixture of abysmal stupidity and not caring at all what they are putting people though.

94,Goodgame Studios,GOODGAME STUDIOS - An Obituary,2016-09-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people – as already highlighted in the large majority of the Glassdoor comments, this (non-gaming) company has, is and will be carried until its inevitable downfall, by its predominantly superb and dedicated workforce. 

Seldom, I came across so many friendly and cooperative colleagues, as during my time at Goodgame. It is a true disaster, that those hardworking people now face a situation – just google “Goodgame mass layoffs”- that they were trying to thwart, but were pushed into by a bunch of C-level amateurs and their longtime loyalists. Those yes-man are also the only exception to my overall very positive view of the staff. Please refer to the ‘Cons’ section to get a better understanding, why those people effectively should never be hired in a senior or lead position by any other gaming company or any company. Period.","The top management – I had more than enough ‘close encounters’ with representatives of the C-level to form a very clear picture. Similar to Richard Dreyfuss character in the Spielberg classic, I sometimes could not believe what I was experiencing during some of the executive meetings. Unworldly comments, mixed with grandiose delusions, a general aversion to decision making and garnished with an inability to accept mistakes on top. If there are any decisions, then they are based solely on a ‘flavor of the week’ approach. Fancy an example?  “A particular competitor’s monetization approach is often mentioned in the industry news during the last couple of weeks. Let’s rip-off its monetization strategy with our products, even though it does not fit to our original game concept(s). Let’s not think about the consequences that this decision has on the overall production, as we have no clue what it takes to develop a GOOD game.” This activity for activity's sake distinguishes the “management style” of the c-level’s inner most circle on a daily basis. There is no mid-term to long-term strategic thinking, just a limping dog chasing fast cars.

In general, the company founders are clearly entrepreneurs from a wealthy background, who without taking any risks in life, stumbled upon a (well-copied) one-hit wonder that they are unable to replicate. In their inability to change with the times, social or ethical responsibilities for their staff are just footnotes. Instead of following a more prudent growth strategy, in their distorted goal “to be the world’s biggest gaming company by 2020” they went on a hiring frenzy. And the deceived staff that travelled from across the globe to be part of this dream that turned into a nightmare, are the ones who have to pay for this vanity move.  If at least all those talented experts, in many cases with real (gaming) industry experience were heard, there might have been a silver lining. Instead any opinion that goes against the company establishment – which by the way is completely obsolete by the year 2016 – is nipped in the bud. Only and only C-level knows best, so just keep your opinion for yourself. 

The results of this management procedures can unfortunately be witnessed now – with more than 600 people being forced out of the company, that just mere months before was so eager to have them on board.  A huge and devastating misstep by the so called top management.

The loyalists – This group is basically an extension to the C-level and shares most of its “prominent qualities”. Raised and grown by the GGS machine, this mostly mid-level managers have too much of Goodgame’s DNA spliced with their own, to be considered as sound managerial staff.  In many cases those “experts” started their career at GGS and never worked for a different company. So they believe that the GGS approach is the only legitimate approach to the (gaming) business. They are in for a surprise, as they surely will have to consider different career options in the near future.

In general there are obviously very capable exemptions. Good and capable people who were able to maintain their common business sense and are unaffected by the limited GGS POV. Those people by now should already have found positions that are more suitable for their talents in better (gaming) companies. 

The products – This should normally be the most distinguishable feature of any (gaming) company. But ask yourself – what do you associate with this company’s game(s) portfolio? Well there is this one-hit wonder that via tedious, commercial reruns in late-night television reminded you to build an Empire. That this commonwealth is build on an aggressive pay-to-win mechanic, is obvious to anyone who plays this “game” for more than one hour. But besides that, what other noteworthy game(s) have left this GOOD GAME workbench in the last couple of years? What value has been added to the gaming community as a whole? Sorry but without engaging and entertaining entertainment products there is no future for this company.

Listen, I understand that the Freemium business is tough and very competitive. The search for the next best hit is risky and requires perseverance.  But without any risk taking, over-dependence on analytics and the believe that “FUN” can be synthesized through BI you are programmed to fail. And you also prove that you never understood this industry from the get-go. 

The company image –It is all just a make-believe castle of Illusions created by the very capable HR marketing team. Yeah it’s great to have regular company events and parties. A good way to connect with those before mentioned great colleagues. But what are even the best events worth, if I do not receive my salary in time to pay my rent at the beginning of any month. What should I make out of company values like “Honesty” and “Transparency” if they are trampled over by the top management to fulfill their own grandiose agenda. This tedious political games are bleeding through the various levels and in the last year have infected the overall mood in the company. Remember – the image you are creating for the outside is vastly different to what people are experiencing on the inside. And in the end all this external effort will be for nothing, when the word is spread that not all is GOOD in this empire."

Goodgame is often not sexy. The games it has historically made are not 'rock & roll'.

117,Goodgame Studios,Not the place to be,2016-04-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The only thing that remains as a ""pro"" is that there are some very nice and talented people left there (non-management).","The culture within the company has degraded to a highly political and toxic environment (especially at the higher management and top management levels). Promises made by C-level management are not worth a dime. Yes-men rule, constructive critique is not welcome, even punished in most cases. 

Lies and deceit are daily occurrences and are usually felt hardest by the mid to low-ranking employees. It is common practice of c-level management (especially the CEO) to take a devastating decision (usually devastating for the employees) and blame it on someone convenient (accepting responsibility for his actions is not a forte of the CEO).

Carreers paths? If you are not part of the select inner-circle boys club, there is no chance for you to get anywhere within the company.

People are treated like numbers on a spreadsheet. Everyone is expendable, easily exchanged and pushed around like c-level sees fit."

123,Goodgame Studios,Don't sign unless you're a junior or trainee,2016-01-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice environment, cool offices. Colleagues atmosphere is really great and it seems like being in a permanent Erasmus with people from all around the world. Some office perks coffee, milk, cereals, fruit. Free soft drinks and beer in the evening is nice to spend more time with colleagues not talking about work. Events are nice and usually spectacular.

The office is nice, modern installations, nice chairs, couches to chill out, but your overall experience will depend A LOT on where you finally are working. Teams are very heterogeneous

The CEO seems a nice and smart guy when you talk with him and he has been open to chat with employees. Sadly with the increase of workforce this has become more and more difficult, in addition to the arising problems of the company and nowadays it is almost impossible. Maybe this is obscuring his understanding of what is going on actually in the company and maybe this lack of proper diagnoses is why he's somehow overwhelmed by the current events. Unfortunately for him, newcomers don't get to know him and this is playing against him.","Sometimes it looks like the chiefs don't know exactly what's happening in their own company or simply they don't care at all. Not sure. Currently a large amount of employees do not trust on the management. Especially after some mysterious dismissals of people supposedly because of poor performance, that their direct superiors had no idea about. Founded rumors say that the real reason was related with some try to create a Betriebsrat, but there was even a disabled person among the fired people that outraged the media and placed the board in the sight of all critics since it was a really wrong movement. 

Apart from that, salaries are below the average in the industry in general, especially for foreigners who don't know the salary standards in Germany. But the confidentiality clause that it's signed with the contract disallows them to talk with their German colleagues to compare. Less vacation days than others. By the way, many foreigners don't know they can negotiate their vacation days, and they are not informed, what is somehow an abuse on them. This, in combination with the fact that Hamburg is the most or one of the most expensive cities in Germany makes it somehow miserable.

Additionally, the company is incredibly heterogeneous in the people management and you may be lucky and have a motivating boss who promotes you, or having the bad luck of falling in the wrong team with a technically unskilled boss with no people management abilities at all, who not only does not promote you but also cuts down any innovation and doesn't value ideas nor potential. But sadly it is not uncommon at all to find incredibly valuable and experienced senior professionals led by people with no experience and no criteria to make decisions.

Career plan is almost non existent unless you're a trainee. There is apparently no effort whatsoever to retain talent and knowledge, since skilled people is let go leaving behind a hole of confusion. Even more, talented senior who bring ideas and initiatives are put aside to assign those merits to other inexperienced and unskilled people who, maybe never had heard about such topics in their life. There is an outrageous level of nepotism at some black spots of the company where long term colleagues protect and cover each other in detriment of others. Apparently no one cares about this. When people is let go the lack of self criticism and the rationalization talking bad about the leaving colleagues to the staying ones by the superiors just to justify why experts are let go is absolutely outrageous.

The loudly announced core values (Honesty, Passion, Innovation, Communication, Focus and Collaboration) are only an empty shell. Dishonest behavior is accepted naturally, Innovation is cut down, Passion is considered too often a negative trait, Communication is almost non existent, Collaboration is contaminated by politics and personal egos, and Focus is very difficult in this scenario.

All this creates an incredible atmosphere of frustration that has led many talented people to leave the company to find better career plan and opportunities. The dripping of seniors leaving and not being replaced or done at the most by juniors is scary. No one investigates why people literally flee from some departments/teams. The company internal toxic atmosphere, and the external perception of the brand as a customer-squeezer has destroyed totally the magic that the company once had in the past."
124,Goodgame Studios,Ambitious and demanding yet fair and rewarding,2016-01-25,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"My impression is that every employee is treated as a valuable team member and not just a production unit that only exists to make profit. I have experienced the exact opposite with previous employers. In general, I like the attitude of the company which is not about the fast money are quick exit of the founders. It really is about creating a big company and a healthy growth with steady revenues and profits. This attitude is reflected how the company is generally managed. Reorganisations are done with the existing staff and not just by hire and fire. I know there has been a nasty debate about the layoffs in November and certainly the reasons for it remain somewhat shady. However, overall I think we are all treated with respect.","The company suffers from several growth pains. Which is pretty normal for a company of age 6, I guess. However, responsibilities are not always as clear as they should/could be. Thus, processes are slowed down and decision are sometimes not taken at all. However, if you manage to position yourself then you have the chance to actually own and decide on issues. 

Personally, I wish for stricter handling of employees. The company tolerates low performers to a great extent which can be frustrating for those who really want to get thing moving."

- The parties are really fun","The management seems completely out of touch with what happens in the company: 
- When there are problems within departments, if anything, additional levels of hierarchy are introduced and filled with people whose most notable quality is loyalty to the management, instead of looking into the problems.
- Employees who want to change something are not being heard, and if they don't quit or give up and just do their job as ordered, they get fired, in the most inhuman way possible.
- There are regular Q&A sessions with the management, but their replies to critical questions are pure platitudes which are not taken seriously by anybody."

Way too much middle managers with nothing to do except block the people in charge of the actual making of stuff. For each of the really good people, there are 4 or 5 people who believe they are much better than they really are... and they are the ones who call shots. Money grabbing management practices disguised as avantgarde business insight. ""Data beats opinion"", indeed... as long as that opinion doesn´t belong to one of the holy cows. Oh, and should you happen to voice your disagreement in that case, your career at GGS is over. Say goodbye to getting renewed or promoted.

Not that you will, mind you. They will keep you in the lowest professional cathegory they can possibly afford to in order to pay you as little as possible. If you grow and develop to a point where they realise they´ll have to pay you more, they´ll just hire another person. They prefer to use the money to ""steal"" top players from other companies- not that I´ve seen any and keep hiring despite having more people than what they know to do with.

The company is a mess. They grew exponentially through a one-hit wonder, and now they have no idea of how to manage that growth. Instead of investing on learning to grow and develop solid games regularly, they hope to keep geting one-hit wonders magically delving into new ""game ideas"" that somehow end up looking like something they, or someone else, did. They are, simply put, the Zynga of the future, waiting to happen. And we all know how that went down.

If you do care about any aspects of the game other than monetization, avoid like the plague. There´s nuggets of gold to be found in individual people, but it's not worth the effort by a long shot."

141,Goodgame Studios,Quantitiy over quality,2015-05-16,2.0,Developer,"So, starting with the good points of this company, where the only good thing is more or less that word inside their name.

The team and colleagues are mostly really nice persons, easy to get along with. 
I never heard an incident of fights or mobbing, at least inside C-level.
So the atmosphere is relaxed and casual.

The team events are not neccessary, but they are fun, even though the budget of 20€ per head seems a bit random, and sometimes leads to events, where you pay on top.

The fruit are fine! I don't understand why people are complaining about these so much, they are more like a gifted horse. Also, if they are not ripe, eat them the next day! It's not the companies fault, that many colleagues eat them regardless, even green bananas...

The offices, equipment, etc. is state of the art, also the new chairs are finally deserving to be called ""chairs"".

Management actually is learning, even though it seems painfully slow.","Here we go, starting with small complaints, coming to the big picture....

You dont get many vacation days, and are actually FORCED to spend around 4 of these between Christmas and New Year.

Reaching the location with public transport takes a long time, as living nearby is too costly for many (Hamburg is allready too expensive. The area round the company is not affordable for most)), and there is no good connection, just crowded busses stuck in traffic.

The benefits are mostly just for the show. You just feel, that they pay every cent of these begrudingly... For example the free beer. Free beer,  yay! Oh wait, only after 6 pm, and only one... While this is understandable (Who wants drunken epmloyers?), the lemonade is also only available after 6 pm.

The bathroom equipment is a bad joke. This one is especially visible to me, because it used to be decent. But now.... I seriously have never seen worse toilet paper in any public or private bathroom anywhere else. Don't they even realize, that it is kind of costly to pay all these extra wiping time? Maybe it's not that visible, as they don't pay their epmloyers enough in the first place. 

Almost everybody gets paid and entitled one level under their qualification. That, or they are getting tasks one level above their qualification. Whatever is true for one single employee, it leads to a low morale for the company itself and the products (Despite the high spirit along team members).
Those, which get paid under their qualification just do the work, they are paid for, and that's it.
The others are just underqualifyied.
This dangerous mixture of not caring and mistakes leads eventually to mediocre products, wrong decisions, and a ton of unneeded additional work as a result. It also doesn't help, that the goal is not to actually have a good game as a product. Or rather their definition of a „good“ game: A good game is a game with a high KPI, and that's it. Fun is out of the equation, or rather a small factor in their equation, to calculate what makes a player stay. One big reason for many to start working for a lower fee in a gaming company is a compassion for games, after all...

The current company strategy reflects, that management knows there is something wrong, but instead of finding the reasons, they just throw in as many new employees as possible, and try to brute force games out, to get another success like Empire.
They try to rush the games, to not lose too much time on fails, disregarding the fact, that rushed games tend to fail more likely. Sometimes there is no preproduction. And if there is any, implementation still starts at a time, where decisions are not final, and change constantly. The excuse for this, is the magic words „agile process“. While agile workflows are the way to go, it doesn't mean, that sequencies should be avoided alltogether. Decisions are made, and then changed during implementation, but often not as results of implementation... When results of implementation are finally there, the NEXT decisions have to be implemented, while the mistakes of the prior decision get maybe patched in the time that is allready entirely planned for the next decisions, or they are just ignored.
So, rushed out decisions and completely parallel crafting and design finally lead to tons of uncalled for mistakes, wasted hours of work and simply frustation.

The voice of artists and developers is not asked for. Design decisions are marketing driven, made by underpaid or overqualified game designers, and supervised by product mangers which too often have not a clue about gaming.

While the communication between the compartments leaves many things to whish for open, there is still a ton of time wasted in meetings. About 80% of the meeting time is useless, or just hideous.

I cannot close without mentioning the games again. They are mediocre to bad. Boring games to addict people to pay money. While this is true for many free to play titles, the now rushed out games are broken on top, and have not the amount of features they should have, to be called a „game“ (not even speaking of „good“).
The customers a treated the worst, and seen as cash cows (The word milking literally is used).
A nice recent anecdote also shows, that the employees are seen the same: The login screens of the work stations actually showed an ad. An ad for referring new employees, and receive a multiple amount of the usual fee, but only for „a limited amount of time“.
That is exactly the kind of ads, players of Goodgame titles get annoyed with constantly.
Using this for refferals is also a questionable decision: Do they really want people to suggest anybody as a new employee just to fetch the reward, or start to wait with referring until the next „bonus round“ starts (An effect well known from the games)?"
142,Goodgame Studios,A Hell paved with Good intentions,2015-05-14,2.0,Client Developer,"Diverse people from different cultures
Free German language course, but on your own time
Free cereals, milk, ""coffee"", and fruits.
Some help with relocation
Lots of free time, where you can do some useful research
No stress environment, no crunch time
No cliques, but also hard to socialize with people
Huge offices, but no heating in winter
Up-to-date tools, devices, and computers, but cheap gas-station toilet paper
Nice gym, and nice colleagues, nice C-level people, but bad to indifferent middle management","The company is a mostly selling it's employees and prospective employees lies

There is no flat management. There is a chain of command, and middle managers are plenty and useless

The salary is quite low, and they loose, and will loose a lot of people because of this:
50% of the bruto will go on taxes and hidden taxes, i.e. Rundfunkgebühren
50% of your netto will go on rent, electricity, internet, etc. (if you're lucky)

You don't have the choice to live alone, because of 3 months rent deposit + 2.4 months broker provision (if you are desperate and foreign)
Finding a WG (living with others) is also very hard, and you will move a lot, because the big most of WGs are temporary. If you're lucky you will find something together with some GGS colleagues.
If you have to move from within germany, that will also be expensive if you have lots of stuff.

There are no flexible ours, because you have to be there between 10am sharp to 5pm.

They hire regulars as juniors, and seniors as regulars. The only reason they have such a low hire quota (2.5% to 1.5%), is that most people are smart enough to see in time what their hiring strategy is.
Lead developers are called Firsts, but you will get payed the same, and no title change.
Yes, there can and will be a ""Lead"" Junior Developer; very ridiculous, and very sneaky of them.
They value more papers from universities, than actual experience and talent, but that is somehow expected of a german company.
You will never give you a raise, or a promotion, unless you ask for it, and maybe not even then.

They don't take kindly to people who challenge them, and point out their mistakes. When I say ""they"", I mean your immediate middle manager.
They will not take you seriously, if you are foreign, or female, or have a certain religion, but sometimes you might brake through because they have some quotas to fill.
No female person in a leading position, all C-level people is a Boy's club, although they had all the chances to hire at least one female in a C-level position in the past years.

You will be scolded if you do things you were not suppose to do, even if they didn't tell you not to! The rule is: what's not allowed, it is forbidden. No chance to do your own experiments and research for your project, but plenty of chances to do it for your own development, outside of the project.

Project source-code is mostly a mess, because developers don't get enough time to lay down proper architecture, or the developers are not trained enough on the job, to learn the project's code rules and conventions.

Most of the pressure and stress and work falls in the end, on the client developers, as they have to present the ""face"" of the game.

The titles are a mess, intentionally, so that the people hired by them, have a lower chance of being noticed by recruiters. They really let their creativity flow here.

The only really important departments, which they pay and treat better are:
 HR, because they need to keep the cancer growing, and everyone in check
 Business Intelligence, because they need to monitor the KPI, as the games are KPI driven, and not even a mix of KPIs and fun.
 Marketing, because they really aggressively market their games, and play with the mind of the players to get them addicted worse than heroine

The worse departments are:
Sales, where they hire and fire, no chance of permanent position
Project management, they are just task managers and meeting creators, long hours and low pay, and take some responsibility of the product owners (product managers)
Art, they hire a lot of juniors as trainees, and their pay is low, and are never taken seriously or their own artistic vision into consideration. They are merely sewers in a sweatshop, where the product owner calls what looks good and not. They won't respect your expertise. 

In the end, you will be valued and treated exactly as they see you, a tool on their belt.

They are trying desperately, yes desperately, to find another hit game, like Empire and maybe Big Farm was, as it looks like this cash cows, are showing sign of old age, so they are going in all directions, trying all game genres, to find one that will make a hit again, to keep the boat afloat, and their pockets full. Or else, well, look at Zynga and Rovio."
143,Goodgame Studios,"Not a game developer, but a business that happens to make games on the side.",2015-03-13,2.0,Developer,"- Free cereal, fruit on Monday and Wednesday and drinks after work (used to be pretty much unlimited, but quantity and hours have been cut progressively).

- Flexible working hours, 10 to 5 base and the freedom to add hours to reach 40 hours per week (unless when you're in QA). The company does not keep close track of this and largely trusts you to work the hours you are paid for.

- Company parties are amazing and you get 20 euro per person per quarter for team events.

- Very loose dress code, room for individuality.

- Quality hires, at least in my team (see below for internal promotions).

- Very flexible and fair when it comes to personal wishes. Special vacation requests for example, getting time off in advance, were possible for me.","The biggest caveat you have to keep in mind when considering this company, is that it is run (very successfully from a financial point of view) by a dentist and a lawyer. They could have been selling insulation material and the company would not be all that different. Marketing, sales and PR are by far the most important teams, and a lot of issues stem from that.

- No flat hierarchies. Despite what is still being said during interviews, there is a serious level of overhead you will battle. You talk to your project manager, who talks to the first, who talks to the lead, who talks to the team lead, who talks to the department lead, who talks to ... If you're lucky people are actually talking, but it might all go through Jira tickets. Trying to skip one of those levels could get you in trouble.

- For a company that is 100% privately owned, it is run as though there are outside investors. With games that have zero hype built around them, it makes little sense that you let marketing dictate a release date and that teams end up working on Saturday. On that note, poor planning seems to be a common occurrence in general. Ideas become critical overnight only to be cancelled again when fully implemented two weeks later. Breaking releases of tools the company relies on get announced months in advance, but it gets ignored until the games stop working.

- Good old boys club when it comes to management. Though they advertise with the company being multicultural, once you reach a certain level you need to be white, male and German speaking. Yes there are exceptions, but they are just that.

- Internal promotions are questionable at times. I've seen more than one person get bumped up to a position they would never have been hired for if they weren't dating someone higher up, or were grandfathered into the company.

- Poor communication skills from the top down. Major decisions that affect entire teams are taken without any input from the relevant parties and nothing is shared until the last second. Any available information comes from office gossip. Failed projects are swept under the rug without a proper retrospective, so the same mistakes are made over and over again.

- Every decision is based on tracking data. This makes sense in many ways, but also kills the creative process of game design and development. No one seems to listen to actual customer needs and wants. The value of a feature is purely defined by weekly spreadsheets that list the amount of paying users."
144,Goodgame Studios,Poor Customer Service,2015-03-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A great place if you are under 40 and don't mind taking advantage of other people - primarily your customers,The company consistently turns a blind eye to the requests and needs of the majority of the customers.  Catering to deep pocket players and lying to investors is part of the daily routine.

- The perfect mix between professionalism and fun

- really rapid advancement possibilities
- possibility to implement your own ideas
- very successful and fast developing company
- flat hierarchies and a lot of decision- making scope","- sometimes it is a little bit too loud because of big office areas
- there are not enough meeting rooms available"
147,Goodgame Studios,Hire and Fire,2015-01-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Young and fun team.
- Company events, sport offers and other benefits are attractive especially for young people.","- Everyday work in hire and fire environment.
- Hard to get support from team leader.
- Many employee are unmotivated to stay although they want to do the best for the company."
148,Goodgame Studios,"Fake 4-5 Stars reviews, dystopian company",2014-12-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The big name of the company is looking good in the resume
- good parties
- good offices, working spaces
- free coffee, milk, serials, 2 times per week fruits
- no crunching
- great colleagues","Well first of all, it is actually obvious that most of the 4 to 5 stars reviews are just the HR dogs and management to keep the overall rate good looking.

I am working in the Art Pool together with the concept art guys and the 3d artists, so this review is more art related, but same things are going on in the other departments. How do I know? Because friends and colleagues are talking to each other.

- First and important thing is, some of the art department leads are super unreliable, promising you what you wanna hear but never holding to his promises. If he does not like somebody because of personal reasons, he tries to ruin this persons career, a few cases are known among colleagues. This is unprofessional and incompetent. Our motivation now is lower then ever, because there are many immoral unsaid things going on.

- On our Xmas party one of the CEOs had a great speech, where he told us that Goodgame Studios is not a bubble, don't listen to all the gossips outside the company, we are great! But because of the unsuccessful projects they started to have some financial problems we believe and started to think where they can save money. Without warning they just rejected one of our colleagues and didn't want to extend his contract even though he did a good job, which is immoral too. This was not the only case. So, GGS is a bubble.

- They do not listen to the employees, doing their own thing and it turns out to be ..... not good. How can you copy one of your own games, changing the visual art direction and hope that it is also gonna be successful???

- Many good guys are leaving this company, because of all this cons.

- Low, very low salaries for art related jobs (can also be in other departments). Why are you thinking that if we like to do art, it is our hobby, and we are ready to do it for free?? No, we don't!!! Just because we love what we do, it does not mean that we are gonna paint pretty pictures or sculpt 3d characters for free!

- The management is not really competent, making strange decisions and hiring incompetent people and the guys who are competent are just used on low pay and low positions.
- Intransparent recruiting process.

- ""You are just a number, anyone can be replaced"" is the main politics of this company.

- boring tasks. 

If you are gonna criticize something or gonna give some bad feedback, you can be fired, so it is like in a dystopian regime, where they have pretty trailers, advertising and fake smiles but underneath you are insecure and play fake politeness and happiness.

I would never recommend Goodgame Studios to a friend or someone else, because you are just getting abused for low pay and boring tasks."
149,Goodgame Studios,The perfect job (after some tiny changes ;),2014-12-16,5.0,Business Intelligence,"Seriously, every morning when I get up, I am happy to go to work. The jobs @ goodgamestudios are highly interesting (and entertaining), all coworkers are young (or at least stayed young in their mind), dedicated, and want to change things together for the better and ""go forward"". 
The teams are fun to work with, and everyone is easygoing and highly approachable (may it be a ""normal"" worker, a Lead, Head or even the Management).
Coming from science, I was originally hesitant to work here, but most of these prejudices were completely without a reason.",some conditions are still too much those of a startup-company...
150,Goodgame Studios,Dissappointing,2014-11-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,They have a lot of money from past success,they don't seem to know what to do with it.  The company has had some past successes but they mistakenly believe that lightning will strike twice if the closely copy other franchises look and feel.  Its a business practice better suited to China and it's impossible to feel very fulfilled  if you work in any creative capacity.  Dont take the recruiters at face value--not that you ever should of course.

Recruiters are fantastic at hiring people who share the same level of energy and passion as the company itself so you'll generally always be surrounded by amiable people. I found the hiring process professional yet relaxed and was kept informed during it. Goodgame Studios is a ""young company"" in a strong growth period, with the large majority of employees currently in the early half of life. Fresh food & drinks are provided to employees and time off is approved when needed. All-in-all it's a great company to work for and a fantastic city to live in.","Like all companies that grow so quickly, inter-departmental communication can become an issue, but this is something every large company has to work on improving (and they are).

The location of the office","The salary is ridiculously low for a massive working charge, a lot of pressure, and almost no means nor attention brought to workers. The databases are looking like something out of the 90's and you'll be lucky if you can load some info after waiting and waiting.

Half of the leads are completely incompetent and if you are a foreigner you have no chance of ever becoming one.

The management is hectic, nervous, changing and completely opaque. You are not to be forgiven for any mistake, but you do have to keep it quiet whenever they are making mistakes (and it happens almost on a daily basis).

The games are of very low quality because the first and only goal of Goodgames is to make money on players' back. Besides, all of the games are made on the same model. The bugs are never fixed because its not productive...

Almost half of the company is build on interns resulting into a chaotic organization, but who could blame them ? Goodgames doesn't hesitate to place them into a competition against each other for some precarious temporary contract."
