7,Gorillas Technologies GmbH,"Pay, PTO, benfits",2022-03-25,4.0,Customer Experience Specialist,"Pay is within average range $18-$20/hr but a bit higher would be ideal because we are based in NYC and the cost of living is horrid. A guaranteed salary of $50,000 after taxes would be perfect. Sick time and PTO are unlimited. Hopefully they truly follow this policy and I can actually take a vacation at some point or visit my grandma whenever I’m able to. I will definitely post an update if not. I’ve only recently started and I have not received any information about their benefits packages but I have at least been informed that they offer M/D/V (unknown if I will be able to afford it)","More information during the hiring process would be ideal. I’m sure they have a people and culture team. Most other companies I had interviewed with had very clear pamphlets for company culture and employee benefits. I was also only told that my role would be hybrid, no further details as far as scheduling or expectations to be in office. Also no information if there would be a stipend for transportation."

18,Gorillas Technologies GmbH,Unprofessional & Unethical company - Avoid this circus,2022-02-21,1.0,Senior Manager,I think that you can easily negotiate a high salary due to the bad reputation of the company.,"- The founder is the least inspiring CEO I have ever seen. He is not able to articulate his ideas properly and nobody can barely understand what he says during the open company calls. 

- The HR department is something unheard of. They are not able to pay salaries on time, constantly having issues with contracts, payroll, and answering simple employee questions. I see a huge turnover in that department probably due to the incompetent leaders that run the department. 

- No Benefits. We were asked mid 2021 the type of benefits that we would like to have as employees and even if we followed up an embarrassingly amount of time, this was never looked at. 

- No Transparency. Things happen, you are assigned to things, and you are impacted by change. Nothing will ever be consulted with you and if you challenge you will be a seen as a ""Toxic"" employee. Nobody know how the salary review is done, nor if there is a performance management process? Maybe that is also happening secretly behind the scenes who knows. 

- The company keeps on hiring unexperienced people with only a couple years of experience from Investment Banking and big Consulting Firms and places them in Director, Senior Manager roles paying some crazy high salaries.

- Employees are being secretly fired from one day to the next. Suddenly you might realize that your colleague won't be there the following day. At the same time there is a constant turnover of people who voluntarily leave this show."

- There are several warehouses, usually it is possible to work very close to where you live","- Company's sick leave policies are too strict for the customary country rules (Germany).
- Pay is not great, and there are constant issues with improper payments, mistakes in payslips, etc.
- Promotion seems to be justified by personal relations, not competence.
- Several problems with sexual harassment (3 cases that I know personally of).
- Too many anti-vaccine people in positions of power prevent the implementation of proper health practices for employees.
- Safety equipment takes too long to arrive.
- Work conditions are often improvised. They seem to believe that the workers will make it work with what they have at hand, which makes the company lazy in implementing good practices.
- Recent investment frustration led to unjustified pressure on employees to boost revenue and turn a profit.
- Practices implemented by upper management are unreal sometimes. Some were thought of by people with absolutely no contact with daily operations, and they are impossible to control or implement."

A lot of sexism and problematic behaviour as the warehouse is dominated by men. Management changed illness policy for new riders (if you’re sick for two days, you will not get paid) and the payment is only 70% of your usual wages. Management won’t promote people which has potential in growing in the company - they’ll only hire people which looks like them. A lot of pinkwashing in June-July but not doing anything to actually protect LGBT+ employees. There’s several serious health concerns regarding work at Gorillas, including long-term back pain, getting into accidents (faulty bikes with bad brakes) and the brakes are too small (30 minutes for 8 hours of intensive labour is not okay!). Missing out on a shift? You’ll get €50 deducted from your monthly payment (I’m sure that this is illegal) and a ‘whistleblower policy’ which isn’t found anywhere - but it’s a trick of management to ask and see if you’ll react so they can most likely put you in a list. Generally, warehouse management is incompetent and there’s no ‘people’s leader’ and instead it’s only mediocre men, which have no experience in management. My mental health worsened and I had anxiety and panic attacks while working at Gorillas."

138,Gorillas Technologies GmbH,Great start up mentality!,2021-07-29,5.0,Accounts Payable Specialist,"Lot's of autonomy given in the role, you can make an impact from day one and everyone is keen and open to suggestions and improvements. Great work-life balance with hybrid working and to some even the possibility to work fully remote.","Not many I can think of, only that it is a start up with processes constantly evolving, so you need to be resilient in the sense that things change, and fast."

Do not pay reimburse for your personal phone use and additional computer accessories
Promote people who are loyal versus people who are knowledgeable
Take more advantage of expats, forcing them to pay for their own transportation (+300euros a month)
Management pretends to be your friend (not your boss but your friend) and takes advantage
No clear goals
No innovation
Management comes from big corporations and will just do the same thing they did there. No room for improvement or a voice. 
Lies that they are sustainable by stating that they work with locally sourced products but in reality they are buying from the same wholesalers as any other grocery store."

153,Gorillas Technologies GmbH,Burnout culture,2021-05-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Interesting projects and a young team.,"The company is growing faster than it has structure to. Super chaotic environment, inexperienced managers being promoted on a basis of friendship with the CEO, burned out employees, micromanaging, no benefits except from discount groceries, no sustaintsble process, instability. A company that is focused on expansion above employee’s wellbeing and has the hipocrisy of saying the other way around. Dont recommend for the ones that value their mental health and not working 60-80 hours a week, there are plenty of other cool startups in Berlin that you dont have to give your soul away for."
154,Gorillas Technologies GmbH,Burnout Culture,2021-05-27,2.0,HQ Team Member,"Amazing product, fast career growth","Every week company loses great hard-working people due to its burnout culture, growth over everything including personal employee healthy, treating employees as replaceable assets once burnout, although company promotes flat hierarchy few executives hold full control on every company decision, opinion from leadership values more than data and you are expected to just execute as they say."
155,Gorillas Technologies GmbH,Absolutely dreadful company,2021-05-25,1.0,Inventory Associate,"Young and diverse work culture
Decent pay","As the company is a startup, there is real room for growth. However, nepotism is in full force here, with certain colleagues getting promoted to positions due to friendships and alliances.  Incredibly unfair to the competent staff that actually make a real difference to their job. Inexperienced managers - rota issues (not giving us 11 hours between shifts), poor or unnecessary communication, (calling colleagues on their days off, this happened VERY often). Not to mention the endless WhatsApp groups you're put in so you cannot keep up with what's going on, and things are constantly changing. By the time you return to work, a process is different so it's very chaotic. No work/life balance - constantly being rotad in for Friday-Sunday shifts with very little flexibility around this, even though Sunday was the quietest day.  Arrogant manager - if you say or do something they disagree with, they'll make you pay for it by by subtle shading on WhatsApp or during staff meetings. Absolute despicable what they've gotten away with. Blame culture - not considering that the expectation of work cannot be placed on one person to do absolute everything, especially focusing on trivial things that were not necessary. There was always something to complain about, which was often in the main WhatsApp group chat. And when you try to explain why that may have happened, they shut you down."
