11,Grab,"Extremely political, biased environment",2022-04-05,1.0,Data Scientist,Perks are good. Prefer not to say about certain practices.,"Across teams, something I noticed was biased behaviour during events/day to day work because you are a foreigner/belong to certain race or gender. No regard for privacy of minority employees and also diversity and inclusion initiatives are nothing but a hoax. Even if you politely suggest something against a particular tech/business decision which can be harmful in long run, they resort to group bullying and makes pressure for forceful resignations. Unworthy individuals are promoted on hard work of others due to their race/connections in upper management. Credit for good work and entire projects are stolen in name of employee monitoring and disciplinary actions. Better invest your time and energy towards working for a non toxic environment. They don't value hardworking and honest employees but rather are removed covertly in name of *** (A popular practice with Amazon). Abusive people managers are rewarded for harassment, upon confrontation steal hard work and make people physically/mentally sick. No support during hard times."

Not only for increasing my accounting skills, those projects also make me collaborate a lot with various parties, and that makes me very happy and proud.
At Grab, I found a very ideal work environment, where all team members, including associates, assistant managers, managers, senior managers, to the Country Head of Finance, work hand in hand to achieve goals with a very strong team work. All team members can share experiences, learn from each other, so that here I can develop my knowledge and personality. Diversity and culture among colleagues make us more united, where every problem solving that occurs is always decided on the best solution that is fair to each other. For career opportunities, everyone has the opportunity as long as they work hard.","Sometimes if you are in a busy season, such as during the monthly closing or year-end audits, you have to work extra hard because the timeline is very tight, even on weekends, if you need to do additional tasks, you have to do it.

2. Engineers will do a shift (7 days) of on-call duties usually once every month (can be stressful)
3. Projects are touched by many hands (people come and go) and code usually contains dead, deprecated, over-engineered, hard to read/understand code (which engineers are afraid to touch in fear of breaking them) that leads to point 1 and 2.
4. Product managers command the direction and there's a strong emphasis on profitability and hence, things move very quickly, in terms of wanting to create new features (that may not actually create impact - but PM needs to show to the top they are innovating), and thus less emphasis is given on making code robust.

Your work is tied to goals for each quarter and you will be appraised based on that. So be clear on what needs to be done and do that.

* Excellent Flexi benefits

* You are mostly on your own, Don't wait for a Fairy Grandmother!

549,Grab,nice,2021-09-13,5.0,IT Support,team work that very solid,"always contract for ops, no chance to be employee"
550,Grab,This is my balanced view after talking with several employee & alumni,2021-09-13,3.0,Senior Product Manager,"- The package for tech is really good compared to any other companies
- The team that you are working for is really top notch quality, smart people
- Your direct manager are typically experienced and manage the team well
- The work life balance in ""Transport"" and ""Food"" is reasonable. GFG is an exception where people are forced to work longer than normal","Now the some part of ""Pros"" is actually the downfall of Grab

Aggressive culture
- The condition is too competitive and tend to be toxic. All 4 Grab alumni comparing our experience with previous employment and all agree that it's an ""aggressive"" culture where you never feel at ease
- Business and Tech tend to fight and just burnout from both sides
- Telling people about the real timeline will 100% of the time result in backlash and you are forced to tell the wrong timeline, just to miss it and get a backlash

Promotion problem
- With how high the qualities of the people are, it's making promotion choice a little hard. We notice that more than 50% of the promoted people, we disagree with. You can notice that when everyone is good, random trivial things are chosen as basis of promotion. The most noted are race (no, really, search for GFG managers in LinkedIn and you will understand), managing upward (you will notice the promoted people are the ones who do ""less work"" but ""more talk"")
- Short promotion ladder, there are only 3 promotion that can be guaranteed (G3-G5) while most people join as already G4 or G5

Org structure problem
- The way that Tech/Business is structured + aggressive culture makes it a bit unique. As a senior startup person, I will best describe this as ""bank experience"". The ratio between BO and PM is 1 to 1. The job of BO is just ""overseeing all"". In typical startup, business unit is either BD, Marketing, Ops with 1 BO which is at the very high level. However, in Grab, there are too many BOs which makes the communication a little inefficient

You will notice that most people leaving Grab because of this stress typically climb up quickly in another company. This is because Grab is a cluster of high quality, stressed & low career progression people"

On the org level, the company does make genuine efforts to maintain transparency and healthy office culture.","You may feel lost amongst the big org and wonder what to do next with your growth. There are career ladders defined to help but they often only end up as bullet points which lack clarity. Managers twist the ladder to their definitions.

653,Grab,Grab Design - It’s a Rabbit hole,2021-07-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Office location is good, new office location is pretty bad","I joined this company hoping that its a big brand who have a mission to solve people’s problem where design plays an important role. After working here it’s clear what they show it to the people of Singapore and SEA and what they think and the way they work internally is poles apart. It’s a Rabbit hole. 

It’s a company which is stuck in ‘creative rut’. There is no creative freedom because designs are controlled by your design leaders and product managers who have a very strong say in everything. Yes, everything. One of the 4H is Hunger and it’s a hunger for money. 

Work life balance is a mess here. You can see lots of reviews about this. My day starts at 9-9:30 am and ends at 8-9 pm. My average has been 12-15 hrs in past 3 years and I started to feel what am I doing and it’s not good for life and health. HR tends to ingnore these issues. Let’s say there is no HR here. People set too many meetings. They don’t even honour lunch time. It feels like a slave here. When you talk to your manager they say you need to manage your time and they blame you for their cultural mess. Which reults into stress and pressure because you need to prove yourself everyday here. Designers who are good with leaders/PM’s run the show which shows how the bad quality of design work is. Guess what all design leaders can’t see how is good and who is not.

People are very political and you can’t trust them. Most of the time they talk about you on your back. Promotions are not based on how you perform but how good you are at your PR skills. How good are you with your bosses also you need to be a chatterbox. I know a person who’s feedback wasn’t good but was promoted. If you are a chatterbox you win it’s ok if your design skills aren’t great or your don’t deliver the quality. Design heads are fine with this because that's how they are also. All design leaders wants is just the visibility nothing else. None of the leaders has not demonstrated to me that Grab value design. New HOD doesn't deserve to be at the position. Working with her is very very hard. This person sounds emotion less, no empathy for team members and sounds very rude most of the time. Before these new HOD’s design team used to be much better. Current design leaders are a not leaders. Nothing seems to be moving here. It’s mess and no one knows what’s going on and how to fix. Dirty politics and favouritism played by design managers and HOD’s. All design and product leaders have created a culture which is not positive. Design leaders and managers are busy in builidng their own profile and enjoying their life and money. Its the designers who are struggling a lot and thats why every month designers are leaving. Company don’t want to understand why and how can they fix it. They are not interested in fixing but showing that they bring impact. But where is impact? Why its not visible to the design team? Design leaders/managers/product and the leadership is a Gang of Rude Arrogant Blabber mouth. Everyone works here just to impress one person and that's how chain of command works. If you are looking to join Grab and specially design team, my suggestion is AVOID or keep it as a last option. The cost of working here is too high."

You also get to experience first-hand technology stack that rivals even the best of companies out there. I know because personally after transitioned out of Grab, I found myself at ease due to familiarity with most of the technology/services that other reputable companies are also using. You also get to work in a fancy huge office with a nice view. Most teams here gets work-life balance. Most team leads are competent and people are both smart and friendly. You will be above-average compensated if you work on tech by Singapore standards. It's a very diverse company and there are mostly no discrimination on your gender, age or race. High management have a focus on being kind and other good values. Depending on which team you are in, you may also get to travel a lot (during pre-COVID times), since they have a lot of offices around South-East Asia. Last but not least, at Grab you will feel that your work is actually making a positive impact and you can see it with your own eyes and ears every time you walk out the door. There is real job satisfaction here.","Aside from the above average salary in the region, there isn't much other benefits to speak of - don't expect free food the likes of Facebook/Google; don't expect OT pay, don't expect unlimited ice cream. Do expect to get mid-range ""used"" Laptop (they use MacBook Pro here for Software Engineers). And god forbid if you break it accidentally, you get to pay for the repair, except if your department head agrees to absorb it. Aside from the occasional freebies and ice cream, don't expect any freebies that are regular - except for maybe drinks etc. Culture-wise, it's also average - there are no coaches and I get the sense that the company isn't willing to go the extra mile to invest in your well-being. Although your mileage may vary, generally company is pretty stingy when it comes to promotion and increments. Whenever there are questions about benefits during townhall, company will reiterate how they are already doing above average (which is true) and tell grandfather stories about how early grabbers gets much less and work much more. In terms of the office environments, even though you get to enjoy the view, you get sub-standard desk (no standing desks) and chair to go along with your old and slow laptop."

2. Too many people wear their burnout as a badge of honour and are appreciated by the top management ( e.g: I didn't sleep for last 2 days, I don't get time to eat or pee, I have not taken a single day vacation because of work etc.)
3. Your promotion depends on how much you brag and show off  rather than how much value you add. So talented people are never rewarded.

1064,Grab,Politically charged work environment with minimal focus on engineering excellence,2020-10-14,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Grab offers reasonable compensation in SE Asia and has some employee-friendly policies. A few of the engineers are technically competent, helpful, and demonstrate a collaborative attitude.","The primary driver of Grab's growth was the abundance of VC funds, which facilitated promotions and marketing campaigns targeted at driver-partners and customers. Grab acquired Uber's SE Asia operations because of Softbank's support, and they were the principal investor in both the companies. Uber's technology platform is superior, and its operations management methodology is better than Grab by many orders of magnitude. Browse to the public Github repos of Uber and Grab to get a better idea. 
The work-environment in Grab remains very politically charged. There are hordes of engineers who are incompetent but get promoted to G5 or G6 solely based on ""good relations"" with their reporting managers.
During my stint at Grab, I have across multiple instances in which a team of engineers would attempt to reinvent the wheel. A group built a documentation microsite using Hugo instead of using an existing system like Confluence (Wiki). There was yet another group that developed a mock-server, instead of using WireMock or MounteBank. Furthermore, the Engineering Lead was blissfully unaware of these open-source tools. Finally, this custom mock-server was buggy, painful to use, and did not have a single useful feature. 
The application codebase is bloated and is full of unsound (if not outrightly bad) engineering practices. The situation is so dire that Android Studio is unable to load the application codebase. The official recommendation on one of the documentation microsites is to use an alternate code editor (vi or vscode). Furthermore, you won't be able to build the codebase on your local machine, and the only way you can test your code is to use CI or to use remote infrastructure using Mainframer. 
The processes that are in place make engineering teams feel worthless and actively infantilize engineers and individual contributors. A manager has to approve almost each and everything, even something as trivial as internally publishing a code-labs (guided tutorial) or a video presentation on a component that you have designed and developed."

4. some offices are physically great (eg Marina One)","1. technology is lower than expected for a company of this size and >7 years old. actually the level of technology management and speed of development is disappointing. Don’t see the spirits of pursuing quality or better solutions.
2. HR system is terrible. HR team seems totally incapable to evaluate people properly and put right people into right position. Every round of performance review leads to mass attrition. Managers also play a bad role in this, a lot of them don’t promote people according to contributions but based on favoritisms or as a part of their politics game.
3. Top leaders don’t seem to have a clear strategy thinking. They behave and talk like amateurs. Their words are not convincing in a lot of the internal communications.
4. High level managers (BU heads, TF heads) seems to be obsessed in politics than doing real contribution. Actually these big shots seems to be the biggest limiting factor in company development. Even some middle managers are diligent, they cannot change the bad impacts that higher leaders are doing, like unproductive strategies (superapp, AI), nonstop reorgs(during which some leaders are pushed out and power shifted to more incompetent leaders). 

You may wonder how come the company is still doing well if there are bad management? First, it’s money, this is a heavily money-driven market. Second, high quality employees keep joining the company attracted by the name, so they still get things done. but they don’t stay very long and they don’t realize their full potential.

- If you are lucky, you make a few good friends in the company.","- The company is no longer the same company when I first joined. When money was not a problem and tech-companies were all hyped out, life was, of course, good and morale was high.
- With recent developments in the tech world where IPOs are shelved and heavily-funded tech-companies on the verge of going bankrupt, you would expect Grab to be under a lot of pressure. Grab is the only company now that is going to help save the face of one of its biggest backers. You should know who and what I'm referring to.
- Expect pressure to trickle down from the top, and when you put human self-interests into the equation, expect toxicity to arise as well. The toxicity I am referring to will come in different forms. People getting disengaged, morale being extremely low, and generally people who are just looking out for themselves.
- The inadequacies of management are beginning to show during this troubled times when the race to profitability is the absolute priority now. When things are going good, managing the company and a team will definitely be easy, but everyone is being put to the test now and what a lot of middle-management and below staff have witnessed is nothing short of disappointing.
- A lot of the senior managers who joined the company were pulled-in by their previous colleagues, so there is definitely some form of corporate-nepotism which was OK at the start, but people are now realizing they are really not fit for the job. Unfortunately, some of them hold lead positions, and you'll often hear that Human Resources is mediocre which any current and former staff can attest to.
- Morale is extremely low in the company. Management is extremely good at painting a pretty picture and are good with words, but at the end of the day it counts for nothing.
- The company is running on staff with an average tenure of around 1.5 to 1.7 years, so this says a lot. There will always be people who are willing to take a pay-increment and enter the company to slog for a year or two, and then use the company brand to go to another bigger, more established, and more importantly profitable tech firm. Everything looks nice on the outside, but inside, it's a mess.
- Do not expect to be promoted unless you are willing to sacrifice everything else in your life for the company. Career progress is horrid here because of cost-cutting and there will always be people applying to join the company. Management does not map out your career path clearly for you here.
- Staff benefits are considered mediocre compared to industry standards because, again, becoming profitable is the focus. But you can't expect much when Human Resources are a joke in the company. Harassment cases are handled extremely poorly with HR telling the victim that their job is to protect the company first."

If you love the Singapore work life culture (or should I say blend) this is the job for you. Revel in fun when your lunch, dinner, weekend and holiday times are completely burnt answering merchants. Suddenly, the remuneration doesn't seem too healthy looking at a wage per hour perspective.

Bosses are also part of the mess. You know you're in for lots of fun when the head honcho mentions a passing remark on the group chat (which is on 24 hours) and everyone springs to life answering and providing perspectives. The cherry on top - this happens on a Saturday night at like 9pm. Think of how this trickles downwards.

Sure, you get to learn a lot and see real changes, but this is at the expense of your time and sanity. 

I will only recommend these to people who are moving from a similar work schedule and subpar work culture. All the best, you'll need it."

1301,Grab,Not a great place to be,2019-10-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"A mixture of people from Amazon, Google and other top companies are there. Hence company has got a good brand name outside for sure. 

Unlimited snacks and beverages. 

One of the few companies offering higher salaries in Singapore. So while switching you are able to negotiate for higher offers.","Post interview process:

Grab was lethargic in handling the post interview process too. Once they confirmed the offer, I told them about another offer and asked to speed up next steps so that I could let the other company know or make an informed decision. But they were not even replying properly and behaved as if they are doing a favor by giving the offer. This is because of the superiority feeling that everyone in Grab has. However it is sheer arrogance.

After joining:

I interviewed for one role but just because they had an opening in another team they put in that team and the people in other teams themselves ridiculed this team. This gave me the realization that I had made a huge mistake joining Grab and not choosing the other offer. This showed the unprofessionalism of the people as well. This did not happen for me alone. This happened for many people actually. The environment itself looks pathetic, not just for one team but almost everyone I have spoken with. It's the most sad environment I have ever worked in. I was unhappy the entire time and depressed too because of joining Grab and I thought it was my mistake initially. But after seeing others, I realized that the founders, leadership, senior management have created this miserable environment and not bothered about it too.

Irony is that culture value deck asks people to be humble. However, a bunch of people I interacted with, were the most arrogant people I have ever met in life. Nobody knows what is humility or humbleness. Everyone is just trying so hard to prove others that they are the best. Well, what is the point in doing that? Instead they should focus on improving the app.

Reorg:

Almost every month there was a re-org. Well one of the culture values is disrupt or be disrupted. I think the some teams like SRE team took it literally for the team and decided to disrupt everyone every month or otherwise they ""assumed"" management will disrupt them. Literally there was re-org every few months and their leadership changed every few months. So there was no stability or reliability for the team itself. Ironic that this happened for SRE who are supposed to bring reliability for the services. This affected my service team too badly for sure.

Work and Culture:

Devops and Infra is the worst team here definitely. Internal politics is too much. They created SRE team for services, who are again just bunch of arrogant people, who are not really bothered about improving Grab. They just want to get promoted just because they think they deserve it, even if they have not done anything useful. That team is just a proxy to other devops and service teams. During issues, they do not do anything themselves. They plead others to fix and hope that it gets fixed. But still they seek credit for that by mentioning that in their performance reviews. 

People there are only interested in getting promoted. While wanting to get promoted is not bad thing, they want to get promoted badly that they will do only things that get them promotion or better rating and never implement anything. I have known people who got promoted just by talking alone endlessly or just writing proposal document and never implemented anything. Having read blog posts from other companies, the same thing was done by interns in other companies successfully and in Grab it was just a proposal document forever and still just for writing that and not implementing it, they get a huge rating. People speak like they moved mountains when in fact they just changed some metadata in a web console.

I have heard people complaining so much about others getting promoted. That is the culture now. Everyone wants to beat others and become highest Grab levels in career ladder but never once I heard anyone really talking about fixing issues for the customers or drivers.

Promotions:

Anybody can get promoted just by speaking endlessly without creating value for end-users. Grab has managed to create a culture where everyone wants to be promoted alone whether they make end-users happy or not. Are Grab drivers really happy? No I don't think so. If you say you are from Grab, they complain so much but they still keep you in car because of their professionalism. But the people inside Grab do not have that much professionalism.

I have known people who got promoted just by portraying themselves as experts from other top companies or just by doing worse internal products that do not really add any value to the service teams. Just for their performance review they do it. 

People who have just worked in industry for 2 or 3 years can become manager if they just express that interest and they are not evaluated whether they are managerially suitable or not. So people who report to them are screwed.  
I have known really good people leave the company because of the stupid politics.

Wanting to get promoted is not a bad thing. But if you copy Google and Amazon culture blindly, you get a culture where Gmail interface is changed just because someone wanted to get promoted and they just put billion users to relearn whatever they spent learning in Gmail interface.  There are so many improvements that can be made in Grab Food but it is not done because of promotion-centric mindset. That's why other apps in market are better to use as a customer. GrabFood is used only because of the subscription to avoid paying delivery charge."

- SRE/devops is the worst group here, they have not been able to ramp-up in past 3 years, they were highly in-effective in managing incidents and prod environments, that now they have moved all responsibilities to service groups(Regular engg are being turned into SREs against their wishes) and call themselves core SRE group, who don't do anything other than preaching and finding faults.

There were a small handful of full-timers who were nice and competent - got to give credit when it's due.","Mostly, the people working there are highly incompetent, both the temporary staff and the permanent staff.  A lot of people holding management roles completely disconnect with the customer service staff in the front lines. 

The worse incident was when one of the bosses actually arrange meetings with potential interviewees but make them wait for easily hours. He always cannot be found/reached by the front line workers, who are always the receiving end of anger.

When there are angry customers and clients who demand to speak to the manager,  many of the senior permanent staff avoid responsibility and tell the temporary staff to relay that the ""manager"" is not in. The fact that these senior staffs choose to hide in the backend and avoid responsibility shows a lack of capability.

Despite feedback to senior management about the lack of manpower, no action is taken and instead, we get feedback like ""they need to learn how to manage it themselves"". This kind of responses reflect how disconnected the senior staff are from what's happening on the ground."

Lack of documentation in tech side. We need to ask around to get things done. When I'm still a newbie, even asking around produce no clear outcome.

The market opportunities are really solid compared to many other startups. Senior leadership is (in my opinion) really pro-active and competent in growing the business.

There's quite a bit of mess though, but mess represents opportunities to have a big impact, so long as you can come to terms with that. The corollary is that you reasonably can expect to have better (i.e. easier) opportunities to have a larger impact than some of the more mature tech companies in Seattle.

Founders are truly passionate, and do take concrete action in trying to create a good culture.","Grab has been suffering from relatively high turnover and attrition. While building an enduring engineering organization is one of the OKRs, but I've seen very little attention given by upper management and concrete plans communicated on what steps the organization is taking towards this. All the oxygen is spent on outcompeting in our strategic markets, growing the business, or keeping our service up. 

So... amongst other things, forget about any sort of training on things like ethics and compliance, diversity and inclusion. It results in situations such as there being (large) teams in Seattle which suffer from extreme homogeneity in race/country-of-origin... and where if you're not a member of this race, you're part of the out-group...

One's strength is being fairly assessed, that you may fall on the right tasks and areas, where you can innovate and develop your existing gifts and even receive new ones. Talking about compensation... Not a thing to question about, with Grab, as long  you're doing your part, with willingness to go extra mile, a great reward always comes at the end of the day.","Downsides?... Downsides are everywhere, no matter what job or company you are in. For me, it only depends on the person on how he/she sees every situation. If your mind is set to find reasons not to ""Grab"" your dreams, then you will always find a lot. But if you'll set your heart and spirit right, you'll see challenges as ""Opportunities"", problems as  ""Time to Perform"", failures as ""Learning Process"", and fear as ""Time to believe""

It is not a perfect company but it tries really hard to do the right thing, often in very difficult situations. The company has matured in a substantial fashion, and while there are certainly areas where it has to improve on, the trajectory is in the right direction.

Grab is unsurpassed in some areas:

a. Product/customer obsession. There is a reason its the unicorn it is. No other company in SEA shows the level of focus to customers that Grab does.

But we do need to consider the trade-offs that we make when we are hacking against our system and app experience. And make those decisions with our eyes open. 
2. Fast headcount means that you may find yourself in a dynamic environment e.g. having to work with new people every week.  Not a bad thing, if you like fast pace and working in a diverse environment.  But bad if you are not adaptable and if you expect everything to be running SOP-ed."

- Immature execs who want to be worshiped and put a lot of pressure on others who dont comply. abusive/aggressive behavior is not condoned and flows down the chain. 
- No concern for employee welfare. Believe in extracting as much as possible from  employees until they burn out.  If you are in Grab, be prepared to sacrifice everything. Run with a military mindset - the best employees are those that are completely brainwashed.

They say and look like they listen (surveys are sent out regularly) but you will realise they don't since nothing really changes.. after a while.
