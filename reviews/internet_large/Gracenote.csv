This is when the HRBP of Gracenote responded to me and then she told me she would provide me with the experience letter. Now its been two weeks and I have not heard back from both of them despite repeated emails to them. I dont understand why they are not able to provide something as trivial as this. My greencard application is stuck in a limbo because of them.

How to be a cool guy who gets ahead at Gracenote:

When asked why there are no women at the top with you, wonder aloud why they would want such a position, since they wouldn't really fit in with the guys, and like, you wouldn't want them to be uncomfortable, you know? Wring your hands in faux concern while others pat you on the back for ""just being honest"" about your profound respect for women and their fragile fee-fees. After all, the saying is ""limitation is the sincerest form of flattery,"" right?

Talk loudly about the spreadsheet of emojis you use to log which base you hit with your OKCupid and Tindr dates. Tell your coworkers that the woman who gave you guff about your behavior is mentally unstable and probably just wants your bits.  Undermine her suggestions and authority every chance you get. Also remind everyone you're a feminist, even though you've sat out of every conversation about the rampant sexism and ageism in the company, because those just weren't the time or place, ok?

Design ""cultural fitness"" interview questionnaires so only a narrow subset of your white 30- and 40-something male friend group can pass muster for the job. It’s cool though, you ask if they like Sonic Youth and Run the Jewels, so it's totally not sexist or racist. Besides, you voted for Hillary!

Fire off some nonsense in a company message board about how we are, like, DUTY-BOUND to leave piles of dishes in the sink for the cleaning ladies to deal with, even though it causes them to fall so far behind on their other tasks that their employer threatens to terminate them -- because gosh darn it if we don’t give them a mess to clean up, WHAT will they DO for A LIVING???? WON'T YOU THINK OF THE(IR) CHILDREN???

Extra credit: When you find out the lead candidate for a promotion is the woman who pointed out that the above argument is nonsense, use your authority to have the entire position pulled.

TLDR: Gaslight all the women. Put down their ideas. Repeat their suggestions. Take their credit. Like some Instagram posts from this or that women's march. Feel real good about yourself. Lather, rinse, repeat.

How to be a cool chick who gets ahead at Gracenote:

Warm a seat for a real long time so you can get promoted to a position of power that lets you FINALLY pay your female employees ............. $4,000 a year less than men in the same entry-level position 🙃

Ask men who successfully moved into different roles to speak at a meeting about lateral movement within the organization, because their career is just, like, SO inspiring and neato bandito. Tell a woman who expresses interest in doing the same that this is why people don't like working with her, and that if she doesn't like her job, maybe she should just leave?  

Withhold a promotion from a woman because she hasn't been at the company long enough. Six months later, promote her male coworker a whole two positions up, though he's been there half as long as -- and accomplished quantifiably less than -- that same woman.

Use company cultural events as an opportunity to do  exotic dances in front of your coworkers. Do it in ""ethnic"" clothing because that makes it a whole, like, educational diversity thing. ??????

Write up another woman because some guy felt uncomfortable with a grumpy face she made. Complain a few months later when someone on the street tells you to smile. Be sure to completely miss the irony.

Extra credit: Reconsider a female candidate when she writes the standard follow-up email after her interview, because that's just ""weird"" and ""aggressive"". Be sure to remind everyone how much adversity you faced trying to move upward as a female 'snoter, again completely failing to recognize how you perpetuate that atmosphere of hostility.

TLDR never say a n y t h i n g about the crap environment for women at Gracenote, and actively rejoice in the downfall of women who do, because you know if you keep your mouth shut but your lips parted you too will finally get promoted! Hey, Beyoncé said you should make that paper, right?","Sometimes you look at yourself and feel like a fraud who is perpetuating the very injustices you claim to rally against, and that some day everyone will find out how deeply you've internalized the patriarchy and how transparently terrified you are of actually doing anything to challenge the status quo. But just take a shot from the keg on 13 and shake it off, cuz you got this 💖"

They do not care about your work, how you do it, there is no point in trying to be good at your point, because it will never be acknowledge.

They have no interest in your personal life or how you are feeling. Some of the team leaders do not even talk to their team members. 

The communication is horrible. You never know what is going on and what will happen. Not even in you own team. They are very bad and slow at making decisions.

They are really cheap. They do not give anything to the employees, and they try to save every little cent, instead of rewarding the employees for a good job.

200,Gracenote,Great Experinece,2017-06-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I had a great experience at the company and don't have anything bad to say. I go a better job for more money and more responsibility at another company.  Part of the reason they wanted me was because I was working at Gracenote. People in the industry know that Gracenote is doing things in an entirely new way and they want to know how to do it.  It makes you more valuable,"For me, I don't have a lot of cons. For some people, who are not as outgoing as I am and don't volunteer for as many projects, they might find it harder to get ahead. Managers are really busy so sometimes it is hard to get them to focus on you. Overall, there have been a lot of changes in my area but I think the change has been managed really well and so I have no cons about this either. Maybe more snacks in the kitchen"

209,Gracenote,No more a suitable company,2017-04-25,1.0,A Hard Working Employee,"-With huge changes over the last couple of years, honestly, not many left worth mentioning .","- Gracenote used to be a great company to work for some years back and had an amazing culture. Vibes among the employees were mostly positive . 
But with recent changes of moving from one parent company to another , lot of great people left the company and took the great culture along with them.What is left now at higher management  level are bunch of selfish souls who are only worried about their retention bonus and salaries . They are making random layoffs every few months to balance their budget and have no vision on how to grow the company .

- Growth is very limited if you only work hard , you need to lick your manger's boot to grow in this company , that is the culture being promoted lately .

- Very little influence of engineering , company has stopped respecting quality engineers  and that too when they are aware that  there is shortage of engineering talent and not many people like to join a company in that part of East Bay . Surely , some people in management are not seeing signs of downfall or are ignoring them for immediate personal benefits .

- Some people at higher management have been around for years and are now feeling insecure about their position . They have been taking irrational decisions to keep their position strong in the company . Its all messy politics now !"

Great colleagues and learning experience. Very relevant projects given. Lots of fun events and activities.",I can't find any cons working in Gracenote
213,Gracenote,can't disclose,2017-04-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Given the reviews here I want to weigh in.  Your experience here will, like at many companies, depend on what function you work in, who you report to, and how much freedom you have within your job.  Some of those reviewing here are at the medium to low level on the reporting chain, so they likely don't have much visibility in co strategic developments; this does not mean that the co is doing poorly.  The company just got acquired by Nielsen a few months ago, which is a sign that its core business and products have meaningful value.  Though there will be some changes at the leadership level with, understandably, GN departures where there is overlap, many changes are bound to be more at the higher level and the core operations will operate substantially similarly from the way it has been working now.  

The peripherals (e.g. festivities, theme events) by HR are frequent, probably once every 2 weeks or so.  Free snacks and fresh fruit are available daily; they are not like the perks at Google-esque companies, but they are reasonably good, offer some healthy options, and are certainly not scant.  A good representation of co-workers will join in depending on the festivities, and many have friendly co-worker friends like me.  Some eat lunch together in our kitchens, which has a relaxed environment; otherwise go off and eat on their own.  From what I observe, there is a good deal of freedom here.  

Compensation-wise, some are happy with their compensation while others feel it's below market.  In my view, the company is willing to offer equitable compensation if it feels you are worth it.  I for one was offered above-market compensation, which allows me to focus on doing a good job and not look elsewhere.  

For those in engineering positions, the co is taking steps to recruit good people to the east bay.  While I have seen some turnover in this function, there are also some who have been here for a good amount of time and they happen to be people I enjoy working with, which confirms to me that those good at what they do and have good personalities tend to do well in the long run.","I have seen those who are uncomfortable with change not do well here; they tend to spend a lot of time talking with others like them and their negative energy likely spills over to the quality of their work.  

BTW, change does not happen every day here; it is gradual and not chaotic, but some people are unnerved by seeing turnover and any change.  The turnover is however generally routine and to be expected with acquisitions, biz need to re-direct, and also the need to rid very poor performers.  What is true is that the turn to contractors for some functions has, unfortunately, led to less-than-ideal temp hires that drag down operational smoothness due to either (1) lack of institutional knowledge (2) subpar competence and/or (3) no real commitment to their job given perhaps their thinking that they are here only temporarily.  However, I put these cons in perspective with the many positives that the company offers: comfortable culture, meaningful work, good positioning of former startup under new parent, good or OK colleagues, free food, great commute and comp for self, and believe that there are others who feel similarly as me."

Complete ownership of channels and edits. You get to learn how to interact properly with international clients and can develop a real camaraderie if you have a knack for it.

Small and efficient teams. Eliminates work politics to a great extent. Plus, you get to know each and everyone really well.

The work will always have a bit of a challenge no matter how versed you are with your channels and stations. Thankfully, most of clients I came across were really helpful and understood the difficulties faced.

Great work from home policies and probably the highest number of leaves granted in any company I have worked so far.

The office space was lavish, in the heart of the Central Business District.

Free snacks and beverages. De-stressing room with games.","Probably too many C level employees were hired for a team that small and thus, they weren't able to make good on revenue generation.

It takes a really long time for knowledge transfer to happen from the States to India and in the meantime, new hires would just be twiddling thumbs.

- I like my coworkers, both the ones that have been around as long or longer than me, and the new ones. I like them at work and for the occasional get together after.
- Great music culture. There are always instruments sitting around. Especially as we get close to the annual Gracenote Jam! I often see coworkers out randomly at shows. Sometimes on stage.
- Fun, encouraging culture.
- Most of the engineering managers I've worked with will try to accommodate if you want to get into a new area or learn a new skill.","Since I joined, especially in the last few years, Gracenote has expanded into areas beyond music that I'm less interested in. But that's just personal."

262,Gracenote,Creative company with amazing tech work,2016-05-16,4.0,,"Some amazing tech work you won't find anywhere else in one place!

Engineering employs a wide variety of technologies, and new ones are adopted regularly. Opportunities to keep current and try new things. Hard to get bored.

Work involves more creativity than the average tech company. Lots of creative people.

Relaxed work environment. You don't have people sleeping under desks like you see at certain trophy job companies in Silicon Valley. Amazing views from all sides of the office. Lots of snacks in the kitchens (not enough good lunch choices in the surrounding neighborhood though).

The Gracenote Jam is awesome. The company rents a night club once a year, and Gracenote employee bands play all night. There should be more company events like this.

The Gracenote hackathon is amazing, but should be opened up to the outside world instead of just employees.","Still a fair amount of legacy tech/tech debt to remove. It's a good thing that management recognizes the need to replace old stuff with new, but they need to dedicate more engineering resources to the problem. It looks like they are, but not fast enough in my opinion.

Too much focus on always building the next new thing and too little focus on maintaining and improving the things that pay the bills. It is fun to build new stuff, but it's not fun to have to fix old things that break.

There always seems to be a budget crunch so we have to constantly economize, even though the company is apparently doing well financially. Huh? This doesn't make a lot of sense and is a huge distraction for employees.

Fair compensation and reasonable benefits, but not mind blowing."

No unified goals or clear path to what the future of the company looks like.
Compensation and benefits are not competitive for Bay Area, so top talent can't get hired or retained.

Incompetent people hired from outside instead of growing and developing people within.

- Lots of challenging & quality work. The company is growing at a crazy pace. Gracenote just acquired couple of small sports companies & launched new Sports vertical on top of existing Music & Video verticals

- Being a small company many core products are developed by small teams. Ability to be part of product from design to delivery phase. Provides significant opportunity for one to contribute & deliver impact. Ex: The entire Gracenote Mobile SDK's for iOS, Android & Windows is managed by a team of 3 people.  

- Smart & friendly peers. Meetings are short & to the point. Ex: Just a small flow diagram & the entire  team is able to grasp the product direction

- Management/Company supports employees to be creative/innovative. Some of the products are outcome of ideas from yearly Hackathon

-  Open communication. Every one is welcome to walk into senior employee' s' at Gracenote desk to get their questions/concerns addressed

- Fun events every other month.Musical Jam sessions, wherein employees sing/play different instrument & party out. How cool is that :)

-  Awesome view of the bay & Golden Gate  bridge :) Come check us out","- Company is located in Emeryville & freeway leading to the place are clogged 24/7. Commuting to/from office can be challenge some times.

Projects involve invention, not cookie cutter application.

The location (Emeryville) is an easy East-Bay commute.","There are some legacy technologies to integrate with.  Any company that's been around as long as Gracenote will have these.  On the flip-side, there's lots of opportunity to make a big impact by refactoring.

New opportunities for development as well as the need for deep support of a large code base are constantly driving the engineering teams that build the Service, use it, and support it.  There is tremendous diversity among the people at Gracenote, which makes for strong, interdisciplinary teams. Originally, I came on board and worked at HQ, but I have become a remote employee after returning to the east coast.  The Service development team and its management have been absolutely fantastic about helping to make that a great experience.","The Service team sees a lot of churn with regard to short-term work.  Management continues to improve control over this, but some team members definitely do not get enough time to focus on longer-term objectives.  There has also been some loss of focus as Gracenote has grown through acquisition.  Add to that the fact that our role in the parent company (Tribune Media) is practically inscrutable.  For some folks this represents opportunity, but I find it disconcerting since my background was always working in the core of east coast computer companies where company mission was obvious (and focused)."

If I could rate this company negative stars I would. I look at some of the positive reviews and I just want to laugh. Obviously forced by management to write, and the only people they could get to do this are low level IT-type guys who probably sit in some cubical and has no clue what's actually going on in the rest of the company.

- Zero process, all chaos
- No efficiency whatsoever. Expect to take the most frustrating route for every project you do.
- General incompetence. 
- Management spends 90% of time with internal politics and in-fighting rather than actual work.
- Management does not know a single thing about the products, markets, or competitors. And they are not willing to listen or learn. What a joke.
- If you are smart, expect your output to be purposely and severely worsened, because clueless management butchers it up to make it seem like they are ""contributing"". 
- If you are smart and produce good work, you will not be appreciated at all, but instead threatened.
- Nobody intelligent or significant wants to be at the company. They are either already out or on the way out. 
- First Sony wants to get rid of it, then Tribune wants to get rid of it. Except now it is even worse because everyone good left, and they lumped in all the worst parts of Tribune. It's basically the ugly stepchild that nobody wants.
- 20% lower salary than market

* Old timers & arrogant team members: people who claim they have been working in the industry for N+ years will keep banning your idea and force you to do stuff the old fashion way because they think they have more experiences than you.
* Status Quo: people will guard their portion of system and if you need them to make certain changes, good luck, you will have to open a ticket, go through their approval, and they have to prioritize, etc., by that time you probably found a better solution yourself. 
* Ego: there are engineers who don’t want to do any real work to the existing products and keep looking for projects they can dictate and get credits from. The classic one for example, always emphasis on how to improve business process, development process, testing process, documentation process, etc., but never get any real things done.
* Management integrity: Decisions are made without transparency or communications. A lot of false promises to employees just to keep them stay. This happens from top to bottom, mid-management gets false promises from top executives, and they will do the same to their direct reports.
* “Team work”: there are groups that will team up together to push out something only to their benefits. They will act together in the meeting to make you sound foolish if you don’t agree with them.

311,Gracenote,great enthusiasm needs follow through,2015-02-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Gracenote attracts a lot of people passionate about media, and this is felt through the workplace culture, which is pretty great overall. This makes coming into work everyday enjoyable, on the most part. Perks are on the medium side for a Bay Area tech company.","Insufficient alignment to achieving goals; fragmented ability to get things done due to ""team fiefdoms"" not working together. Some senior management (who have been at the company for a long time) doesn't get that the business is no longer a startup and that success can only be achieved by being organized and thorough. Product quality often suffers as a result of this."

There is a goo work-life balance and management tries to keep morale up with regular organized events.,"Lethal combination of a few hard core old-timers with self-serving agendas and a set of new leadership scrambling to undo the damage of years of poor, ADD-afflicted management.  The recent selling/acquisition set off another round of shuffling and new faces/priorities."

318,Gracenote,Unless you're a mind reader...,2014-06-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Gracenote offered great benefits, fair salary structures, but was challenged with keeping satellite employees looped in effectively. As I've read on other reviews, let me echo that this is a good stepping stone for your career, but not a true 'home.'","You'll need a copy of MANAGING UP by Roger Gittines, unless you're a certified mind-reader. A good manager knows how to nurture, delegate and build a healthy working rapport with subordinates. Such was not the case for me."
319,Gracenote,Don't expect a promotion but do expect a great place to start a career before moving on to something else.,2014-05-15,2.0,,"The topic of entertainment and technology runs  strong amongst the culture.  If you're music or film nerd, you will be pleased to find others like you.  Stable company offering solid work / life balance.  Flexible hours.  Health insurance.  Stocked kitchen.

The engineers that work here are some of the most talented that I've worked with.  The hackathons are always fun.","Having worked here for a long time, I've seen the company change for the better but it falls short with opportunities for professional growth and horrible politics.  Engineering practices for some of the more high profile projects are really frustrating to take part of due to lack of process and disconnect between management vision and certain engineering groups.  Many times, ownership isn't effectively communicated or expectations around what priorities should be produced is lacking across many teams.  

There's also a huge communication divide between groups, especially content and other engineering groups.  I'm not sure why it was the case but everyone in content seems really unhappy and less likely to socialize with other members of the company.

To get promoted, I've only seen people who greatly sacrifice their personal life on top of going way beyond expectation to the point of alienating their peers.  I've also seen people who are way very talented, capable, and possess great leadership abilities get passed up.  This has promoted a culture of elitism in some groups that I haven't really seen at other companies."
320,Gracenote,Intern,2014-03-26,4.0,Intern,Many chances to learn through talking to everyone in a flat work environment. A lot projects going on here. People are energetic here. Always interesting to explore new stuff from difference department,It seems a lot people here work for difference projects at the same time. You cannot ask people to focus on your project only because they may have other tasks to take care of as well.
321,Gracenote,"In transition, signs trending positive",2014-02-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Gracenote shook up senior leadership a few years ago, breaking some of the calcification and allowing a reaffirmation of their culture and identity. The recent acquisition by Tribune may help continue this redefinition.",Some of the departed executives were just downright mean. The product base and their engineering teams are fragmented and sometimes at odds with each other. The IT department is very immature and cliquish.

323,Gracenote,Worst company for career growth,2013-08-13,1.0,Software Engineer,"Common Pros that any company in SF has - Snacks, Food, parties, annual cruise, beer bash to be precise. Nothing great.",Management and Engineering managers don't know what they are doing. Engineering is always in rush to release products to customers without thinking whether products are ready and good to go. There is a false thought among engineering that there is plenty of work for engineers which is false as they find interns and cheap resources to get the job done in a hasty manner. Engineers don't get respected for their opinions and advice about any suggesions for making their products better. You may get a thank you email but at the end it is all hurry and don't worry policy. You will soon feel orphaned and disrespected. Raising concerns with HR is futile as they don't have any voice over employee concerns and issues. There are more directors and sr. Directors and sr. Engineers than normal Engineers who know what they are doing and with all the haphazarness it is not a surprise that competitiors are far advanced and popular.
324,Gracenote,Better management & more improvement needed,2013-07-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:  It's an easy place to work.  You won't work long hours and can come and go as you please.  This, ultimately, is uninspiring and lends itself to employees here knowing only how to work as individuals and not as a group.

Lots of fun events!  (Movies, concerts, parties, baseball tickets) GN makes a real effort to give back to their employees

CEO makes a real effort to reach out to all employees despite his assistant who will always tell you that he's unavailable.","Corporate culture is (unintentionally) comical here.  Complete boys' club with little to no diversity in upper management (all white males).  Favoritism is rampant starting with the CEO's own inner circle and working it's way down the management chain.  Lack of focus throughout the engineering side and could benefit from a more structured/focused approach to hiring.  Many people have positions here they can't define and often have a ""what the hell am I doing here again?"" look on their face in meetings.  

HR is ineffective.  There are good people on the team but the team leader serves only as a yes-man to the executive board which makes any kind of real progress or fair judgment calls impossible."

There is no solid product with quality, they dont even seem to be interested. They keep changing the title and doing all same thing over and over without improving it. Extremely hierarchical and political, and each manager has 2-3 direct reports. Obviously a lot of talks and complicated process with fingerpointings but anyone making real contribution gets ignored in this extreme politics - sounds like 30000 people company? They have 300 only.
You should expect 4 meetings per day and the micro management will blame you with a typo in you document without appreciating your day and night work. Very low respect to engineers, and whoever enjoys complicated process and millions of documents without real job being done will find home here."

There are still some decent groups like DSP and other assorted engineering groups to work for.,"Gracenote needs to remind itself that it's now SONY and should market that accordingly.  It went from a small startup to a huge corporation that has a Japanese business model.  Most of the senior management has cleared out. The fairly recent surge of ""Johnny Come Lately"" types hired there are not team players who have ruined the overall collaborative working environment that Gracenote was originally built upon.  Gracenote is not even fifteen years old.  That's a short time to be ageist."
337,Gracenote,Not a software development shop,2011-09-22,2.0,Software Engineer,"Liked most of the people I met there, but not so much with the management. In fact, the one manager that I liked abruptly left the company within weeks of my starting. Decor of the remodeled office was nice. Views of surrounding area were nice.","As a software developer with a long history of developing products, this was the worst possible place to work. It consisted primarily of developing ""scripts"" and patches to the existing, overly complex, system. There was no sense of code quality, only data quality. All that mattered was that the data in the database was correct (all well and good, mind you). Very much a database-oriented group, not a good place for an applications developer. Never heard of Agile development process, very much a traditional development model. Not at all a technology company. In fact, the state of technology there became very muddled with the introduction of .NET and Informatica, on top of the existing, delicate system (most of which was in PL/SQL, Perl, and Java)."

They close the office over July 4th weekend... it's like a free extra vacation week, without any email!  International company, so you may get lucky enough to travel.","Too many projects and not enough resources.  There's a significant lack of focus, and the company is missing a clear vision.  This is evident by the nearly constant series of fire drills and ""urgent"" issues being dealt with.  There was a recent regime change so it's still unclear if the new president will be able to change the culture in any major way; the previous president was very difficult to work with and mean."
