It is very sales intensive and you manage over 300+ accounts so time and mental stress management is imperative to do this job well.
45,Groupon,Amazing Benefits + Excellent earning potential.. if you can make it..,2022-02-16,4.0,Business Development Manager,"Amazing benefits with BCBS PPO. My maximum out of pocket is $1,500 and they're in network at most doctors offices and mental health centers. Disability benefits are included after 1 year which offers 100% of your salary and average of past year's commissions. 401k matching after 3 years. Uncapped commissions with the opportunity to make some serious money if you can master the craft. Good training program. Unlimited PTO.","Extremely high turnover. It's not an easy job or an easy sell; with most sales job, the objective is to close a deal and that's it. At Groupon, you have to create a campaign that you believe will sell well to customers and then sell that to the merchant. Groupon's platform heavily focused on customer acquisition and often the campaign that has the highest chance of selling may not be immediately profitable for the merchant. Usually, there's a lot of negotiations and it can be challenging to get business owners to see the big picture and the potential ROI. If you can get the merchant to agree, the results are usually rewarding as a good chunk of your comp is based on sales. However, there are times when you do everything right, and for whatever reason the campaign won't sell. BDR starting pay and comp plan frankly sucks, which is where you see most of the turnover. If you are able to succeed as a BDR, you'll like get promoted within the first year and a half. Those who are promoted, typically stick around although the ever-changing objectives from upper management and inequity between verticals can make it challenging. 

Gender bias in the sales org is another problem that I've experienced when it comes to promotions and overall respect. I know that this is a problem everywhere, and it's something that I've experienced first hand many times. I will say that they've come a long way in my time there in terms of hiring more female mangers, but, they still have a long way to go. In my experience, I've watched countless men get promoted the first time they were eligible, while I've had to passed over for promotions twice now even though I'm performing at and often above the level of my male colleges in the director position and the feedback I receive is always vague and subjective and not based on my performance or contributions. 

The first time, the feedback I received was literally 'you're doing great. we just want to see it for more quarters.' I can't help but wonder if this would have been the same outcome if I was a man. There was actually a man in a different vertical who started in the same class as me who was promoted that round. He was hard working and well deserving, but at the same time, so was I. The only difference between the two of us was that he was a male and finished that quarter 130% to goal and I was a female and finished 244% to goal. That said, I put my head down, and continued to 'prove myself' for 6 more months and was promoted the next round. The second time, I was up for a promotion I was passed over (this time for BDD), the feedback I received was extremely subjective and had nothing to do with my performance or contributions to the company. The manager that made the decision had been transferred to my department the same week I was interviewed. so he really didn't know me or didn't care to. The feedback I recieved was based solely on my personality or in his words, 'the qualities we look for in a BDD'. This was interesting because I've been performing at or above the level as the BDDs in my department since my second quarter as a BDR. I've literally never been less than 150% to goal. I am passionate, driven, knowledgeable and I genuinely care about the merchants I work with. I am also flawed. I have qa quirky personality and a strong mid-western accent. So, I sound different than most sales people. This 'quality' of mine makes me memorable to merchants when I call them. Sometimes, I stutter or stumble over my words. This is an insecurity of mine, but in hindsight, I think this flaw actually makes it easier for me to get the merchants trust because it conveys a sense of humanity. So, yes, many of these qualities don't fit his idea of the qualities of a good sales person, but that shouldn't disqualify me from a promotion. I'm able to close profitable/high volume deals because I know my ins and outs of my department, I am detail oriented and know what will sell and what won't, and I believe in the power of Groupon's platform and am able to convey the big picture to merchants."

- Clients can be disrespectful and hard to work with. Sometimes we have to deal with their frustrations from being forced to do certain things with their campaigns, which makes it harder to work with some.

179,Groupon,Embarrassing Treatment of Employees,2021-09-26,2.0,Merchant Development,Your team and manager are everything. Sales managers have serious dedication and patience to constantly be low-balled. They are incredible. Sales managers for this company have the job of peddling nonsense from leadership and finding a way to have their team survive. The best,"I have been at Groupon for a long time. Over the past two years, we lost a lot of really good talent to other competitors. We are losing tenured employees constantly, and no amount of new candidates from elsewhere will be able to fill in for the understanding of Groupon like our current employees.

Base pay has largely been the same for the better part of at least three or four years. Commission has changed constantly, usually not in anyone's favor. Our business development friends get a much better bonus by being paid on a contact's performance. Working in the account management side in sales does not.

Management will always be defensive when asked about this, saying they're either looking into it, or justify it by saying that they are in-line with its competitors. A quick view of any glassdoor, RepVue, or indeed profile of their competitor companies will show that yeah, we're in range of competitors by being the literal bottom of the barrel in wages and commission. Every, time.

Management is not positive towards that kind of criticism. It's always deflect. Politics are terrible here as well, and I've seen some real bad performers get promoted because of tenure.

Don't come here to do sales. I promise you that it is not worth the frustration"

189,Groupon,Work for a business that only cares about liquidating,2021-09-21,1.0,Business Development Representative,It is easier to list the pros this company gave because there was so little. The people are genuinely really nice and you can work remotely.,"Where to start: poor management (does not look at potential or anyway to help employees grow), unorganized (takes days, if not weeks to get back information from HR, IT, and administrative), constantly changed the commission structure (monthly basis - cut it by 50% while requiring we sell more to get our OTE), purposely give the stellar salesman (been there for more than 3+ years) warm leads, BDD & BDM's had access to reserving accounts so we could spend 20+ minutes researching businesses only to be told we can't request them because they are on hold for someone else (not very sales friendly), lead generation never gave you a message if your lead was a good or bad one business, management would have to SELL their own product on their employees because salesman (BDR's, BDD's, and BDM's are leaving like crazy), we take over 70-80% of the businesses money leaving them at the breakeven point, the objective is to target new businesses that do not know better and take advantage of them for a short while (vile business model), made the culture of the company a new employee task by making a culture club that, YOU GUESSED IT, is run by employees that have been at the company for less than 1 year (CULTURE ALWAYS CHANGES AND WILL NEVER BE THE SAME), they asked me to give my SSN and my DOB again during my last month at the company because they changed ""HR Providers"" to equifax (known data leaks) - first off, they should not need to ask me again considering they have this information from when I first hired, and no employer should ever ask their employees for that information after they have provided it once, it felt very unprofessional, unethical, and very illegal. Last thing, when I left, Groupon did not give me any time to print my payslips, look at any emails that were important, say goodbye to any of my colleagues, talk to any of management to receive data about my performance, and just receive any lasting info for references and networking. The one thing that stood out about leaving, is that they were so quick with booting me from the system that it felt like they had something to hide.

Overall, you will be selling a product (NOT A SOLUTION LIKE THEY WILL TRY TO SELL THE EMPLOYEES ON). This product is not a good one unless you contact a business that has the employees and capacity to handle more customers. You still have to be able to sell them on losing 70%-80% of the cost of their service to bring in customers - in reality, what Groupon is asking businesses, we will be your POS, but if a customer does not come in you will not pay us a dime, but we don't have to pay you either (Groupon will make 100% profit if that voucher is not redeemed - very suspicious & unethical for how much money is collected). The only people benefitting from this if you are not a large business is the Customers and Groupon, so if you have a soul and understand how the economy, GDP, and overall money flow works, you will understand that Groupon undermines all of that, they do not care how many businesses they hurt in the process of gaining power & money. For instance, just go look at their BBB rating.

Cheers and best of luck to future Grouponians,

I hope this helped."

209,Groupon,Not a company to grow long term at,2021-08-31,3.0,Merchant Development,"--Unlimited PTO and work life balance heavily promoted: very flexible managers promoting taking time off to prevent sales burnout, competitions to win half days/full days, general sense of time off to enjoy. Feel very respected with the unlimited PTO. 

--Great direct management: direct managers provided with good tools to coach and help grow sales reps, great initial learning skills for sales cycle -Initial upward mobility 

--Good starting job out of college and strong company brand recognition. 

--Fully remote for sales (could be seen as a pro or con depending on the person) 

--Very easy to hit quota, nobody even has to try that hard to get it. Good pay for how simple the work is.

--Good benefits 

--Great diversity and inclusion program, very open minded and makes this a priority for employees","--Awful upper management: specifically at an RVP level in Merchant Development, they don't provide any follow up or action taken within the department, we are treated very immaturely (for example, we are sent reminders on how to turn on an out of office signature - seems demeaning for teams that have been here for 4+ years), another RVP sends daily emails about personal reflections/life coaching which feels inappropriate 

--Rude communication from other departments that seem to work against you (specifically Risk Management who berates sales reps daily and even gets in fights with sales managers- about everyone on my team has gotten yelled at for spelling a name wrong in emails, etc.) - doesn't create an inclusive workspace 

--Groupon doesn't seem to put businesses first, it shows with merchant retention and new business 

--Very slow and not a lot of work - our team has asked to take on other verticals or projects since some days we have less than 1 hour of work given our vertical is so slow. Doesn't seem to be a general desire for management to help teams find additional work. 

--Trajectory of business/business outlook not strong

--Promotion cycle for roles is tedious and vague (has taken some reps 3-4+ years versus some at 8 months)"

- Some departments seem to be run on gut feeling. Therefore projects are shut down quickly without notice. It's good business, but can upend employee stability. Outside Sales, I always saw people be reallocated, not lose their job."

Favorite part was quitting after 2.5 years of employment and 400k in revenue, the expensed 'work from home' equipment and I had to pay Groupon $400 for my desk and chair, etc. The laptop never made it back to them in the mail and they don't want it, just the $.

I understand what they are trying to do - but if you aren’t part of the special group, these *race based policies* feel awfully discriminatory...

Also, people at Groupon fall into 2 categories. Their team, boss, and subordinates were laid off, and they are doing 5 jobs across 80 hour weeks.

2.) The flexibility is great. As long as your work is done timely and well, no one seems to care if you're putting in 40 hours.
3.) Good benefits. Other than unlimited PTO (which has pros and cons), I would say Groupon's benefits package is average.","1.) Very little upward mobility. The company talks about career progression a lot, but isn't proactive about retaining its workforce. Promote people when they do great work, give them titles and raises commensurate with the new responsibilities they take on.
2.) Pay in general. It is on the low-end of competitive unless you are in product & engineering or high levels of management.
3.) Company talks a lot about culture and they have created a dynamic workforce, but the institution itself doesn't do much of the heavy lifting when it comes to improvements. That all comes from employees going above and beyond."

449,Groupon,Most UnAmerican Company,2021-02-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Unlimited PTO
-Groupon Volunteer group/charity work","Avoid this company at all cost. Management is a mess and lacks any direction. So much politics and favoritism, people and managers ok with mediocrity just to hit deadlines rather than focus on quality. They rip off customers with stupid policies and refund practices which change so often with a pretend desire to help but with all intentions of making it difficult for a customer to get a refund. And if you’re a merchant you get equally screwed, just lookup the story of the cupcake business that almost went under because of them. So many shady businesses practices which is no wonder they were involved in a class action lawsuit not so long ago.

They will easily lay off American workers only for you to find out your job was shipped overseas to Poland, India, and some other vendor outside the US because they want cheap labor. Management support themselves only so don’t believe their mantra about supporting their people or the rank and file, that’s pure BS. You’re a peon and grunt that is disposable at any time. ZERO JOB SECURITY or even proper recognition.

And they speak about developing their people and promoting from within but there really is no mentorship from leadership, it’s sink or swim. They all need a course on proper management and people development because they would then take it against you for not doing well when you’re not properly mentored or coached, no feedback. It’s ridiculous. The tools are there, they don’t use it. 

Poland leaders are full of themselves, same with those in India. They’re the real cancer of the company, but hey they’re cheap so Groupon keeps them, expands those sites and invests in them. Never mind the American worker.

Lastly, your PII is not safe with Groupon as a job applicant. They will not let you close down your account unlike other companies. Shady, shady, shady.

This is all preCovid so just imagine how much worse it is now."

Shocking."
642,Groupon,The WORST company I worked in,2020-10-01,1.0,Account Manager,"Nice office and free fruit, that's it really","Where do I start?
From the stress exercised upon the employees due to the continous change of direction (one week you focus on onboarding new accounts, the one after on developing the current ones, then on getting important brands on the website, then on workig via consignment rather than with drop-shippers, then get more sales screw the margin, then get more margin screw the sales, and it keeps going)...

The incompetence of some employees and especially managers was appalling. I have seen managers that had verbally abused employess getting promoted and competent managers being laid off.
I have seen popular but incompetent account managers getting praised and account managers generating a ton of revenue not even getting a pat on the back.

Worse, during the period that led to the lay off ot f the majority of their employees I personally witnessed lies from the vice-president and the HR department in terms of how to choose people to fire, or they made personal favors to employees that made deals behind everybody's back. I wish I could disclose more details on that.
Also, they offered peanuts as a redundancy payments, while offering a ton of money to the then-CEO Rich Williams for getting out of the company after he destroyed it.

Good thing they are slowly going out of business"
643,Groupon,Good to start with... Bad to end with,2020-09-30,2.0,Business Development Representative,"I worked for Groupon for about 2 years, so this info will be regarding pre and post covid19.

-Honestly, they give a pretty great training program. I feel like my sales skills were really improved over time with their structure and the way they initially train their reps.
-Free snacks in office (though they were limited)
-Good benefits and ""unlimited PTO"" (post-covid19 unlimited PTO was pretty much non existent and you had to get PTO double or triple approved weeks in advance)
-Great peers and coworkers (for the most part)
-Fun in-office environment before covid19","-company is going downhill
-upper management and management in general have no idea what they are doing
-micromanagement that seems to be getting pushed from C level employees
-major changes in commission structure (started out making a decent commission percentage, then they changed to a smaller commission percentage with a larger base pay, then they took commission away all together and only paid on launched deals
-they are always doing some weird sneaky things with your money (I've personally had to call into HR to receive bonuses that were missed on their end, and I had a coworker that was missing nearly 5K in commission)
-the merchants you will reach out to are either out of business or HATE groupon 
-they encourage you to harass merchants to the point of legal threat
-constant Zoom meetings to chat about ""feedback"" on the new program Groupon has laid out... employees give challenges on how their newly enforced pitch has been going over with merchants while upper management tells reps that they just need to do better and keep pushing 
-petty petty petty environment, everyone is talking about someone else, make sure to have all your ducks in a line because even if you have something in your personal life, Groupon managers will bring it to your professional life
-no real sense of a promotional process, I know successful reps that have been exceeding metrics for months going on years and are still not promoted, while other reps that got lucky with a high selling deal get promoted or low performers get moved to a customer service roll instead of getting fired
-awful communication overall
-Groupon as a company is corrupt, they lied to their investors about where their money has come from and I know numerous current and former employees that are caught up in lawsuits with Groupon"

676,Groupon,"Fun at first but don't be fooled by the ""millennial"" culture",2020-08-31,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The company does a great job of making the office still feel like college. From the frequent team outings to the keg parties in the office I often felt like I was rushing Groupon. Everyone in the office seems to be around the same age which can be great if you're new to the city and want to meet a bunch of people. This can also be a problem if you catch my drift. The other thing the company does well is work-life balance. This is a job where you can leave at 5:00 and not have to worry that often about work.,"It's clear the company does not want to invest in its employees and encourages high turnover so that they can continue to hire people at low rates. There is no opportunity to negotiate pay even after several years of working there. The company also has an issue with working as a collective unit. It always seems like something is broken or a team isn't operating as they should. I blame this on too much expansion too quickly. The number of offices this company has is insane considering how many communication issues there are. The issues keep getting worse as the company continues to outsource work to save money. 
Work is based around non-sense KPIs that encourage mistakes or inflated numbers. Most of the job feels like tracking things for the sake of tracking instead of actually being strategic. 
If you're in sales it's very difficult to pivot into anything other than sales. I took a job in sales hoping I could grind it out for a year, prove myself as a worker and then pivot into other avenues. This was never the case. I ended up leaving to find opportunity and growth elsewhere."

Lots of MBA types that dont understand technology. Lots of spreadsheet trackers that change every quarter.

Bad Managers. Highly political. Don't be fooled by the cat spaceship and funny conference room names, Groupon is just like any other Fortune 1000 company (which they are not anymore), but ran very poorly.

These shortcomings are just a function of how the company is performing. They just dont have the $ to pay top dollar. ""A performers hire A performers, B performers hire B performers, not long until you get to Z"" - some apple guy

Groupon is around the C or D level. They cant attract talent so they have to settle just to fill the position. Be wary of anyone as this company that has a big title, they likely are not good at their job but are great at being political.

All of these rumblings are from someone who worked in product, so not sure if engineering is as bad, but things I hear there also point to a poorly run organization."

I stayed there for over five years.","The business is shrinking, and fast. We haven't had a new product in 10 years, each attempt is a cockamamie scheme that lasts 2 weeks. They are trying to nickel and dime everybody. It's really sad because the company has no competitors and could kill it. They have decided to take this frustration out on the sales people and the environment has become stressful and miserable. I literally felt myself and my fellow sales reps were devolving into cannibals. They fired 8.5 month pregnant rep in Sept 2019. This wasn't a bad rep mind you - this was a tenured sales person who had a difficult pregnancy. Out on her butt - the company refused to pay her a dime in benefits. I don’t think I’ll ever forget this cruelty. 

The newest thing is hire hundreds of college students and force them to make 80 dials per day and never promote them to the next level of rep so they could actually make a liveable wage and actually speak to potential clients instead of making fake dials. The newest managers are maybe 2 years out of college. There is very little investment in the employees, we all feel expendable and just a number. Promotions do not happen nearly fast enough.

- Groupon as an app looks old and doesn’t promote businesses but deals, the page looks dated and the product you’d have to sell is not a great product anymore, it’s not bad either, but it’s definitely not worth 54% of their margin. 
- no one wants to talk to you on the phone so a BDR position is just talking to people who want nothing to do with you
- there’s a requirement for calls and “touches” a day, as well as move forwards and contracts closed. I feel like these numbers are pretty high and actually become demotivating so people exaggerate on their numbers to reach their daily goal to make it look like they’re working harder than they are. 
- you’re expected to close 6 sliver + contracts a month. You can do it, but depending on their level of difficulty rated by Groupon (which doesn’t mean anything) you can get paid only 1,050 from launch bonuses  (before tax) on top of your base of 2k a month. So in essence, you can be making only 3k a month for working extremely hard if you’re deals don’t perform well (which they usually don’t bc ppl don’t buy Groupon as much as they used to) and be meeting the standard. But in actuality, many people don’t even close 6 contracts a month and close about 3 a month. So most people don’t even make 3k a month in their first year.

・Attractive salary (for Japanese experts)
・Game room is large with all basic things, such as T.T., Pool, Foosball, etc., but your time is so strictly regulated that it is remains only for the name sake.","If you are considering to join as Japanese language expert to this company, let me make some points clear.

・Rule of 15 min break
        In 9 hrs of office hour, you will be given (at pre-sheduled time) 15 mins break before lunch, 30 mins for lunch and 15 mins break after lunch. This is so strict that that a few mins extra may cost you scoldings from TL.
    In case you want to go to lavatory in other than break minutes, you may have to take permission from your TL. If you go without permission, TL may stop you. That’s s nearly a treatment like a school child or a slave.

・Phone rules
You cannot keep phone with you in office. Phones are kept outside. This rule is meant for data security, though manager and TL, etc., are not are restricted. Since company is so freaking strict about this that people are sacked out who are found violating any such rules related to security. So forget about your phone before you go your seat, no calls no messages. Obviously, you can utilize your break time to check missed calls and reply to messages.

・Disrespectful Management
Your Japanese skill might land you in respectful job in other industries, but here numbers and  statistics are the only thing that matter. Manager or TL are used to treating employees in most annoying and unprofessional way. Do not expect any respect, and be prepared to face humiliation for even smaller things, even if that is illogical.

・Job to say sorry, 80% of time
This expression plays major part of your job. You serve a point of contact for all kinds of problems of any customer. In most of the cases, you are not responsible for their trouble, but you will have to apologize to console customers. So, you will be in a job profile somewhat similar to `Apology Agencies` in Japan, who hires people to say sorry for somebody else’s mistake. So, you will be get paid to feel sorry and repetitively use the word ""So sorry”. This is simply not fair, because apologizing unnecessarily in not good no matter how much you are paid.

・Ever changing shifts
Shifts don’t allow you to take proper and natural sleep. Weekend are not fixed and it changes every month, it is impossible to plan a get together with friends who have their weekend on Sat, Sun. You cannot join any institute to pursue any course for any further advancement in career. You may not even plan for something that happens in Bangalore on fixed days."

It's nice to have additional incentives (sometimes in the form of bonuses) for contests. The training program is great and unique, they give you a ton of tools to set you up for success. If you want to get promoted to the next level, the expectations are very cut and dry. Overall you will learn a ton.","Business owners can be challenging to work with,  are more often than not emotional and  don't think logically. While you may be managing accounts, it's still very sales-heavy. The company is very large so there are a lot of moving parts. They talked about internal mobility but I think it's more challenging than described."

For those that take advantage, career progression can be quick moving.  There's a lot of opportunity to make a significant impact early in your career, and high tolerance for testing new ideas.  People are serious about their work, but don't take themselves too seriously.

In particular, Sales Operations has a great team culture.  Expectations are high, but the ability to make an impact on hundreds of sales reps is a motivator.  Team is comprised of a lot of strong performers with long Groupon tenure.","The quick pace and dealing with rapid change can be a deterrent for some who prefer more of a long lead time.  Seems to often be a disconnect between progress Groupon is making vs how it's interpreted by the street, and subsequently stock price."

Zero growth potential within the department.
Awful promotion process.
Old and dated equipment, was using a Mac from 2011 and PC’s are clunky and slow.
Upper management does not listen or care for anything. Can’t blame them though since the company itself is in such a bad position. There is no vision for the future. Retention of employees is very low. You’ll probably be hired at a lower salary than I was. The sales training team is useless, as they’ve not had real world experience in years."
1093,Groupon,Loved working at Groupon!,2019-06-01,5.0,Business Development Manager,"I loved working at Groupon over the 3 years that I was there.  It was fast paced, good fun, had a great culture with loads of opportunities to do try new things.  Hard work was rewarded with good commission.  

I joined at an early stage in my career and was promoted quickly after achieving targets and working hard.  I had great managers who were inspiring and taught me loads.  Their L&D department was great and gave lots of training throughout my time there.  I learnt so many great skills from Groupon that set me up for my career and I still keep in touch with some of the awesome people now, who have become my best friends.",Once you get to a mid/senior stage it is harder to progress/get promoted as you are in such huge teams of people.

1100,Groupon,Not an engineer's place to be,2019-05-18,2.0,Software Engineer,"Good culture, events, activities, nice kitchen with loads of junk snacks .","If you are an engineer and looking for long term prospects, this is not a place you want to be.
Lots of politics and bureaucracy. No matter how good you are, if you are not in good terms with higher management, forget about promotion.  

Once you join, you will quickly realise that SDE1,2and3 are all internally software engineers. But recruiters sell SDE3 as senior engineer while hiring. SDE4 is actually a senior engineer. Also don't be surprised if you find SDE3's earning more than SDE4. And your compensation might also vary based on team you are joining. 

You will be offered bonus and stocks as part of your CTC but its wise not to consider them at all. 
Groupon stock keeps on reaching its new low. 
And bonus, if you are really lucky you might get 30-40% of the amount mentioned. Bonus calculation, which compromises of company's and your own performance, is flawed. Company's performance takes precedence over your own, its not distributed 50-50. For ex - If company's performance is 50% and ours is 100%, you will only get 100% of 50% (Not 75%)

Managers and business organisations are changed frequently. So its not very uncommon to have 3-4 managers over a year. No solid engineering plan in place. No roadmaps, not clear transparency. S-team is only focused on teams that makes money for business, all other teams are treated as B-teams. 

My personal view - Groupon is a nice place to be for short term but definitely not for a long term perspective."

I have been able to internally transfer into a new position, so my experience with growth within has been very positive. The work life balance is absolutely incredible. I have had a great amount of work life balance in both departments that I have worked in. The work from home opportunities is also a huge benefit. Since being here, they have added in 401K matching opportunities as well which is a huge plus. Would definitely recommend working here if you're looking for an opportunity that entails growth and development.",Communication from Upper Management can be missing in certain situations regarding changes or organization updates.
1108,Groupon,Marketing,2019-04-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great work culture with lot of freedom and flexibility,Nothing that comes to mind
1109,Groupon,Overall Engaging and Fun Company,2019-04-26,5.0,Merchant Development Director,"-Excellent work life balance: work from home every other week, occasional Friday leave early, unlimited time off (most people take off 25-35 days per year), not expected to bring work home.
-High pay: If you hit your numbers and take advantage of the additional sales competitions/incentives/pilots, you could make upwards of six figures for the year. 
-People: Overall working with engaged, excited and driven people that come from unique backgrounds/experience. Regular team outings and easy to make lifelong friends at this company.
-Company does a good job of promoting healthy conversations with managers about career development/growth and always does engagement surveys and is constantly trying to improve (though if they are actually improving can sometimes be questionable).
-Company does care about their employees: fun activities around the office such as Tiffany Haddish visiting for Groupon's 10 year, summer/holiday parties, Groupon Week, promoting volunteer days, catered lunches, etc. 
-In general a cool brand/product to work for, very well known if moving to a new position outside of Groupon where most are familiar with the name.","-Like any sales position, a lot of communication can be very unclear and misleading where they bounce from project to project and quickly give up on ones they start. 
-Favoritism across reps - many managers will pick their favorite reps and help them get promoted quickly but not help others. If you are well liked, it is easy to succeed, and if you are not well liked, you might be lightly pushed out the door. Many Sales Managers can be pretty cliquey and talk about sales reps behind their backs to other members on their team or in the department which doesn't always promote a healthy culture.  
-Questionable integrity: Multiple issues with sales reps not getting paid the correct amount and no upper management catching it. Sales reps will sometimes have to go the extra mile to itemize everything they should be getting paid for which seems unsettling. Most do not trust the commission tracking but there's no clear way of knowing if you are paid correct or not. 
-Cross department communication issues - like any large company can be frustrating to work with other departments who have different priorities/deadlines, but more frustrating when in sales and a lot of your paycheck can rely on other departments."

1124,Groupon,Fast-paced international career,2019-04-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- the Poland locations are ever-growing (currently +1100 employees) so there are lots of internal recruitment opportunities (typically you can apply after you've worked 6 months within your current job), most of them internationally focused (online marketing, project support, etc.),

- strong volunteering program - you get additional 2 days off to use on whichever local volunteering initiative you choose ad there's dozens you could participate in throughout the year,
- no dresscode, nobody cares if you have dozens of tattoos, piercings or rainbow colored hair!","- extremely fast-paced companies, structures change very often and so do your direct supervisors so if you don't like change, this might not be the company for you,
- it's still a relatively young company (10 years old) so at this stage struggles with both startup AND corporate process issues simultaenously: on one hand there are still many things that don't have a process we could follow, on the other hand, some things are already designed into a process and are hard to change, while the company keeps growing"

1164,Groupon,Welcomes to Groupon where titles are made up and responsibilities don’t make you more money.,2019-02-21,2.0,Account Manager,Manager recognizes real hard workers and rewards them accordingly. Training is tight and works to keep people on trends and being able to offer a great product and platform.,The experience that I outlined in the pros is not available for everyone at Groupon and managers are forced to hold members back to keep their departments afloat. The employee experience that Groupon advertises as a great work environment is only available if you are at the top.
1165,Groupon,Groupon Getaways is failing,2019-02-21,1.0,Strategic Account Executive,Flexible time off policy (Sometimes).,"There aren't enough words that I can put here that will show how serious I am about the failings of Groupon Getaways. If you are thinking of applying, I am begging you to reconsider. There are other sales jobs in Chicago that will make you much happier. 

Firstly, we have had 9 people leave the floor in the last two months, including top leadership. Look at the public earnings reports and you can clearly correlate the two. People are no longer making anywhere what they used to, and the response from the team is to pivot the division to make us like an OTA (Online Travel Agent). We now have thousands of deals up on the site at once, with customer growth slowing (Another data point that can be found in the earnings reports). You can clearly understand why that doesnt make sense with a basic understanding of Supply/Demand economics. As a result, Commission payouts have slowed greatly, and your base is all you can rely on being paid out to you. 

The division has prioritized the needs of the business before its employees, and it shows. Actionable feedback from us hasn't been valued, and the steady decline of this division is now in a freefall. 

It's sad to see it. I've been on the floor for years. This place used to be a great way to grow and learn from. The decisions of leadership have ruined whatever promise we had left. 

Do not apply to Groupon Getaways."

People are very approachable here and willing to lend a hand. This does extend to leadership (executives, whilst extraordinarily busy, are very friendly).

There is a good work/life balance at the company too. You are expected to enjoy your leisure time and not respond to emails at all hours of the evening and weekend - though that is entirely up to you and could depend on who you might be reporting to, I guess. Groupon likes holding socials and team events and strongly encourages staff to have fun together outside the office.

Lastly, the company is very open to internal mobility and encourages you to consider Groupon for future career progression. I myself have met several people who have transferred, switched departments and have undertaken roles quite different to their initial role.","This may be common for any big organisation, but I feel there are quite large issues relating to inter-departmental, or even departmental communication. You often hear conflicting things from different individuals, which can make processes quite arduous and time-consuming, as a lot of people will have a hand in one matter.

I can't get into detail but the choices being made do not make me think that Groupon is investing money and talent into the right places.

The unusual bits of culture within the company. ""Inclusion"" groups and the like, to me, are extremely weird and creepy. None of it has been mandatory, but it's never the less extremely odd to me.

Sensitivity to terminology could not be more understated. Be cautious if you have an advanced vocabulary. People here have the propensity to Google words and take the first definition without context and react with vigor. Personally I find this behavior pretentious, but it is the way of the younger crowds. Speak carefully with small words.

-The site is littered with sub par businesses that clutter the experience for the subscribers and make it difficult for individual deals to stand out and be purchased (directly affects the compensation of sales reps)
--Priority is put on quantity of deals closed versus quality of deals. Directly impacts the subscriber experience, which in turn affects the company's performance and sales rep compensation
-New sales reps hired into the company are as green as they come and burn leads, sometimes very good ones due to the poor lead management system. 
-Sales managers are mediocre at best. Basically sit at desk and mouse click to approve deals and sit in meetings quite a bit. 
-Base salary was lower than most other companies (starting base salary is about $35k)

—Team culture. Direct teammates are supportive and generous with their time and expertise. Your coworkers are the reason you stay for so long. 
—Big company benefits. Generous parental leave, unlimited vacation, recently started a 401k match program, nice facilities/generally up-to-date technology.","—Lack of experienced management. This caused a lack of development and mentorship opportunities, and led to a lot of situations where friends managed friends and wouldn't effectively performance manage them when needed. People are held to different standards.
—No strategic leadership.  The strategy changes every quarter, and your goals are a constant moving target. It creates a lot of redundancies and wasted effort, not to mention makes it hard to speak to your own accomplishments during performance reviews.
—Not all teams are created equal. Product and Engineering receive yearly individual learning & development stipends while other teams fight tooth & nail for funds to offer lesser opportunities. This creates a class system among employees that absolutely affects team dynamics. 
—Too big to be effectively agile. Even minor shifts in strategy create ripples felt for months afterwards."

Too many hurdles to jump to get any new ideas across, we are asked to contribute ideas but in reality the levels of mid management and red tape don't really allow this to happen.

If you are hip and speak from idiocy then you will survive. Try to find one person who is genuine. You may be able to do so with one hand. The leaders don't work from the office. They fly all over town and sometimes the world. They do not spend 5 min in a team meeting encouraging their staff. But they do well behind closed doors and apparently ""working from home"".

The lack of genuine direction and growth is clear to see, round and round they go, is it a marketplace or is it an aggressive deals site or is it just something that was cool and relevant in 2011 (FAD)?

The failure to attempt to connect with the youth (20 to 35) in general (and especially the wealthier bracket within that) and focus on 'mums?'really makes it much more of a company of the past than it needs to be, someone please explain to the 'genius' marketeers expendable wealth/disposable income.

-Extremely aggressive management - scaremongering is the only tactic used 
no support/no training/just sit there and work it out yourself. Also a real blame culture everyone seems scared/hates their job and is just trying to keep their heads down

1. In MD, you start as an MD rep and you can get promoted to higher positions. The issue is that there is not many opportunities available to get promoted within a single year. As a result, the department experiences high turnover at the ""rep"" level. Interviews can only happen once every 6 months or so and while up to 5 or 6 reps can be qualified to interview, there is usually only 2 or 3 spots available. So for most reps, it does not make sense to stay committed to the MD department, since they cannot be guaranteed to experience consistent growth in their careers. 

2. Groupon is a data driven company. However in MD, it seems that leadership does not understand the context behind the sales data that they are working with. This results in reps being goaled on accounts that are either ""out of business"" or are just too small to handle the number of customers that are required to hit their specific revenue target.

In addition, management looks at the number of accounts that leave Groupon within your book of business and uses that to determine your overall performance. Churn is a standard way to determine how well an account manager is doing in their job. However, since we do not offer a membership and allow merchants to leave at any time, then reps have no way of being able to control this metric and are put at a disadvantage when compared to other reps who might not have had as many requests from their clients to leave the site. At the end of the day, this sets you up for failure. 

3. Another reason for high turnover has to do with the non-competitive pay and commission structure that's offered to MD reps. Many reps cannot justify waiting 1-2 years for a small promotion when they can find easily find another company in Chicago and make a lateral move and still end up making at least 10k more a year.

4. Finally, this is something that bothers me personally but there is no reason for managers trying to control exactly when reps come into work and leave work. If an employee is consistently coming in 15 minutes late to work or always leaves early then that should be addressed with the employee. However, if someone is 10 minutes late or needs to leave at 4:50 pm then it is unreasonable to expect them to make up for the 10 minutes on another day. We're all adults here. We understand that punctuality is important but life happens and this job does not justify us being treating like we're in high school."

I started as a Fact Checker, which meant I went through the copy in the daily emails and made sure everything matched was accurate. Over time this evolved into a position called Deal Qualifier, which basically meant I had to hassle Sales Reps about all their shady tactics they tried to pull or forms they'd forgotten to fill out. It was dull, repetitive, soulless work and I showed it in my work. 

Eventually I landed in a different job at Groupon that was less stultifying, but that was only after going part-time so I could be happier as an underpaid adjunct college instructor. I literally gave up my healthcare benefits and let my pay fall dramatically so that I didn't come home stressed at how much of my life was wasting away. But Groupon then forced my out of that job because their middle management was obsessed with making changes so that it was clear they'd done something. At least I avoided the mass layoffs that hit many of my friends last year, I guess.

Groupon has a terrible reputation but no one in management seems to realize this or care. They know that businesses will eventually be desperate or naive enough to give them money.

Many common practices here feel unethical, and some are actually fineable  regulatory offenses. Compensation continually decreases. Autonomy is disappearing. 

The ""Local"" division I was apart of is the heart of this business, and as someone who brings in the company's revenue flow from the front lines, I can tell you that turnover will remain high and most likely we will continue to see downsizing due to a lack of clients and a horrible reputation in the industry that has become too large to overcome at this point.

1495,Groupon,Inexperienced Senior Management,2017-12-14,2.0,Senior Business Development Manager,"Having worked at the Groupon Sydney HQ for a few years, I had the chance to see it all. What I've included here is from my personal experience and observations.

There's a high staff turnover, so promotional opportunities were offered to me the longer I stayed.

Sales cycle is relatively fast, at least compared to other companies I've worked at. If you're doing well, you can earn decent pay.

Has a bit of a start-up feel, it's a very fun and vibrant office culture, or at least it used to be in the earlier days. A lot of millennials working here.

People are very friendly. Many of my colleagues also became long-lasting friends outside of work. It's likely you will experience the same.

Work-life balance was good.","The promotions I received gave me a new job title and a modest pay rise, but I really felt like I was just doing the same thing. I didn't experience ""real"" career growth and my manager didn't make much of an attempt to help me learn new skills.

I found that most of the sales directors didn't offer quality leadership. At quarterly meetings, I'd listen to presentations about ""more sales activity = more deals = more revenue"". When you've been in the company long enough, this sounds a lot like a broken record.

I received regular one-on-one, as well as team, meetings with my manager. Most of these were to ""tick boxes"" rather than develop new strategies on where to play and how to win. From what I observed, very little effort was made by managers to help new sales reps get better after the initial induction. It's a bit of a sink or swim environment and I felt bad for sales reps who had a lot of potential but were not given the chance to be properly nurtured."

Neither of my managers had any idea. It must have come from above. When I asked HR in my Exit Interview, "" Why am I being let go? How do I explain this to future employers?""

Staff is leaving left, right and centre and they aren’t hiring. That means resources are short and satff who stay are getting all there work and they then leave because of this as well. 
Global top management knows this, acknowledges this and do nothing, I have asked top leaders (VPs, SVPs) this question twice in a year and they are cold but frank. 
International (non-US) management is running like headless chicken trying to find a magic solution to prop the business up and in the process bullying people below them as top management has no clue what to do to prop non-US business.
Stay away if the role is to support non-US business.
That said I am working here for 2+ years and year-1 was great and year-2 is a disaster, and gets worse every day. Management do not encourage people to even think about growing in the org after a while and HR gets upset when you apply for internal position as they have to backfill you. 
Mgt. say they dont want you to work weekend and evenings but keep on giving you more, as people leave and it never ends even after a year after people leave. They do say though they are not happy that you don’t want to take on more work but if confronted that you already are working most weekends and evenings, clarifies that they have no budget to backfill.

It's hard to please both customers and business partners (and that's  what the Groupon business model is about), and Groupon surely sucks at it. The internal systems are bugged and not reliable. They generally save on engineering ( declaring your work time via Google docs, it's a jock in such a big company). The company lacks professional process-creators, many back-office processes are  like a sieve and it's the customers that feel it at the end (check trust pilot).  Employee retention is low, so there are new 'managers' and 'leaders' much too frequently. Usually, the leads are non-experienced so they learn management on their current teams which is visible and only deepens the chaos. Due to low employee retention and constant changes it's hard to build a solid and good performing team. Additionally, the salary is below average, especially for people speaking 3 languages fluently (and the knowledge is required to perform your daily tasks). The management tries to look cool, they organise events and try to bring some fun to the workplace, but when it comes to professional discussions you can clearly see that this is just a big corporation with start-up communication chaos. Also, outsourcing to Sitel and using cheap workforce in India makes the whole work much more harder."

Below is just on my experience working with their data. 

If you work in data don't work here unless you have no other options. Their tech stack is 7 years old and is a complete mess. There is no organization among their tables, incredibly hard to understand their table structures and get basic pieces of info.  You should not need to do 5-7 joins to get answers to basic order questions. If you have any questions about the data(integrity)  or need to understand their ETL process  you have to work with their EDW team, who is a complete disaster and has no organization. They use tableau which is a fine tool to pretty much just display excel sheets, a complete waste of an excellent product. 

Weekly fire drills from management completely disrupting the work flow of other issues they have requested.  Once complete there are questions on why other projects have not been completed.  Little understanding on the difficulty of some of their requests. Few actual analysts among the managers who manage the analytical teams, so there is little understanding of how work gets done in this field."

I've never seen this before at a previous employer, and it's really cool to have this kind of visibility to the senior leadership team, hear about how our work impacts the business, and check in on where we stand with company goals. This transparency is really important! 

It's easy to get used to this aspect of the work environment as an employee/no longer find it exciting once you've worked there a while, but the office space is very unique (visually fun, open layout) and the dress code (or lack there of) is very liberating.  I feel as though people truly come to work as themselves and are more inclined to collaborate in this environment - that doesn't get old. It's really freeing (still after 1 year) to get to wear whatever to work every day + come into an office that's laid back, where  people are working hard, and it's a fun environment. 

I also enjoy how the company empowers you to take ownership of your work. If you are self-motivated and driven, your opportunities are endless at Groupon. 

A team I work closely with is the sales team. They've got a top notch 12 week training program that a lot of other companies don't offer. They do a ton of promoting from within, and it's inspiring to see the impact our sales reps can make on local businesses.","Groupon offers a strong benefits package, but currently there is no 401k match.

Commissions were huge, impressive bonuses for launching products on time, and the culture was unlike anything I have experienced. I was fortunate to have some really great managers who were not only fun, but did look out for me and listened when I had concerns or was interested in other opportunities. 
Have been able to grow in the company and jump into new roles and new departments over the past 6 years. It is definitely true you get out of it what you put in. There are definitely people to mentor you and support the path you are looking to take. 
I love the unlimited time off policy. I have made some of my best friends working here. I know what is expected of me day-to-day and how to deliver.
The parties, activities, lunch and learns, and organizations makes this a place I am still happy to be working at and keep it fun and interesting!","I have been waiting 6 years for a 401K! It makes me feel unvalued as an employee and would probably be the reason Groupon could not be my whole career as I need to also think about my future.

I like the location of the office and that it was not in the heart of downtown.  They also let me work remotely while I got settled in Los Angeles.",There is a lot of layoff right now so it creates the sense that there is a bit of instability.  It's a company that has grown really fast so people right out of college have had the chance to get promoted quickly... that being said you have a lot of middle management that are not equipped to manage effectively and are not interested in staying in the position they are in.

While I was there, they changed the metrics for certain group one day, and fired a ton of people who hadn't met the new metrics that month.

Luckily he has since left the company. Some of the people I worked with here were very conniving and threw their teams under the bus in order to score a few points from management. Groupon tried to bill itself as ""the next Amazon"" but did not have the engineering talent or management structure to support that claim. Instead, you got a lot of horrible leaders who were only in their position because they happened to be there when Groupon was growing. As a result, GRPN (at least in engineering) was a revolving door. I saw several people start with enthusiasm only to leave after a month.

Now that the company is older and clearly is not the next Amazon, you would expect that they would change their management style and try to retain engineers, but from what I have heard they are actually doubling down on the aggressive ""bro"" culture and shipping jobs to India or Ireland."

-I can't speak for all the management there, but my manager was excellent and very supportive.","Where to begin? Here we go...

-Complete and total lack of transparency from upper management
-Constantly changing the commission plan to such a point that it was hard if not impossible to figure out what we'd be making
-Product nearly impossible to sell. Cold calling into small businesses. Groupon brand is tainted so getting foot in the door very hard.
-Even if you CLOSE a deal the next part was getting the deal on the website which could take weeks and sometimes fall through completely. 
-We only would make commission based on how the deal performed online which is incredibly hard to predict.  Sometimes a deal that was supposed to be amazing would bomb and next thing you know, for reasons out of your control, you've made no money AND you've gone on performance management.
-About a year ago they took all the sales people and split them up into teams (or ""verticals"") that sell into particular industries. Health and Beauty, Things to Do, and Food and Drink. You had no say in where you went and it is widely known that Health/Beauty and Things to Do are much EASIER to sell than the poor saps who have to cold call into restaurants.
-Anyone who wasn't on Food and Drink was making money hand over fist, closing bigger deals, and overall happier in comparison to the graveyard that is Food and Drink. Agents there drop like flies. It's a dismal place and being put on Food and Drink is essentially a knife in the back. 
-Management here values the wrong thing when making promotions. When promoting reps to management they care more about their numbers than actual leadership qualities which means that we end up with reps-turned-managers who have no clue how to actually lead a team."

Lots and lots  of politics . They will throw you out saying the name of company policy without having any fault of yours. 
The team  in which I was placed  , the team members of that team never ever explained me anything properly .One of them was extreme rude to me. He had said many things to me many times which I can not write here.I tolerated all this because I needed that job very badly. I even informed manager once about all this but he did not agree. 

One day I caught few of my own  team members making fun of me, I emailed manager copying HR head in cc thinking that HR would take action against those employees.But I was wrong.
The employees  who were making fun of me , they were not even touched.Not a single word is told to them and everything was put on my performance and I was fired giving the name of company policy. I was the one who should have got benefit of doubt instead I was fired saying that I did not perform.

I gave HR many options like my probation period can be extended to six months,then they can see if there is any problem with performance or the matter is something else . I also gave the option of changing my team, because my own team members were completely against me. Both of the options were complete feasible.
HR and one of my team member had already in their mind that they will not allow me to continue in that company.

I was asked to sign on my own resignation paper  in the name of co-operation. I thought as per company policy , I would get at least 45 working days , so that I can search another job in those 45 working days.But they told  instead of that we will pay you that money.

Some middle managers actually care and advocate for the employees on their teams, and employees are for the most part genuinely nice and motivated.","Upper management in Editorial (copy) likes to make organizational changes that alter employees' titles, responsibilities, or both (this has happened twice in the past year and a half). This wouldn't be such a big problem, except many editors in the department have been there for years, working toward opportunities to grow and diversify their skill set. Changing up the department structure and taking away opportunities that people have worked toward is, admittedly, not as bad as laying people off, but it does throw a wrench in people's career plans, and sometimes even has the distinct flavor of a de facto demotion.

What's more concerning than all of this is the fact that, weeks after the most recent organizational changes, upper management has still not held a meeting with the department to address these changes or a plan going forward, which makes it seem like they either plan to lay people off or just want employees to quit. For the most part, employee motivation and happiness seem to be at rock bottom, and you can feel it in the air.

I assume that, going forward, Editorial won't be promising potential employees opportunities to advance in a writing career, and that it will continue to put greater focus on streamlining processes and optimizing efficiency. If that doesn't interest you and you're considering a job at Groupon, I'd suggest you continue your search for a job elsewhere."

1877,Groupon,Forgotten Satellite office,2016-12-08,1.0,Software Engineer,"Nice building with a great view.
Friendly co-workers.","If you're not at the core, you'll be forgotten. That's what's happened to Seattle. Palo Alto is the engineering core and Chicago is the business core. The company is pretty immature in many ways and communication is definitely one of them so if you're in a satellite office, you won't get all the information that you need to do your job and you'll be forgotten when it comes to a lot of opportunities. That ends up seriously limiting engineers's career growth. You'll be better off at many many other companies within Seattle.

The only outlier is the marketing team that's in Seattle, but they managed to not be forgotten by making *everything* a fire that is urgent. Palo Alto hates Seattle because of it and will sometimes follow up on requests because they know ""the people in Seattle are experts at making noise"". Which reinforced a bad cycle, because the marketing team then knows that works and continues that. The other engineering teams in Seattle get labeled with that reputation even though they're very separated from the marketing side. If for some strange reason you really want to work for Groupon, best move to Palo Alto.

Cost cutting measures are a bit ridiculous. Penny-wise, pound-foolish.

In the last couple years, let me list out all the HR problems that have been big enough that a mass e-mail had to be sent to the whole office:
1) all the men had to be asked to attend a meeting where the SVP had to ask them to stop urinating on the ground in the rest rooms
2) employees were asked not to expose themselves to the facility staff
3) people had to be told to stop spitting and  blowing their nose into the kitchen sink because it's not hygienic"
1878,Groupon,Not a place for engineers,2016-12-08,1.0,Senior Software Developer,"Good work-life balance. A large portion of the company is probably only in the office 50% of the time (and less of that time actually working).
A very small pocket of solid engineers (though shrinking because they're jumping ship)
If you negotiated hard of your salary, it could be pretty high (we're desperate to hire) though you'll be making a LOT more than the people at your level that got promoted into that level or didn't negotiate as hard.","Software Engineering is valued the least at this company. If you rank roles, it's sales people -> business people -> product people, then last comes software engineers.
Terrible decisions made by the sales and business people cause a lot of trouble for engineers. Mostly because those people are really weak decision makers. Very poorly planned too. Product managers are often giving really weak and ill defined product requirements (engineers aren't allowed to define the product, engineers are relegated to just doing what they're told). Often the product managers aren't even thinking through their decisions and when engineers ask for clarifying questions, it's clear that the product managers didn't really think things through. Sometimes their responses is to just yell at the engineers. Product managers also throw engineers under the bus a lot of mistakes they make (product change requirements that result in a delay of delivery). Or they don't think through the end to end and forget to include a business team and then the whole project gets killed.

Mission focus isn't clear as well. There's a big push for the goods business but the mission of the company is supposed to be about connecting people with local merchants. They're just doing it because there's money to be made. That's kind of the only driving factor at this company, making money. No one cares about making a long-term sustainable business or a good user experience unless they can make money off it. Not saying this is a bad goal, but this is basically the only goal.

Company is very junior in experience, even folks in very senior leadership positions aren't very experienced and thus make a lot of bad decisions. Most people get to those levels because loyalty is promoted (or maybe it's out of desperation because they can't find anyone else)."

The culture was laid back and cordial, and I almost never had a problem taking time off or pursuing my passions outside of Groupon, as the department wants you to have a life outside of there.","As Groupon worked to rediscover itself in the post-Andrew Mason years, it began to value voice and creativity in editorial less and less. The thing is, I absolutely get this and think it's probably the right move considering where the company is going. Groupon started as a company chock full of personality, but if it wants to make money and maintain itself as a leader in e-commerce, it needs to value business over editorial creativity. My problem is that some of the employees brought in in the latter days lack pretty basic copywriting skills, and the quality of the copy has become wildly inconsistent. As someone who very much values quality content, this concerns me and sorta bums me out. 

Also, to echo some of the other comments here, management is lacking. Lots of promises and minimal follow-through. What the company needs is innovators in its ranks. They're there, but management doesn't listen to them enough."

Groupon doesn't have a 1 year plan or even so much as a 2 month plan and decisions are abrupt and political. This is not an environment for people who seek stability, fairness or faith in leadership. This is a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants company where expectations change on a daily basis and people are required to adapt without question. There are so many intelligent employees whose ideas could strengthen the foundation and create stability, but ultimately, this is not valued and the people have very little power."

From my first year there to my last, I saw big strides in Groupon's attempts to not only create a fun atmosphere, but to provide people with lots of growth and development opportunities.","The pay was truly terrible, as was the process of salary negotations when moving to a different position within the company. Recruiters/Hiring Managers would even lie about company policy around pay bumps when moving between roles. KPIs for different roles on the sales teams would experience wild swings throughout the year, with compensation/bonuses being tied directly to these scores.

They have hired almost 100 new inside sales reps from June- October of 2016 because thats how many people are quitting/ being fired from this job. They don't tell you this in the interview but after your 12 week training period they can fire you if they want. Over-all, I wish I wouldn't have invested my time at Groupon- they really see sales reps as a number and you won't be evaluated qualitatively rather you are a just a number."
1935,Groupon,Sales,2016-10-14,3.0,,"Working at Groupon for over 3 years I can honestly say it was a roller coaster. However, that is expected at one of the fastest growing companies in the world. There were tons of pros, including the PEOPLE, the benefits, the unlimited PTO, the flexibility that the company had was tremendous and I know I won't find it any where else I go. Like any sales role, the harder you work the more money you make. The majority of the top sales reps are the ones that work the hardest, plain and simple. There is a ton of money to be made if you're hard working, dedicated, and know how to work the system. It's a great product, so it's not as hard as people think it is to sell especially with the phenomenal training program they provide for the sales reps. It completely prepares you for the sales floor.","Like any public company that grew way too fast, there are plenty of kinks in the system that I could talk about however the one that sticks out the most is the favoritism. Every team/manager operates differently and many things are based on manager discretion when it should just be simple-a company policy.  They are willing to bend the rules for some and not others and that brings moral down across the board. It's frustrating to watch it happen and I'm sure it's frustrating for managers to not be able to have more say in certain processes. I saw this improving prior to leaving, but they have a long way to go. They lose way too many great employees because of this which in the end costs them a lot of money because of the high financial investment it takes to onboard 1 sales rep."

The product is great, and many commented on how they tried something they never thought they would ever try thanks to a Groupon deal. The CSRs bust their butts to try and make things right, but management will tell you not to call a customer to follow up because ""we are any inbound call center."" There is no outbound call center and you get looked down on for following up. 
Was a nice view of the river out the back of the building while on 30 min lunch (not long enough for downtown Chicago)","Disability company was an absolute nightmare to deal with. Months to get paid and asking for way more info than needed. If you want paid, HIPPA is ignored. Metrics keep changing to almost impossible goals. Calls are ""graciously being handled by partners in the Philippines"" when in reality they are going to migrate to full customer service outsourcing. Were told the morning of the day that later hours were being added to open call hours, but not to worry as our schedules weren't going to be impacted. The Philippines call center takes the later calls, then mishandles them horribly. Emails are outsourced to India, except when a system issue causes any overload, which gives the US based reps the ability to handle some of them. All online chat is from Philippines. Very bad language barriers happen constantly but management only cares about hitting their numbers for their bonuses, come hell or high water. You'll only move up if you have super high call numbers & productivity, yet you can't give good service if you're blowing thru calls and tossing issues of onto others. Watched the company focus severely change with new CEO and was stated that they were going to look at cost effectiveness with lower wage paying areas being targeted for work at home jobs. Most of the Chicago reps who started in office now work are home and the size of HQ has gone from two full buildings to one partial building."

2012,Groupon,Downhill,2016-08-24,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Free caltrain pass,
Free lunch in SF and PA","The biggest cons is the culture of the company. And the fact that its not a tech company. 
Very very poor engineering culture. One of the best example i can think of is the way company provisions VMs. There is this internal software used for people to setup VMs. It was implemented by using git as a storage (??!??). So for an even small change for any team in the company, for any VM in any environment there is this centralized git repository used as a storage. In Order to make a change you have to, in the end, commit there. So can you imagine when all those hundreds of developers needing to make even the smallest change on any of the VMs start working, it is literally impossible to commit. It sometimes takes hours, because in between you pulling, and rebasing and pushing there has been multiple commits. If you do it at 3 o clock in the night when nobody is around its smooth. The fact that the company that has been around for so long didn't figure out a better way to do this tells a story. And what is worse nobody sees this as a problem worth solving. Why? Because in their mind in doesn't bring money (they only see direct money, revenue lift in that quarter).
Its very product driver, and marketing driven. Hacks are preferred to stable solutions if they are quicker to implement. The credo is: ""Yes we are aware it is wrong, but do it anyway because its faster to market that way"".
There is barely any recognition for infrastructure work. No, if your code change, or your app doesn't make money, its useless. The people will be moved to something else. The super interesting thing is there is this belief system that software written like that, in SOA architecture can be left to run staff-less. For intsance a bunch of interns write a software that does something. It shows some initial promise (money-wise), so they invest a bit more time, if it cannot be made to make more money the management will move the people back in the 'pool' to wait for another task. While the software written by people that didn't really know what they were doing will be left there to run. Even more interesting, the whole project like that (shady software, no people) will be lumped over to some other team.
So in meetings you will often have multiple managers introducing them selves as ""I am such and such, i am a manager of this app, this other app, this third app, this fourth app and other things"", and that to be even more interesting everyone in the meeting will have similar bunch of applications on their plate, without any people to work on them.
Just the burden of having all these apps, that you don't care about, and don't own be on your pager duty is mind blowing.
The amount of pages you can get sometimes at night is amazing. But when you offer the management to fix it, they tell you that they are not a priority right now. Sure they are not you don't get awaken at night for it.
Recently it has gotten significantly worse. While the wall street sees this as positive movement (cost reduction) The upper management has decided that the headcount is not given to almost anyone anymore. People won't be replaced. There are literally whole teams that are leaving. Great talent too. Some people leave to google, some to other big companies, management rarely even talks to them why are they leaving.

I cannot even begin to imagine what kind of strategy could that be. Let the talent leave, the software will take care of its self, if not lump it on some poor team with overly ambitious manager.
My team for example lost two people last December both very senior. They didn't get replaced. And as we were crying that we are understaffed, the management decided to not only not give us replacements, they decided to give us two apps that were written by two teams that were staffed with 10 people combined.

So you loose two, you get new software worth for 10.
Its literally unbearable.

""Do more with less"" taken to the extreme. I am also leaving now. After four years. I got to admit I learned a lot in the process, about how big companies work, i learned a lot as an engineer too. I got to live in two beautiful countries thanks to Groupon. But what is enough is enough.

I would seriously not recommend work for Groupon to anyone who is an engineer right now. Wait a little bit, either find something else, or wait 6 months and check again, maybe things have changed. Its literally super toxic now. 
But once it gets this downhill I really don't believe it will recover.

Even if you are just starting its better to go somewhere else and learn proper engineering from the get go.
If you by any chance interviewing at Groupon and you get to ask the questions ask them what kind of tool is used for provisioning VMs, ask them about the storage. If it is still what I describe stop the interview, and go somewhere else"

If you truly enjoy sales, you will move up quickly. Take note: You better hustle, and always be at the top.

Heck of a work/life balance--maybe too much.","The best way to explain it: freshman year (representative), sophomore year (manager of reps, trainer of new hires, or a sales person who makes far more doing the same thing), junior year (a sales person who makes three times what the freshmen are making doing the same thing), Senior year (sales director of some sort). 

Competitive work environment can be daunting but if you have thick skin and you're void of compassion then you're all good.

Salaries are completely all over the place, you may be doing the same job as someone else who is making twice the amount you are- even with the same experience.  HR and upper management don't care what you think, feel or say, and will never take any of it seriously.  When I left the company HR didn't ""have time"" to do an exit interview and told me they'd send me a SURVEY to fill out- which they never did, however I wasn't shocked by this nor cared because anything you say won't matter to anyone in the company.

You can control how much work you put in but you can't control how your deals will sell no matter how hard you try. Every quarter something new comes out to steal more money from merchants, because screwing over reps didn't earn the company enough money.

2116,Groupon,Cargo Cult Engineering,2016-05-15,1.0,Software Development Engineer,"I worked at Groupon for about a year as a software engineer. My role was in a new team and I relocated to Ireland to become one of the first members. We built products that were internally facing, aiming to improve processes within the business and some other components that were externally facing (affecting the global user-base). Here are some of my experiences.

- The office setup is very nice, they provide free drinks and snacks and a free lunch once-a-week which also involves an informal meeting / presentation of some topical issues. They have a nice terrace area (with wifi) which catches the sun and is protected from the wind. It can be pleasant to work or spend time there during the (short) Irish summer.","- So much re-invention of the wheel. There seems to be an active reluctance to use existing tried-and-tested tools and instead, hand-rolled, bespoke and (as a result) buggy solutions are preferred. Multiple duplicate solutions for existing problems can be found throughout the company.

- They use lot of Ruby; when other large-scale companies are turning away from this in favour of the JVM (mainly due to scaling issues), Groupon seem happy to keep going with Ruby. I've worked on Ruby projects before and I've never seen it written the way they use it at Groupon.

- There exist some ""colourful"" characters on the engineering teams. Some of these people have loud voices and strong opinions; as such these people have clout that they don't deserve. In reality they just produce noise or are overbearingly pedantic; the end result is not good engineering. There have been cases of work having to be completely re-written as a result of being over-engineered and poorly tested.

- The on-call process is a bit dysfunctional. One of the engineers in particular is an ""on-call hero"", happily spending out-of-hours time on what are often really trivial issues or over-sensitive triggers. SLAs for services are often arbitrarily decided without any advance performance testing. There is nothing heroic about being needlessly woken up at 3am.

- The interview process is *insane*. Groupon have ""bar-raisers"" (similar to Amazon) that can effectively veto the recruitment of a candidate, even if that candidate has received otherwise great feedback from other interviewers. Reasons for vetoing might be because the candidate cannot do (or does not know about) something that they would *never* be expected to do in the role. The amount of false-negatives must be very high. Also: ""colourful"" characters tend to select like-minded individuals, so the crazies-to-normals ratio is unusually high.

- QA is an afterthought. Where it exists, it is administered improperly and inefficiently; this is a combination of a company culture that does not understand or value QA, a lack of QA resources (many QA engineers have left) and the ""colourful"" characters of those that remain. 

- The hierarchy would describe the engineering teams as ""agile"", following ""best-practice"", employing ""micro-services"" and all the buzzwords. However, much like the pleasant facade of the office environment, from an engineering perspective, things aren't so pretty under the hood. It is a bit of a Cargo-cult: teams might have meetings standing up, but that doesn't make them Agile. Headless chickens can move quickly, too.

In the end I had to get out because I felt that my engineering abilities were diminishing as a result of working there. I hate being negative, but being honest overrides that."

Most of the engineering organizations hire for a broader engineering skills (DS, Algo, pgmg, problem solving, etc) and this is the only place where they hire for specific technologies (Ruby, java, postgre, etc). The current engineering leadership is good at sweet talks while hiring and making use of the resources but once they see there is no need of your skill sets they turn arrogant so that you quit your job. One of the worst recruiting team ever who gives all sorts of stories to trap you to join and later they involve in discussions sharing the bad behavior leadership to the employees after joining. 
The best of the engineers and leaders who have joined from premier ecommerce organizations have left now since there no good work in India and it keeps on changing.

While I do think it can be helpful to some people, most of the time I felt like a crook to businesses. Sales goals are pretty unattainable when you get upstairs and management either micro manages the hell out of you, or couldn't care less what you're doing. I had 4 managers in 6 months, and the one I felt I worked best with was only mine for two weeks before they flipped the whole company.

Pros: casual dress and environment, lots of autonomy, free coffee/tea/pop plus decent cafeteria on site, no formal vacation policy, very fun and young atmosphere.","A lot of pros can be seen as cons; casual environment sometimes equals unprofessional environment. No formal vacation policy can actually mean you're answering emails on vacation since you still have to hit all your usual monthly sales numbers.

Most of the people I know have left now since they were pushed out or stuck  in the same role with no progression in their careers. Sad use to be a great place to work. It is what you make it though, good straight out of college stepping off point. Some great people still work there but you have to make the culture the company just wants to fill seats.",They don't care about their employees unless you're an engineer or higher up. The unlimited PTO is monitored heavy and you can't even be sick twice in a week or three times in a quarter without possibly getting written up. There is no career progression and they eventually push you out or you get stuck in a dead end career path. The once model for company culture has all but vanished. In the sales department you barely know the person that sits behind you. Most my friends and the good ones have gotten out and moved one and now it seems like more of a revolving door get them in and out so they don't have to keep paying people more. It's a giant call center now compared to a place where creative people worked and used their creativity in all different departments. Now it is a corporate call center.

So how it works is you have to clock in your hours ( 40 a week) only because they got in trouble for overworking reps. They still do, and look down on people who leave at 5pm. Everyone is drinking the kool aid at Groupon, and its scary. Hire around 15 people a month for GOB, oh and get this they tell people ""you are the best of the best"" HA! Most of my team was afraid of our manager, and the the person that sat next to me was afraid to quit because out of fear of the manager's reaction.  A guy on our team was  fired even after he met the 16 sales in 16 weeks on the last day of the deadline. Groupon does not care about its people, and everyone that works there knows it.

Management is typically on good terms with the rest of the team. Clear  and fair rules regarding  pay raises.  Employees are always given priority whenever a position opens up and everyone has a fair shot, regardless of their current standing in the company.  If one performs well and shows remarkable skill in an area outside of their  regular duties, their position might be reconsidered on an individual basis. Good benefit offering even for the sharp-end employees.",The office is either distracting open-space with no privacy on one floor and depersonalizing cubicle-laden crush of people on the other. The job terms and salary offered to the newcomers to the company  are near-humiliating and the clear-cut raise policies can be harsh if someone minimally falls short of their targets.

Management expects a lot and will feed you a lot of fluff about hitting top metrics to move upward in the organization. Ultimately, you'll move up and take on more and more responsibility and they'll avoid giving you any sort of actual promotion. Groupon leadership does not care about you-unless you're in engineering or on the tech side-you'll just barely make a livable wage. While Groupon is doing some cool things and has a massive customer base the brand is tired and there's a huge stigma that's tough to get past (as a sales rep/am). The majority of businesses hate us and/or think of Groupon as a necessary evil and have 0 respect for the value prop....you'll feel that resentment when you're on the phones. Employees are unhappy and the majority are bored and not challenged. Some people who got in early made good money so they stick around and do nothing except bring down morale and complain. Managers micro-manage and set ridiculous metrics and monitor talk time, activity, dials, etc. expect to be treated like a child."

2316,Groupon,"Once great, now much much less",2015-12-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great colleagues and easy commute. Also sometimes extra holidays over Christmas.,"Initially this seems like an amazing opportunity and it is without a doubt a great name to add to your CV especially if you're quite junior or fresh out of university etc. And in the beginning when I started it really was a workplace full of good vibrations (just like the Beach Boys song), energetic departments and an overall positive outlook. Now, don't get me wrong I am truly grateful to have had the chance at working for this company and I appreciate the things that I have learned from my managers and peers throughout my course there but sadly I must confess that it was an extraordinary relief when I resigned.

The good outlook as mentioned above was either a phase that seased to exist or it was merely myself that was new to the company and unable to see through the veil of joy covering the truth behind the atmosphere at work. There was a slow but steady increase in people leaving, not only from my department but others too and the number of empty chairs and cleared desks began to add to an increasingly gloomy atmosphere. 
I also began to realize that a lot of people were not as cheerful as I assumed and that they were unhappy with their salaries, working hours and the lack of appreciation for the hard work that they put in when working over time (which seemed to be every day for some). Some people even stayed late just to stay late - and yes, that makes no sense but let me elaborate: in some departments it was almost seen as a bad thing to leave on time or even close to it and even if the people had nothing to do they would sit for about 30-60mins late just to show that they sure as hell weren't going to leave - and for what?
I was astonished that there were people who actually felt bad for leaving on time and couldn't quite comprehend the situation properly but just went with the flow at the time. What worried me as well was the inaction from the managers and heads  that seemed to not care that their previously cheerful, energetic and joyful departments were much quieter and the ""buzz"" was all but gone. Slowly but surely the passion was filtered out amongst the negative changes mentioned above and for me it was time to move on.

Hopefully the company will begin to listen to their employees and strive towards stimulating that passion and motivation that used to exist in a bright and dedicated working environment. Should they choose to continue on the path that they were on when I left then I highly doubt anything positive will come from it."

The only bright side really was the unlimited paid time off and the work life balance was pretty good, however that really depended on which department you were in. I was pushed out of the company because my work was interfering with my mental and physical health (I have an incurable neurological disorder). I was forced onto an unpaid leave (either that or quit were the options given to me) to which I am still fighting to get the money owed to me from short term disability (it's been since July). I had to move out of my apartment and I am still struggling to keep afloat financially. They really don't care about the employees so be prepared if you're trying to get a job there."

Good interdepartmental camaraderie for the most part
Exposure to lots of issues (believe me, there are a lot) makes for heightened problem solving skills","All the great things we created are slowly being stripped away, as a brand it is losing its identity in favour of austerity. The amount of job losses/cuts recently has been utterly ridiculous, don't get me wrong, I understand the business decision behind lowering the operating margin, but the way it has been handled over the last 3 years has been atrocious. Terrible vision from the board leads to a very uninspiring local senior leadership team, mostly because they probably don't have a clear direction or plan to work towards, which trickles further down to the frontline staff who are deeply, deeply unhappy, I don't think I knew anyone that was genuinely enthused about their job when I left. The rot is so deep I worry if the company will recover.

The amount of resources available for development is utterly disgusting, being told by L&D that there was no help available whatsoever to coach young managers, for people that actually want to improve and make a difference in their job, it really did make me sick to my stomach. Not that it's the fault of the local L&D departments, they do a fantastic job with what they've got, but what they've got isn't much.

HR direction from the US has been a disaster with continually changing messaging month on month, year on year. I understand this is [was] a growing company, but that doesn't mean it should feel like a ship in a storm all the time. Terrible and non existent HR leadership, even at local level, has led to a culture of mistrust between the company and its employees. Nobody knows whats going to happen next which makes for very little engagement. Absolutely awful comms from HR from the very start of the company, examples of language completely out of sync with local/work culture, of rash and almost childlike attitudes, no unity in messaging from one person to the next. Add that to confusion in org and responsibilities means they have lost a lot of good people. Its only recently that they gained some GREAT people who are doing their best.

Not strong enough leadership through the sales team, no one has stepped up to sync sales and ops, which could be the key to making this company tick. It's obvious that the Sales team will promise the moon on a stick to our merchants for a contract signature, only to disappoint down the line when they don't get what they've been promised, diabolical expectation management. This maybe down to unrealistic targets, and probably due to poor training also, which I sympathise with, but this makes it all the more important that their leadership is strong, I fear it is somewhat of a boys club though. People go for being liked over being respected, which doesn't make for longevity."

The days are long, but as long has you put in the work and keep up your activity you should be fine. The sales training was awesome, but with that being said they expect you to make a high amount of sales in not that long of a period of time especially given the fact that a lot of the new hires have never sold before.","Everything except the sales department at Groupon needs a lot of help! Merchant support and the editorial team are pointless. The inside sales people are not only supposed to make the sale, but then are expected to follow through with the merchant to make sure it goes live on the site. It almost seems like merchant support and the editorial team do not care about there jobs at all! 

The higher ups at groupon need to really focus on improving the departments that handle a merchant after the sale has been made! (merchant support and Editorial Team). Both editorial and merchant support departments need more training on how to handle merchants. They are losing a lot of money for Groupon!!! This also puts much more stress on the sales reps because they not only have to worry about making the sales, but they have to worry about the sale going live on the site too because of the lack of training merchant support and the editorial team have."

2539,Groupon,G1 Sales rep,2015-06-02,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,There is a young crowd which is great for recent graduates transitioning into the corporate world.,"As of today June 2nd Groupon just split up the entire sales force into two divisions. The first division are sales reps who exclusively call on news business, and only receive commission on total gross profit for the first 30 days of a deals life(Groupon keeps 100% after the 30 days) Once the 30 days are up, no more commission. Granted these are Coupons, so these deals are not going to net a lot of Gross profit in only 30 days. The real profit comes when the deal stays live on the website and gains traction. Their pay is still $32,000. What is really interesting is what they did with the other half of sales reps who have invested just as much time as the other half into starting a sales career for themselves. Based on absolutely no previous performance or sales numbers, Groupon has pigeonholed these reps into account managers who do not have the opportunity to go after new merchants, receive an extremely low commission split and their main duty is to work on deals that were previously just closed by the other half of sales reps that I just explained. Why would a merchant want to work with another sales rep after they just closed a deal a few days ago? On June 1st Our SVP emailed the whole company with a short email stating that our department had to meet about drastic changes within the company. The next morning they told us about the split between the sales floor. The mood in the office today was depressing to say the least because everyone was killing themselves on a daily basis to hit extreme Daily, Monthly, and Quarterly goals only to have their entire books of business wiped clean and taken by Groupon so they can hit their projected numbers for their next Annual reports release. If you just graduated college and are struggling to find a job I understand if you apply to Groupon, because it’s a starting point. But realize there will be drastic changes every 6-8 months and they pay is extremely low. I'm assuming most of you can guess which of the two I was assigned too today."

(nobody buys Groupon Getaways anymore)
- they changed the commission structure in November 2014 so the reps would make less money and Groupon would make more money. all the reps complained, they didn't do anything about it, morale was very low and literally EVERYONE quit
- especially in Getaways, the only good accounts/hotels are already controlled by senior reps
- starwood, hilton, marriott, IHG, and choice hotels are not allowed to work with Groupon or else they get fined. so basically you're left with low quality independent hotels or bed & breakfasts ran by 45 year old moms who have no idea what they're doing
- there is absolutely no room for career growth or promotion opportunities. if you hit your target 6 months in a row you get a $2,500 raise and your title is changed to 'senior sales rep'. which is about the lamest excuse for a 'promotion' i've ever heard of (doesn't really matter though because the targets they set are absurdly out of reach and arbitrary)

I have never seen people treated so badly in my entire life. They are ruthless and cut throat, firing strong performing individual without warning because they want to bring in a friend they had previously worked with at another Company. In some cases people have been hired and started before the other person was let go which meant it was an absolutely humiliating experience for that individual.

Furthermore, it is a company that says it ""lives by its shared values"" but this could not be further from the truth. If you are considering joining because you like the sound of their values, run for the hill please.

This place used to be so good when the people who worked there were genuinely passionate about the business and brand. Now it is a bunch of people who want to make a name for themselves with a ""fun"" brand on their CV."

- Allowance for team outings and medical coverage.
- Long lunches","A) Work process
- Monotonous, little innovation, no input from the bottom line was heeded even though we were urged many times to take initiative  
- Dodgy deals given the green light (as revealed through simple Google searches), managers did not act on feedback 
- Diff departments are segregated and isolated in their work; little direct interaction with sales and clients hence a mis-match of expectations
- Ludicrous measures put in place to cope with the leak in manpower toward the end of 2014
 - Some sales managers override the process and push for their deals to be processed first (and scheduled for to be live the next day) despite little to no heads-up at all
B) Management
- Changed multiple times following the departure of the founding brothers
- Indecisive, decides things on a whim as if they can be done overnight
- Over ambitious with tragically little to no understanding of Groupon’s original principle
- Absolutely no transparency or understanding of change in processes pertaining to their subordinates; whichever team is affected would find out from other teams instead of their own managers
c) Culture
- High amount of tension as redundancy and restructuring is happening (as mentioned above)
- Interpersonal conflicts not handled in the best manner; individuals allowed to harass co-workers with little to no consequences on the grounds that they're getting their work done and can still get along with a number of co-workers not on the receiving end of their ill conduct.
- Feedback regarding said conflicts also not treated with anonymity; basically anyone who complained would have a target on their backs 
D) Career progression and termination
- People pushed to senior ranks but not given official letter of recognition, title change in system or pay revise till the next year in April. So if you get promoted in May, good luck to you.
- Acknowledgement of progression is not clear; promises given verbally and then retracted on the grounds of not being in writing, which is very unfair  
- Pay review resulted in A LOT of unhappiness and intra team tension.
- A lot of redundancy (due to restructuring) going on, affected teams are kept in the dark till the last minute and usually find out through other teams instead of HR or their managers. When it happens, it’s kept quiet even though the writing’s pretty much on the wall."

News flash. That's micromanaging. If you don't want to babysit don't hire students straight out of college. Or recognize those that have work experience and know how to plan their own days and those that need to be shown. The daily metrics and quarterly metrics are incredibly high and are nearly impossible to attain within their planned schedule and the accounts you are given. If you want new accounts worth calling on, you have to find them, but not during your 8 hour work day. ""Unlimited PTO"" they use as a selling point yet they fail to stress that it needs to be approved by your manager and with crazy amounts of notice. Calling in sick is better than actually doing the right thing and giving them any notice you have. They will deny you. There is no room for advancement. Especially if you start with Sales.

Has mistaken having no real road map with being ""agile"".
Tries to behave like a start-up when it's operationally larger than most companies.
No real road map for advancement, chances for advancement are extremely limited since positions are often created out of thin air and the staff is so young that no one moves except for horizontally from department to department.
Departments are wildly different in how they operate so one department might be great while another one might not be.
Work/life balance varies wildly from position to position, department to department.

The first few months on the job are easy.,"Horrible work life balance, average new employee works well over 40 hours a week. Occasionally there is mandatory overtime that is unpaid. Constant shifting of metrics and what matters for sales. Managers micro-manage to no end. A typical day looks like this:
1. Come in and answer emails.
2. Go to a morning meeting where your manager tells you that everyone is not doing enough.
3. Make 50-60 dials to businesses that hate Groupon (because Groupon calls them EVERY DAY until they say YES.)
4. Take a quick lunch
5. Mid-afternoon meeting where you are once again told your team is not doing well enough. This time with a completely pointless activity.
6. Make a million more calls.
7. Leave an hour late.

There is no 401k matching.

The biggest con I can list is how the workforce is split up. This company hires upwards of 50 salespeople a month. Because at least that many quit every single month. If you got into Groupon as a sales rep more than 1 year ago you can make money, everyone else cannot. 

Don't work here. It's pointless. It's not even a good reference to have on your resume any more because they hire literally anyone that can speak.

Oh yeah, the ""unlimited time off"" requires you to have ONE MONTH advance notice to take 1 day off. So good luck using that.

If you are a frat boy or sorority girl you will love it though. Also this place is going down. They have sullied their name so poorly that the bubble has already burst and they just try to make it look like they make money."

Change happens before it is announced. It is understandable that it needs to happen but without the buy-in and motivation of the employees, all change is pointless. The company seems to chase its own tail with that. 

Work-life balance got better in some departments but some teams just stay late for the sake of it. Managers should promote and lead with example by not staying past 7pm (or longer) every day.

They say they have an automated 'demand generation filter' on the list which is nonsense.  If a local business is not 'QL' approved, you can't work with them.  You're expected to sell 20 deals a month and the only way to do that is to recycle old deals from merchants you've worked with.  But the compensation for a refeatured offer is near next to nothing.

If you don't hit your call numbers, you will be fired, regardless of how much money you are bringing in.  The managers look terrible.  They are all in their mid 20's yet balding, overweight from all the stress, and drink almost every night.  They come in hungover and tell stories of how much they drank, and then they openly pop adderall and fuel up on caffeine to get through the day.  Hours are 8-6, and they will occasionally roll out 3 week stretches where you need to stay til 7.  They encourage coming in on Saturday rather then enjoying your free time.  PLEASE, do not but into the publicity videos and fake reviews they post.  A casual dress code does not make up for low pay and long hours.  The office is filled with distractions to keep your mind off of the pay/hours/goals.","Micro managed.  People try to get you passionate about selling coupons.  Worst of all, most businesses get absolutely screwed over.  There were businesses that we worked so hard to convince a partnership with, and some of them went out of business because of a huge customer flood and a terrible revenue split.  When this happened, management would simply say, 'Oh well whatever, it happens"".  Goals change weekly.  People constantly quit.  I had a team of 16 people and 15 people talked daily about quitting.  The only one that didn't had recently gotten married and had 2 kids to support so he was trapped."

-Fear based environment - fear of not hitting your ""number"", everyday, fear of repercussions for this and of course, fear of ultimately losing one's job (even for strong performers, which I was). This fear certainly harmed productivity.
-Product is very difficult to sell (hurts a lot of businesses - why they would ever do Groupon I don't know) and lack of flexibility from management for these constraints to work through challenging situations 
-Transactional sale more than long-term sell (always focused on short term)

Also the parties and work events. And the Vitamin water.","Management is young and inexperienced.

Training class was comprehensive.,"Poverty wages. Remote employees are part time with no benefits. Yet they want savvy, technical people with BAs. You can make more money with far less effort ANYWHERE else. Training class gave misleading information about customer advocacy. The fact is, Groupon attempts to avoid a refund at all costs, going so far as to take the money for an item direct from the customer's credit card; but if the customer wants a refund > 3 days later - they try to issue ""Groupon Bucks"" which is a fancy word for store credit ONLY usable on further Groupon purchases.

2784,Groupon,"If you want to feel helpless and disposable, get a job here.",2014-09-01,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"The atmosphere was alright and my colleagues were good. They encourage word-of-mouth recruitment. Good facilities, office is quite nice, although I got trapped in one of the elevators when it broke down once. Relaxed and laid-back. Our team leader and manager at the time of my employment were great. Both my team leader and our manager left shortly before and after mass redundancy and outsourcing.","The business itself is flawed, from practices and ethics to execution. Working in Customer Service allowed us to identify extreme gaps in knowledge of sales team and neglect of TCF policies, we were witness to a huge amount of negative press and an investigation by the OFT. CS dealt with distressed, upset customers and the job was stressful and difficult, particularly given the lack of clarity on extenuating circumstances. We were told a 'refund isn't a solution' despite it definitely being so on most occasions. Groupon loved to identify as a 'friendly, customer-focused and original business' but behind that cutesy young-business face there are ruthless businesspeople and shareholders who have absolutely no interest in content consumers. Like, at all. I can't imagine this situation has improved, as the 'unifying' of the company has meant these poor practices have now been launched across Groupon internationally. 
Rather than focus on improvement of business practice and regulatory standard, higher management tackled the problem of falling profits and falling trust in the business by moving customer service out to Chennai. Just before we were made redundant we were able to witness how the staff in the outsourced office who were initially 'working alongside us' were often not bringing satisfactory resolutions or even corresponding with customers in satisfactory written English. 
It's particularly interesting to note that the newer head management had ties in business in Chennai, and despite being presented with evidence of the likelihood of customer service returning to the UK, and the likelihood of negative press, continued to shift our jobs abroad. No problem, no matter - given how quickly it's appearing that this fad industry is falling apart, I am pleased I no longer work here."
2785,Groupon,"T'was once a land of magic, then the Big Bad Wolf Cop blew down Cloud Cuckoo Land.",2014-08-28,3.0,Customer Support Representative,"It was once the best place to work, when everything was still Groupon-y. The crazy, weird, quirky, nutty nutella chocalaty environment was the one reason why everyone loved doing waking up every morning and coming to work. Heck, there was even this one guy that wanted to work all seven days, because he's bored at home. 
""that"", was how awesome it was. Yes, the ""was"" imply this was all in the past, and not existant, which will be elaborated in the Cons below.

The current pros are:
- People working with you on your level will be very friendly, and very cool people. Some try to act cool when they're not but that's okay.
- No dress code. Meaning you could wake up on a Monday morning hungover and go to work wearing the Iron Maiden tee shirt and pair of worn-out jeans you wore to the gig last night, although it is recommended. I'd put on a Death tee with a pair of shorts and my slippers. 
- Unlimited coffees. Hangover killer! 
- Importance given to being on time to work: I like being punctual and I like how being punctual here is a necessity.
- High-speed internet and wide screened computers: all running the latest specifications and a crazy fast internet connection.
- Free Wireless Fidelity connection for your mobile phone: Facebooking while you poop.?! 
- Music free environment; but only to the extent of your personal ear/headphones.
- Neatly maintained cafeteria
- Occasional ""fun"" events
- Quarterly team allowance for team outings/picnics
- Ping-pong table + Foosball
Now all of this were a thing when I was still a part of Groupon, but since things over change a lot and quite quickly, I'm not sure how much of these are still being provided.","Well, I'm not sure where to start. Perhaps from the top. Heads-up: This isn't a sob story.

Continuing from the Pros above:
It was all great, until it became Indianised. Now I have nothing against Indians. I am one myself, so if anybody thinks this is something racial, your argument is invalid. What was once a fun place became a business. I understand that inorder for a business to thrive in this crazy market its competing in, its gotta produce a profit, keep numbers up, make sure stock values don't dip. All that is understandable. But it should also be understood that the people who pour in their heart and soul, are supposed to mean something. 
Clueless management. Its like you ask them to change a light bulb, they tell you to fetch the data guy and collate all the data, look at it for 935 hours, tell the data guy its all wrong and that he needs to redo it again. And what happened to the bulb that needs replacing? Nothing. It still isn't working.
Compensation: Designations, job-titles, responsibilites of that job, make you who you are and what you're supposed to be doing and what you could do more than what you're supposed to be doing. The usual way how its done is the more higher your responsibilites, the higher you get paid. But here, its all messed up. No stable fixed payment structure. Same goes for the appraisal cycle. A guy who got promoted and a high appraisal rating, gets the same thing as a guy who newly joined the company for a starter position. They then ask you to come forward to them and tell them your grievances. When you do, you're showeled a bunch corporate farce glazed with a ton of whipped cream and a cherry on top.
Everytime there's an internal job posting politics happen and somehow, somebody just happens to very conveniently ""mess"" it up; either the management or the HR. Everytime!"

Even if you get a ""crappy"" person on the phone, worst case scenario you bumble through the phone call and laugh (or cry) about it afterward with your teammates. We're all going through the same thing, so it's really fun to encourage one another. Great thing is that the sales reps here are extremely positive people with a can-do attitude. There's such great energy here! Awesome work-life balance. You can do 9-5 and be a top sales rep within the company, no problem. Some people like to put in those extra hours too though.","You have a headset and are on the phones all day. So, it's not 100% the most glamorous sales job.

Sales is monotonous and often has little regard for the overall well-being of the merchants we work with.

Your threatened on a daily basis regarding your leads that come in from the company website, have a bad day or week, they get turned off.  If your at 100% of your goal at the end of the month you make 0...yes Zero.  The plan is designed that you don't start making money until you exceed 100%, getting to 100% is almost impossible except for reps that have been there forever.    Furthermore, the product is terrible.  Breadcrumb Pos (PRO) is an app, its not a POS system.  It offers restaurants no features and lacks ALL reliability and stability that you would want in a POS system.  Its a cloud based system that runs on the internet, if the internet goes down the restaurant/bar is dead.  Good system.  The system also experiences outages at least 2 times per month which causes major losses for merchants.

- Activity goals that get in the way of closing contracts and making the company money. They also leave employees exhausted which affects our personal lives. Oh, and they change almost weekly - no consistency or time to adapt.
- No safe place to go with questions - my HR ""partner"" went behind my back to tell my boss I was reaching out to her for simple clarification questions, not even with an actual problem. My manager yelled at me and told me that I should really only come to him with questions
- Extra-curricular activities that benefit the company actually discouraged if it does nothing for sales. 
- Getting promoted in sales used to take a quarter and now it takes a year which helps save Groupon a couple thousand per rep in salaries
- Stay late policies that make you feel like you're in Kindergarten time out, instead of policies that incentivize you to use your time efficiently for a reward

Middle management--which was almost nonexistent when I worked there, and was a chaotic role at best--is generally very young people freshly promoted from the sheep pen. Promotions and selections for the plum assignments were usually popularity-based and overwhelmingly favored young improv-comedian-type men. During my tenure, I saw numerous extraordinarily talented writers leave because they were simply exhausted by the quota system and by the accurate impression that no one cared what they thought about the work they were doing.

Great to see a lot of internal promotion and people growing through the ranks. We are all really young and starting our careers but it is cool to see people step into shoes one size too big and grow into them quickly.
The company focusses heavily on technology and processes, for the past year it has been hard to cope with so much change but it is starting to pay off now and the tools are super helpful.
It sounds cheesy but everyone is friends.. people know each other in different departments and we hang out as much inside the office as outside.","One of the hard things of working for a fast moving company is that it always changes.

This contributed to a number of structural problems—the most frustrating being that it became very difficult for even high performing employees to advance along their career path because the company was more interested in bleeding employees out than rewarding hard work.

- Casual dress code
- Great atmosphere with constant ad-hoc events around the office
- Flexible working & work from Home (role dependant)
- Opportunity to contribute to global growing business (not maintaining someone else's work)
- Opportunity to work with peers in different countries & expand knowledge base (role dependant)
- Paid sick days
- Benefits that support key life decisions (wedding bonus & baby bonus)
- Company promotes diversity ( PRIDE & Women groups)
- Paid time off to volunteer for causes

I should start by saying that this is not a 9-6 Company. If you are looking for a Company where you show up at 9 do your bit then leave at 6 on the nose this is probably not the best environment for you. This Company has been around for 4.5 years in Europe and what originally started as many individual entities has since started to transition to a single global organisation. A transition of this size & scope there are ultimately going to be challenges and frustrations- but there is also countless opportunities to have impact on the Company you work within and to gain a number of professional skills along the way.

Money is being invested into management training for all people managers and with the new EMEA management leaders a bigger focus is being placed on employees. They encourage diversity, community and team events and teams receive training based on the changing needs of the organisation.

After reading the other posts my unbiased opinion is that people have valid feedback however I think they are genuinely missing the size of the project at hand. Aligning 20+ countries in Europe to the globals objectives takes a lot of time and often one project needs to be completed in order to enable another. I have seen the Company with no benefits and rewards (every person in every position was paid below market) to a Company that matches market in terms of base comp (most roles) and also offers good benefits. I am very confident that this offering with continue to grow with the business. 

I highly recommend working here but stress it is for specific personality types. It is very challenging with constantly changing goal posts and deliverables. There can be long hours, lack of transparency and a general lack of communication and understanding between departments. But as someone who thrives in this environment I like the challenge of making it better, which I can see my role does.","- Could have better holiday allowance
- Some office furniture needs replacing

The main cons of the org stems from general communication between teams and business units. There are some staff (managers & front line) who have a real ""blame"" approach to issues and instead of working together to resolve issues (in a positive way) they rather blame everyone else and allow for that negativity to spread to the rest of their team.

Also communication could be better from our Senior leaders on why we make (or don't make) the decisions we do. Giving us more context about why the business didn't do something is just as important as tell us why it did."

Yet there is a ""fun"" atmosphere, but it's a facade, it's not real.  People are over-worked, and for the most part, the people who work here are stressed out and fairly rude."
2868,Groupon,Senior Account Executive,2014-05-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The dress code is nice.  Account Managers are good.,"Everything. This company makes me sick to the stomach.  They way they treat their employees who have done great work over the course of a year, met goals, and always stayed the course.  One bad month, they want to can you.  Unreal expectations.  They place a manager that is young twenties who hasn't managed anyone and expects people to respect them.  They never met her goals most months and now she is managing people...really!!!!  Now they are micro-managing their great reps, who will eventually leave.  This company is ridiculous to say the least.  I can not believe I have wasted an entire year with this bunch of people.  It's not about the merchant any more, it's about Groupon's bottom line and what they are making.  They turn great deals away, yet again, 20 year olds managing those decisions as well.  Seriously, a sucky place to work.  Don't waste your time, because no matter how many months you make goal, let one month go that you don't and you are in the hopper to get canned.  Trust and believe!!"
2869,Groupon,Recruitment Position,2014-05-12,1.0,,Innovative and intersting company that is new in certain parts of the world.,Recruiter was rude and disinterested
2870,Groupon,It changed.,2014-05-10,3.0,Outside Sales Account Executive,"As an outside rep, the schedule was flexible, but you end up working all of the time.

Quirky company with pretty lax dress/appearance code.  Made it nice to be incognito going into merchants.

Work with some pretty good people.  DSM was great.  RVP was great.

You really do help local business.  I -with Groupon's system- helped more than a few businesses either launch, or grow to see success.

If you're a guy, you get to know more about feminine hygiene and upkeep than you ever cared to know.

Pay was pretty good...","...but even good pay has its limits.

No specific vacation time means that you probably take your computer with you and never really take a vacation.  In my two years, I never truly took time off.  Could be my fault, but it would be nice if Groupon would have time when you can be completely off the grid.  All other departments can take time off and not worry about merchants calling them or things going haywire.  But not sales.  Your expectation of numbers doesn't drop, so you never really unwind.

On top of that, senior management is whipping harder and harder.

I realize you can't make different standards for people.  But trying to mold all reps into one style -I think- is ruining Groupon.  I was always ""slow and steady wins the race"" and did very well.  No phone.  Only in person.  But the standards of contact go so high that I was unable to effectively sell like I used to.  I felt as though I was being converted into an Inside Sales rep who was outside sometimes.  I had a very high close rate this way.  Then, I made a LOT of contacts but didn't close as much.  Seems to me that the wrong things are being measured (contacts instead of contracts).  Consistently closing contracts is no fluke (thanks for that comment Darren) even if the activity doesn't match your model.  You people (most of Groupon) may need the contact standards.  I just wanted to close business.

There came a time where I was TRIPLE LOGGING ACTIVITY so that the right things showed up on the right reports.

No more human intuition.  QL rules the day.  As outside reps, we know the market.  We know a good restaurant from a bad one.  But convincing people in Chicago of this proved problematic.  There were sandwich shacks that were qualified to run with us, and high-end restaurants that were not.  Yes, we could feature the non-qualified high-end ones, but it won't go to many people so won't sell well.  It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Company ran by a bunch of young twenty-somethings and some older people trying to be cool twenty-somethings.  Expect all meetings to be the most unprofessional that you have ever been in.  From the first meeting on my first day until the very end; cussing in meetings is the norm.  But it's above conversational...it's as if they were trying to make a point.  Kids just out of college don't generally make good managers."

You are expected to be available at all times, including nights and weekends. They don't care how mistreated you will be by certain clients they do business with, or by the lack of breaks they give you during the day (eat your lunch super fast and limit how many times you use the restroom). There is no room for promotions even though they will keep adding on to your work at the same salary. Certain managers are incredibly rude and will yell and cuss at you for petty reasons. Starting salary is the lowest I have encountered in this industry and extra perks are only available if you work in the Chicago office.

However, they have been contacted a dozen times already by several different reps and just do not want to be bothered anymore yet we keep calling.  It seems that the Groupon market is pretty saturated and it is a model that only works for businesses that have little to no variable costs (museums, zoos ect). I would honestly feel guilty when setting up deals for companies when I new it was going to hurt the business financially but had no choice because there are goals to reach in order to keep your job.

Developers ignored our concerns, as did our managers. During my last few weekly there, we had a number of outages in the software, costing merchants an incredible amount of money.

That's a huge plus. There is room for advancement if you work for it - most people are in a sales role and they just assume that there is no career growth but I have seen plenty of people work hard and move on. The company is still very young and has a lot of room for growth so there is opportunities to make your ideas come to life. I personally enjoy seeing all the moving parts working around me as there are not many companies in Chicago that grew so big so fast - and now we are in that period of adjustment to make all our investments, tools, and acquisitions merge into one big machine. While frustrating at times, I think in the long run it will good experience for many people to use later on in life when they take on larger job responsibility or even start their own companies.","Management is super frustrating. I really like the long term vision of the company that the CEO has, but sales management is so short term focused and I think it really affects the morale of the sales force at times. Things change all the time here....they change bonus and commission plans all of the time because I guess they just can't seem to get it right. I wish sales management would be more active in the day to day stuff that the sales reps go through. It seems that they just look at numbers all day and say ""do this, do that"", when they really need to realize that every single merchant we are working with has a different personality and different needs and desires.

2927,Groupon,If you constant change and low commission/base then Groupon sales is for you.,2014-02-11,3.0,Account Executive,"Unlimited paid vacation time, many young professionals, game room.","Management sucks, major favoritism with accounts, Company doesn't stand up for it's sales reps."
2928,Groupon,Bait and Switch,2014-02-11,2.0,Editorial,Your co-workers will be pretty awesome.,"Other than your colleagues and the dress code nearly everything else here will quickly turn into a liability for your career. 

If you are like most others in Editorial you will have recently graduated with a degree in a creative field. During your first days at Groupon much will be made about how many opportunities there will be to use your degree and your imagination. Within a few weeks you will see how this is not the case. Salespeople in the end have license to nix anything that strikes them as unconventional. Most of the best creative work here gets eliminated.

Nearly everyone in Editorial is looking for a way to leave for something else. The reasons for this are threefold: (1) You've no real ops here to flex creative muscle. (2) The compensation is miserable. Yes, the benefits are on the upper end of standard, but the paychecks are below market rate. (3) There is almost no path to advance within the company....more on that in the next paragraph.

New recruits are frequently told how many current managers were in their lesser positions for only a few months to a year before being promoted. While this is true it is more a function of circumstances that no longer exist within the company. Most in editorial who have been around for any length of time have stagnated in their position. Every few months or so upper management promises new career ops but those are quickly taken away for a variety of reasons related to disorganization.

That final point is probably the most important. Groupon suffers from a debilitating disorganization that isn't going anywhere fast. There is a large internal bureaucracy that stubbornly resists efficiency. 

Overall if you need something to pass a few months of your time while making your way onto the next thing this is an okay place to stop. If you're more determined in your career choices though, you will want to look elsewhere."

I've read a lot of reviews on Glassdoor and unfortunately the negative reviews are, for the most part, accurate with my experience here (for inside sales reps). 
It was almost a running joke to learn each week who had quit or been fired from an inside sales position. The monthly quotas are set very high and difficult to obtain, especially for small markets who also make the least in commission because of units sold. Most of the time during my calls I was told to take a hike or f-off and to never call back again. And my job was to wait a small period of time and call again. And we would get questioned when the businesses we sign up call and ask to be removed or ""paused"" because of how many vouchers they've sold...since Groupon wants to keep businesses on their site forever. I knew it was an inside sales position but this was like twisting arms, pulling teeth, and going to war with people on the phone everyday - - hence the very high turnover rate (and why Groupon is always hiring). My advice? If you decide to take this job, do it for no more than a year and move on."

This is a growth company struggling to continue that original growth, and all policies are aimed at short term gain to please shareholders. Since floating on the stock market, staff numbers and wages have been squeezed almost to breaking point. The lengths of this have even stretched to the Christmas party, which will be mid-January this year to save even more pennies.

No chance of career progression - the ethos of Groupon is short-term from top to bottom. Career progression is encouraged in the form of changing career - by leap frogging around the company hoping to find a department that is shrinking slightly less fast or paid slightly better. Do not work here if you want to learn new skills or progress, there is a glass ceiling above all that makes upwards progress impossible, so unless you want to 'progress' by moving sideways to a completely different role then forget it.

Hugely high staff turnover - Due mainly to the above two points but also as the company shrinks the workload on each person increases. New tasks, new responsibilities, endlessly working harder but yet pay-rises are dangled in front of everyone but never materialise. I've never been at a company with higher turnover, the majority of people at the company 2 years ago have gone.

Operations side of the company is a complete mess. Treated like a disposable under-class."

If you are average and like to be around people who are just like you or slightly below average, then Groupon is a great fit.  There's a general lack of accountability to be a rockstar, so you'll have the opportunity to coast by doing ""ok"" work for an ""ok"" company.  Punch in at 9:05am, punch out at 4:59pm.  Don't create, don't ask hard questions about where the company is headed.  If you're social and want to meet fun people, there are lots of young and fun people to befriend and partying to be had.","All technology companies do is manufacture innovation.  When technology companies stop innovating, their ability to grow shrinks and business performance suffers.  To innovate, you need the best people.  To attract and retain the best people, you need to foster an environment that drives creativity, innovation, and excellence.  Groupon had this for a moment in time, but lost it, and lost a lot of A-level talent in the process.  The end result is that the company has migrated to the mean.  If you're serious about business and working in an environment where the culture allows you to stretch your thinking and imagination, look elsewhere."

Glassdoor requires at least 20 words but I struggle to come up with more Pros","Constant change, long hours, no career progression.

While change is inevitable in any company, it is clear that Groupon's management team have absolutely no idea what they are doing. Expect major structural changes every quarter, change of line-manager several times a quarter and brand new KPIs laid in front of you with absolutely no consultation (by the end of the quarter, company's direction have completely changed and your KPIs no longer matter anyway).

There is no sense of job security because 1) Ridiculous turnover rate, 2) Mass firing / redundancy of some of the most dedicated people. Don't expect any career progression unless you are in the inner circle, expect to work long-hours (including weekends) with zero recognition, horrible work ethics all around. You will be constantly 'stepping-up' to take on more responsibilities without pay rise, because your colleague's just been fired and they don't plan on getting a replacement. Some of the most talented, hardworking and dedicated employees with passion are stuck in meaningless position - management simply fail to see their best talent.

If you are interested in Sales, this is the place to go but expect 1) Harsh sales environment, 2) Micromanagement, 3) HR walking you out before you know what happened. For Ops - this is hell. QA pressured into approving questionable contracts, Images/Productions are restricted by guidelines which limits their creativity. BDMs are incentivised by cash payouts to pump out contracts while Operations are given nothing to handle the additional work. 

Short-sighted management team - all about daily and weekly target even if that means burning customer/merchant and overworking employees. Conflicting messages from management, spontaneous projects that employees spend days and weeks working on are never implemented properly. Managers with no people skills are promoted and no training is provided to those who need help. 'Promotion' comes in a form of title change (zero pay rise).

Unethical Business, Horrifying Work Ethics & a lot of frustrated employees."

- High turnover of staff - people come and go.... Mass firing... definitely not a stable place to work. You come to the office and be surprised that half of the office is gone.. They do it in the most unethical way. They seriously do not care about their employees. 


- The management expects you to work atleast 10 - 14 hours a day or for some people longer and still do work on the weekends and do not get paid or get time in lieu for it. People are forced to work long hours because everyone is over worked. 

- They only care about their sales people but forget about the other employees who works really hard to be able to help drive the sales. Operations staff are the most unappreciated in the company despite of their hard work. HR and Manager do not respect operations unless they are friends or married or in a relationship with them.

I'm sure there are some departments within Groupon that are well-managed, but Merchant Services / Account Management is not one of them. I have never been under such poor management in my life. As an account manager, you will be belittled, undervalued, under-appreciated, underpaid, and taken advantage of. You will learn very quickly that you are the bottom rung on a unorganized,  unprofessional company ladder. The metrics in which your performance is measured on change almost monthly (and are delayed in sending out so you have less time to see where you stand). You will be under the supervision of a Team Lead (or TL). This TL will be in meetings all day. They will then judge you (with no logic) on your daily tasks (even though they never did those tasks themselves) and then sit on a soapbox while allocating a high deal count to you. One team specifically had a team count of 12 account managers that then went down to 4 in the matter of weeks. This is a reflection on how poor this department is.. They do not replace employees when they leave (shows how important they really are), and the workload of the employee that left gets dumped onto others who already have a full count. The employees that stay are then held to the same standard as if they had a normal workload to begin with. I would never recommend working here to a friend. I wouldn't even recommend working here to my 
worst enemy.  Please, highly consider other options before even thinking about becoming an account manager at Groupon. I do not see a job being much worse than this."

With that said, most of these complaints seem to come from people that are relatively inexperienced in the working world.  Others who have seen different working environments tend to appreciate what we have here at Groupon.

Sure the money can be inconsistent but that's sales and honestly you get out of it what you put in.

This role is given leads to call but really it's an inside sales job.  You sit in your home office dialing for dollars.

There are no territories so you can't just stop in places and cold call.  Groupons idea of cold calling is dialing off their lists.  Most of the good accounts are owned by inside sales reps in Chicago.  I have never worked for accompany that inside sales reps have more prestige and power than outside reps but I promise you, the outside sales reps are not considered important.

These managers are largely not equipped to lead a sales team. Reps are often told they must stay late - often until 8:00 - and come in on weekends. 

Worst of all, reps are misled about the opportunities in sales. In my interview I was told several large cities they were hiring for. You aren't told what city you'll work on until the end of training. 

I was given a mid-size city - but told that I could only focus on the outskirts (small, rural areas with no population to speak of). You're evaluated and paid on gross profit, and deals in these areas do not perform well. Therefore, you're only as successful as your accounts. People who started at Groupon early had it made- mediocre sales people don't need to work hard when they can run the same businesses over and over to crush their goals.

3094,Groupon,50% chance you will last a year - This is a MUST read!,2013-03-20,3.0,Account Executive,"First I want to say that I really liked working at Groupon for a year and I am not disgruntled at all. 

Second I will say that things at this company change monthly. I was there a year and the sales processes, commission, sales tools, basically everything changes multiple times a month. Every month there's ""a better way to do things"" and it's SO ANNOYING! 

Groupon is a great place to work if you don't care about your career. If you want to have a strong career in sales, management or business in general it's not the place for you. It can be a good stepping stone to something bigger and better, but in no way will it be long-term. I worked there for a  year because my last company was sold and it was Groupon or no job. I worked there for a year while looking for another sales position which I found and love! 

First and foremost it's a sales job. The culture is great and fun, but if you don't hit your numbers they have no problem firing you. In the year I was there I was on the top of my game and made President's Club so it's not like I was struggling and am mad at the company or anything. I saw probably 15 people get fired/quit on my team over the course of just 9 months - and my team had about 30 or so people on it. The turnover is CRAZY! At the time I left so many managers who had been there since it was a start-up were quitting - seems like everyone is quitting. 

People, just like me, see Groupon on the outside and think OMG! what a cool and fun place to work - kinda like Facebook or Google. Then they get hired as an Account Executive and you're basically a telemarketer cold calling business owners who want nothing to do with Groupon and trying to persuade them to feature their business on Groupon. You will call 100 businesses and maybe 10 owners will talk to you for more than 5 minutes. Of those 10 only 2-4 will even run a deal. No one wants to be on Groupon anymore and the ones who do are crappy businesses that barely even make money. I didn't mind the cold calling, but if you aren't wanting to make 70 calls a day aka telemarketing than this job isn't for you. 

I also heard great things about the culture and when I was hired I was so excited to be working along side people my own age. Everyone there is so distant. It took a good 4 months before people on my team even started opening up to me. People on other teams won't even give you the time of day. It's weird, but no one there really cares about anyone else unless. 

Daily deals are on its last leg. Groupon won't be around in a few years like they are now. When a new CEO comes in I can guarantee mass layoffs and pay cuts. Show me a new CEO that comes into a new role running a struggling company that loses millions of dollars every month and says, ""Hi everyone! I'm your new CEO - I know this company is struggling so everyone gets raises and you can expect to keep making the same commissions for years to come!"" No one.","- Terrible leads for new reps
- Telemarketing businesses that hate you
- 70 calls a day to even make goal
- Account Executive potential is around $50-$65k tops for new reps. Senior reps might make more, but not for long - Not much money for Chicago. 
- LONG HOURS! Depending on your market you will work like 8-6 or maybe 9-7

There's a very shiny, outer image that the company projects that does make it look good on a resume.","The main problem with Groupon is they fell into a classic business mistake of putting all their effort on growth, and nothing on infrastructure to promote that growth or the retaining of personnel to continue that growth.  As a result, whether you are employed in sales, or are a details writer, or even in customer service, you find your work process constantly changing in a seemingly desperate attempt to keep up with demand or patch holes that were never foreseen.  This makes the day-to-day much more stressful than it should be for the average employee.

Further, Groupon has not been very good at improving morale or working to keep the people they have.  As you might infer from the submitted employee salaries, pay for comparable positions are below the well industry standard almost across the board, with meager to no pay increases annually for performance.  In addition, there is almost no ability to move out of your current position that you are in, other than into a management position for your same position.  Lastly, the very public negative  press related to the company, such as the CEO and Founder, Andrew Mason, being fired, gives one a sense that Groupon is a sinking ship and that the company, and your job, could go under at any minute. 

It really is a tragedy - there are many very talented young people working there, something almost any company would envy, and they feel like there is no future for them or the company.  There's so much potential, but the systematic problems are not using them to the f"

3103,Groupon,"Weak management, Poor guidance, and Dim Outlook",2013-03-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Was great while it lasted.,"***PLEASE READ*** 

Weak Management: it all starts from the top. There are way too many executive and management (Vice President and Director levels) ""relics"" in this company who are incompetent beyond the company's early days as a media darling. They are just too small for their britches. Now that the media sizzle is gone and the company has to operate on a daily basis, it's easy to see the cracks, holes, and faults wherever you turn. Groupon has some major operating issues, particularly in its international business and here in Chicago, the HQ, where all the major decisions are made. 

We brought over many executives from Amazon because we thought we could be like Amazon, but didn't realize how hard it is to run a real company beyond just deals because we're missing so many pieces and we can't seem ever make the right decision internally, catch a break with the media, and get our financials in line.

We acquired many companies to run our product development offices in Silicon Valley and once the acquired talents get their stocks and cash they can't wait to leave. Why? Because these guys are smart. Instead of getting stuck in the bureaucracy, they go elsewhere while they still can.

The Chicago HQ office really needs help. It's basing a great deal of emphasis on daily deals and not much elsewhere. 

Poor guidance: weak management = poor guidance. We cannot seem to make the right decisions and most often then not cannot seem to keep great employees because they are frustrated by not getting the recognition they deserve. Some managers try to influence with fear as if the employees jobs are at stake. This is poor management.

Dim Outlook: weak management > poor guidance > dim outlook
What can I say but to direct you to the financials of Groupon. We are not gaining. We have lost the hope of our investors and the only ones really holding on are the ones who can cash out the most from the top. That is a fact."

Sales reps are forced to run certain deal structures even if that is not in the best interest of the business wanting to run a deal.  They then run successful deals on competitor sites.

New reps are given burnt accounts, and expected to fix the mistakes senior reps made.

Your clients don't mean anything in regards to when they will feature.  Managment will feature a deal based on total revenue opportunity regardless of what the merhcant thinks after the merchant has been waiting 3 month's to be featured.  

The company is ran on ""Short term results, get paid today, worry about tomorrow, many tomorrow's down the road.  This is NOT a long-term client relationship business model.  Management cannot treat their merchants like ""2nd Class"" and expect to continue to get repeat business. 

The small amount of merchants they do have to feature you will see them appear 3 to 4 time's a year.  Nothing new with this company & the client will notice quickly, which I'm sure they already have."

- some good sales materials, if you can find 'em.

- good online resources","What a MESS.  I think this could have been a pretty good job, but there are all kinds of problems.  Everything is sooooo unorganized.

We were supposed to have sales materials mailed to our home to be waiting on us when we got home from training.  I asked for them 1-3 times every week for for months, never got any of it.  Made up my own.

I'd be okayed to call on a certain client/category, make the sale, do all the paperwork, and then have the deal rejected, often to see the EXACT SAME DEAL run by an inside rep within  weeks.  Hours wasted.

We'd put new businesses coming to town in the system only to have them taken away within two weeks.  Accounts would randomly be taken from one persons' list and given to the inside reps.  

Market was waaay oversaturated.  Lead planning was a major hindrance, at least in my city.

Environment in the office was catty and negative in many cases.  Felt like I spent more time selling to my coworkers and trying to get my deals to run and get the OK to call on clients than I did actually selling.  Really exhausting and ridiculous.  Feel like my whole experience there was a fiasco and waste of time.

Wearing Jeans to work","No managers to speak of- Most of the management has been ""grand fathered in"" from before the big hiring explosion and none of them have any people management experience.

Everyone keeps secrets from their reports - Even if its something like explaining process changes in that your team will be working on, you hear about everything last minute when management has known for weeks or sometimes months.

The company as a whole makes erratic changes - While the company started small, they have grown considerably, but still expects people to be able to change what they do at the turn of a dime. Its unrealistic and causes many more problems in the long run

Each division of the company is its own silo - Communication between departments and divisions is a joke. Everyone is out to get there own piece of the pie without any consideration for what is actually good for the company as a whole

No career development - Even with reports complaining and asking for career development, management has been dragging its feet. Worst part is, if reports don't approach managers with specific interests, managers do not have the ability to help reports determine where their specialties lie.

Compensation is a joke - Paying someone with a masters degree 30k and yet calling their job entry level even though you would need to know many internal policies and procedures is a common practice. Pay rates of the same position two years ago or even one year ago is now a fraction of the pay rates currently. Often times, interns are paid as much or more than full salaried employees within the sales department."

You work long days - 9 hour shifts (and most people work through their lunch). Although the company may look like an office of slackers to someone passing by, you are literally working from the minute you're in until the minute you leave. Management is very hit or miss, some are great, others are absolute nightmares and treat their team like slaves. Wages are going down, and all customer service department salary staff was converted to hourly wage (without notice or dept input). You started at Groupon 2 years ago? You make ~$4k more a year than people starting now. You started a year ago? You make ~$2k more than people make today. Wages are going down and the workload is increasing due to internal and external pressures. Veterans talk about the ""old"" days (the company is only 4 years old) and how much fun it used to be. The vibe can be a little cliquey with coworkers, in some ways like freshman year at college. Entire customer service team was converted to hourly wages recently, and the department heads said it was so that it'd be easier for folks who want to work part time, but in reality, it's a cost cutting measure. For now, the unlimited paid time off is the only real salvation, but there's a really high chance that this will change. The job on a day to day basis is dealing with the same things. However, the company and department makes big changes every couple of months. There's not a ton of room to move up in the department, so folks have to look at other departments or look for work elsewhere. There's a lot of moving parts in the company, so things go wrong - a lot. When deals go bad, the customer service team has to deal with the fall out. There's a huge disconnect between sales and customer service and often times, it feels impossible to resolve things in a timely manner. For several months, there was an army of temps, all of whom made a lot less than the full time employees, had to do nearly double the workload and were viewed and talked to like second class employees. You're evaluated on a weekly basis, and by performance metrics, however they are not always accurate as there are constantly issues with the system. No pay increase after six month reviews, only after annual reviews and most people aren't getting raises due to the huge issues the company is facing being a public company now."

They also operate with very little people management experience, which might frustrate you if you prefer guidance, focus, and support from your managers.

You are around other young people just getting their careers started.,"I was so proud to say that I work here at first.  They say you get unlimited time off but that's not even close.  The daily deal business has so many competitors now.  As a sales person you are going into markets where merchants are so sick of getting calls from Groupon and its competitors.   In training, they will sell you on how cool the company is and it is cool but if you are going into sales it is HORRIBLE!  Slowly turning into a boiler room atmosphere with live updates on how many calls you have made.  No longer can take a consultative approach but rather squeeze every last dollar out of merchants. Truth is, if you go into sales you're stuck there. There are a lot of young people there with no management experience and majored in subjects like philosophy. The divisional sales managers are arrogant and just sit on g chat all day acting like they are so busy but really aren't.  They sold Groupon when it was so easy to sell.  You're not selling anything, you're begging merchants to work with Groupon.  Out of the 800 salespeople you will probably find about 5% who are actually happy to be selling for Groupon."

-somewhat laid back work atmosphere (in this sense I do not mean the job, just that you can dress as you wish)","It is understandable how a company such as this has to make changes. It grew incredibly fast and didn't know what to do with itself. However they need to take a look and see how miserable their employees are, especially within the sales staff, and maybe readjust some of these changes. Our commission has been cut drastically and our goals are unrealistic. Groupon has become this constant ""more! more! more!"" monster. We no longer consult businesses but call them and tell them what features they have to run. If they don't want to do it, we move on, and yet go crawling back to that same business a few weeks later when we've exhausted the others to try and force them into a similar deal they rejected before. Groupon needs to get back to the way it was and actually be there to help a business grow not put them out of business. Being at the company for over a year and a half I've seen it become increasingly greedy. As sales reps we now have to squeeze every penny out of merchants we work with and get paid half the commission to do so."

3267,Groupon,Intellectual satirical writers gone wild,2011-11-15,4.0,Staff Writer,"It's a young company that hires mostly young people in their 20s, so it's really easy to connect with the people around you. There's always something happening in the office almost every day, whether it's making ice cream to playing dodgeball--every day is a surprise. The editorial department has a tendency to operate on a different wavelength than the rest of the company since we're not focused on sales, so it's definitely more of a lax atmosphere. It's also different because it's certainly the smartest department in the company--all of your co-workers attended Top 30 colleges and half of them hold journalism degrees from Columbia. So, it's a funny, fun-loving group with whom you can interact on a more-intellectual level when you're through writing. 

There's a Groupon gym that you can use if you want, and there are tons of child-like break-rooms located throughout our offices, so that's always cool. Managing editors are generally nice and respected, and they have a tendency to invite you out to drinks after work or parachuting off buildings (seriously--this company is a surprise). Because of the intellectual environment, there's a lot of opportunity to improve your writing and have your co-workers and bosses help you along the way. Before you get a job offer, writers have to go through Groupon Academy so you learn to write in Groupon's style and tone.","Honestly, there aren't that many downsides if you're part of the editorial staff. A lot of the stress and pressure is placed on sales. My reason for leaving was morally-motivated in that I wanted to work for a company whose initial mission involved helping local businesses promote growth within their communities. The reality of the matter is this: Groupon has grown too fast and continues to grow fast because it's too focused on attaining (but not retaining) business clients. A majority of the profits made from deals are consumed by the company instead of the local partner with which they're working, and there's no certainty or any sort of plan to help business growth once deals expire."
3268,Groupon,Dissatisfying but with some knowledge gained.,2011-11-12,2.0,Business Research,"Few or no cases of office politics and it is largely task-oriented. The environment is not as supportive and friendly as advertised but nevertheless, it is based on a flat hierarchical structure. Even the office is small, with all the various operations department (editorial, redemption, customer service, business research, city planning etc) and sales teams squeezing into one open space with no compartments/structures separating them, the various departments are in general not familiar with other departments other than their own.

Fast paced environment with a lot of work. Hence, it is interesting.

Get to grow with a growing company.","Long working hours despite low pay check.

even though work place is designed to be an open area, intangible barriers still exists between departments.

Lack of employee benefits. No proper pantry other than a drink dispenser. Have to bring your own cup and cannot use the plastic cups provided in the cupboard. Those cups are for guests only.

very underpaid!!! No OVERTIME and long hours are usually expected from everyone. salaries are only around 2k on average, even for fresh grads out of local universities (NTU, NUS etc). This excludes the sales team of course."
3269,Groupon,Grass Isn't Always Greener,2011-11-10,1.0,Sales,"-Anti-corporate culture
-Brand recognition (though this can be a major CON too)
-Has the largest subscriber base in most cities 
-Hard to get bored 
-Can still be a great avenue for marketing/advertising small businesses","The job that Groupon sells you on and the job you actually do once you accept a position are two completely different things.  It sounds like you're going to be able to build relationships with merchants to help them promote their business, but that is so far from the case.  In reality, Groupon is a boiler room mentality, with an ultra high sales cycle time- if you can close a merchant on your first call, thats encouraged and then you aren't expected to talk to them again- it's on to the next 30/50/7- calls.  Groupon also has a really hard time taking no as an answer.  If a merchant tells one sales rep they aren't interested, management just transfers that account to another rep to have them try- no wonder merchants who have told Groupon no in the past HATE Groupon! Sales reps get accused of soliciting, told off, yelled at- management doesn't care.  Maybe someone else will have better luck!  There is ZERO autonomy regarding which deals sales reps can close- if it's not something Groupon wants, good luck getting it featured on the site.  It's almost like they set up reps to fail- spending all this time spinning your wheels on obscure smaller deals will NOT help you hit your massive goal.  Maybe Groupon will grow up at some point, but for the immediate future it's like a roller coaster you wish you didn't ride, and can't wait to get off of."
