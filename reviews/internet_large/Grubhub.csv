0,Grubhub,Pay could be better,2022-04-10,4.0,Specialist,"Grubhub is a great place to work! Upper management really values employee work/life balance, half Fridays at work are great. Tons of resources available for employees to refer to for growth development.",Definitely underpaid for the position.
1,Grubhub,Beware,2022-04-08,1.0,Restaurant Sales Executive,"If you have a busy schedule outside of 9-5 this is a good job to streamline commute time (i.e. college, kids, extracurriculars)","Hard to find a place to start. Was told the ""first three months are guaranteed $3,000 commissions."" The way they structured the onboarding was that it ran three days over into a new month. Was informed that 'guaranteed' commission is only guaranteed for a full month from start to finish. So don't expect to see that till your 5th paycheck (2.5 months). The industry standard for this role is much higher in terms of base salary (1.5x to be precise) so do not be manipulated by the 'guaranteed commissions'. The OTE mentioned in your interview is probably exaggerated from the sales that happened in the heat of COVID. If you do take this role know that Grubhub has irritated a lot of restaurants by posting their menus without permission - $15/hour is not worth you getting cussed out every day. Competitors have adjusted to the exit of COVID fears by offering very high signing bonuses for restaurants - you do not get that same luxury here (UberEats offers upwards of $200K for one restaurant Grubhub offers a free tablet). Expect to be put into territories that are essentially the backwash of previous reps. Job security is low and the turnover is high. If you take this job, use it as a stepping stone and move on. In my tenure three senior executives left within a one-year time frame - so guess the turnover at the lower levels. I left several months ago but know this now - every call you make, you have to say ""this is a recorded line."" If you are a tenured sales rep you know this screams ""solicitation"" and triggers sales resistance from the start."

Uncapped commission with top performers clearing $100k/year
All Fridays end at 1PM local time
Great Benefits
Paid business travel","Company policy is ""travel optional."" However, travel is integral to being a top performer. I'd estimate that most reps spend 15%-20% of the year on the road. Face to face is way more effective than over the phone. None of this was clearly communicated during the interview process.

If travel is not an option for you, you will be doing this job at a disadvantage compared to those that travel. This will be reflected in your metrics.

Oh yeah, if you miss quota 2 months out of 12, you are subject for termination. If the most effective way to hit quota is to travel for face to face meetings, then travel is unofficially required (if anything to keep your sanity as the end of the month approaches and you're still shy of hitting the monthly quota)."

37,Grubhub,Not your everyday cold calling sales.,2022-03-07,2.0,Inside Sales Executive,Relaxed culture. Decent training. Some managers willing to assist.,"Cold calling is not the right description of the job. It is more like a warm call, but the other party is already strongly against your product. You get a list of restaurants to call and are made to call each either daily or every other day. These people have said no to GH ussually 50-100 times. Therefore as soon as you disclose why you are calling they become incredibly hostile. Management has the idea of ""match their energy"" so I was asked to get hostile and argue back with the restaurants on the phone asking you to stop calling them. This can lead to developing some very bad sales habits in my book. No one wants called by a screaming salesperson demanding that they buy their product. I have never been hung up on so much in all my day of sales and cold calling."

Friday half-days

Remote","False pay advertisement

Extreme micro-mangement from low sales managers

Saturated marketplace - everyone knows who you are, what you do. There's no science to selling GrubHub. Most of your ""new leads"" are restaurants that have already tried and quit GrubHub. Or they've already been called on dozens and dozens of times this year

Senior Management is completely out of touch with reps

Super unethical business practices (we will list your restaurant's menu and info without consent for our own gain, then blame the restaurant for any service issues like cold food, late delivery, incorrect order)

Unprofessional - I've never worked in an environment where emoji's are used more than words in a Slack channel

Very high turnover

Training is paid at minimum wage for two whole weeks of mind-numbing cold calling principles - don't expect to practice it until they throw you into the field with a quota

You have a talk time quota immediately out of training, which your manager will remind you of every two hours

- good work-life balance","The company essentially is myspace to facebook.

A few critical problems i've seen during my tenure here within the product org:
1. CPO is completely checked out with no vision brought to the actual product, thank god he had left the company & i don't think grubhub has any intent to hire a new CPO at all
2. the company functions at a very top down apporach - this is fine if you just want to execute what senior leadership says; however this also means your ideas are easily killed by middle managers because they have to do what their boss told them to do - even with data/facts on your hand supporting your argument, your idea is worthless to senior leadership and they think their idea is the best. Unfortunately, they are far too detached from reality to know that none of those ideas would actually work. no product retro is done to track either those initiatives work or not because it's been pushed all the way from top down.
3. for whatever reason, finance department runs this company - they have strong leverage they can pull and all other departments are like 2nd tier citizens to them. Also new CEO is effectively the CFO who has been running the company for the past decade, our CEO has checked out like a long time ago. Thanks to finance's dominance in this company, all projects are focus on profits (i.e., making every bit of money from restaurants or customers as much as possible) rather than forming a coherent long term vision.
4. since there are not really that much things to do at middle management level because ideas from ICs are killed and upper management just force us to do project XYZ, middle managers have nothing to do than micro manage the hell out of you on your individual projects. also thanks to this, your manager essentially is your blocker for promotion therefore no career advancement at all.

Bottom line: this is a place where innovation dies & if you are interested in saying ""yes sir"" - this is the place for you"

Management... lacks actual culture and diversity. Doesn't listen to their people. Micromanages every second of every single day. This is the first company I've worked for that has implemented the placement of a work force management system to track specialist adherence that wasn't a call center. They've set and placed heavy emphasis on specialists meeting extremely high and unrealistically substantiated metrics which are everchanging. Communication is poor and non-existent in most cases! The day-to-day changes almost daily and major departmental changes are communicated at the very last second, even when management has been planning them for months!

Speaking of daily changes, your job responsibilities will change OFTEN! You'll be forced to learn your job from scratch at least every 6 months! Your supervisors will change along with them, so don't grow attached to the people you work with or the type of work you'll be doing! Along with these changes, expect trainings on new task to be lackluster and to be given by overworked and underpaid ""seniors"" who don't necessarily want to do the job and/or have no experience and therefore no business training anyone altogether! In my experience, you'll either get someone who is knowledgeable and who geniunely wants to help, or you'll get stuck with someone who doesn't like questions and get easily annoyed with folks who don't ""get it"" immediately. Then, there are the folks who have been barely trained themselves put in ""support"" roles who have little to no idea what's going on in the first place and are absolutely unfit to support anyone in any aspect. Training and support is a complete gamble, in which most of us never truly know what we're going to get. Be prepared to either continuously have to request more and more training or you'll be forced to tough it out on your own and attempt to teach yourself using the outdated, incomplete and often completely inaccurate learning SOP's used to somehow aid the QA team in deciding who's doing what correctly... But, that is a whole other story/argument for another day!

Let's jump back into expectations tho, shall we?
Expect your ideas to be ignored by those in the position of power to make changes. Most managers, leads etc don't know how to do the jobs and tasks those they are managing are doing. So, don't expect help or support from them. Don't expect them to listen to your ideas or concerns regarding ways to improve processes or how to make things better... They are only trained see things from a numbers standpoint, and specialists have been underhandedly been told numerous times that everything is a numbers game. Your quality of work delivered isn't nearly (or at all) as important as the quantity of the work you deliver! Everyone's screaming ""Look at the progress we made!"" But, what they mean is look at this large body of work we cranked out, nevermind the quality isn't up to standards or that the work we've done made absolutely no impact whatsoever to the goal we've been given to accomplish! Fun Fact: The only goal is: Did you do a lot of whatever you were told to do?

The pay is a comedy! Earlier this year, the company decided to merge a bunch of departments into one big ""FLO (Front-Line Operations"" department where everyone would be cross-trained and assist each other with workloads and responsibilities, but refused to pay everyone the same or somewhat similar salary. So, now we have folks who make as little as $15-$16 dollars per hour doing the same work and sharing the responsibilities of those who make upwards of $20+ an hour and management refuses to listen to reason regarding pay equality in the light of these changes! Not to mention, they've placed emphasis on EOY merit inceases, but this year the maximum amount they gave as raises was a mere $0.40, which was given to anyone who simply showed up and did their job up to those who went above and beyond in 2020! PS: The department just hired someone with no previous experience at $17 per hour while most of the folks hired within the last 3 years are only making about $16.30 per hour. Make it make sense.

Upward mobility is a joke! You can give your all, be a team player, implement the best ideas and still be beat out by someone(s) will little to no experience due to favoritism and office politics. Work ethic and skill won't get you as far as you'd think! Don't expect to move up in this company unless, you're prepared to kiss a lot of pinky rings aside from giving your all, being a yes (wo)man and doing great work.

I literally could go on and onnnnnnnn... But, I don't have the time!"

268,Grubhub,Dog Eat Dog & Unorganized,2021-06-08,2.0,Account Executive,Free gift card each week,"Managers don't know what they're doing. Salesforce over there is a complete joke. There are several duplicates of restaurants. Sometimes you end up calling restaurants who are already signed up because you can't find the duplicate which shows they work with us. Even if you had the righter way to call accounts with multiple locations, managers/other account executives are shady and will call behind your back. This has cost me deals that were 20+ locations. Not innovative in anyway, just reacts to what DoorDash does. 

Training is only 2 days long, literally a joke. My training manager was so sarcastic. She said someone asked her how our training class was doing and her reply was ""better than I expected."" 

If you're experienced in sales as an account executive, it doesn't matter. Everyone starts at the entry level.

There are months were sales are super scarce. I had a senior rep tell me to go out to local restaurants and sign them up and just say that it was by chance. Which is completely against policy and I could've gotten fired for it.

There was a group chat with the reps on my team who kept complaining about the influx of new hires... a chat I was in and had just started a couple of months prior.

All in all between management and other reps, I had a terrible experience."

- Way too much focus on metrics that don't always result in success. You are required to get 60 min of talk time per day by cold calling into markets that have been ran through a dozen times over. Territories are shared which leads to arguments among reps, broken rules, and lost deals
- Management is a toss up, and there is a complete lack of diversity in leadership. Bad managers are not held accountable, favoritism is rampant, promotions are few and far between
- Extremely high turnover and burnout. New hires are quitting after a couple of months - don't be one of them
- Little focus on development and career growth. Nowadays if you make it through ramp, you've only proven that you can simply keep yourself on the phone (most of it spent being yelled at by restaurants who have been called by GrubHub 10 times in the past month) and have gotten lucky enough to hit quota in the process. From there you are on your own as there didn't seem to be any requirement for managers to actually monitor your performance....
- GrubHub is not keeping up with the competition. Market share has tanked in every major city over the past two years and you constantly find yourself selling against GrubHub/3rd party"

316,Grubhub,Very High Turnover,2021-04-24,1.0,Remote Restaurant Sales Executive,"Free food, work from home","GrubHub is hiring a bunch of people for the remote restaurant sales position. If you’re thinking about joining DO NOT DO IT. They’re taking advantage of the current labor market and hiring unemployed sales managers for this call center position. 

They give you 10 or 12 zip codes to sell in and you’re not allowed to sell outside of your territory. Their Salesforce is a mess and you’re only calling restaurants that made GrubHub remove their menu from the platform. A while back GrubHub put restaurants menus on their site without the restaurant owners permission. You’re calling these restaurants. 

They expect 60 minutes of talk time per day. The timer doesn’t start until someone actually picks up so you could potentially call 50 restaurants that don’t answer and get zero talk time credit. 

Turnover is atrocious. People are leaving on their own accord because they aren’t honest during the interview process. They don’t give you the tools necessary to succeed. You’re paid $32k. Go look at average sales salaries at GrubHub and it tells you everything you need to know about this position. You will not make 6 figures. Don’t believe them when they tell you this. Tenured reps are leaving too. I’m too new to know what’s going on but it seems there’s a mass exodus right now. Everyone is missing their sales goals because territories are so thoroughly picked through you’re calling restaurants that don’t speak English. 

This job is awful, you’re paid less than regular reps, your territory is too small, their required metrics are absurd, commissions aren’t that great. Nobody on my team is hitting their talk time goal. Everyone is stressed out about getting fired because 2 strikes and you’re out. Miss talk time one month and your sales goal the next? You’re fired."

- Management attempts in diversity, and inclusion.

Before Covid: 
- Office + culture + coworkers
- Lunch catering + work events
- Monthly enterprise townhalls that gave a sense of purpose to the Enterprise team.","Grubhub is becoming more bureaucratic and dysfunctional every day. Grubhub as the whole is a very top-down chain of command company. While I assume this can work for some companies that have a clear vision, it doesn't for Grubhub. Most of the higher management + product team tries to catch up with our competitors instead of coming up with new ideas and because of that initiatives can be half baked and not researched. At the same time big ideas from the engineering teams usually die by a thousand cuts of bureaucracy since they need to convince a lot of people before the idea even reaches out to higher ups. This bureaucracy is worsened by the number of people that are in ""management"" or decision making positions while none of them have any willpower or sometimes real power to actually make any decisions. 
In addition, as I have been here longer I realized that it is very hard for people to advance in their career. A lot of times politics are more important factor vs. competence. Since I have been here, most of the management stayed the same while some of them are good managers, there are some that are not. I have noticed that not so great managers are usually the ones that use office politics more and more to gain more power and push aside competition in their ranks or even other managers. That being said, the company recently introduced a leveling guide that on paper, should allow career advancement. However, execution on that is remained to be seen. 

The last thing that can be improved is company's HR practices. Year end reviews and compensation adjustment timelines doesn't make sense . Compensation adjustments happens before year end reviews. Because of that it doesn't matter if you feel like that the year end review was unjust or even as the result of the conversation during your year end review your manager changes his/her mind about you. By that point, things are mostly set and it is too late to change anything. It would also be good to be able to review your manager. There is also a lot of talk about ""inclusion"" but in reality, it just translates to some corporate HR video about it and nothing else in practice (given even that is better than nothing)."

Tried reasoning with the guy from day one onwards, and over communicated during weekly check-ins and impromptu briefings, but received no actual help. I honestly feel like he didn’t care to do as much within his power to help me the one month I (whole team, except 2 people) were struggling, however, I pushed through. I actually expressed my concerns with having opportunities taken away and not fully returned before things got a little challenging. Our personalities didn’t mesh well, and the negative energy he emitted made the environment unfit for me. Most managers don’t respect or accept constructive criticism from my 20+ years of work experience. And this guy was no exception. A person who also had less work experience in sales or management after playing semi-pro sports prior, by the way, insulted a team member to the point that others began to follow suit. So imagine what that had to be like... I actually expressed my discontent with his behavior personally and to him and his boss when pulled in for a performance review... fired a week later because of my actions “falling outside the code of conduct.” Something supported by vague wording in their policy in addition to working in a at will state, etc., supported their decision. My offense wasn’t something many would say is punishable by immediate hiring considering the fact that a repeat offender of signing up businesses for less %s without mandated floor approval never got in trouble to my knowledge. Something I had been encouraged to do by any means necessary before but I digress. I’m not white and it sucks that another white guy questioned if that may have been a factor in separate end results in comparison to my younger, white male counterpart that was a habitual line stepper. But I digress. I’m hustler and still had work going on in another profession, so I gracefully bowed out when the curtains closed after this act. If you work here, get the title, benefits/stock, experience, and move on to greater opportunities that await you in life. Don’t like this chapter be your story if you want more...go forward. Get it?

Decent perks and benefits.","The Managers in this department play favorites and either micromanage or are never around for support. You get most of your support from other coworkers in the trenches with you. I have a long-time operations background and honestly, this job is better for a salesperson. You push restaurants into onboarding when they aren't ready so you can get paid out more, you are pushed to sell owners on restaurant concepts that will fail and you are constantly stressed about metrics. Managers will have one on ones and all you talk about is how badly you are falling behind in numbers compared to your teammates. 

They changed the commission completely and are now paying out reps even less than before. You definitely need a sales mindset and need to feel motivated by money to do well. You won't be asked to work on projects and will be told to stay in your lane if you express interest in doing more than your job requirement.

On top of this number, I was expected to hit 60 minutes of what Grubhub calls ""talk time"" per day - uninterrupted time speaking with restaurants over the phone. Even though I was consistently hitting my restaurant sign up numbers, I was ultimately let go because I wasn't hitting an average of 60 minutes of talk time per day. I spent more time making sure my restaurant submissions were flawless than I did on the phone and had to suffer for it. This told me that management had zero trust in my process and did not respect me as an individual - it felt as though I was viewed more as a ""cog in the machine."""

* Kind, thoughtful coworkers—talented people who're also easy to work with as human beings
* Strong senior ICs in particular
* Caring design and product leadership—kept the lights on during COVID but remained reasonable and humane about the mental toll of the pandemic
* Exciting time to be at the company with evolving product lineup, business challenges, upcoming acquistion","* Occasional bureaucracy that comes with growing companies
* Constant roadmap shifts/pivots + resulting org changes every 6–9 months makes it feel like there wasn't sound long-term planning 
* Ups and downs in competitive landscape—widely acknowledged the company fell behind severely within about 3 years
* Artificial and inflated boundaries between ""Chicago"" and ""New York"" teams stalled growth, caused unnecessary politics, and has likely resulted in subpar product decisions—Chicago teams in particular need more resources and exec attention
* Product and engineering leadership often felt somewhat arbitrary — who got promoted, elevated, etc. wasn't as clear to those on the ground. Make sure leadership actually focuses on the long-term and not just short-term incentives, as well as understands the crucial connections between product, engineering, design, and other parts of the business.
* This was improving over time, but compensation decisions and career growth progress were opaque for a long time
* Communication styles tend towards synchronous, ""meeting-oriented"" culture — this becomes less and less effective in a large, distributed org
* Research and design often had identified problems over a long period of time that didn't seem to get heard"

* If you don't mind occasionally getting paged during dinner, work-life balance for engineers is above average","This company used to provide a valuable service, back when it was hard for restaurants to set up their own online ordering systems. But now it's easy, and the only way Seamless/Grubhub (or a competitor) seems to be able to thrive is by using SEO to inject itself as a middleman into the process--not adding value, just taking a painful cut. And Grubhub's now adopting DoorDash's model where restaurants are added without their consent, leading to terrible experiences with outdated menus and hours. Grubhub loses money on those orders on average, so it's lose-lose-lose for the restaurants, diners, and shareholders--the only point is to create the illusion of growth in order to prop up the stock price. While it's possible Grubhub is still useful in some communities, in major cities it's a net negative at a time when restaurants are in crisis anyway. Working for a company that shouldn't exist is demoralizing to say the least. Restaurants are the main victim here, but the company is fairly open about its willingness to deny pay to drivers for issues that aren't their fault and skirt privacy laws for customers... whatever they can get away with.


The engineering leadership culture is also problematic. The department doesn't solicit or use 360 reviews--there's no real opportunity, formally or informally, for employees to give feedback on their managers. So while most of the managers (and directors, and VPs) are perfectly fine, jerks are also able to thrive--there's minimal consequence for being abusive to your direct and indirect reports, even when they quit (or request transfers) in droves as a result. Concerns cannot safely be taken to one's manager or to HR--they're simply relayed, without anonymization, to the person in question, and despite company policy there is no actual protection against retaliation. Not everybody in tech has to deal with the bullies all that much, but their spheres of influence seem like they will keep growing, and poisoning the rest of the culture. Perhaps as a result, communication about compensation has tended to be highly misleading."
529,Grubhub,Happy so far but wanted more training!,2020-04-07,5.0,Account Advisor,"Benefits are great, people are really friendly, great company culture, job is pretty involved/not super monotonous.","Account Advisor training and Sales training were combined so I didn't get a lot of specifics related to my role when in the group -- I wanted more training specific to my role that wasn't just shadowing (what I was watching others do didn't make sense to me yet).

I came in being a top performer at my last sales job, I have the skills and me-and the entire office for that matter- have been barely getting more than a couple signs. It’s all about luck with the area here, not your ability to sell. People have started to drop off like flies at this office—either leaving because they can’t take it anymore and move to better companies or because they got stuck in a couple bad territories and get fired. Every day you come in someone new is gone. This has lead to them recruiting in the area HEAVILY. I even get people contacting me about the job and I already work here.

Benefits - Health, dental, vision, life, critical illness, all covered, and reasonably priced. I was finally able to cover myself AND my wife and it doesn't cost a fortune.

People - Grubhub has a habit, or maybe a skill, for only hiring like minded positive people that are energetic and eager about their job, people who WANT to be here and add a positive vibe to every interaction.

Management - The management here, on EVERY level, is constantly moving forward and looking out for the employee's best interest. They care about their staff, they live by the adage ""happy staff produces results"" and they take care of us.

Work/Life Balance - I come from an industry where this concept doesn't exist, and here at Grubhub I'm actually instructed that keeping the balance is a part of my job. I actually get time with my friends and loved ones, and it doesn't hinder my ability to get my job done.

Room to Grow - In a company that favors and encourages creative thinking and collaboration, you're free to grow ideas, move toward big and small goals, and you're encouraged to think critically about how things are done and how to improve.","I can't think of a single thing wrong.

-Fun activities","Support was very fun in the beginning and it was nice to hang out with co-workers but then it became super cliquey and it was one team vs the other. Management changed after the acquisition with LevelUp and they began to micromanage EVERYTHING. How long you went to the bathroom, if you were doing tickets every single second etc. The list can be endless. They truly did not care to promote you or help you if they were not your friend- people were there less than a year and would became team leads just because they had help from all their friends in tickets and everything you could think of. People left the company, especially in support, due to this. If you want to work in an environment where everyone knows your personal business and gossip about everything- this is your place. Other than that, expect to be questioned about everything and sacrifice your vacation time for other people. Oh, they also pretty much forced many people to quit because they didn't like them and reported everything to HR. Who really needs to be reported are the managers that sleep with their employees or those that favor some to others.

It's toxic to work here, trust me."

They want you to sign up 12 restaurants a month and claim you get around $300 each restaurant you sign up.  Heres the catch: they put you in some random small town in the middle of nowhere with no restaurants, or an area that most places are already signed up. You are just calling places that don't even speak English and YELL at you and tell you never to call again.  Another catch: in order to get your $300 per place you sign up THEY the restaurant have to stay active for 3 months on the Grubhub app. Then you get paid. And the restaurant always wants to back out and cancel before and they tell you to LIE to them and say oh it takes 3 months for people to start to really come through on our app. Which is another lie. It's super shady. All they want you to do is lie to peoples HARD EARNED MONEY AND BUSINESS to get a sale. It's disgusting.

They also pay you around $30,000 a year.  They say oh you can get all this extra money and make $60,000-$80,000 a year if you sign up all these restaurants. But they have to stay active for 3 months, BUT you get fired within 3-4 months not even if you don't hit your quota which people never do. So they get away with paying people 30K a year to get new places signed up. So it's a smart system for them and cheap labor."

This company is full of petty individuals that will set you up to get fired.  This place is a cult.  They want you to smile while they are messing you over and not complain about it.  There used to be parking lot meetings where employees could address concerns and give feedback.  Management and higher ups were never prepared to answer questions and would easily get rattled.  The end result was them taking those meetings away.  They said too many people were complaining.  Gee I wonder why.  Could it be the disgusting way you talk to employees? Changing their schedules with a week's notice? Taking away overtime when being hired you stated overtime would always be available? Most of us don't have the luxury of getting salary. Could it be stalking people around the office? Having managers sleeping with and blackmailing employees? Maybe it's managers going on vacation for the 7th time in a year leaving noone to approve someone's pto and then try and write them up for not getting pto approved.  Telling employees they can't even touch their personal phones even though it's not an actual company policy,  it's nowhere in employee handbook.

If the people weren’t so great to work alongside - everyone’s tenure would be at least a year or two shorter. 

The Chicago office space is nice and there are great areas to collaborate or work in silence, but unfortunately more than half the workforce is extremely immature (the Sales team should essentially rebrand to Phi Kappa Grubhub since it’s a perpetual frat house environment) and areas are quickly stained, equipment is broken, or they are just generally treated like a personal living room. 

The $30 weekly credit is nice, but that only was introduced because someone finally told the CEO he is out of touch and everyone is miserable.","It’s the same old problems day in and day out. It’s arguably more exhausting and mentally draining than working over 40 hours at a structured company with clear strategic goals. How many times can people voice concerns or respond to an engagement survey with concerns on communication, development, and middle management? The action plans never get to the root of the issue and they always lose momentum  after an initial shoutout in an immature companywide Slack channel. 

In general - nothing is done well with the exception of the tech & Product world. For a tech company - we move fast, but definitely not as fast or as effectively as other tech companies. 

If it were a year ago, this review would’ve been much more positive but too many great leaders have left the company. Leaders that actually took the time to know what was going on with their employees and proactively tried to solve problems. They’ve been replaced with leaders with unbearable egos that spend too much time gossiping in their pastel colored button downs than actually leading. 

I don’t know how my opinion of the CEO would improve because he’s never in the office."

617,Grubhub,Stay away,2019-08-15,1.0,Restaurant Sales Executive,There's snacks i guess and you get 30 a week in grubhub dollars to spend on grubhub. It basically buys you 1.5 lunches a week.,"#1 the training you receive is hot garbage. It is completely useless and does not set you up for success

#2 the pay is absolute trash. I am one of the top reps in the entire office and i don't even break 6 figures. You can make a lot more money in a lot of other sales jobs. You get 32k a year base and the commission is garbage!! You work very hard for not a lot of serious reward. You should honestly work somewhere else.

#3 the attrition rate is insane of the 18 people i was hired on with only 1 other person is left. Last week alone i personally know of at least 8 people who were fired last week. Our sales team is maybe 40 people. Most people are looking for other opportunities and when you look around the sales floor, a lot of the time its quite and its empty. Theyll give you the line that theyre looking to expand and that they should grow to such and such number, yeah thats a pipe dream.

#4 a lot of the management has no idea what they are doing, and a lot of them are extremely immature. This is a perfect example of how not to be when you're in charge.

#5 people are always beating on these stupid drums every time they close a sale and they're yelling. Some people like it, but to me it's extremely annoying, distracting, and it's embarassing when youre on the phone with a potential client. This is more of my personal opinion, a good amount of people use it as their motivation, but i could care less if anyone even knows i have a go live.

#6 the territories you get can make or break you! I have had great territories and ive had bad ones. They change every 3 months! So if you get a bad one, and youre just starting out, you may as well kiss your job good by buddy. They rate all of them equally, so it makes it very difficult sometimes. 

#7 the managers are always stuck in useless meetings that are not beneficial for their teams. They do not have enough time in the day to develop their new people so they end up failing and getting fired."

Work/Life Balance","The corporate organization is a sinking ship. The Field Sales team was once a fun team to be a part of, selling a competitive product that our target market needed.  Our team consisted of reps all over the country and management at the time was really good at making sure we were all engaged and encouraged communication, and collaboration. 

 Towards the end of 2018 things started getting really shady. Our job function changed, compensation changed, the product we sold changed and expectations became increasingly unattainable.  Communication was non existent to the point that we had to ask what our goals would be each month and what we were getting paid. Once the good leaders started leaving I took that as my cue to leave. I quickly saw where it was heading. The manager that stayed was the exact opposite of the one who left. Communication with our peers was actually forbidden, meetings cancelled, 1:1's would be cancelled or just never happened with no explanation and the compensation was insulting. This organization will drain the life out of you. It's a toxic environment that needs a complete overhaul. I can't speak for other organizations at Grubhub, but as for the corporate space, it's a NO!"

Leadership-  Poor overall just poor.  It finally took Grubhub some time and realized that having two tyrant leaders manage the care department into the ground.  Many leaders have left to seek better opportunities where companies value their opinion and they are treated & compensated fairly.

Communication- Poor.  It really was sad that a company this large does not communicate across departments.  There were countless of times when I would find out about a new update from product the day before it launched.  Then my expectation was to create a training in just one day to be used by not only the Care GH employees but our partner agents as well?  I would say that the month of December was horrible for me.  My peer and I were given an unrealistic goal of re-writing the entire Customer Care Training in just one month.  Mind this you this consisted of about 30 modules.  We each averaged a module-two a day.  

Culture- Ok but please GH, EDUCATE your other departments about Care.  It really hurts when you pour your soul into a company and the department just to hear other departments call you lazy, incompetent and overall not needed.  There were countless of times at LPF's (GH sponsored social events) that non-Care employees would make comments about my department.  In one instance I told a salesperson that they should really visit us and work a shift in Care to really appreciate what we do for the company! This was ONE major reason why I left.  I really did not like that GH would ignore this and turn a blind eye.  This is another reason why you are losing good employees here.  Also, to try to get out of Care was a nightmare.  Just trying to interview for other positions outside of Care felt like you were at a disadvantage because you worked in that department. For a company who values development, they really are lacking in the empowerment for Care."

Matt's email re: the 2016 election made me feel safe. Matt seems genuinely interested in his staff and is very visible.","Upper management lacks any emotional intelligence. They do not care about any of their employees or their development. My boss continued to get development opportunities and left our team floundering. On top of that, our team was without a manager for four months before hiring someone who has no experience in a call center or tech company. Managers frequently pass other, lower level employees work off as their own. My last year was miserable due to the fact that members of my team left, and no one replaced them for months, and still weren't replaced upon my time ending there.

Compensation is a joke, in which I did not receive a raise for 3 years, instead getting RSUs which were worth nothing by the end of my employment and created more of a tax liability for me. When approaching my manager about this, they were surprised and said they would do something about this. Upon talking to other members of my team, this was the reaction that was given to everyone, so it really wasn't a surprise, it was just blatant inaction.

Sales and tech teams are completely unapproachable, rude, and in often cases drunk. Alcohol flows through these teams like it's water. The sales/tech division is one big frat party that treats the office like it's a playground. They do not prioritize their work, often delaying deployment of products for months, sometimes years, and then pushing out a rush product with no regard for any other team's work load or deadline. Example: product launches would happen without any notice, causing multiple teams to scramble to document it's go live.

HR is also very unapproachable and moves slowly to correct issues that are raised. An abusive manager was allowed to work at the company for long after complaints were escalated, and then when said manager retaliated, no action was taken. Homophobic remarks were made to me by management and little if any action was taken.

This company treats it's employees like it's publicly traded, but treats it's customers like it's a start up. Their ""values"" have not scaled with the company's growth and still behaves like it's one big party.  There is no trajectory for what the company wants to become, there is no investment in it's people. Attrition is alarmingly high.

GrubHub will fail if it continues to pour money into growing rather than investing in strengthening it's internal teams. Abusive employees, no matter how effective at their role, need to be removed. Competency needs to be questioned with members of management."

3. The work environment can be a bit chaotic. You have your good agents then the really bad ones. There is really none in between.  
4. The rules and policies kept constantly either how you spoke on the phone, various things on the back end, or just a work-flow policy.
5. Not one single lead would ever be on the same page and it all just got confusing. 
6. It really seemed as I was a machine tied to my desk. 
7. Leads and managers have their prized people and they make sure you know it.

GH is a good company,"You are treated as a temp worker, not a FT employee. No access to all the amenities that GH offers. Management plays favoritism. You are micro managed to an extreme level.

I work with multiple departments and everyone I've worked with is always willing to help and contribute as you need. So overall it's a positive work environment.

The unlimited vacation is wonderful and we are able to take advantage of it. Although I hear that this is really dependent on the team you're on.

They do a lot of promotion from within and I feel that there are a lot of opportunities to grow here.","Stock is not doing well and rather than giving you more base pay for raises, they give you stock shares. However, they don't vest for a year so they're stringing you along to keep you.

With a PATHETIC maternity leave policy (it's less than 3 WEEKS), they are putting many women between a rock and a hard place. For those that are looking to have a family, they decide between dealing with a poor maternity leave policy (they can take short term on top of that but 2 weeks is shameful) so they don't lose their stock options which haven't vested yet or they leave the company to find somewhere else that has a more progressive and thoughtful maternity policy and lose that money.

They purport to be a progressive, forward-thinking company with initiatives like RestaurantHER but that's all superficial. If they actually cared about women, they would start by making sure that the women at their own company were represented fairly.

C-suite doesn't seem to be interested in actually hearing from their employees. There's no system set up to provide anonymous feedback and while we do have a monthly townhall, there has never been a Q&A.

There's no clear structure laid out for promotion. It's not clear what an employee needs to accomplish in order to move to the next level. Along with this, job titles /levels are not the same across different departments or even different teams within the same department. On top of that, the timeline to be promoted is excessively long."

This place is quite literally a sinking ship, competitors seem to have figured this out as well and DoorDash is now leading in market share. The CEO Matt and his sidekick Adam (CFO) are running the place straight into the ground. Their egos have clouded their ability to make sound decisions by hiring Senior Leadership equivalent to a bunch of conceited frat boys. The culture is driven by this new leadership whom are outwardly disrespectful to lower ranking employees and continue to push female employees out of positions of power. Adam drives the ship and stands behind an HR department that prefers to let talent go over addressing countless complaints against leadership. Don’t be fooled by their offers of RSU, the stock has and will likely continue to tank as leadership has no vision and competition continues to grow. Run, don’t walk away from this place!"

I loved going into the lunchroom and getting a can or two of sparkling water from the machine without needing a coin.,Training is only as good as the trainer. The charming trainer seemed to think I was too old to waste time teaching. Right behind the HR tape on forbidden behavior the trainers predatory behavior began. It was meant to distract from the trainers ineptness at teaching an older worker. The trainer never once asked what would help me succeed. The last day after being the trainers toy for 3 weeks the trainer made a sexual gesture. In hindsight and several postings on social media I suspect it was done to entrap. Never in my years have I witnessed or experienced the trainers inappropriate behavior. I was caught off guard.  Training and HR are interconnected. My decision to not go to HR was spot on. HR corrupt to the core would protect this charming trainer .  A new hire: who are you gonna tell and who is gonna believe you. I should have nailed the trainer the first time. After that it felt like I would only alarm the trainer. And soon after the behavior seemed normalized....but then in true predatory fashion  escalated to a sexual gesture. The three weeks I was distracted and affected. I could not sleep and the second week forward everytime I ate I got sick. I stopped eating. I was sweeped up in the trainers abuse of power. I was traumatized.It took months of therapy to feel me again.  So older worker no matter how happy you are about landing this job be very guarded. Beware of empty smiles.

Pretty decent stock options but the trick is putting up with the internal drama long enough to see them vest.,"Expectations are constantly changing so if you can't keep up with their ridiculous new monthly demands you can lose out on a lot of the bonus money that should just be integrated into your regular pay. Some of the most disgusting favoritism I've ever witnessed within a company. You'll watch friends of management or directors old coworkers/friends get hired and then three months later said friend/old coworker is getting chosen for roles that veteran employees of 5+ years got turned down for. For how big and thriving the company feels they are beyond cheap. Senior specialists getting paid wayyyy lower than 90% of competitive companies start out new employees. The pay rate for senior specialists (my old role) is not on par with the work load what-so-ever. Micromanagement by managers and assistant managers that start to deteriorate your mental health. They breathe down your neck so much, so often, every shift I would walk through the doors of the building absolutely dreading what was yet to come. Most long term reps I started with back in 2014 have either been run out of the company or voluntarily escaped as fast as they could (myself included in the later. I thankfully was able to escape in early Feb 2019 after 4 years). Another unfortunate aspect of this company is that you rarely see people of color, women, or minorities in general in higher roles than management. A lot of the vp/director positions are just white men..maybe one random white woman thrown in there."

-I work as a full-time outside office employee","The job is stressful. Rules are constantly changing and responsibilities shift around quite frequently.  You have to rely heavily on other people and departments to do their job efficiently to hit quota, which is a rare occurance. As an outside employee, working out of my home office is a huge plus, but we definitely get forgotten about all the time. Don't expect to be flown into HQ for the large company celebrations, or be given any sort of allowance when the rest of your team in Chicago gets treated to a happy hour or dinner.  But working in-house seems extremely difficult and distracting honestly. The open floor plan and no cubical walls leaves reps talking over one another and fighting to hear restaurants over the phone. It resembles a packed cold call center. ""Smile and Dial"" is a reoccurring phrase. Dress code is ridiculously casual. No professionalism whatsoever. Want to wear your pajamas to work? How about sweats and a skimpy tank? Anything goes at Grubhub! Definitely feels like a college classroom at times, though you definitely don't need a college degree to do this job. Upper management and C Suite is obviously so far removed that they are unaware of what really goes on on the sales floor. Calling disinterested, busy restaurant owners all day convincing them that providing their food at basically a lower price is going to be profitable for them isn't exactly pleasurable. Get ready to be constantly hung up on and constantly yelled at and/or lied to about wanting to sign up and then ghost you. C Suite: ""Wow you guys really killed it last year with the amount of restaurants you practically killed yourself over to sign up. This year, let's increase sign ups by 70%! You can do it *winks*"" Oh ALSO don't expect to be promoted. I'm talking remote or in-house. Talent leaves constantly because open positions are given to outside applicants. Job development structure is seriously lacking and most managers are in their early 20s and have hardly any experience in team development whatsoever."

What’s left is nothing but insecure people who look to curry favor with either the CEO (Matt Maloney) or CFO (Adam DeWitt). 

If you’ve ever had the (dis)pleasure of interacting with either of them, you’ll find them to be some of the most conceited and arrogant men around.  The lack of regard for any opinions other than their own is frightening to say the least.

They care about nothing except the value of their stock, and suffer from wanting to appear like they know everything... when in reality, they are so far removed from the real business and organization, they are strangers in their own building.

They have cultivated the behavior in the levels below where everyone strives to win their approval without consideration for others or what is truly best for the company.

A new development is a strong lack of diversity at the leadership level - how many non-white males are left at the VP and above?  If you audit - how many VP+ females have left in the past few months?"

There’s little to no incentive to perform beyond baseline expectations which seem to be ever-increasing while department-wide wages remain flat. Morale is visibly low.

Nice people
A product that benefits restaurants as long a Grubhub hires enough drivers","The environment- the people are nice, but you don’t really fit in unless you’re a part of the youth partying/drinking culture. During a sales event, which was basically drinking until you’re drunk, I expressed that I did not want to drink and was then pressured by my manager to drink. She told me if I didn’t I would have to sit alone in the office while everyone got off an hour early, which is beyond messed up. 

The management- following the last con, the management is a mess and they it really doesn’t care about you as an individual employee.  Whenever something unexpected happens, which happens a lot, I have to track down my manager repeatedly remind them of the problem and once they decide to confront the problem they have to do the same thing to their managers. This usually takes a day or two while my customers are angry at me and I’m the one getting yelled at. 

Treatment- as I mentioned earlier management doesn’t care. People come in and out of this job faster than any company I’ve seen. And this really isn’t even due to the fact that the job is hard, its just that Grubhub’s solution to a bad territory is throwing a bunch of sales people at it until they finally either give up or find other solutions. This usually causes plenty of people to miss commissions, which ends up in termination or most of the time, employees quitting out of frustration. 

Verdict- I would only take the sales position here if you’re either comfortable in that frat/party environment or using this job as a stepping stone/temporary job as you look for something better."

- Grubhub leadership has shown an unmatched capacity and desire to engage with all levels of the organization. I've heard their ideas about where the organization is going, what they see as our long term challenges, and generally what keeps them excited about our company. That energy resonates throughout. 

- My coworkers are smart, passionate, and love food! Exactly the type of people I want to be around. 

- Work/life balance is a priority here. No one expects you to answer an email after hours. All you have to do is get your work done - the company is very flexible about the rest of the details.

Leads are very helpful. Opportunity to move around in the company.,"Grubhub outsourced the Customer Care position to a couple of third party companies located in New Mexico. Majority of The Customer Care Agents lack the ability to communicate effectively due to the fact that they don't really speak English. Which makes it very hard for other departments to collaborate with them. Many times they receive calls they can handle without transferring, however they lack the basic skills and knowledge to solve a typical customer issue. Whether it's a customer, restaurant or driver. There have been times they transferred a call and the customer is screaming because they had to explain an issue to someone who doesn't speak English and now have to explain it all over again after being transferring which leads to hostile callers and escalations. Customer Care in New Mexico also cause Grubhub to lose a lot of money. Instead of looking for effective resolutions that will keep the customer satisfied and the company from going bankrupt, they always decide to give customers full refunds on top of a  huge discount for their next meal. It isn't out of the ordinary for customer care to cancel an order thats 5 minutes late and giving that customer a 25 dollar discount code on top of refunding them and making Grubhub pay the restaurant."

– Peer-level willingness to try new processes, collaborate
– Dedicated research team","This company has made smart acquisitions and partnerships as a first-mover, which increase its revenue, value, and appeal. But inside, it was incredibly damaging for those of us who wanted to collaborate and solve for real problems beneath leaders who didn’t know how or want to do either of those things.

Despite high turnover, an inability to deliver basic features after spending years on them, re-building features on the same platform, and knowledge of bullying and harassment, the company has not made changes in leadership where it matters and instead has gone through its regular 1.5-year cadence of re-org and shifting to hide the damage (and protect those responsible because they have trouble hiring to replace them).

There is zero accountability because the ability to safely give feedback about your boss no longer exists. Execs only seek input from directors, a few of which are sycophants and prone to gossip.

In Product (product, ux research, design), many leaders are devoid of soft skills, don’t foster growth, and don’t understand employees’ skill sets. Some seemed to have no qualifications for their position, whatsoever. Initially I empathized over the pressure they faced and their learning curve as the company scaled rapidly. But, true personalities came out with that pressure. 

At least three leaders hid insecurities by: not letting their teams make decisions, hiding their day-to-day activities or withholding information, preventing team discussion by pushing conversation into 1:1s, blaming their team for their own backfired decisions, creating false feedback as a punishment mechanism, and firing or running out those who challenged them.

It is the luck of the draw if you join. There are a few good leaders who don’t breed this toxicity. In my opinion, these leaders were still too passive to call out the damage being done by others.

Problems exist beyond leadership. PM waste endless hours filing regression bugs (there is no real QA team). Simple changes are blocked by cross-team dysfunction. Finance often blocked delivery due to meaningless metrics. The Design org has struggled as subservient to Product leadership, who easily micro-manage design work because of the top-down approach and a lack of advocacy for design as an equal contributor. Positions for senior design leadership remain unfilled for years. Many designers and product people never saw work delivered, anyway, due to a shortage of engineers and inability of the company to prioritize."

Previously, I had worked at a much smaller start-up, and GH seemed like a good middle ground between a cool start-up and a corporate gig. GH has been able to maintain some good start-up qualities, I feel totally comfortable speaking up and contributing in meetings without fear of speaking out of turn, ect. In general people seem to have a good work-life balance and everyone I have met is pretty cool. Actually, I have yet to meet anyone who I would consider a big jerk. Also, these people love food. You will be fed.","On-boarding beyond the orientation is defined by department, so it is up to your team to get you acclimated to the company. It is a missive place if you are coming from a small company, and it can feel overwhelming."

(pantry stocked w/ drinks, snacks, cereal, etc, catered Fridays, $18 Grubhub spend every week, which is about 1 meal. Would be nice to have another days worth). Meet new people during lunch eating together. Everyone is nice.
Work-life balance and laid back environment. I came from a dog-eat-dog env w/ long work hours and this is far from it.
Women engineers, leads, and senior management, BUT the NY office needs more diversity!! (idk much about the other branches)
Paid conferences and a desire to have engineers present.
No issues w/ hardware (laptop, monitors, standing desk, mouse, etc). If you need something, ask for it you'll have it in a couple minutes.","Code reviews can be really meticulous... to a point that I think is ridiculous. This may not be a con for you, but the code is clean. I feel like that can still be achieved w/o this level of nitpicking.

Teams are siloed. I like to work on a breadth of problems from ops to sre to typical engineer work (startup env). You won't do that here, but there is a set of tools to do what you may need. You can also propose a feature and offer to implement it yourself.

Hierarchical."

Ever since switching to grubhub from yelp Eat24 has slowly just been burnt out and going away. The Eat24 website and app are a joke, it’s just Grubhub with a different name, same restaurants and pricing there is no difference, they just kept the name for the incompetent customers that think they’re different. 
-GH started riding the managers so hard they went from some of the best people I’ve worked with to literally walking around stalking people’s shoulders yelling at them for not grabbing work within 5 seconds of it pulling up on your screen. 
-Constantly having useless meetings about things that don’t even have anything to do with Customer Support. 
-GH has no clue about anything on the “Eat24 Legacy” side of things, trying to apply rules to the severally understaffed side. 
-They’re unwilling to hire on the old platform but let you know everyday how they’ve hired 10 NEW REPS IN CHICAGO! 
- Floors Managers till talk with their favorites and be loud and obnoxious just to stop and tell someone else who’s constistantly working that they aren’t doing enough. 
- No matter how many orders or calls or chats you take they expect you to take more, while others do less. They know you’ll handle more work and will let others slack and not bother with them as their seen as a lost cause. 
Oh was there an issue with something only YOUR manager has access to? Well NO OTHER MANAGER CAN HELP YOU. 
Need to change your hours? That’s not possible cause they’re too short staffed, but don’t worry, the person that sits in front of you will get their schedule changed noooo problem.

The management team is so supportive and very trusting in their direct reports.  I never feel micro-managed but rather left to do what I need to but with their full support when I need it.

866,Grubhub,"Rapidly growing company, opportunity to make an impact",2017-07-31,5.0,Vice President,"I started at Grubhub 3 months ago. I ended up relocating to Chicago after 13 years in another city; I was THAT excited about the opportunity and the people. Here's why I joined:
- Absolutely brilliant, authentic people. Positive culture. 
- The business is growing explosively fast, these guys have been knocking it out of the park; plus their market (online food delivery) is itself growing rapidly.
- There's still so much low hanging fruit... So it's relatively easy to make an impact. 
- A feeling of a startup remains: everyone's obsessed with action, launching things fast, learning, making it better for our various customers. This is remarakable for a $4B public company. 
- Very little politics, internal backstabbing. People genuinely want to help each other.","- Lack of focus. If everything is a priority, nothing is a priority. We need to do a better job saying ""no"" - so we can concentrate on the most impactful stuff. 
- Departmental alignment. We need to find better ways to collaborate between groups - cross-group prioritization will help. This is a normal growing pain of a startup that is undergoing explosive growth... We've got to pay attention to it, though!
- US-only business. I came from a company that had strong international presence, and with it, a myriad of interesting, diverse problems. Grubhub is yet to go after that whole space - there are very entrenched competitors out there by now."
867,Grubhub,UghHub,2017-07-19,2.0,Data Ops,"- Espresso machines are replaced approx. every 6 months with newer, nicer ones that probably cost the same as many paychecks
- There are like 9 fancy flavored water machines
- La Croix stocked in fridge
- Pretty much free to make your own hours as long as you get your work done","- Managers only care about numbers, not their employees
- Burnout
- Unfair compensation (across similar roles, across department, just in general)
- Ping Pong tables and other Band-Aids to lull people into complacency (see: Espresso, Water Machines in Pros)
- Little growth"

Nice office space (I've only been to the ones in NY and CHI, but they are really nice)
Decent/Good leaders in marketing and operations
Clear market leader","Huge lack of real leadership on the technology side (product and engineering)
Starts at the top (CTO is by far the worst I have seen and should not have been a VP, let alone a C-suite member)
No alignment - teams cross functionally work together and come up with great solutions only to be overruled by:
POLITICS within product and engineering, where it is clear that the CTO cares only about saving face and looking capable, only encouraged by the head of product who has some sort of past relationship with her and won't stand up to anything she says... Wake up - the shenanigans are obvious to everyone."

880,Grubhub,Food Delivery Company Needs More Snacks,2017-05-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Friendly People, Good name recognition in Chicago, some of the office is fancy",Communication could use some work and you always kind of feel like the execs and senior level managers are one foot out the door so its hard to get behind the mission of the company. there have been some questionable decisions in the past few years and it seems like no one in management positions really knows what they're doing but just blindly throwing people and money at the problem and hoping that it goes away
881,Grubhub,Customer Service Lead,2017-05-16,2.0,Customer Service Lead,You can work a ton of overtime because they're always short handed.,The company treats customer service like crap. The rest of the company is openly treated better and given more privileges. There is no development provided for leads but then told that they don't qualify for a promotion. Leads carry all the weight while managers pretend to be busy. Outside managers are brought in so you're completely discouraged from the potential of being promoted. Then when outside managers were a bust so they promoted from within and paid internals almost half of what externals were making. This is ideal for a first job out of high school so you can smarten up and realize you want a better life.

893,Grubhub,Getting better all the time,2017-03-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall Grubhub has been a good place to work and is getting progressively better. The company has been transitioning from a startup and growing into a larger company, but is doing a pretty good job of staying nimble and not getting bogged down in too much bureaucracy. The executive team is relatively inexperienced but solid and getting better over time. It's inspiring that half of the C-level roles are filled by women and has a progressive environment.  

- Interesting work in a dynamic market that will remain in a high growth phase for the foreseeable future.
- Product, Design & Engineering are able to move more quickly with leaner teams than I have seen elsewhere.
- Quality of coworkers is above industry average, and many would be successful at large tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Some recent hires and people brought in through acquisitions have also been raising the overall talent level. 
- Compensation is competitive, and the stock grants are especially generous.
- Work life balance is reasonable. People work hard and focus on results but aren't pressured to work around the clock.
- Having an assigned HR business partner and a more legit annual review process is a recent improvement.
- The office has lots of friendly people and has the atmosphere of a winning team","There have been some growing pains as the company matures. 

- Leadership remains shaky in a few areas, although recent additions will help. 
- Turnover is too high in a few orgs, more than can be explained away by a hot market.
- Some processes such as the interviewing/hiring process aren't mature.
- A few executives make flippant comments in meetings that don't belong in an otherwise professional environment."

Despite the fact that they planned this for months, they only gave the employees 3 weeks to figure out what they were going to do since their positions were being eliminated. 
TERRIBLE METRICS. The minimum amount of work that is supposed to be done is unattainable. The ""bonuses"" shouldn't even be thought of. They really aren't attainable.

4. All of the above leading to lack of recognition for all the hard-work done."
956,Grubhub,Opaque and Adversarial,2016-07-31,2.0,,"What GrubHub does is fascinating.  It's hard not to take extreme pride in helping restaurants get more business and make it easier for people to find and order food.  No matter where you worked, you can very easily observe how your work contributed to the end product.  A lot of the people, in all parts of the organization, are extremely enthusiastic and are constantly looking for ways to improve how they can contribute more.

On top of that, there are tons of areas that you can work in regardless of your interest on both the technology and business operations side of things.  Upon wrapping up one project, it wasn't uncommon to join another project to support another area.","Joining the company, all facets of the organization were in transition, from dealing with leadership change as a result of the merger, expanding into new business operations, and just overall headcount growth.

Even though, functionally, the different areas of product development were always siloed, the camaraderie of ""we're in this together"" slowly faded away.  The general interactions between teams became more adversarial, as if one was truly more important than the other.  Rather than celebrating achievements together, it became an arms race in who can tout their goals more loudly than the other. 

Attitudes shifted as well as people started name-dropping members of upper management as a baseless leverage tactic.  It was getting increasingly irritating to call these bluffs.  Shortly after my departure, people at GrubHub now are, indeed, literally afraid of being on the wrong side of certain managers now.

That's not a very great way to keep people motivated.  On top of that, there was increasingly more ""don't tell anyone else but..."" as if this were going to make people feel better about themselves.  It doesn't.  The opacity in organizational and technological goals is pitch black.  There have been many organizational pivots and they have all happened swiftly."

I'm trusted to do my job and make my own schedule. There is a great energy in the office. I'm very lucky to work with some of the sharpest, most creative people in the game. The people are what makes it what it is!",Free food = freshman fifteen 2.0
961,Grubhub,From best to worst job once Grubhub took over Seamless,2016-07-14,1.0,Marketing Department,"My time at Seamless was an amazing, fostering, supportive, creative and educational environment. I achieved some of the biggest highlights of my career during that time, I worked under the best manager I've ever had, gained some of the most valuable experience in my career, and worked for a company that was beloved by the city I lived in. I was proud to be a part of the team and honored to work there. Then...post-merger...Grubhub began taking control...","Nothing! It's a wonderful place to work and I love it!...yeah, because that sounds like something a human would write. If you're wondering why there are a bunch of 5-star reviews like that on this page, it's because HR began sending out emails telling employees to write 5-star reviews once the walkout happened....and by walkout, I mean, once everyone started aggressively quitting. Here's why: 

First of all, the CEO is an egomaniacal monster who has no value for his employees, whatsoever. Money is the bottom line, for himself. Once appointed as CEO over both Seamless and Grubhub, he began cutting benefits, eliminating staff parties, happy hours and lunches, and even cutting the employee budget when it came to ordering food on our own product. He also actively attempted to snuff out the Seamless brand entirely so that his ""baby"" brand, Grubhub, could ""win out"" in the end...as if was a schoolyard competition and not a beloved service and multi-million dollar business. The Seamless/New York team was devalued abundantly compared to the Chicago/Grubhub team, to the point where blatant favoritism caused inter-office tensions.  And as they saying goes, ""poop"" falls from the top - so when he began replacing upper management, he hired people that fell in line with his beliefs. 

The environment shifted from a place of communication and collaboration to one of uneducated demands and unrealistic expectations. Do what I want regardless of whether or not it makes sense. Nobody was given the tools to do their job correctly, they were just told to do them faster. Any questions asked were met with threats and more demands. Budgets were slashed, employees were brutally fired for trying to help the company succeed and suggesting alternative solutions rather than ""falling in line"" behind blind leaders. Tyrannical leadership insisted on changing the entire beloved look and feel of the brand - stock plummeted, sales weakened, and consumer loyalty dropped off due to lack of rewards, acknowledgement, and cohesive brand messaging. Employees who had worked there for years and had a good understanding of the consumer-base were stripped of their power and responsibilities, and agencies were brought in to do the work of in-house teams. Money was spent irresponsibly and inefficiently. 

One by one, people began quitting (to the point where upper management began ordering those who gave notice not to tell other employees they were leaving in order to 'not affect morale'). And who was hired to replace these people? Usually nobody - work fell on those who stayed. Sometimes they would hire inexperienced, cheap replacements who they would refuse to train (or they just hadn't replaced the position that would normally train them...and never would), so eventually the company turned into the blind leading the blind surrounded by previously effective and enriched employees who were all trying to find new jobs. 

With each bad hire, upper management stubbornly holds up the facade that their candidate is successful in their post, praising them for the accomplishments of others (those who actually work hard, work smart, and execute any/all marketing materials are overlooked and insanely underappreciated) in attempts to create a false understanding that they made good hiring decisions as a means of saving face. It's perception over substance, every single time. In fact, Perception Over Substance should be the new, more accurate, internally representative company slogan...since they hired an agency to craft the nonsensical fluff line currently in use. 

I held on hoping things would go back to the ""old days"" for longer than I should have - then, eventually and intelligently, I jumped. And I couldn't be happier now that I'm out.

I still keep in touch with my few remaining coworkers left there. They are all trying to leave."

964,Grubhub,Avoid like the plague.,2016-07-06,1.0,Marketing Department,"There are a few good people still there but the venomous environment is bringing out the worst side in many. Uncertainty and fear about job security and the future of the company are covered up with forced smiles in a hostile work environment. 

Pre merger and IPO this was an amazing place to work with smart, driven people. Most people who were with the company for more than 2 years have either been forced out (fired without cause “At will”) or left as soon as they could find anything else. Many quit without another job to go to. Total brain drain. 

Unlimited vacations but many are too overworked to use.","The soul of the organization has departed. What’s left is a heartless corporation still clinging to the pretense that it’s a fun, innovative and caring work environment. Quickly went from the best place I’d ever worked to the worst within a year. 

Brown nosing and schmoozing are rewarded rather than hard work and initiative. Senior leadership play favorites to yes men. Individual hunches serve as the rationale for business decisions rather than proven past learnings or logic. Some managers resort to deceptive and cut-throat methods to make themselves look better. Charming and agreeable when anyone more senior is around, then manipulative and aggressive when they are gone. Sadly this behavior seems to work. 

As the workloads increase the timelines and upper management’s empathy decrease. You're expected to do more, faster, and be happier about it.

With so much turnover, everything is in a shambles and valuable information and processes are lost through the revolving door. Think it’ll be different for you and you’ll be able to fix things? It won’t and you can’t. Maybe you’re in another toxic situation and think anything else would be better – I advise you to look elsewhere.

Warning: HR asked staff members to go into Glassdoor and write “more relevant” reviews in response to negative entries. I suspect that many of the positive Glassdoor reviews are a result of that initiative. You be the judge of their authenticity."

What is acceptable for one team is taboo for another. The board should overhaul the entire executive tier, starting with the CEO. He can't be bothered to come to work in the summers anyway. He fires people without cause, relying on fact that he can ,because this is Illinois, and he doesn't need a reason. The CFO is also a horrible human being who needs to be knocked down a few pegs.

Then some more odd things started happening such all but a couple people from recruiting were fired at the same time, just so we could hire someone from Orbitz and he could bring his team.  Time went on and more and all of the sudden those that didn't decide to leave were now being forced out or outright fired (no logical reasons why).  New leadership seems to be targeting anyone who has worked there for multiple years and now is resorting to directly intimidating teams.

-Constant growth at the company that doesn't trickle down to you. General pay increases in my department were about 25 cents. At the same time many of the employees who had been at the company for a long time have left to pursue other opportunities, and when they leave, you are left to pick up the slack until they find replacements. We had a 54 % turnover rate in my department in 2015, including everyone from senior management to reps.

* Despite the size of the company, it does not feel too corporate at all. It feels like a nice balance between a nimble start up and a slow moving company.","No real cons that I've encountered so far, but if I have to pick one this would be it:

* Grubhub credit only applies to orders close to the office. This is barely a con to be honest. As someone who brings lunch to work most days, I'd love to be able to use the Grubhub credit to order lunch on the weekend. However, I get that it's not Grubhub's duty to pay for my food when I'm not at work, so this is not a big deal at all."

Inability to set a clear strategic vision for company which leads to significant waste of capital resources, time and employee morale in the hot pursuit of endless ""emergencies"" and ""reprioritzation"".

They sweat you for EVERY minute. It's pretty pathetic for a company worth 1.72 BILLION dollars to do that to us.
They also dangle the carrot of a bonus before us but then they do everything possible to make sure we don't get it. They base your ability to get the bonus on your acceptance of the orders that you're sent but they don't have their app set up for you to be able to hear if you're getting an offer if you're talking on the phone. Therefore, I can work a 12 1/2 hour day and if I need to make or answer a quick phone call and that causes me to miss and offer, it lowers my acceptance rate and then not only am I not eligible for the bonus at the end of the week, I might not get paid the guaranteed minimum for the day as well. I have first hand information that they have the ability to create an app in which you are able to hear an offer even if you're talking on the phone.
Another thing that may cause you to miss the opportunity to accept an offer is if there's a glitch in the app. That happened to me one time. So I called in and I was reassigned the exact same offer that I had missed but at the end of the day because I had so few offers for the day, I got paid a third of what I should have gotten paid for the whole day!"

No matter how hard you try, no amount of experience or hard work, you have to meet a certain number to be considered a valued employee. That's what we feel. Things are unbalanced and unfair. Seasoned employees get the shaft & are often overlooked because they are seasoned and not part of the favorite group of lazy workers who rather play games on their phone/facebook, etc. They celebrate & reward the new employees who have yet to tarnish their records by giving them gifts and free lunches while the people who have been there for a while, who have bit of a tarnished record (calling out sick, being late, forgetting a period in a sentance), are looked past. You only get promoted/given bonuses/offered better shifts/and MUCH MORE, only IF your score is high enough. Promoted by a score and not your hard work, dedication & experience, is sad, but GREAT way to demoralize their workers. They promote job growth, but you need a certain number to be considered. The wrong people are being promoted & awarded. They are losing good, hard working employees by putting us ALL on the same plain and to reach for a goal that is almost impossible to reach. You are graded on quality and quantity. It's painful to watch a once great company that cared for their employees, get greedy & not care for their employees as much as they claim.

Tremendous work environment, beautiful culture, and the employees, the talent, and the leadership all shared equal parts in the experience. You could feel the energy and excitement each day between the products and campaigns being produced. GrubHub still provides some free food here and there, and little events to try and improve office culture. But, the rapid growth of the company (we have completely run out of office space) and the hiring of 5-10 ppl a week, the closeness of the company that made it feel like family has dwindled and it operates more like a well-oiled corporate machine. They have recently gone to unlimited vacation days pending manager approval.","Since multiple transitions, and natural growing pains, the rapid expansion continues to bring in top talent, but the ability to foster a fun and family oriented work environment is long gone. Due to the company size, the ability to throw more activities and parties have become sparce and confidence in some of the leadership isn't consistent (this varies per employee and department of course)."

I was only challenged in my job when I was pushed to my limit without my leaders realizing how much they were really asking. When I came in, it was a mess, and it was essentially my job to create a system for the program I worked on. 
It was constantly about pleasing the upper management who never actually worked with us, only demanded more. We were treated expendable and I felt, even as a full-timer, that our team would be cut any day. I never received valuable feedback or coaching, my leaders just occasionally checked in that I wasn't too burned out.

Product Team (ie the team responsible for maintaining and innovating the website) is terribly disorganized, mismanaged, and over-rewarded despite minimal contributions, and two royally massive screwups (including the famed disastrous relaunch of Seamless.com). 

There's also blatant favoritism towards the Grubhub / Chicago side of the company. 

The CEO tried to run Seamless into the ground and everyone in NY was aware of it. 

Grubhub management put in charge ahead of Seamless' management, site restructuring with Grubhub as a priority (the main reason for the site relaunch fiasco), hiring in Chicago over NY, forcing NY people out by hiring people to be their bosses, but they're in Chicago, trying to run and position Seamless as an 'authentic new york' brand when the management isn't even in New York."

This led to increasing levels of bureaucracy, blatant favoritism and extremely high turnover.

 Employees went from feeling valued to being instantly replaceable in the blink of an eye. Managers got promoted by schmoozing the right folks, and not because they could lead and inspire people. Departures were quick and kept deliberately low key, so morale wouldn't topple even further. News flash: it's too late. 

Company policies change arbitrary based on the whims of executives, and HR's job is to make sure employees don't make a peep. Executives lack direction, making employees feel misled and cheated.

The culture, the way the managers treat you, The constant Quality Assurance meetings to tell you how bad you sound on the phone. There was no incentive to work there. No advancement unless you are liked by the higher ups. Regardless of your skills. If you represent the look they want for their brand, then they will give you a promotion. No one ever gets promoted who deserved it and if they do, it takes years to get there. Promotions either happen due to luck or popularity contest.  The yearly reviews are the worst.

1058,Grubhub,"Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Job",2015-04-19,1.0,Sales Fulfillment Specialist,"Nights and weekends off (unless you work in customer service, the largest dept in the company). 
Decent amount of paid time off. 
Casual dress. 
Stock Options - Only good if you were hired in 2013 or earlier. No longer a benefit.","Where to start? 
Be ready to take verbal abuse from Sales Reps and be told to break the rules and protocols for your job just to ""push things through"". Our main job, (we've taken on so many it's hard to keep track sometimes) is to process new restaurant sign up contracts from Sales Reps. It's a lot of virtual paperwork, editing, data entry, and customer service as we have to be a liaison between multiple depts to get these new restaurants live on the site. We also have to communicate with restaurant owners about their menu, missing information that sales people forget to gather, and setting them live on the website. Keeping all that in mind - when sales reps get angry that things aren't being done fast enough or you're not allowing a contract to be completed because vital information is missing, you will take a lot of crap from people who you don't even work for. You will tell your boss about it, and nothing will come of it because he has no power over the sales dept, and HIS boss doesn't care about your concerns, and the cycle will continue. It's not an easy job to balance everything and put up with very strong personalities to begin with, not to mention...

You will be severely underpaid and overworked. The low, non-competitive pay wouldn't be so bad if the people in charge of our dept hadn't consistently given our team more and more work without expanding the team or giving us any help. Since starting this job, responsibilities from other depts have not only been given to us but some teams have been flat out FIRED so the company can cut costs and we can take over their work. Specific example: There was a team of 5 based out of the New York office who were just let go in March so our team of 10 can take over their full time jobs in addition to the work we already do. On our team of 10 people, I believe we've lost about 7 over the last 6 months. The job has become a revolving door because of the low pay, excess work and demands, and zero appreciation or concern from the people in charge of the dept, most of whom happen to be callous and one in particular has literally referred to us as ""bodies"". As in, ""we have enough bodies to get the work done"", ""A body is a body is a body"", etc. 

I hope you're ready for none of your valid concerns to actually be dealt with. In response to complaints, our boss flat out told a handful of us several times that Sales Fulfillment is not a career, just a job. What kind of motivator is that? His boss knows he can just replace us with newer people who aren't at the end of their rope. At the same time, I can't really fault our boss because there's virtually no career advancement in all of our dept. He's right. There's no future here for anyone. The ONLY reason people are sticking around is the company used to give a decent amount of stock options upon employment. Those stocks are now worth some money, enough to make our total compensation actually somewhat baseline competitive, so people are sticking around to ride out their accrual. The big problem is that newer people, especially the people hired to replace all of us who've left, do not get that benefit and thus have quickly discovered that there is zero reason to stick around. 

If they want to solve their problems by just throwing fresh ""bodies"" at them, word will soon get out that this company clearly doesn't care about having a proud staff of loyal, hard working employees not to mention actually caring about them or valuing their opinions. If the company did care, SOMEONE with power in my dept would have to answer to 70% of our team leaving over the last 6 months. They would have to start changing their methods and actually fight to get us more help instead of dumping more work on our plate. At the end of the day, the company keeps doing real well because business is great, and there's an insane amount of work they get done with minimal staff and they keep getting away with it."

- Job comes with benefits.
-Paid lunch period
- You don't have to wear a uniform
- You can use your phone
- You can surf the internet.","Quality Assurance grants low scores for no GOOD reason. They make up new rules so that they can mark you off if you don't do something that is really unnecessary. For example if someone calls in to check on the status of their order and you say ""I can check on that for you."" they mark you off for it. What is the ""correct"" thing to say is ""I can check on the status of your order."" So they are essentially marking you off for using pronouns instead of nouns. This is even if you handle the issue correctly and the customer is satisfied with the call. If this rule wasn't so ridiculous I would comply. The fact that it didn't used to be this way is what angers me. Also, the fact you are being marked off for something so trivial is crazy. This is not the only thing that I hate about Quality Assurance. 

The whole quality assurance department can be used as a mechanism for molding people's schedules. If people are scoring too highly then they will naturally deserve better schedules. However if they score low then you can make them work whenever you want. This is not right at all. I have been super depressed this bid because of this.

Ability to make decent money if you are lucky enough to get decent territory.,"Management is incompetent. Lack of consistency. Favoritism. Office morale is at an all time low, as everyone from management to new hires are quitting on the sales team.  Career development is non existent and reps that have been there a year or longer are treated the same as reps who have just started. Inside sales reps are treated like children and are given recess privileges. Everyday we lose top reps and new hires. The work environment is terrible."
1098,Grubhub,One of the most unprofessional job places I have ever worked in.,2013-07-15,1.0,Customer Service Specialist,They are downtown and centrally located.,Management does not seem to have a grip on the people who work at Grubhub. Management is complacent and under qualified for the positions that they have. Real talent is bleeding out of the company. This leaves a leadership vacuum that affects those all around them. The management that remains is more concerned with keeping their job than actually do it well.
1099,Grubhub,"Once was good, but headed downhill",2013-05-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"free lunch every so often, no dress code, beer on Fridays, roof top patio","It's no longer a fun internet company, it's gotten pretty corporate. Management isn't addressing issues within their departments and are ignoring them. Morale is pretty low and no one is taking responsibility for that."
1100,Grubhub,What is happening to GrubHub?,2013-05-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The only Pro aside from location is that when you tell people you work at GrubHub they have heard about it which wasn't the case 2 years ago. That turns into a Con quickly when you're hit with complaints from people that use the service or they find out what it's really like to work there,Departments in chaos caused by people that knew what they were doing leaving.  Had an issue I tried to get help on that wasmet with confusion and no support by the new HR person.  Having trouble getting my job done with operations due to leadership.  Lots of frustrated people having similar experiences with these departments now and missing the time when there were people who provided real support and had knowledge for what they do!  This causes a lot of concern for where the company is headed.

1103,Grubhub,The good times are over,2013-03-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"When I first began working there, the start-up culture was exciting. There is usually lunch provided once a week, and around holidays to celebrate. There are also a lot of really talented and interesting people who work there, so it's a great place to make connections and friends.","The senior management of the sales/account management department is abysmal. The sales managers encouraged sales reps to lie, or at least omit information, to close a deal. It would then be turned over to account managers who had to correct this information, and try to save the account, or be penalized for losing it. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing---or, worse, they know, and just don't care that it's wrong.
All sales teams have this reputation, sure. But GrubHub purports to be different. At company meetings, the co-founders talk about how different it is, and employees across departments and looking at each other with raised eye brows."
1104,Grubhub,Customer Service Specialist,2012-11-17,5.0,Customer Service Specialist,"Awesome co-workers, amazing training, free drinks, and random free food.

-Some of the people are incredible
-New office is great","-Subject to random changes in commission calculation
-Inexperienced and under-qualified senior management which leads to an extremely disconnect and inefficient work environment
-Executive management doesn't seem to care about about sales employees at all.  Middle management recently told us founders lied to us at a company wide meeting when asked a question about a change commission structure
-Senior management doesn't seem to care about sales employees. E.g. being pulled off the sales floor with no guarantee that lost time will be factored into compensation
-Little to no sales resources
-Very inefficient and redundant processes"
