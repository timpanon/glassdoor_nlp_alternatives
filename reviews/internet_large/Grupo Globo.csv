Stay away from this company if you want to make a career. For interns and juniors developers is the best, after 3 years get out! Actually the company is just admitting people from smaller cities in Brazil just to pay lower salaries for those who didn't know the price of living in Rio de Janeiro.
I guess the great problem is that is not a revenue oriented company, but a political oriented, if you have good relations and know how to smile feeling angry inside it is your place!"

Maybe there is one specialist per technology or programming language inside the company, the tech talks are really great. The environment is very casual, it is a great thing to go to work with light clothes in a hot and sunny Rio without being criticized.

The company invests a lot of money in training, we can choose one national and one international conference to attend to every year.","The senior management tries to block your salary and career progress saying things like ""I can't give you this"", but the employees know the company can. Some senior managers try to stop your salary progress by diminishing your work, which is an awful situation, making some people dissatisfied, which leads them to leave the company towards a better opportunity or get unhappy about their jobs.

The environment is VERY crowded, specially at the development site. Despite this, the Operations site  (known as Globeleze) of the company is barely used. You do not have a place to stay in the company, there is always someone taking your chair or your workplace and there is always some useless ""workplace rearrangement"". The chairs are not comfortable at all, it is like an attempt to make you get a vertebral column disfunction.

Innovative culture generates internal competition, which is not always healthy."

There are internal techtalks on many topics which you can learn from and they also have personal budgets for training.","Illusionist style management. They cast a spell on you telling all the wonders and you believe them, move to the city and join the company. They also make you believe that you are inferior to what you really is, so they can control your progress in income. Raises are very rare and depends on personal politics and the ability to blindly follow management. Most work gets down to make repetitive client side job, and the really nice backend work is in two or three projects in the whole company. Theres a lot of waste, finger pointing and the management likes to blame the developers and the teams on their lack of skill to handle any situation, they (management) never get accounted for the mistakes. ever."

The company invest heavily on personal development, sending people to trainings and conferences (inside and outside Brazil). I usually travel to conferences in the US once a year.

The ambient is relaxed and casual, as is the dresscode.","The company just changed the Business Hours from 9h30 - 19:00 (1h30 lunch) to 9h00 to 18h30. Those who live outside Barra da Tijuca now get the worst traffic to get to work and them back to home.

Besides that, there is no carrer plan and and the salary is not that great."
91,Grupo Globo,An amazing place but ...,2012-07-08,5.0,Senior Software Developer,Globo is an amazing place for engineers. They use all the buzzwords about agile practices that you can imagine for real in a day to day work. Full of very talented people with a CEO that really can sit on your desk to discuss the future of the product you're working on. A few places where a junior developer can stand in front of really senior one tell him he's wrong.,"As any big company there's a lot of politics that hit the more senior people much more than new hires. As the industry in Rio is so small, there's a lot of really senior developers that goes onto management almost as a retirement. moving up in the ladder can be really difficult as really few people graduate from the company."
