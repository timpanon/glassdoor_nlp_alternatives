0,Gympass,Gympass Business Development,2022-03-28,3.0,Business Development Representative,I am an individual who is very active and aligns very well with the mission and values at Gympass. Gympass provides their employees with great benefits along with affordable access to the platform which allows employees to stay fit and active.,"During my time at Gympass the onboarding process was horrible. I was offered a salary which was then ""offered prior to checking in with the company budget"". That was the first red flag. Next, I joined right before the global pandemic and did not feel like the company was being very transparent about the situation. Unfortunately, I was laid off within a month and then 6 months later I was asked to come back which I did. After coming back, there still seemed to be a lot of lack of transparency from upper management and as a BDR employee I did not feel valued. I eventually left to find employment elsewhere and while there were several cons to the role overall I enjoyed working for a company whose values were very aligned with my own."
1,Gympass,Go for the people; not for the tech,2022-03-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great people - some of the warmest, smartest, most collaborative peers and reports I've ever worked with
- Good culture, especially on the Brazilian team
- Fast paced and always something new to work on
- Amazing HR team and great benefits. They do walk the talk with well-being","- Executive Leadership is very former consultant heavy and uses the consulting approach to solve business problems, which often times is not practical
- Lots of unattainable goals and KPIs
- As the company grew, there were countless restructures and new leadership, which often cuts the momentum and you spend more time onboarding new people and explaining what you are doing, rather than actually doing it
- Very Brazil centric, though leadership is making an effort to establish US as its headquarters. The challenge is that a lot of best practices in Brazil don't translate to the US, and management has a hard time understanding that natively
- Technology is very far behind, especially compared to other tech peers in the industry they aspire to become"
2,Gympass,Great place to work,2022-03-17,5.0,Senior User Experience Writer,"As a wellbeing brand, Gympass works hard to live its values.

It's a really passionate and engaged team of people who are a pleasure to work with every day.","The People Team is great, but there is still a lot of turnover, which is extra rough because it takes a really long time to hire replacements for people who leave the company."

- The Gympass employee benefit is a major plus! You're able to visit premium studios and gyms at an affordable, monthly rate.

- Generous stock options package depending on grade level. 
- Gympass is the future of company wellbeing benefits with exponential growth. This is the time to get in if you can!","- No 401k match
- Global leadership and departments are heavily led by Brazil, so understanding of particular cultures and the local needs are not met. This can cause delays in campaigns or projects. This area has been getting better, but there is still work to be done. 
- Pay can vary depending on your department / role. Within the health tech sector, I would give them a grade level ""C"" compared to other companies and their salaries. Gympass recently went through a market evaluation and increased salaries of many employees, but still comes up short compared to other companies. To my knowledge, they are continuously working on this too."

- they push wellness and their culture but have gone through several rounds of lay offs with high profit margins during the pandemic (remember, if no one goes to the gym, their profits go up)

- Fitness vertical is dynamic and interesting
- You can carve out a work/life balance if you are on the right team","- If you aren't from Brazil, you don't matter
- You are always replaceable with a Brazilian employee
- They say they are global, but they aren't. This is a Brazilian company that wants to be global but won't get into a local mindset. Those of us in the US get so tired of hearing about 'winning"" in the US when they don't actually listen to those of us from the US when we suggest tech improvements or marketing. You can't win with a second-rate app, and since the Brazilian tech team refuses to consider anyone outside Brazil you can't win
- No one in the US knows who they are because they don't market the product at all.
- They ""lay off"" constantly. They'll restructure and layoff and then replace employees that knew what they were doing with outsourced teams or just more Brazilian employees
- The app is so bad and since all the tech team is in Brazil, they don't care because Brazilians will accept the bad tech. The US and EU won't and it's hurting the company
- OKRs are everything and get in the way of real progress

57,Gympass,They’re a mission driven company...driving in the wrong direction,2021-03-07,1.0,Fitness Partnership Representative,The best thing about Gympass is the discounted membership.,"Too many to list. 

-They are cheap and have slashed teams or outright outsource an entire department.

-AI and Machine learning has been a big investment since 2019 and they have replaced entire departments...

-Gympass is keeping it “Brazil.” They’re switching key leaders back to Brazilians or hiring American leaders but truly it’s not much their call on key initiatives. It’s a PR type.

-CEO had a chance to take another role at Gympass but declined. 

-Top performers are leaving in droves.

-A little cheesy to be comparing themselves to Spotify and other successful tech companies.

In short, look at 3 start reviews and lower, more accurate picture. Personally felt lucky to have worked there for the year while it was great. The rest of the time was trash."

- Pay disparity 
- You will get screwed almost every performance cycle, by technicalities or because they felt someone else deserved a raise more than you (They're CHEAP)
- HR pretends to listen but doesn't act on anything, your concerns will not be heard, HR isn't helpful at all 
- Mediocre pay compared to competition for similar and even some entry-level roles
- The benefits are average, no company matching for 401K
- No bonuses, commission being taken away
- Company won't pay for certifications and stopped education credit
- ""Restructuring"" every quarter that leads to layoffs & no pay increases and 
- Lack of diversity. They boast about having employees from 20 different countries but how many of your employees are Black? Better yet, how many Black employees are in leadership positions? (Referring to the US)
- A wellness company that doesn't actually care about employee wellbeing. If they did they would do more to boost morale, check-in on employees and not put so much of a workload on employees. They're too cheap to hire more employees in areas where they're needed."

There is also so much flexibility at Gympass- they accommodate to what you have going on in your personal life so when you need to tend to family emergencies or you just need a mental breather, you can do that without the guilt trip.","Definite downside of working for Gympass is that your pay is constantly changing. There is no stability in what you make. Our team has seen thousands of dollars in commission per month, to no commission at all, to a couple thousand per quarter (3 months), and it's still changing each quarter. There is never a set amount, so planning financially has been a game of saving every ounce of commission in preparation for a point that they completely cut the pay down to nothing or next to nothing. Also, it's scary to think about moving to a different department to grow yourself professionally. We've seen departments disappear and we've witnessed very loyal people get cut from the company without warning. I know people on my team, myself included, have a fear of moving on to another role and that role getting cut completely down the road. You just never know."

There was also a disparity between departments on how ""company-wide"" policies were upheld again creating inequality in how employees were treated. HR department also did not respect and seriously listen to employee concerns and employees were left feeling ignored and as though they were not cared for.

For working in the European region, all major decision making was made by a team of Brazilian leaders in Brazil who didn't take into account how their choices would impact a very different region and market. It felt like there was no trust for those in Europe to make decisions. They also filled many european roles by bringing employees over from Brazil rather than trying to find local talent and people who understood the region better."

But don't get me wrong.. the company is dynamic and you have to work hard to stay.","It has been my best working experience so far, so honestly I don't have any downsides to mention here.

For sales reps, a new commission structure is provided quarterly, and can be drastically different. The direction of the company changes from week to week and there is no clear path at any given time, which is largely to do with the lack of upper leadership.

96,Gympass,Don't Drink the Gympass/Softbank Kool-aid,2020-09-06,2.0,Associate,"-For the most part, I've found everyone I've worked with to be a pleasure to get along with. My team (short-lived due to massive layoffs) got along really well and I'm sure some of my connections will remain close to me even as I left. Granted, I didn't meet everyone here since I was only working for 9 months (maybe less than 40 people), but no complaints
- Global CEO: he seems to be a really nice/genuine guy, always living the mission and inviting people to come to a workout with him when everyone was in the office. Very approachable
- US CEO: Marshall seems like a great guy, definitely what the US team and Gympass overall needs in order to compete in the future. He seems to have an impeccable resume of success here in the US, and I'm sure he's got great things in store for Gympass, if he gets the support he needs globally
- Living the mission: Everyone here DOES live the mission. People workout together often, it was really a motivator for me to see everyone getting together to work out week in and week out, setting up company workouts, zoom workouts during covid, etc. It was inspiring and got me to step back from lifting everyday and trying out new things like spin/yoga/bootcamps/pilates, etc. the list goes on. I now jog and do yoga on a weekly basis, something I haven't done in 10 years
- Discount: Decent, definitely is helpful if you live in NYC and have a decent amount of options to go to. Some of the cool brands we worked with were harder to schedule, often requiring 2-3 separate verifications or even emailing someone to reserve your spot....EMAILING
- If you're looking for a career change and are really into fitness, say you're an entrepreneurial trainer or marketer, definitely the place for you. Lots of people that are managers on the sales team that just started out working at a gym or owning their own gym, etc. I'm sure its a great way to break into white collar work","-Tech/App: Is terrible. Gympass is obsessed with ""winning"" in the US, but you cannot ""win"" in the US if you have a terrible app and user experience. It has gone through improvements since I started, but it is nowhere near where an app should be in the US. Its incredibly buggy, logs you out all the time, crashes, etc. It was amazing to see how many CX employees were fighting for support for their clients. No urgency to fix anything ever, things can always wait for the tech team that I think is still based out of Brazil

-Management: Essentially all global leaders or anyone that matters are just Brazilian harvard business school men that all worked at some big 4 consulting firm. Groupthink is huge here. Maybe they should take a page out of some HBS case study and look up ""think global, act local"". Things that work in Brazil won't necessarily work in the US, stop jamming it down our throat, there's lots of talented US employees who have years of experience here. OKRs (don't even get me started on this garbage) are created by people who don't even sniff what's going on in the ground floor on these teams. During the beginning of the pandemic, things in the industry were changing daily. You're trying to adjust and bring findings to management, but it didn't matter, has to be tied to the OKRs. THROW THAT OUT THE WINDOW. Next QTR they changed OKRs for the team and used my suggestion but since it came from a global leader, it was now on everyone's to do list.

^To add to all this, I'm not one to bring in gender into anything, but as a male coming into the company, it was interesting to see that none of the leaders were male -- first thing I noticed (coming from another startup that was successful and was acquired, over half of our leadership was female). There's a ton of talented women here, and by the time I left they were getting some of the spotlight globally but lots more work needs to be done. Gympass will have these global town halls, and it would just be male after male presenting. Just recently they started having the head of HR who's a female get more speaking time, but they also tried to squeeze in another female exec from marketing in at the end but it seemed like an afterthought. People would run on and on about their updates, but save 2 minutes at the end (or just go over the allocated time) for marketing, where she had some of the biggest and most important updates to share. 

-Work ethic: There's no work smarter not harder mentality here. Its just work hard, break things, worry about it later.  There's a ton of extremely manual processes here

-Politics: This company is by Brazilians, for Brazilians. They love to move people around the company through internal referrals and promotions, often putting someone with no experience in roles that directly require experience. Its all to help out someone who's cozy with global leaders or HQ, that want to come to work in the US, etc. I actually love that they do this when it works, but on my team it did not work at all and it was one of the major reasons why it was difficult for our new team/department to succeed. When you have a company that is almost entirely comprised of sales and marketing folks, it's hard to find new fresh ideas, tech improvements, and people who can execute on those ideas etc. Not every problem in the world can be solved by sales and negotiating.

-HR: Never really had too many negative interactions with them, actually thought everyone was fairly nice and approachable. But when they decided to lay off essentially our whole team (previous Gympass employees were kept, go figure) they really fumbled on all aspects of my exit. They tried finding me places internally, which I appreciated, but they were recommending me a ton of low level positions that weren't really close to what I needed. They also messed up my employee grade level, changed up option award structure, and had me coded in an irrelevant department. They also had me do a case study for an INTERNAL interview...yup you read that right. And HR told me that I didn't have to do a presentation for it, so I didn't. When I went into the internal interview they expected a full 20-30 minute presentation. Needless to say I thanked them for the opportunity and headed for the exit."

Relationships between different teams are very tough, employees are encouraged not to communicate with other teams other than over Slack which creates a toxic work environment for everyone. 

No 401k match,  but that is typical of startups

The work is pretty dull. Essentially spend the entire day cold calling which is good experience but gets boring very quickly. It doesn't help that our gym partners don't like the fact that programs like Gympass take away from their existing member base. The mission of the company is to defeat inactivity but most of the people utilizing the benefit were already active before they got Gympass. Now they just pay less money and aren't as loyal to the small business gyms they were going to before."
124,Gympass,Ambiguous,2019-11-24,2.0,,Good people that mean well in general. Very energetic. Could be a good place to work for the right person in the right type of role.,"Lack of direction. Managers are smart and competent, but generally more interested in doing their jobs than helping you do yours. Expectations can be unclear. Fire drill culture, but such is the norm in startups."
125,Gympass,An Actual Honest Review,2019-11-19,4.0,Anonymous,"I am going to be honest, Gympass is not for everyone. We are a fast paced company that is new to the US and learning our way through it. As you can imagine, the US is a HUGE market and with that comes growing/learning pains. If you are not one who can handle change or the typical ebbs and flows of a start-up, then maybe Gympass isn't for you. However, if you can handle it then I can promise you you will not be bored and every day will come with new challenges.
I'm not sure where these comments about the HR team are coming from. In my personal experience they have been nothing but helpful and willing to make Gympass the best place it can be. They throw events(that has the BEST food and drinks), provide advice if/when needed, and also seem genuinely and truly happy/willing to help. I myself have had questions about my career and where I want to be- they have listened as a sounding board and have guided me with my concerns.
Yes sometimes its frustrating when they bring someone else from Brazil, but to be completely logical- What else do we expect? If it was an American company going to a different country- we would send our leaders to open those new markets.
Having worked here for over a year (almost 2) I can truly say I am happy where I am. I learn something new everyday, I have grown exponentially since I've been here, and I have gotten exposure and experience that I don't think I could have gotten anywhere else. Does this mean I haven't been frustrated? ABSOLUTELY NOT. I have had my fair share of wine after an infuriating day of work, but who in the world hasn't?

To conclude my ridiculously long review here, I will just say- the majority of the time reviews are going to be negative. You only ever leave reviews if you're angry *cough* Yelp *cough* I'm just here to throw some positivity in the world and set the record straight. Don't listen to the disgruntled former employees- but one who is still here!","Get ready to get your hands dirty; you will be pulled in a bunch of directions and feel like you can't get your feet under you. Then one day you'll be on a call and know the answer to something and you will feel utterly vindicated and all your hard work will fall into place.
Hard work will pay off- don't be afraid of it."
126,Gympass,"Great Mission, Questionable Execution and Leadership",2019-11-06,1.0,Business Development Representative,"- Gympass, the actual benefit, is great. Being a Gympass employee, you get a great deal on it, and Gympass employees frequently work out downtown together. 

- If you are young professional, there are many people like you from many walks of life in the office and throughout the organization. 

- The Houston office has a great location in Downtown. You can access the tunnels through the elevators. 

- Gympass pays for you parking in a nearby parking garage or public transportation if you take that.","- Inside the office is a little crowded. If you are used to having a lot of space at your desk, you won't have that here.  

- The pay is not that good. You are required to clock your hours. You can get overtime, but it is a pain to have to clock in your hours and I have not experienced having to do this in past similar positions.  

- In addition to the base pay itself, the commission for the BDRs is insulting. You could land a meeting with a fortune 500 client, and that would count the same as a company with 1k employees. The commission is capped to a target and the metrics to get to your target earnings are unrealistic. The most you could make in a month is 66% that I would make in my past positions. Also, who enjoys being capped? Absolutely no one.  If this is your first job out of college, you would probably be fine with it, but given my knowledge of other comp plan structures, this was unacceptable to me. 

- Lots of changes.  My direct manager left during my first week. We had an coworker get terminated my first week. It seems to be a revolving door in terms of talent. With the new management came the commission plan change that was previously discussed (it was uncapped before and different company sizes yielded different commission amounts). 

- What might be the ultimate downfall of Gympass is its persistence in trying to replicate the LATAM market (from which the company began) to the European and American markets. As an employee, you will see leadership promote strategies that worked for them in the LATAM market, although they may not be the best for other markets. While I think it is important to have a benchmark, it is also important to realize other market dynamics that make America and Europe different. Not everything will work the same, and you shouldn't expect that same! 

- Again , Gympass is a young company, they are trying to figure things out. Leadership sometimes feel like they are learning just as much as you. 

- If you are a BDR, expect a lot of micromanagement. I am all for coaching and feedback at the the right times, but it seemed too excessive in the way the it is currently practiced.  Don't expect management to be accomodating at all. They ultimately just care about the numbers. It takes multiple months for lead generation representatives to ramp up, despite this they gave out a performance improvement plan (PIP) for me after my second month with only two weeks to improve!

I love our mission. Gympass did a company wide challenge to check into gyms and it got a lot of people to join Gympass that hadn't joined. It created friendships across teams and even created a bit of a culture shift of allowing people to work out during lunch or coming in a bit after ""starting time"" if they did an early workout. 

The people are great. Everyone is approachable from the executive leaders to the most entry level person. If you have an issue that you can't solve with your manager, you can always go to HR and they will help as much or as little as you want them to be involved.","Change is hard.

One problem is solved creating three different issues, decisions are taken overnight and, of course, nothing is conveyed so that creates a lot of confusion. 

There is a huge lack of communication amongst departments and even within each department, thus everyone's performances is always at risk. Teamwork is not as present as it should be, many co-workers prefer to talk to your manager when a mistake is being made instead of letting you know what could be improved, this creates an environment of everlasting confusion that jeopardizes one's performance. Humbleness scarces.

Management is poor even though they try, senseless decisions are taken almost on a daily basis, I also noticed that the workforce is still pretty young and this is self-explanatory, employees that aren't expertised enough are promoted to coordination roles.

157,Gympass,Internal Values need to be re-assessed,2018-11-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some good initiatives like the internal newsletter, learning platform, D&I initiatives and local wellness club. 

Gympass is a high growth company with a great concept, it has expanded globally in under 5 years and currently counts almost 1,000 employees. There is definitely potential to grow further.

Monthly initiatives like the end of the month wrap up, global calls, healthy breakfast and team walks are a nice way to improve communication among teams/offices and update each other with successes and future plans.","It’s disheartening to see how the company is parading very noble concepts like mental and physical wellbeing at work. I joined Gympass thinking that I could make a real social impact on the professional world, however, I shortly realized that those concepts were only praised externally, so that employee wellbeing is important only when it means revenues. Gympassers spend their life praising concepts like retention, employee satisfaction, stress reduction, and the importance of workplace wellbeing but none of these notions are applied internally (i.e. When I opened up to my manager about having anxiety because I felt my job was unstable he proposed to terminate my tenure as a solution “for my wellbeing”).
 
Leadership either acts as you don’t exist and lack basic manners (which means they will shortly get rid of you) or they open up and will share personal opinions about their teams. I often listened to my manager complaining about the lack of intelligence of their employees and mock their personalities. This created a very negative and toxic environment where trust and respect were non-existent.
 
If you don’t comply with the culture you are very easily identified as a toxic person and the company will most likely let you go on the spot. As well, if you are no longer needed, managers make the work environment so tough that you naturally become toxic. Generally, the concept of “being toxic” is used against employees rather than being used as an opportunity to welcome feedback and improve upon.
 
The lack of transparency is so embedded in the culture that senior managers will say anything to serve their purpose. Nonetheless, the nepotism and favouritism in the company are so strong that most promotions happen because of the laddish culture some managers have established. On the other side, if the strategy changes (and it seems to change way too often) and you don’t serve a purpose anymore, they will let you go on the spot. And when I say on the spot, I mean that they will ask you to vacate your desk on the same day, without a handshake or the opportunity to say goodbye to your colleagues - which shows that the company has a cowardly way of not wanting to take accountability for its own decisions or simply deal with the consequences of their choice. The company re-structured internally so many times that it ended up having a very odd ratio of senior leaders to employees, where sometimes a managing partner/director is only responsible for no more than 3/4 entry level/junior employees. 
   
There is very little money invested in proper resources for the team: laptops break down, licenses take weeks to be provided etc, which makes it very difficult for some teams to hit targets. The worst part is that the resources allocated usually match the level of seniority in the business meaning that the higher up you are the better laptop, phone etc you get, and this creates a sense of frustration and discrimination among employees.
 
HR is not independent. Personal strings outside work make it very difficult to trust the department and raise issues - I would expect no personal involvement (from friendship to more) from such positions.
 
The exercise of meritocracy (one of the core values) is also a big red flag at Gympass, I have witnessed the  top team performer:
•	having to fight for a promotion for 3 months
•	Being told that if the promotion didn’t serve the purpose of the manager it wouldn’t necessarily happen
•	Ultimately being promoted after discussing the case with 3 different senior managers - the promotion should have come with further responsibilities which never happened
•	Overperformed for the following 6 months
•	Was promised a further promotion to lead a team
•	Let go after two weeks of the promise"

The London office is located within a WeWork - great location, facilities and opportunity to network with other startups. 


I worked with a great team of smart, ambitious people and joined at a time when we were still putting processes in place and trying new things which also meant that I had the opportunity to get involved in other areas of the business. 


The end of month wrap ups + pizza/drinks are great and a very good way for all the teams to update the whole office on achievements made in the last month, come together to celebrate successes and mention upcoming plans and initiatives everyone is working on. 


They have recently implemented some good initiatives - wellness club, internal newsletters, new learning platform, focus on D&I after global survey.","The company is ruthless in how it treats its people which is ironic considering they are promoting employee wellbeing to their clients. Gympass spend majority of their time preaching about employee engagement, retention tools etc. but it seems they don't know how to apply these concepts internally. It’s the kind of place where if you tell management, you have mental health issues - not only will they not have any empathy but they will use this as an opportunity to bring up your targets and put more pressure on you. At the same time they are holding talks on how it is the company’s responsibility to look after its people in terms of physical and mental wellbeing… 


Of course, business needs are a priority but there is a lack of human touch in the way they deal with issues and treat their people - ranging from favouritism by management towards certain employees, lack of independence/confidentially from HR, management not being open to discussion. They are not open to opposing viewpoints and have an attitude of sweeping things under the rug.



Meritocracy - practice both ends - not just punishment

Gympass is an organisation which prides itself on being meritocratic. It’s off-putting when you watch your colleagues have to struggle and argue their case for promotion when they’ve deserved it months ago and really management should have recognised and rewarded this by now. On the other end, they are quick to pick up on people who are underperforming and use this meritocracy to “let go of people” (as they so clearly outline in their values) without providing the support and training to help people improve. 

There is not really any organic growth in terms of career progression as you would expect from a typical startup as the general tendency has been to replicate the structure in Brazil which has resulted in hiring externally rather than promoting within. Gympass is very much a scale up now with a lot of decisions which seem to be made at the European HQ in Madrid.


Diversity & Inclusion

Across the company there is a general theme of it being Brazil centric (most senior leaders globally being Brazilian) and the lack of women. 

Globally there is only one female country manager and very few women in other leadership positions and even then usually only in Marketing/Launch/HR which is then reflected in the teams. Gympass is now starting to focus on this initiative company-wide but more needs to be done to recruit more women across all teams and retain them.


Lack of trust & transparency - being honest goes a long way. 

There seems to be somewhat of a lack of respect and professionalism by management. It was frankly quite shocking to raise an issue with management where I was trying to understand why I was not given the same exposure as some of my peers even when I was over-performing compared to them. Not only was I not given a satisfactory answer but I was in fact accused of being “childish” by a manager who apparently has 10 years of experience."

Accounts have been totally stolen or redistributed.  And if you wind up having a problem that you can't solve yourself, you won't have the support or resources to solve it."
