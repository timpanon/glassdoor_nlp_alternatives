You can virtually walk in the cabin of Business Head to discuss ideas/issues. It’s a young organization that creates a vibrant atmosphere to work. The senior managers are particularly very supportive and genuinely listen to your problems.  You can learn a lot in the company and it allows you to rotate in various functions to keep the learning going. I’ve seen people with potential move from counselling to even digital marketing profiles. It’s a great place to build your career especially if you are in the digital/internet space. Work life balance is also great, though during season time it can become hectic at times.","Since its a part of a large group, the processes at level of parent company become a bottleneck."

Highly inefficient HR
Employer does not take good care of employees. So much hungama about employee welfare and HT culture but its only publicity and seems fake employee engagement
Few people could survive here because of some senior editors who are unreasonably demanding.

You can take up any issue , if you are convinced and they are willing to give it a try. The journey so far has been good. There is a  nice cafetaria withon the building and good breakfast available - a boon for someone who just cannot have it at home . On the money  part i, t is good and got a good raise last year.

282,HT Media,Review about HTCampus - Toxic to say the least,2017-03-15,1.0,Assistant Manager,"Although very few, but since it's a Hindustan Times venture you will be working with a nationally recognized brand.","TL;DR : It's better to remain unemployed than get a job with HTCampus.

Well, where do I start... The entire HTCampus team is fed up and attrition is extremely high. Everybody is just looking to get out of the company . For starters you have to reach office exactly at 9 am, after which you will have to sign a register for HR team to send you warning emails. The senior management will shout and scream at you for everything from coming late to having breakfast in the office to spending more than 30 mins for lunch. Normal office chit chat among colleagues, personal discussions and enjoying some moments with your friends and colleagues is actually forbidden and you'll be getting harsh glares from the senior management for doing so. Moreover, they will try to instigate a feeling of fear in the entire team, which obviously isn't good for productivity. Then you'll have to create ppts for everything which will take up most of your working time and then you'll be asked to stretch till 9pm and beyond just to get your work done. Meetings happen any time of the day and they last till the time the vertical heads have talked about everything not even remotely related to the point of discussion. Constant abuse, job threats are common, asking for leaves is considered a crime and if you're working from 9 to 6 diligently you're still not in their good books as you have no sense of urgency. Blame game is the favourite way of passing time for all verticals and those who are here to work and not play politics or lick up to the senior management are considered as punching bags. They try to become a start-up but don't want to let go of the traditional corporate work culture too where ppts and excels are more important than real work. The sales team is good but the management tries to push them to their limits and their breaking point. There is no work life balance and you are expected to be ready for work on a 24*7*365 basis - quite literally!
If you get through all this, your appraisal will be delayed from the regular April to July. This is done to ensure that people don't leave mid-season on checking the peanuts they receive. Although they know that they'll receive peanuts only, but still humans are an optimistic species."
