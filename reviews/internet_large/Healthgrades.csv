1,Healthgrades,Don’t. Please don’t.,2022-02-12,1.0,Customer Service Representative,They start you off at a decent wage with a promise to learn more and increase your hourly.,"I was a temp for HG, now Mercury Healthcare. Turn over is very very high. They use 5 temp agencies to fill these jobs with a promise of FT hire after 90 days. That’s 90 business days, regardless is you work weekends. This job is blatant data collection on behalf of health systems across the United States. You get calls from folks who just want to talk to their doctor, collect names, addresses, phone numbers, etc. then connect them to their doctor. You provide references for people needing new doctors as well. That’s not too bad. People will fight you on this though, especially if they are already established patients. “My doctor already has this information, why am I giving it to you?” And you are told to lie to them that you assist in scheduling appointments. Training is ONE WEEK, with the promise of being able to learn more “phases” as time passes. The supervisors don’t know anything, they are young, eager to prove themselves, and bullies. No one checks your progress until a QA score comes in. You only have yourself as an advocate. If you want to quit, they will hold your things hostage and pack them up to send back to your temp agency. Maybe. Don’t bother, it’s a ruse to get people in the door, the job is hard, you get calls from legitimate crazy people or people having health crisis’. It wears you down. Your agency won’t tel you anything unless you call them, and then only maybe. Literally no one knows what is going on. No one."

HR team in Denver is awesome.","Not the worst place I've worked, but it's close. Acquisitions and associated layoffs/ RIFs are a part of corporate life, but the way HG handles them is shameful: no transparency (even though that is a company tenet) and horrible execution. 

Management leverages employees like pawns to address performance challenges with other employees that they don't want to deal with.

Leadership is lacking to non-existent and there is always a ""shiny new thing"" to chase regardless of the impact to employees. Evariant acquisition and leadership communication was deplorable. 

As many other reviews state, there is finger pointing and blame, adversarial relationships between teams and when you work to solve that problem, it goes unrecognized. Reward and acknowledgement go to people who respond to emails all hours of the night regardless of what they were doing during actual work hours.

If you have any self-worth, you do not want to work for Healthgrades."

38,Healthgrades,Squandering strong market position with disorganization and office politics,2021-05-02,1.0,Marketing,Exceptional PTO and the chance to work with a strong portfolio of services for consumer and B2B audiences.,"While the portfolio has strong footing in Healthgrades' markets, the company has weakened its outlook with poor management. Leadership seems voracious to acquire smaller businesses, but their lack of execution, product management acumen and operational competency compromises many of the benefits their acquisitions should provide. When I worked there, leadership splurged for a company that was struggling and didn't have a compelling portfolio. Almost all the employees from the acquired company soon quit after coming to Healthgrades. In the end, I question if these acquisitions do much more than drain cash from the company.

Leadership also wanted to be innovative but didn't show the discipline or know-how needed to learn their customers' needs, develop relevant products and craft effective go-to-market strategies. I saw smart, organized and gritty product developers leave the company, because they couldn't see a way to get anything done.

Personally, I found it difficult to do anything more than spin my wheels. Further more, if I tried to add value, it often made some people insecure. Office politics and idiosyncratic management practices made it difficult to roll up my sleeves. I worked with some smart, driven people, but there were too many hurdles to accomplish much."

55,Healthgrades,Unfulfilled and strained,2021-03-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Got to work with some amazingly talented individuals!,"The business direction from upper management has been questionable throughout the past several years. I worked in what felt like a golden era at Healthgrades in which we were executing on our core competencies and seeing growth in the consumer and health systems businesses. In the past several years, the acquisitions of several companies have led to a complete restructuring of the health systems organization and with it the ousting of top talent and their critical industry knowledge. The terminations of top performing and hard working individuals, whether it be due to COVID-19 or other reasons, has been persistent in 2021 as well. 

The strategy of building vaporware for a couple of high-paying clients in conjunction with poorly staffed teams and a mix of company cultures creates a high pressure environment in which employees are celebrated for working long hours and around the clock on weekends. The culture is one of high output but low quality.

Working in this environment for an extended period of time took a toll on my wellbeing and ultimately left me feeling unfulfilled and strained."
56,Healthgrades,Long hours building vaporware,2021-03-02,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,The other engineers were interesting and hard-working people,"Healthgrades acquired a company called ""Evariant"" and replaced several of their C-suite executives for the ""health system division"" with those from Evariant.

The new CTO made no attempt to forge good relationships between the original Healthgrades employees and the Evariant folks who came over after acquisition, instead opting to just fire a large percentage of the Healthgrades folks over the past year. Merit is not rewarded, only blind loyalty is recognized. 

The company as a whole takes a very ""sell the product, then build the product"" mentality which leads to an overwhelming amount of client commitments. The excessive client commitments demanded long hours, with some engineers working every single weekend. Employee burnout is real and several key Engineering leaders have left and not been replaced. People are forced to wear many hats outside of their job description and that effort is just expected rather than rewarded. 

Despite all of that effort, this work is for nothing; the client commitments are continuously delayed and features are released in a very buggy, unusable state. 

Instead of investing more resources to stabilize and deliver existing product lines, new product lines and teams are still being formed. This is the ""vaporware"" that other reviewers have referenced.

Majority of employees did not receive a merit increase in 2020 nor will they receive one in 2021, despite numerous layoffs equating to everyone having increased responsibilities."
57,Healthgrades,"Amazing colleagues, toxic culture",2021-03-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Learned a ton by working with several very smart people. Supposedly had unlimited PTO, but never actually took any.","The charges of vaporware being sold are true. The products could be good if enough time was provided and engineers weren't worked to death, which is the norm. It doesn't seem to matter how many nights and weekends a person puts in; this place and its senior management value loyalty over merit 100% of the time. Utterly unqualified people are placed in positions of power because they are chummy with management, while the line workers in engineering and product toil day and night to pull miracles off for clients with unrealistic expectations (facilitated by leadership). Products are sold before the design even is put on paper. The executive team rules by fear and intimidation, and cult of personality prevails. Actually good work is not rewarded, and speaking up with one's opinion is punished. Misogyny and a favoritism toward men of South Asian ancestry are rampant in the product and engineering org. Your career will probably stagnate here. The CEO has bet on the wrong horse."
58,Healthgrades,Hellgrades doesn't begin to describe this toxic workplace,2021-02-24,1.0,Integrated Marketing Manager,"Compensation is within market value.
Unlimited PTO (if you can ever find the time)
The day you leave will be the best day of your HG experience","The blame game, demeaning comments, and vacillating leadership. 

I spent more time defending my work from my superiors trying to blame my late delivery of assets on me when the reality was that the process had changed that week and thus delivered me faulty data sets to work with.

It did not matter the quality of my work that I produced. I would have 1 leader wanting the project to their liking. Only to switch the entire presentation when shown to another leader. This went on for many projects. I never felt that I was creating a presentation for the client's benefit, but just to please my boss.

I had my boss ask me if I was purposefully trying to put the team in a bind so that they would have to take the work away from me and do it themselves. Again it was not me, but the process that was slowing things down and it felt demoralizing.

4 leaders on 1 project caused considerable rework and confusion that often left me beyond drained.

Coworkers who were there to help would often be demeaning in their tone and approach. It seemed that nobody was willing to help nor was there a team atmosphere or comradery among coworkers.

I felt that my ADHD was used against me by some employees.

Superior would praise me one day for something and the very next day they would fault me for the very same thing that they praised me for. Leadership guidance is inconsistent from day to day, which creates a culture of fear.

The company was so toxic that the counselor provided through HG benefits told me that I should leave.

Every day was dreadful because you never knew what was needed or how you stood with leadership."

76,Healthgrades,"Amazing people, bold mission, but lacking in career opportunities",2020-09-19,4.0,Client Services Associate,"- Workplace perks: drinks, snacks, amenities, tons of office space and private rooms, new appliances and amazing deskspaces (feels like no expense was spared!)
- 401(k) matching, assistance programs, student loan contributions, and many more smaller perks that really add up.
- Seriously amazing coworkers. Even in a stressful work environment, people are friendly and excited to do their jobs. My team was diverse and extremely collaborative, like a little family. I hear from other employees that I was on a great team of people and I feel lucky for that, but I always encountered great people from HR to Finance to Operations.
- I started off as an intern and was given plenty of opportunity to explore and learn about HG, as well as interact with upper management and other teams at HG.
- Upper management seems communicative and encourages collaboration and participation among employees through recognition events, seminars, lunch and learns, and much more.","- Sadly, as great as the employees are, I think that management doesn't do nearly enough to keep talented people. I feel like HG could be so much more, so it's sad to see and hear about talent leaving. During my time at HG, 3 people left my small team and their spots were never filled. This all comes at a time where HG is supposedly doing extremely well, thanks in part to the pandemic.
- Internal data issues generally caused a lot of headache. Lots of work had to be redone and tracked, postponed, or cancelled outright. This is understandable from my perspective, but my efficiency seemed to be hindered more often than not.
- Many teams working together to achieve a goal creates a lot of collaboration but brings its own issues. Office politics were not usually problematic but there were times where there is miscommunication between teams. Managers could try harder to make sure issues are understood fully by other managers and that there is a clear(er) goal to be met. The personalities of marketers vs engineers can cause issues.
- There is a lack of mentoring or career pathways to pursue once you're out of the internship experience. There were a lot of circumstances, the pandemic among them, that I believe contributed to solving higher-priority issues throughout this year instead of focusing on what actually makes HG work so well - talented and ambitious people.
- I am so grateful that HG offered for me to remain working for them while I wrapped up my final year of college, but when the time came to decide whether to stay at HG for a potential salaried position, I felt a bit strung along by management. I waited months for the opportunity to even interview for new openings, and it seems to me that internal hiring rarely occurs outside of entry-level positions. I chose to remain at HG during this time as I was assured that my interest in HG would likely result in a full-time offer, but that time never came. I sadly chose to forgo other opportunities, which is especially scary during a pandemic, but sadly this wasn’t recognized by management."

Saying ""yes"" to anything that is asked and then grinding the people actually doing the work is especially rewarded. The new approach seems to be use someone as much as you can until they burn out, and then replace them with a new body.

A culture of fear and blame has replaced a once healthy culture of professional growth and quality. It is now more important to say your task is done as quickly as possible than to design something that works and actually test it. If it doesn't work properly, then blame the other teams involved. 

Most of the talented engineers have left and are being replaced with offshore and contractors."

82,Healthgrades,HellGrades,2020-08-05,1.0,Anonymous,The small percentage of nice people who worked/work there.,"Worked for the company call center for 5 years. With every managerial change, and there were several, the environment never improved nor changed for the better. It got worse every time.

The advocacy for transparency is laughable. There were more closed door meetings between higher-up management than a person could count. Never explained, but everyone noticed the habit. Management didn’t interact with the “underling” employees, but had no problem dumping duties upon everyone without a courtesy to ask if the employee was interested and without any pay increase. 

When changes were implemented they were done with barely any notice or none at all and without proper planning. Loss of clients was consistent.  Feedback and input from those who gave it was never regarded seriously if concerns were expressed. Upper management never cared what employees had to think or say. Expected to follow blindly and keep your head down. Threats of repercussions were given including threatened job loss or demotion. Favortism was very apparent and exercised often with promotions being handed out to those who were close to upper-management despite lacking qualifications or experience.

Unequal pay is very real here. New-hires make significantly more than seasoned employees who’ve been there for years and men are paid more than women. Sexual harassment occurs without repercussions even if it' reported HR and upper management. Even if written documentation/proof is provided or witnessed by others. Sexism and misogyny rule with an iron fist.

Turn over continues as a revolving door in nearly every position. Expect to have a different manager every year on the average. Often unclear who you report to due to constant change over. Most newly appointed management knows next to nothing about operations and could never answer questions regarding protocols for our clients. It's a scary realization when you discover entry level employees know more about the basics of the business than the person you report to. Incompetence was often excused and overlooked.

When employees are fired or they quit sometimes it wasn't announced and usually never explained. People often wondered where said person went, but no one told them why or when they left. Communication is always poor and nearly non-existent here. You are replaceable no matter how well you work. Being undervalued and unappreciated goes without saying on a daily. Write-ups and firings occur regularly. Even to stellar employees.
 
When the pandemic of Covid-19 started everyone’s hours were cut and bonuses were withheld the day before everyone was supposed to receive them (bonuses were paid out finally in July, but this happened in April). Despite this, certain positions in upper management received promotions and none of the upper management’s wages were cut. Anyone who was salaried didn’t receive any impact upon their hours or pay. Everyone else took the hit. If the company was hurting so badly and had to make cuts to keep going, why was anyone promoted and why didn't everyone receive a reduction in pay?  Goes to show who they care about and have only cared about; the salaried workers and higher-ups while attempting to maintain a healthy profit for their investors and board of directors. Everyone else was and is expendable.

No matter how hard you worked, how well you did your job, or how long you’ve been with the company and as an exceptional employee, those in charge of the call center will only ever see you as a replaceable body doing the work. Praise and appreciation for doing well or going out of your way to make a difference will never matter to them. And forget about work-life balance. Aside from a couple of decent people who remained in small numbers, the majority of upper-management had no concerns about your well-being, time or life outside of work, and expected you to work whatever hours they set and without an increase to your pay when overloading you with extra work, even if it was outside of your job description. All they care about is the bottom line and grinding everyone down to achieve it."

They don't seem to plan things beyond ""well we sold something, even if it's vapor, so now we need to make it mystically appear"". Engineering plans were made typically well after a sprint had already started, and then revised again before it was over.

Most of the work is done offshore, with most of the design done on shore. Problem is that 11 hour time delta makes it bordering upon impossible to actually have real meetings with offshore engineers who made need help or clarity for the work."

A lot of people were smart and left to collect unemployment and make over $1000 more than me  to do NOTHING while I have to work my bit off to make the same as brand new peoples! They wood rather screw us out of our bonuses and not gave us our raises while everyone else in the company gets theres, and try to make us come back to the office where we could get sick and die, rather than care about there employees. Good luck answering calls without employees! Don’t be suprised when you get sued for not paying our $$$$!"
88,Healthgrades,Hackgrades,2020-06-06,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Some good coworkers some of the time.,"If you value yourself, don't work for this place.

Healthgrades sells new hires on the idea that being a customer service specialist is an easy job and that Healthgrades itself provides a meaningful service which helps patients, hospitals, and others. In reality you're a middleman and a scapegoat for upset patients trying to reach their doctor's office, doctor's offices who never signed up for HG's services, and anyone else who happens to dial the wrong number.

If that wasn't tough enough, good workers are punished with a continuous dumping of added duties without any decent rewards (increased pay, free lunches, or even verbal praise). You can expect someone who barely works at all to be promoted because they're friends with someone in management. New hires make more money. 

Upper management doesn't know how to run this company, as evidenced by the major losses of clients and high turnover in the workplace. People in all positions (even supervisors, IT, engineers) disappear regularly and you might notice only when 1) an email addressed to them doesn't go through or 2) because every employee can see the cubicle being cleaned out. Despite the various mottos sponsored by this Healthcare data mining company, the most contradictory one is ""be transparent."" Don't kid yourself or your employees. If the company is expanding so much, then why are the numbers so bad? The longtime workers are quitting, the newcomers are quitting, the CEOs are quitting, clients have left (yeah, go on and talk about the two acquisitions when you have no idea what to do with them), and yet upper management still claims everything's good. It's not. 

Consumer Reports even mentioned Healthgrades negatively in an article published in 2016. Healthgrades will fail at some point as they're not transparent, not rewarding of hard work, not committed to improving, and not ever responsible for their bad decisions (like a client going live accidentally or the Healthgrades website being changed without telling any of the workers). Plus the tech people are barely available and the system crashes more than it should. 

Lastly, HG once refused to give out a bonus to a woman who had a seizure while there at the office because it happened on a Monday. No empathy from the corporate machine. Only fancy headphones that don't work and a headache that doesn't stop even when your shift is over.

Side note, I know Kate or other HR members will try and dismiss all of this, but the truth is out there. That career map ain't the answer and the anonymous whistle-blower line is laughable. Even the free coffee can't make up for the amount of mental energy required to get through a single day of work. Being mission-driven or growing as a company shouldn't mean killing your workers."
89,Healthgrades,Poor leadership,2020-05-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Immediate coworkers are great. People survive this place together.

Strong legacy of success in healthcare CRM. This legacy is longstanding and irreplaceable.","This is a fractured company, with not much vision coming from the top business leadership, and individual leaders and managers pushing their own directions. Multiple rounds of M&A, layoffs, and years of high turnover have made the company feel like it lacks a heart, and a brain. Company ""values"" are more of an internal marketing campaign than a reality.

Recent reverse acquisition, along with layoffs of productive, key teams, destroyed the product engineering culture. Business decision making is unintelligible, as is engineering direction. Morale is shot, to a point that ""acquisitions are hard OK?"" is not a good answer.

Private investors appear to now want to dump the company, so the business will probably be pumping sales and appearances at the expense of product quality and long-term success."
90,Healthgrades,"Great co-workers, HORRIBLE management!",2020-05-19,2.0,Integrated Marketing Manager,"Good benefits, most notably extended time off and 401k match. Great people to work with, especially on the integrated marketing team. Clients all over the country so many opportunities for travel.","- Base compensation is pretty low, but if you're in a commission-earning role there are opportunities.
- No clear plan for the future from management, it's just one acquisition- after the next that have all been very poorly executed from an operational stand point. It feels like leadership if more concerned with setting up shareholders to sell the company than with actually running the company well and keeping talented employees.
- Managers seem unqualified and powerless to truly manage people - it's simply a title without any real qualifications or managerial training to back it up. Essentially, your future and development plan as an employee is in the hands of someone who really has no idea how to motivate or grow you professionally.
- Training is almost non-existent. You're pretty much left to figure things out on your own or rely heavily on colleagues to teach you. Where training does exist, it is very poorly executed.
- No real opportunities for career growth; promotions are simply a new title and increased pay but there is no real path to actual career growth and development.
- Cross-functional teams are very dysfunctional - there is a lack of ownership and accountability from some teams and their leadership is more concerned with shifting blame than finding solutions to problems.
- Sales culture within a MARKETING STRATEGY team; using commission as an incentive for marketing strategists turns them into sales people concerned with selling more of ""what's on the truck"" than being good strategic consultants. It also inspires an unhealthy scale of competition among the team (including between managers and their reports since both have client loads) because client assignments affect commission scales and there is no clear rhyme or reason to how these are done. There is definitely an element of leadership playing favorites."
91,Healthgrades,Former Evariant Employee,2020-04-28,1.0,,Being part of Evariant for the past 6 years has brought many pros. It was great working for a company that had so much potential and so many smart  and talented people ready to propel the company to success.,"The way Evariant’s story ended was avoidable but unfortunately there were too many leaders that put their egos, greed and feelings of self entitlement over the best interest of the company and its employees. It truly was like watching a ship slowly sink, with all the people on board desperately and frantically throwing buckets of water overboard to help it stay a float. During Evariant’s last year, the company culture became toxic and managers were led by fear rather than passion. We were asked to have courage of our convictions and dare mighty things, but then admonished and belittled when we attempted to live up to those challenges. A select few were held on a high pedestal, which resulted in many talented and inspiring voices to be silenced or exited. That was the true and actual death of Evariant - the sale to Healthgrades was only the final transaction. 

The acquisition was so poorly managed and those who led us to be in such poor financial state seemed to be the ones who benefited.  There was little to no logical thought process around the decisions to eliminate certain positions or teams, no collaboration or communication between Evariant and Healthgrades and mass confusion post sale. The company and those that profited only wanted to get to the finish line and collect their money. A comprehensive and well thought out plan to transition the right roles and people was an afterthought, with executive favorites being “saved”  and found roles with Healthgrades, whether those roles made any sense."

Fun, smart coworkers! Lots of fun people and a company where you have the ability to learn a lot, especially about the healthcare industry.

CRM and Predictive Models - basically a Porsche compared to competitors

Constantly changing and evolving--- I put this as a Pro but it could be a Con if you don't like innovation and change and aren't flexible.","Training: Healthgrades does not do a great job of training it's employees, although they are getting better. Checking the Lessonly box does not = adequate training. New products are rolled out with little to no training and the DCD and IMM team are expected to sell with little to no knowledge on how they will actually be able to deliver. Every year another competitor is acquired with the promise of integrating the new team member and training.  This didn't happen after the Influence Health acquisition, I wouldn't count on it now that Evariant has been acquired, although HR and others will tell you differently.

Accountability: There is a lack of accountability and a culture of throwing people under the bus. This happens at every level and across all teams. This has been a common theme the entire time I have worked at the company.

HG CRM: the new platform has a lot of potential but was implemented too soon and with ZERO training. If you are unlucky enough to have a client live on the new platform you will spend 80% of your time chasing answers from the internal team who will point you in 8 different directions, none of which will be helpful.

Employee Feedback & Success Metrics: reviews are done on an annual basis and are based around the VERY subjective core values. This makes sense except that nothing is measurable. You never know if you're doing something wrong or could improve upon something until it's too late. There are no KPIs and if there are, they are not communicated.

Career growth opportunities: HR will likely respond to this telling you they rolled out a career map, which is useless unless managers are able to answer the question ""what do I need to do to make me more qualified for x position?"" often times managers are too concerned with themselves and their own clients to be present for their team.  

Management: Upper management has built a culture of fear over the past year. I have witnessed multiple team members in tears because of the unprofessional emails and conversations they have received from AVPs and higher. Some directors abuse their client travel trips and overlap it with personal trips (and post it online) while your questions and emails go unanswered. In my experience managers have little to no control, in fact I have been told my multiple managers and directors they feel that they aren't really in a management role. I have experienced upper management and HR tell managers not to answer employee questions. Does this sound like they are committed to your success?"

I.e. in many ways, they still operate as five separate companies instead of a single, focused entity.

Very few executives and leaders are empowered to make effective, timely decisions that support their annual strategic plans.

One very poor leader seems to drive most turnover but there seems to be very little interest in addressing that issue.

135,Healthgrades,A mess of a company at all levels,2018-06-05,1.0,Product,"Convenient location, ample work space due to the massive amount of layoffs and people resigning.","1. Lack of transparency: When I worked here, I asked several different people at varying levels what the overall goal and future of Healthgrades was. Each time I got a different answer. Additionally, a lot of employees  have no concept of what is actually going on in the trenches and how every idea they decide on a whim actually impacts people's sanity. 

2. Abuse of benefits: People use work from home a ridiculous amount, often times not telling the rest of their team. Sometimes they are rarely in the office and impossible to get a hold of. 

3. Technical debt: Anybody looking to go into the engineering side of things my advice to you is to run far far away. Each squad used entirely different stacks and the website itself was built out of pure nightmares. A perfect example of this is when they attempted to simply update ""fonts and colors"" and decided it would only take two weeks to make these changes, that turned out to take TWO MONTHS because the code was so terrible and it remains awful. 

4. Opportunities for women: Sadly this company is another shining example of how women are not respected within the technology spectrum. There are no strong female leaders and the level of misogyny and mansplaining is despicable. Often times I would overhear conversations and would just hear the arrogance and belittling done when a female member of the team was speaking and they were never be reprimanded for it. Also, if you interject your opinion on anything and you are a women, prepare to never get promoted or get a raise and almost expect a layoff in your future.

5. Favoritism: From what I witnessed in my department,  often times positions are filled with friends of people in higher positions and often times without discussing with the rest of the team or even explaining what their role was. 

6. Employee support: Very unsupportive and while they would take the time to listen to you, rarely was anything done about any concerns brought up. Additionally, the last two layoffs in the worst and most unprofessional manner I have ever experienced. Most had NO IDEA about any of the second round of layoffs.

6. Overall company stability: I honestly do not see this company lasting much longer. The majority of the staff have smartly jumped ship and the actual product that Healthgrades is trying to corner in the market is irrelevant. They have no clear vision on what they want to do, who their target market is and forget about trying to be any sorts of innovative. Anybody looking to work with this company, my advice is to move on because by your third week you will be frustrated and angry the majority of your day and this company is simply not worth it.

7. Leadership: This company has none and continues to deal with power struggles up at the top. While some are trying to grab as much power as possible, it pushes more qualified and deserving employees to the side. It is sad to see such promise in a company give way to egos.

8. To those thinking about working at this company, don't. It is an extremely toxic work environment as well as super unstable. In nearly a year there have been three major reorganization attempts, with each being more unsuccessful than the last. Yes the generous vacation time and work / life balance is enticing but pay is way below market."

154,Healthgrades,Great place for looking at the internet,2018-02-14,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've always enjoyed looking at the internet, and I found Healthgrades to be a really good place to do that. There was occasionally some work to do, but it was less of an obstacle than you would imagine. Probably a third of the projects I worked on just got delayed for so long that they eventually disappeared — either the person in charge left or got laid off, or more often, there was no single person in charge, which meant no one was actually accountable for the job getting finished.

Even when someone was in charge of a project, you still didn't want to invest too much time or energy in it, because there was always a better-than-even chance that it would get drastically reworked at the eleventh hour. The folks at the head office in Denver are just bubbling with ideas! When you have that many ideas, you don't have time to sit around and see how one performs — once it's out in the market, you must immediately replace it with a new idea. Credit where it's due: The powers that be at Healthgrades were never afraid to blow everything up and start over. Like, never afraid. Like, you'd think, ""Maybe these people *should* be a little afraid, because, gosh, wow, we've blown everything up so many times and we have virtually nothing to show for it, and yet sometimes they wonder aloud on conference calls why we have trouble getting traction in the industry."" But they were just so undaunted. It was kind of inspiring — like, whoa, maybe a bunch of Irish setters *could* run a nationally known company if you just promoted all of them to VP and kept giving them venture capital.

(If you desperately want to be a VP, that would be another decent reason to try working at Healthgrades. Literally 80 percent of the company is VPs. The guy who repaired the coffee machine was promoted to ""VP, Coffee Access Solutions"" one day, just because he was in the right place at the right time.)

And speaking of conference calls: There were a lot of them. Didn't matter if you were working on a quick, routine job virtually identical to something you'd done the previous month, or discussing the launch of a major product that could make or break the entire company — either way, you were gonna kick things off with a call that ran over by anywhere from 10 to 40 minutes. Again, the good thing about this was that it gave you a lot of time to look at the internet. You rarely had to listen too hard, because about half the time, the person in charge of the project didn't have any real information about it yet (but had gone ahead with the meeting because it was the only space everyone had open on their calendars); the other half of the time, the person in charge wouldn't actually be on the call, or could only be on the call for about 10 minutes, because they had another meeting. Point is, you knew you were going to have to ask for direction via email later regardless — which was fine, because by that time the direction would probably have changed already anyway.

The only time we didn't have a conference call, or even a project input form, or anything, was when we revamped the entire Healthgrades B2B website. So that was bold! In fairness to the folks leading that effort, it didn't turn out any better or worse than the jobs we bothered to plan for.

I guess in a sense, working at Healthgrades was a very Buddhist experience. There was very little reason to remember what you'd done before or to consider what might happen in the future; everything was in constant flux. Your best bet was just to focus on the present moment.

Anyhoo, if you need to make a positive difference in the world with your work, there are a lot of places where you can do that. If you just need to spin your wheels for a while and look at the internet, and you want OK compensation and benefits, I would say maybe give Healthgrades a try. The company did manage to attract a bunch of smart, talented, thoughtful people during my time there, which was a sincere pleasure. And although almost all of those people are gone now, who knows, it could happen again!","It was disheartening to watch a bunch of smart, talented, thoughtful people gradually have their souls sucked out. I also felt pretty garbagey about working for a company that purports to advocate for healthcare consumers, but runs an online advertising program that helps pharma firms directly target the patients of doctors known for being ""high prescribers."""

This is hands down the worst place I have ever worked in terms of management and leadership. In their desperation to enrich themselves when the company goes public, the executive team has completely lost sight of the very important mission of the business. Unethical behavior and conflicts of interest are tolerated and even encouraged.

One of the most fundamental problems at Healthgrades is that no one can explain in simple terms what the company does (especially on the business-to-business side). Everything is very siloed and there is constant disagreement between stakeholders that keeps products from getting to market in a timely fashion (and makes it harder to sell them to prospective customers once they are there or almost there). There are WAY too many ""chiefs"" (i.e., VPs) and not enough ""Indians,"" and everyone is out for themselves. The worst part of this is that the people doing the hard work are continually set up to fail, while the ""leadership"" skates by.  It is no surprise that people are leaving the company in droves."
157,Healthgrades,Amateur hour at its finest.,2018-02-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great PTO. Agile, cross-functional software development teams.","I dont even know where to start. Joke of a company. I joined bc I wanted to help people find the right healthcare. The company is caught in total conflict between helping consumers and getting money from hospitals. They SAY they want to help people, but they constantly make decisions to make money from their antiquated business models at the expense of the unknowing consumer.  Not to mention the many conflicts of interest.
Internally, the culture is pretty toxic, the CTO has been on a blood rampage since he started a year or so ago. It's clear he will do anything to try to impress the board and get himself the coveted CEO position. He's venomous and crafty, he's ousted, demoted or outright fired any person that gets in his way.
There's a lot of ""Idea Hero syndrome"" (handing over an idea on a napkin to a team) going around, everyone has a shinny new idea that they want the development teams to implement with little to no evidence or vetting on the idea. It forces the teams to constantly pivot (for no good reason) or cram more work into their committed roadmaps. 
Just no, its a sinking ship, they are bleeding money, killing off people and nothing makes sense. 
It doesnt help that HR is completely useless  and dont advocate for taking care of their people.  Multiple sexual harassment claims against higher-ups; those VP's and directors still walk the halls, meanwhile the  victims have had to leave. They even opened a 24/7 hotline because there are so many problems and complaints. 
Oh, lets not forget the total lack of diversity, every office is filled with a white man (with a few exceptions).  Virtually no female leadership. When confronted with this lack of diversity their official response was ""we just cant find any, they must not be out there"".

While the flexibility and time off was a huge Pro, I felt it was damaging when meetings had to be continuously rescheduled or postponed due to 'so and so' being off. Because there was a lack of ownership of who could make final decisions and everyone had to have their opportunity to share their opinion, it only slowed down the momentum for change and we could never come to a final decision.
 Many of the people I interacted with were intelligent and committed to having impact in the market, but could never spread their wings and fly. We literally scratched our heads at times and tried to make sense of the madness that was pushed down from above.

Convenient downtown location which is close to many restaurants.","Well, it’s hard to know where to start when it comes to cons for this company. Unfortunately their “reorganization” has impacted numerous employees- and I’d have to say it’s been for the bad. Placing people in departments (‘reorganizing’) who clearly don’t belong there, is frustrating not only for the employee, but for their teammates. If you do plan on proceeding with this plan you need to provide better training. This “reorganization’ has also resulted in recent lay offs across all campuses. 

The management is all over the place. I agree with other reviewers. A decision is made and changed over night. There is no clear direction from upper management. If you try to help another department you do get into trouble rather than receiving a thank you & a pat on the back. 

In addition, Human Resources is also all over the place. Although friendly, they are never timely. Their HR skills are definitely questionable and I think they need some additional training on how to handle certain situations.

They also seem to handle out the titles of “Vice President” and other executive titles left and right. These titles have no meaning to them because of this. How can 60% of your employees be VPs?"

Additionally, there are those who came in and worked tirelessly to get the projects in and out while others are sitting around chatting for good chunks at a time and still have jobs.

- Generous PTO (4 weeks if you're hourly) or ETO (6 weeks if you're salaried) + holidays
- Sometimes you get a bonus in the spring
- Some jobs offer commission
- Company culture events and parties
- Most employees are friendly and knowledgeable","- Some employees have terrible attitudes and are extremely negative and at times, very unprofessional. These are the people who will get rewarded with raises and bonuses.
- CEO preaches transparency, but sincerely lacks it.
- Company doesn't want to operate in silos, but when you try to assist another department, you get in trouble. 
- Processes are in place to stop last-minute requests from coming in, but somehow our team is constantly inundated with last minute requests that are ""high priority."" When everything is considered high priority, nothing really is...
- Sales team doesn't know how to sell digital products other than websites and PPC, so they don't. This is a shame. They also guarantee all kinds of things (because they get commission) to clients and potential clients, but don't seem to care what happens with their promises down the road. Often times, the things they've promised are not things that can or should be delivered, and it creates frustration for everyone.
- Noticeable lack of female representation at the top.

163,Healthgrades,No Transparency or Leadership,2018-01-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Six weeks paid vacation. Some flexibility to work from home (depending on your team). Pay is decent for the industry.,"There are no real leaders at this company. Every time a fresh face comes in with real leadership skills and ideas to make the company better, they’re shown the door before any real change can happen, or they jump ship because they see where we’re really headed. Leadership changes their minds about the goals and direction of the company on a dime. 

Don’t even get me started on the “Good ‘ol boys club” and the lack of female representation among our executive and senior level teams. Everyone with a Y chromosome is guaranteed a VP position at some point – regardless of aptitude or ability. Women are lucky if they can get to the director level here. And they have to fight for it.

This company talks a big talk about transparency as a core value, but they won’t even disclose the total number of employees they just let go. AND they won’t tell the existing staff who was cut. So now we’re running around like chickens with our heads cut off trying to figure out who we still work with so we can get things done.

This company is going downhill fast, and I don’t see any way they can recover without being sold off for parts. They are clearly only interesting in selling the company at this point. The reviews here are abysmal, but so is the management. The only positive reviews are ones that HR solicited employees to give to outweigh the negativity expressed about the company online. 

If you’re smart, talented and looking for a fulfilling job in tech, look elsewhere. If you’re looking to keep a seat warm and collect a paycheck, feel free to apply."

Interesting work, very nice people on teams.",CEO and Chief People Person are very out of touch. CEO has ties to vendors which seems to be a conflict of interest. CPP bases her decisions on her feelings towards people v. Real data. No senior leadership based in Madison in over a year.
165,Healthgrades,Look Elsewhere,2018-01-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are some great people who still work here. They offer six weeks vacation a year. Some teams are able to keep a flexible schedule with work from home days.,"The company is flailing. They just cut ~10% of the staff, and it seems like there could be even more cuts. They are actively trying to sell the company ASAP, so there's not much stability or consistency in the near future here. 

It used to be a lot better place to work, but I'd only recommend it now to someone who is really desperate for a job. And even then, I'd warn that it will be a constant struggle. You have to be okay with constant chaos and daily struggles. 

Leadership gives little to no direction, and when they do make a decision, it changes the next day. It's almost impossible to get anything done that actually impacts the company's goals because those goals are constantly changing. Leadership is lacking in every reasonable area of leadership. 

The reviews on here are absolutely true, except the ones that have clearly been planted as positive reviews."
166,Healthgrades,Analyst,2018-01-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The work that Healthgrades does has a real impact on patient lives. The quality of care provided by physicians in America is striated, yet patients currently have no way of prospectively evaluating where their prospective physician fits into the quality distribution. The data assets and patient exposure that Healthgrades enjoys has the power to put that information in front of 1mm patients/day.  The work people do at Healthgrades matters and can be a source of purpose for every member of the Company. 

The people at Healthgrades are incredibly intelligent, hard-working, and fun to work with. I learned a lot working here and met colleagues I hope to continue to work with later in my career. 

The perks and compensation at Healthgrades are top notch. I do think there is a bit of a ""wage gap"" in some areas, but I also think Healthgrades pays above market in other. If I had to guess, the overcompensation and under-compensation cancel each other out.","To job applicants - The organizational challenges listed in other comments are very real. During your interview I encourage you to explore your role's decision rights and delve into what areas of the business you will be able to impact. Don't fall for red herring job descriptions. Just because a position is defined as having agency over a certain part of the business does not mean you will actually be able to impact it. Ask your future boss/interviewer for examples of past success in their career (as well as successes of the person you're backfilling). 

To current employees - Please don't get bogged down in all of the cons and try to focus on the positives. It's hard, but someone needs to execute on HG's mission. I thought it would be me, but unfortunately it was not. Just keep your head down and continue to put the patient first."

The reviews on Glassdoor are accurate (except the fake good ones), anyone that takes a position at Healthgrades has been warned.  C level leaders are poisonous, petty, and vindictive. CIO is worthless, he sabotages the company while he fools the ownership. I’ve never seen a company treat its talented and kind employees so horribly while they promote the least talented and ruthless employees. HR is worse than uninvolved, they actively work to protect and promote bad behavior. Just scan their lame responses to every bad review and you will start to understand their smokescreen and ineptness. This is a company laying off talented engineers in a good economy. Ask yourself why a company would layoff great engineers but keep a myriad of VPs that don't do anything but fight? Clearly they are not done squeezing out every last penny to their personal coffers. The outlook is grim. Any hope that the ship will be righted has now been evicerated. Management constantly pivots to generate work and mask their failures. The company is literally downsizing to a smaller old school open office space - a 1980’s style sweatshop a la “9 to 5”. I'm trying to find another job right now, as fast as I can!

169,Healthgrades,Read the other Reviews: Stay Far Away,2018-01-04,1.0,Senior Leader,"ealthgrades - as a company, replete with its leaders and culture - has striking similarities to another group: to understand the brokenness and toxicity of Healthgrades, study the current presidential administration.

We are taught in school to provide a balanced view of our experiences. ""Don't just focus on the bad; look for the good."" That is difficult to do for Healthgrades. When a plane is crashing, what is the good? ""This breeze streaming in through the shattered windows is nice."" ""I feel so alive right now!"" ""It's pleasant to have all the trifling things in my life melt away so I can focus on what's really important!"" But at the end of the day, the plane is going down. It will crash.

So here are the positives about Healthgrades, in no order of priority:
Healthgrades provides an exceptional example of how not to operate a company; how not to lead (it is ripe to be a Harvard Case Study)
There is tea and coffee available in the breakrooms","Imagine the classic Recycle, Reduce, Reuse logo. It's a feedback loop. Each activity impacts the preceding and the following activity. I mention this because I could choose any number of places to jump in and outlines what is broken at Healthgrades and it will lead and impact multiple other bad behaviors. But let's start with the most critical piece, the piece that we will continually return to: leadership. There is no escaping the fact that leadership is exceptionally toxic at Healthgrades. Having been in multiple industries and companies, Healthgrades possesses the worst leadership I've seen in my two decades of work.

First, leadership is spineless. Healthgrades has - for years - been led by people who are unwilling to make tough decisions. They are more than happy to collect a large paycheck, but fundamentally do not understand that they earn that paycheck by making discrete choices. It's easy to say yes to everything. It's tough to make bets and say no so you can focus on the organization.

Second, leaders are unable to focus, because the senior leadership team is a confederation of individual kingdoms, with each leader constantly working to expand his or her own fiefdom. This is most clear with one of the current leaders. His mode of operation is to reach into multiple other areas of responsibility - without the authority to do so - and begin to act and move resources at his whim. He has actively worked to create confusion and duplication of resources in his departments so we can undermine the efforts and authority of others in the organization. What is worse is his own departments are on fire, have not been able to deliver on their purpose within the organization, while this leader busies himself with blaming others and expanding his personal Q score. 

Yet he has been allowed to do so. And other leaders see this happening, so they begin to adopt the same tactics. Rather than state ""I will not be complicit in this farce"" these leaders decide to adapt to it. Why? Because of fear. Healthgrades is rules by a persistent, ubiquitous culture of fear. One leader is fearful of another, because he is more connected to the ownership group. Another is fearful of all leaders because she generally doesn't want to get caught in the crossfire. The Sales Leaders are fearful of their own people, because go-forbid they actually ask their sales people to actually come off the golf course to do their jobs!

So the fear manifests itself in multiple ways. Groups/Committees/etc. are brought together to make decisions, but it doesn't matter what anyone says in that meeting. People will agree and then get sabotaged. And when they are sabotaged, that person blames others. And the cycle continues.

You could, and should, expect a leader - who is fully aware of this behavior - to do something about this. He can't. He is a figurehead. An emperor without clothes. There is a shadow leader for Healthgrades, protected by board members and whose personal mandate is hidden to everyone below the senior level. 

But here is the issue with this leader: he is not a business leader. He is not ruled by sound business decision making. He cannot converse or make decisions based on a metered, business assessment. He resides in the Atlanta office where senior leaders with offer shifty-eyed endorsements of his 'genius,' fearful that they ever be questioned on their true thoughts about his capabilities. If audience is required with him, it is to make sure he will not become a hindrance, to ensure that he can just be convinced to acquiesce. He neither listens to what is said to him nor to what he really says in response. He puts his faith in his instincts (which are poor and based on lucking into previous success). He is pampered and surrounded by lackeys, groveling for the scraps. And other leaders are too easily satisfied with this arrangement.

There was a glimmer of hope 12-18 months ago. There appeared a reasonable group that had arrived to help build a team approach and take pride in a hard days work. New blood was brought in. The leadership team and the Board appeared to recognize that the old way, the toxic culture, was undermining their own interests. 

As of this week, that is revealed to have been false hope. Healthgrades has announced more changes. There has been a leadership reshuffling, and the leaders that were shining a light on the dysfunction AND providing the right solutions, have been escorted out the building. The old guard, the old culture, has won out. The talk of ""a new day"" and ""changing our ways"" 12-18 months ago, was more theater. The long tenured leaders were being found out (which has been apparent to the rest of the organization for years) and they circled the wagons. They aren't done picking the last bits of meat off the bones of the company.

I could go on. But then it just starts to become noise. The reviews on Glassdoor are accurate. I didn't trust them. I expected I could be a part of the change. Some things are too far gone.

The summary: stay far away from Healthgrades. I 'survived' the reduction of force announced this week. I'm actively making plans for my own exit."

In general, this is the most unorganized, dysfunctional, low morale organization I've ever had the displeasure of working at. I know it might just sound like I'm a bitter employee but I'm really not. I offer this warning to you as one human being to another.. do not work here unless you are in DIRE need of money... and even then... donate plasma or something. 

I don't know where they scrape these bargain bin executives from but they are seriously lacking in their ability to lead the organization in a cohesive direction. In the last several years I've almost lost track of how many different presidents we've gone through. There's never a reason to pay attention to the ""flavor of the week"" corporate vision announced at quarterly meetings because it will just change in the next one. Executives live and breath a blame culture. Instead of owning problems and LEADing change, blame gets passed on down the line where it lands on the lowest level employees. Executives then have meetings where they wonder why the culture has deteriorated and their solution has generally been to hire more executives. There are departments where management literally outnumber workers. 

Turnover is absolutely through the roof. Most people with any semblance of talent have left for better opportunities, better pay, better culture, etc. Morale is horrible for those that are left. There has literally been feces rubbed on the walls of the bathrooms by employees (this is a real thing, not a metaphor). The company tells employees to leave 5 star reviews because on Glassdoor so beware of overly optimistic reviews on here.

- Low Turnover: Turnover is defined as the rate at which employees leave a workforce and are replaced.  Since employees are rarely replaced, the turnover rates for HG is actually pretty decent.
- Opportunities to Learn: Because no one that leaves is getting back-filled, numerous teams need extra hands, so if you're looking to move into a different role, there are plenty of opportunities to do so at HG.  The caveat is that you are unable to shed your prior duties/role as part of this process.","- Ridiculous Attrition Rates: In a 9-month period I witnessed almost 40 people leave HG with all of 5 positions getting back-filled during that time period.  A year ago my team had 7 people, the day I walked out the door there was only 1 person on the team left.  Not a single back-fill posting was made, either externally or internally.
- Support Severely Outdated Technology: While HG is making some moves into newer technologies, there are plenty of legacy systems that are stuck a decade in the past.  These systems often require the most TLC which translates into many after-hours support calls and work.
- The ""Core Values"" of the Company are not Rewarded, but rather Punished: The culture being developed at HG is in direct contrast to the advertised ""Core Values"".  Doing what is ""encouraged"" is often rewarded with more work, less support, and fewer resources.  As a result people often are forced to avoid responsibility unless its completely unavoidable.
- Incompetent or Unqualified Management: I have a hard time identifying which one is worse, but much (not all, mind you, though a vast majority) of management brought in over the past year is lacking (most times severely) in healthcare knowledge, lacking in knowledge of those products/skills/technologies they oversee, or are just plain poor people managers in general."

201,Healthgrades,Beware of TOXIC Sludge,2017-02-21,1.0,Engineer,"Intelligent and hard working people. Delicious free coffee. Not much after that since monthly, quarterly and annual perks have disappeared.","With the loss of clients left and right due to the lack of proper financial investment into the company's infrastructure, security, resources and staffing, the company is very much behind the times. One has to argue with management to get any money spent on necessary tools. If any purchases are made, decisions are not thoroughly vetted and are chosen based on what's the cheapest of choices. How can a company excel when employees are literally told to make cheap decisions quickly? Upper management constantly promote themselves and other incompetent employees with increased compensation and bloated titles than what is compensated to those on the bottom that are overworked and under-appreciated. The company is very top-heavy! What's the difference between a Team Lead, Manager, Director, VP, EVP, SVP, C-level titles? You don't need all of these titles for 1 department. Many of these titles don't even have direct reports!

Executives spew Core Values of Transparency, but it's very much a ""do as I say, not as I do"" environment.  The rounds of layoffs in August 2016 affected all company locations to the point where the Executives held limited conference calls expressing that they had no idea that the effect would be so great to the morale and perception of company stability.  What management does not understand is that the employees are close-knit across sites; many have been with the company for over 10 years. To promise transparency on one hand and blind-side us with the other is a red flag that management truly doesn't get it.  

Compensation is NOT competitive. Even when this is brought up as a concern to management, the reason is due to market value. Many recent former employees have found employment where compensation is at least a double digit percentage from what they were receiving at Healthgrades for the same/similar job responsibilities.  That speaks volumes on how the company is not paying true market value for the positions in the area.  Employees are extremely disgruntled to the point where feces is smeared on restroom stalls and puddles of urine are made as unfortunate surprises for others. Things are getting that bad at Healthgrades!

Burned-out employees do not last long.  Throw in the loss of talent, loss of historical knowledge, loss of perks, loss of PTO (good luck with unlimited leave!), loss of work-life balance, the awareness that competitive compensation and genuine appreciation exists at other companies, then high turnover rates will continue.  How many 2-week notices and farewell parties must you hear of to realize that the ship is sinking because management doesn't care about employee retention?  Management has stated that it's not a part of their job to retain employees. Wouldn't that be in the company's best interest to lessen turnover? The outsourced overseas company, Happiest Minds, is causing more trouble that it's worth. Remember how hiring EMIDS went in 2014/2015?"

Everyone in the company has a different priority and we are hearing ""that's not my job"" more and more from our co-workers.   As you can see, there are horrible, horrible reviews on here, and leadership chalks it up to ""another disgruntled employee"".  They don't actually listen to what the employees want or need because by in large, they simply don't care.  They hired a ""Chief People Officer"" which is quite comical, being that she doesn't seem to care about anyone but the executives.  She's been to Madison several times, and never truly made an effort to get to know anyone.   While we're on HR, Recruitment is a joke.  We're busting our hinders to get the work done, and it takes 6 months to get someone in the door.

(Yes, leaders, we all talk about our salaries and are aware of how terrible your recognition/reward structure is).  There is also no flexible scheduling.  It's time Healthgrades joined the 21st century and offered some flexible options.  There are WAY too many leaders and not nearly enough people that do the work.  Healthgrades says that there isn't money and so job openings are being cut, yet they can continue to hire VPs and SVPs at what is surely way over what a ""worker bee's"" salary would be. 

Bottom line-if you are a talented, driven and all around good worker, PLEASE reconsider working here.  Your talents will dwindle and you'll easily become overworked and underappreciated.  If you're not a hard worker, mediocre at your job, then Healthgrades is the place for you!"

211,Healthgrades,"Stressful, thankless and behind the times",2016-12-09,1.0,Ops,"Following what others have said, the main pro I can think of is the location of the office in Denver.","Stress levels are crazy. It's impossible to get the job done well, and there is a ton of pressure to meet deadlines while also dealing with constant requests from teams all over the country. They demand a lot from you without much in return. Individually I like everyone I work with, but as a whole, it's not so great because everyone is stressed and just trying to get by, and it's hard to remain a positive team-player all the time when you are constantly under stress and frustrated.

Management is incompetent and does not hire people in the correct positions. There are a lot of talented people out there who could help make Healthgrades better, but Healthgrades seems to hire people who don't have the right background or skill level to make big positive changes. On the flip side, there aren't enough people hired to get the bulk of the work done -- all the not so glamorous work that takes a special type A personality to do well. This company is very top-heavy with higher-level managers who just talk and talk and talk and talk and talk without anything being accomplished. A lot of time is wasted with pointless meetings and discussions, yet the worker bees are still expected to attend these meetings while also trying to cram 14 hours of work into a single day.

Technology and products are outdated and they seem to just copy what other publishers are doing instead of trying to lead the way in the industry. It takes a really long time to implement new processes, and just when they do, they change their mind and decide to go another way. It's frustrating to spend a whole year or more developing a new process that works great, only to have it trashed for a political reason or because someone feels like it.

Training is a joke. Most managers have no clue what their employees need to do in order to get their work done. Almost no one receives training, and most employees are too busy to train new employees well because they too are drowning every day, or not given any incentive to help. It's basically a vicious cycle that's really hard to break out of, much like the cycle of poverty, drugs or corruption."

The company leans heavily on it's strong performers while it's hard to determine what some people's roles in the company are. Under-performing employees stick around way too long and it puts additional strain on all of the top performers.
Senior Management makes inappropriate comments about personnel who are looking for a new career including, ""we should hire someone to dig up dirt on people so they won't leave the company.""

Management puts the cart before the horse when it comes to rolling out products and services.  This means that we say we do or can do something before we even know if we can.  This leads to empty promises with clients and scrambling to piece things together without a process to try to deliver something close to what is promised.

In the last 5 months (since the new CIO was hired) the morale amongst engineers has steadily degraded.  I've seen C-level hirings and firings a number of times in my career, and there is always some upheaval that goes with it.

If you have any ideas, share concerns, participate in teamwork, or are helpful in anyway and you're not one of the favorites then you will be written up or reprimanded for not ""following the proper channels"". 
If you share ideas or present new ways of doing something and ask for feedback you will be reprimanded or isolated.

If you have anything innovative or exciting to add that will help the company be more efficient, productive or that will help the team and you share it, you will be perceived as making the upper management look bad and in return they will either write you up, alienate you from the rest of the team or will say you're doing something wrong with no details as to what you did wrong.  With the new objective goal structure and values that were rolled out by the CEO, you will not receive what your or your teams goals are, you won't have regular meetings with your manager to go over your goals or performance, and if you try to speak up about that you will be put on the radar and tee'd up for termination.  
If you go to HR to express concern you will be told to ""just hang in there"" or ""if it's that bad, you should start looking"". If a whole team goes at once to HR to express concerns, HR will leave the management as is and the team will just quit as a result.

The perception is that emphasis is placed on hiring more and more Executive level leadership positions & there is not a focus on filling the ""worker bee"" positions. There has been a mass exodus of employees since the last change in Executive level leadership and the employees who remain are stuck wearing multiple hats to fill the roles & responsibilities of those who left as they are not backfilling many open positions. 

The Executive level leaders do not seem to agree; you are told to change direction by one leader & then abruptly stopped mid change & told to go in a completely different direction by another leader. Communication throughout the organization is severely lacking so when they say 'people first' is the culture you certainly don't feel that is true when you are continuously left in the dark & forced to speculate as no one will give you an honest answer as to what is going on or what can be expected next. 

Healthgrades implemented OKRs which fundamentally can be beneficial for people and the organization but they were implemented when the foundational pieces to sustain them were missing &/or broken. The Executive leaders have also decided to tie performance goals to OKRs which goes against the spirit of OKRs based on the documentation they gave us to read on OKRs. 

The expectation is that you are always available so there truly is no work life balance. 

There has never been a clearly defined or iterative roadmap(s) & the majority of work that is done is to ""stop the bleed"" & ""put out fires"".

254,Healthgrades,Lacks Focus,2016-06-14,2.0,Software Engineer,"This company has some very positive things going for it. The data it owns and processes is second to none in the industry. The company encourages the use of leading-edge tech, from Angular, React and ES6 to REST services and AWS.

The company's new CEO is transparent and communicates regularly. The company is transitioning to a more autonomous squad-based model, based on what Spotify uses. This has the potential to speed up the company's product delivery, which is hugely important given the monolithic projects of the company's past.

Compensation here is a bit above average, and the benefits are decent. The 401k is now great, with automatic contributions and very good fund choices. The available health plans are above average, if a bit expensive. Additionally, good performance is rewarded.","Unfortunately, the company also has more than its fair share of issues, not the least of which is its huge amount of technical debt. In the previous delivery model, corners were very frequently cut in order to meet dates. Of course this happens in many places, but the issue here is just how enormous the technical debt is. The new delivery model puts more power in the hands of engineering, and it does try to allocate time to address this, but not nearly enough to achieve the goal of continuous delivery any time soon.

Another problem at the company is the unrealistic expectations it has of its delivery leads, under both the old model and the new. In the time I have been at the company, I have seen many leads leave because they are stuck in worthless meetings all day and have no time left to actually get anything done. The new model does not address this. Instead, delivery leads now have more busy work than ever with newly introduced processes and responsibilities, all for the sake of increasing visibility and driving toward squad autonomy. Sadly, most of the company's squads are still as interdependent as ever; time will tell how much this really changes.

Meanwhile, for individual contributors, the workload is all over the map. Deadline pressure comes primarily from the product side, and often does not take effort into consideration. Because the delivery leads are stuck in meetings all day, and because product has huge difficulty defining priority (EVERYTHING is important), most teams are hugely lacking in focus. If you are self-driven, there is no shortage of work here on any team, but you may have to go get it.

Recruiting is horribly broken and very disconnected from the rest of the company. It has supposedly been the company's number one focus, but very few changes have actually been realized. Potential hires, especially the best ones, fall through the cracks on a daily basis."

Data-driven approach. If you believe in using a data-informed strategy to solve marketing challenges then this is the place for you. HG holds a massive amount of healthcare data through our clients' CRM, user data from healthgrades.com, and other outside sources. I'm always thinking about how we can leverage this data and so is the rest of the team from our data scientists down to our strategists.

Large scale, but small feel. I've worked in small companies for most of my career and HG is one of the largest firms I've been employed by. It manages to maintain the feel of a smaller company, but I have the ability to see my ideas scale to large and sophisticated healthcare systems all over the US.","Start-up atmosphere.

The company doesn't move fast enough to keep up with trends in the digital health space, so you're always playing catch up. Management is very conservative when it comes to innovation and experimentation, which is pretty key to a successful digital company. Focus on healthcare consumers is never the main focus because that contradicts the main focus on hospitals and clients. To transform the space, focus needs to shift to providing an objective, transparent resource to consumers. 

The company's single largest problem is with retention and recruitment, yet they do nothing to address that. The benefits over the last year have gotten way worse, and they were pretty bad to begin with. The ""best"" health insurance plan premium increased by 500% in one year. The generous employee referral program got cut from $2,500 to $500 with a ton of contingencies. The wellness program isn't really a wellness program, it's a website full of webinars that you can listen to if you have time. There are no health and wellness perks and the company doesn't offer transportation discounts for public transportation or parking. You'll either be paying to park every single day or paying to take the bus or light rail every single day.

The insanity is driven by a level of politics and backstabbing that is unthinkable for a large company.  Additionally, we have experienced slow growth and it has caused continous restructuring as we head into 2015.  Even worse, employees like myself have experienced missed pay periods where finance team literally opts to not pay us at all.  I have seen other such comments posted and its the TRUTH.  Im told we are preparing for something big in 2015 and our finance team is getting skittish over our profitability, but its no excuse.  I do not need to chase down people to simply get my earned salary.

In close, please avoid this place at all costs.  The outlook of this company is extremely poor."

-Politics is off the charts!  No good work can get done with constant backstabbing
-Clients are leaving for competitors and leadership is clueless in responding to it

Given this, anyone coming in that has high energy has the potential to get involved in shaping what this place will become.  Many reviews reflect many of the issues encountered during the cycle of a venture capital purchase, which seemingly, this place is on the tail end of.  By and large it feels that most of those issues are behind the organization.  Most employees are highly motivated and want to get things done quickly.  This is an opportunity to work on a very active consumer facing website and get exposed to all of the day to day activities that come along with it.  The environment is very fast paced.","Due to the fact that the place is in a state of great transition (though at the end of it) there are problems with having too small of a staff to accomplish all of the goals of the organization.  Also, the organization is now too BIG to act like a start up.  Being in the middle is a tough spot and will take awhile to implement and respect the processes that will mitigate a lot of the growing pains."

The high quality equipment they provide employees in their workspace, the environment we work in makes it easy to come to work. Large break rooms, free coffee and tea, cubicles with windows, ping pong tables, yoga stretching area, wearing jeans and flipflops support a positive work place. Every day, I feel appreciated and supported. Folks are responsive to every issue and concern, whether it's a helpdesk issue or HR. Over 4 weeks PTO a year (and this doesn't include holidays). Compared to my previous IT company, my health insurance costs me $300 less a month and yet the benefits are much better!! Nice 401k contribution by the company. Easy to get office supplies without micromanaging every dime in a department's budget. Easy to travel - things can go awry on work trips, it takes the stress and pressure off when their policies are flexible and clearly written by someone who was a road warrior like myself.",nothing comes to mind right now

We have a lot of smart, passionate people who are chasing this opportunity.","Depending on the location and part of the organization,  career advancement is not as well defined as many other companies.

334,Healthgrades,Great and Awful,2014-07-18,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Location. 

The people excluding executive and HR teams. 

Paid time off (PTO) benefit.","The executive team is shady in their supposed company goals. They seem to be like most other corporations in their greedy dealings, even though their message to employees at quarterly meetings is all about helping Americans make better healthcare choices. Meanwhile, they sign multi-year contracts with clients who own facilities (and sponsor their physicians) that make the content displayed on their site biased -- and not for the consumer's or patient's better interest. Example: If a client pays the right price to have data suppressed such as physicians' survey results or background history, they abide to the client's demands.

The HR team is not trustworthy.

Management overworks employees on a regular basis. They say that 12 hour work shifts including weekends will be over when a project is completed, but the projects and unrealistic deadlines set by them never really end. And when they get the team pizza or expense whatever delivery for dinner, they make people feel like it's a favor they're doing the employees.

Their technical teams don't follow any healthy project management methodologies. They went from Waterfall to Scrum to chaos. Hence, their unrealistic deadlines and unhealthy work schedules.

*** As of the summer of 2014, I still can't easily schedule time with my ex-coworkers who've remained friends for lunch, happy hour or dinner because they continue to be slave driven by their management / executive team."

Projects are poorly planned and there is little to no process depending on the department.  Deadlines are driven purely by ego and/or random and unexpected dates, and you'll work long nights and weekends trying to produce a poorly planned, scoped, and executed product.  Moreover, the fallout and cleanup of poor planning is felt for months after a product 'launch'. They claim to be agile, but it is really cowboy coding at it's worst, and all process has been intentionally dismantled for a 'code until it's done mentality'.  There are more Vice Presidents, Directors and other layers of management (many of whose purpose could be debated) than people producing products and when a deadline approaches, they'll be hovering around trying to give the illusion of value (i.e. scope change or scope creep).
