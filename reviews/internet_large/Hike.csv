Average Technology Stack
Office Location","All positive reviews are fake, mistakenly I go through the review & joined the company. And that’s my biggest mistake to join hike.
I don’t recommend this company especially for Software Engineers Role(Backend+Mobile) both.

Zero Work-life balance, High-pressure environment for all experiences(0..10 Years) of Engineers. Unrealistic deadlines for developers. 
No Saturday & Sunday even no working hours. U have to work till 12 AM midnight normally.

Hiring & Firing is normal here, so ur job is always insecure.
Initially, I thought it’s an engineering company but u hardly got time to learn new things.

If u r a Tech-oriented person with a dream to work for Google/Microsoft/Facebook etc than Never come to Hike. 
It's far away from ur expectations. It’s a complete a startup u ll always mess up with Hike work & High Working Pressure.

Example:- To develop a big module u ll get 3 - 4 days. Ideally, it would take 8-10 days. So now u can imagine of work pressure. 
Moreover, they will count ur Sat & Sundays in ur work estimate.

Tech stack is average & free food is the only positive thing I found here.

56,Hike,"Okay for fresh grads, not recommended for career driven folks at 3+ years of experience",2019-10-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. Pay and benefits are good. ( You are very likely to be overpaid.) This it makes a good place for those who prioritize current salary over long term career growth. Especially for those in their 30s, with no aspirations of moving into exec roles, this tends to work out well.

2. For fresh engineering grads, the end to end exposure to the stack is a decent opportunity. This makes most sense for those who are at under 18 months of experience or have not worked in a modern technology oriented company yet. After a point the returns of this are diminishing though. Once you've learnt the nitty-gritty, it makes sense to move on.

3. For several non-engineering roles, there is limited work to do in addition to the high pay mentioned in point 1. Finance executives / content specialist / customer support / operations / analyst folks are all paid significantly above market rate. So if you're looking for relaxed work and easy pay, it may make sense in these roles. Note that the downside is that there is no growth path for these roles, so choose wisely based on where you are on the balance between career growth orientation and immediate financial needs / need for time outside work.","1. Extreme survivorship bias amongst org leaders and leads. Most strong contributors have left, and the 'remainers' have seen disproportionate career growth (at least on paper) - without proper screening for their technical and managerial capabilities. This is largely due to a failure to onboard mid to senior folks from outside the company, leaving the management with little choice. Make sure you vet your eventual manager well. Do not join if you feel they cannot be capable mentors to you.

2. Growth for those at 3+ years of experience is not planned. Most such growth tends to be incidental (your manager leaving). It doesn't help that most managers, in terms of capability, are not too different from a 4-7 year experience band employee (even though some may have more experience on paper), and struggle to groom people who have gone past the first few years experience.

Disclaimer : For candidates that are not from institutions / companies that are considered to be in the top tier ( sorry for the snobbishness but I think this is a useful input), this may still be a good opportunity for some hands-on technical experience and a pay raise, at least for a 2-3 year time frame. Typically, people who are making a transition from this sort of a situation tend to be reasonably happy in the first 2-3 years.

For people with an entrepreneurial bent of mind / already in a top tech company / from an academic background that gets you interviews in the right places, this may not be the best place for your next gig. The only exception to this could be data science, where there has been a recent senior hire. If you're willing to bet on this person staying long-term, it may be worth some consideration.

3. Work-life balance for engineers can often go for a complete toss. Happens in other startups too, except the upside of hours spent toiling is not the same here as it would be in a high growth startup.

4. For those who look at things beyond immediate career growth, compensation and work-life balance, the company has some strategic challenges. In 7 years of existence, the company has failed to get a strong product market fit. The messaging market is pretty much lost, and so discovering social media niches is the focus of the current strategy. This leads to a lot of hit-and-trial sort of work that is more typical of earlier stage companies, in the hope that something will work. The challenge for Hike is that it has to deal with a lot more legacy code and tech debt than an early stage company. This leads to a significantly slower speed of iteration. Though well capitalized, funding is not infinite,and so there are only so many iterations that the company can go through at this point. The clock is ticking."

Good pay master","Work-life balance is non existent - Managers will ping you post workhours on week days and weekends asking you to hurry on things that are no where close to urgent or important 
No off time - there are no holidays given + teams are asked to come in on Saturdays frequently. On sundays you often start getting follow up mails for next week.
Planned holidays are difficult to get - even if you get it ...If you take a planned leave then get ready to get calls like you're working remotely - you will not get any time off unless of course you're the manager's favourite 
No focus on strategy- Company has no strategic vision
No focus on employee growth- growth path is extremely unclear
Biased managers- Top management has picked their favs and will not let any amount of feedback change their perspective, if you have a difference of opinion with them they will give you negative feedback
 Managers are clueless as to the good work you've done and will entirely focus on your negatives (however small) which is not uncommon however none of it constructive feedback

Not a good place for irrational folks (who get attached to their ideas and aren't willing to cut losses/do what needs to be done in a ruthless, competitive space)
Not the ideal place for people who are looking for guidance and direction all the time (instead of figuring things out themselves)"
92,Hike,Great place to work,2018-12-17,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"1. Great ownership: You can own entire pieces of tech and product and impact the user directly.

The 360 feedback is a very important thing and we should keep doing this.","We are a young organisation and thus decision making at times is affected by lack of experience. But plus point is everyone takes ownership and wants to learn from their mistakes as well.

Kudos to people operation team of the company who constantly work to attract best in the industry and take care of employees wellness by ensuring highly benchmarked benefits.
Company invests highly around the workplace to engage millennial’s and make it conducive for people to give their 100% and even more. 
I haven’t seen the kind of benefits this company provides anywhere else.
Definitely this company is the best paymasters at least in NCR.","The only advise about recruiting senior management is to deep dive and have references to avoid cultural mis-fits. 
I am also glad that company auto correct if any, mistake done in past."
153,Hike,Best Place to work,2018-03-11,5.0,Quality Engineer,"I'm working with hike from long, hike provide you an opportunity to learn, and move into any team.
People like each other and enjoy coming to work
People are invested in their jobs and not micro-managed
There are flexible hours and work schedules
HR team works well
Great company sponsored activities - summer outing, holiday party, themed events monthly","it's going good, keep up the good work"
154,Hike,Goliaths...you better watch out,2018-02-13,4.0,Head Corporate Function,"- I worked at Hike for just a shade less than an year. Whats positive??? Colleagues, Colleagues, Colleagues……..The one take away I have is the colleagues I worked with. A happy committed bunch of young extremely talented individuals. 
- I was one of the oldest employees (by age) to be working here, and the yet I felt completely at ease in the workplace. The sense of purpose, the energy and the commitment to the cause was something to be proud of.
- I could compare the energy and the mission here similar to a team working @ SpaceX trying to launch a new age space fleet. 
- The work environment (physical office) is amazing, and could easily give almost every firm out there a run for its money. Being a well funded startup, means that employee benefits and creature comforts come nice and smooth.","- We have to remind ourselves, Hike is in the “high risk-high reward” social business. If Hike were to succeed, the rewards for all would be 1000x and thats the upside we are all chasing for. An equation like that poses a very unique set of challenges on the firm. The firm continues to be battling giants in a match where the stakes are massive. 
- To put in context, think of “David vs Goliath” or imagine the India military take on the US street cred. For every person who says “Aha!! There lies the fallacy.”….think again….just 20 years ago who would have imagined that China would be hunting to be the largest economy in the world….similarly upsets happen in the tech world too….and thats the opportunity that Hike is gunning for. Is it ambitious? Yes. Is it foolish? In Steve Job’s lingo Yes. Is it hungry? Of course.
- Also on a similar vein to the argument above - if every person in the h/w space stops making laptops because apple is dominant, then the Microsoft surface or the Dell XPS 13 would have never happened.
- The firm had a few big unforseen market challenges (in two qtrs, middle of last year). The positive though is……since Q4 2017 has absolutely gotten its mojo back with actually a brand new multi pronged product strategy thats beginning to deliver huge momentum."
155,Hike,Wonderful experience and enjoyed every moment in HIKE.,2018-02-09,5.0,IT Specialist,"Hike, a company with very young, energetic and positive culture.
complete facility is awesome in design. Food is unbeatable. This is the company where people actually listens and action on the needs of the employees.","we know developers work very hard to match up the expectations and business needs,  but the only bothered thought is that the support Teams also work day and night to make users feel good and bringing up the WOW factor which is ignored by the management."

5. Everyone is really passionate and they believe in the mission set by the founder",Since it isa big organisation it takes time for your idea to get approved
157,Hike,Very intelligent system converting into a park of confusing ideas.,2018-01-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"1)If you want to open our own startup.Best place to work.You will understand what all you should not do.
2)Very good office space. 
3)If you want to be a self learner especially in programming best place.Because there is no coding standard and no architetecture only people with higher posts which is actually very good for a developer/programmer who is a self learner.","1)Huge team of product managers who write what features to copy in a excel sheet.
2)CEO should handle product management and make his vision clear.
3)A lot of talk about data but nothing reflects in actual product.
4)Features that actually worked are not iterated because there are new things to copy and get influenced in market that come up every month.
5)Work distribution is haywired . Some people are just here to show there faces and some are working there ..s off.
6)HR should take feedback seriously which is given to them by employees. 
7)The first time user experience of the app shows how serious people are about the product after the big talks."
158,Hike,Worst company for Engineers,2018-01-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Beautiful office
Flexible working hours
Good Salary","There is a lot of politics within Hike Management. Employees who work less and speak more are valued. Engineering Managers are incapable of technical discussion.  
Hike is still trying to figure out product-market fit. Product metrics are going down. Product team domains engineering team.Agile methodology is not followed for product development. Rather, Product team decides timeline by themselves and engineers are asked to meet it anyhow. The codebase of Hike Messenger is full of hacks. It lacks proper architecture. The company doesn't have a single architect-level engineer. Product people have all the privileges.

In short, if you want to do good quality work, don't join Hike."

* Sidelining of good leaders at all levels, leading to their leaving the company (ongoing)
* Some people have  to work nights and weekends to do donkey work while most folks have no work to do. Guaranteed way to ruin your career.
* Lack of good leadership leads to no mentoring opportunities
* No accountability in the leadership chain. They are not even trying to meet the goals for the company.

Company had opportunities when I was there, Now as per I hear from other employees there is not much. But still it is better than many other companies in India and definitely way better than service companies.","- Main problem is there is zero innovation. They do not welcome others ideas. Company thinks they are doing world shaking work but in reality they do not have much idea of what they want. Sometimes they will say they want to become Whatsapp, sometime fb, sometime snapchat. There is none originality.

- They think they are leaders and not ready to accept their flaws including technical knowledge, business.

Good teams Nothing else to add but,"Too many layers in management is made and bad decisions are made that don't solve customer problems. Hired do many engineering levels but why is app not stable yet the CEO should ask himself this question. Everyone is doing things to please their bosses but not real problems faced by users. The user Churn will continue to rise if we don't focus on them. My friends are leaving hike and it is embarrassing to explain why we can't fix the small things which even independent developers don't face . Why we don't respond to customers on App Store and play store when there are issues but only respond when they compliment us ... Time to take customers seriously 

The roadmap is not clear. We miss the early days when we were included in decision making and now decisions are made behind closed doors and employees have no opinion"

The food is with the company's compliments and we keep hiring expert caterers to cater the needs and tastes of different cultures working together under one roof.All i can is the company is doing a lot for its employees and the employees should recognise the same !!

188,Hike,One of the best company to work for in India,2016-05-21,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"* Superb culture and work life balance. Company takes care of employees same as a family takes care of its members
* Compensation and perks at par or exceeding industry standards, periodic review and salary corrections to match best in industry 
* Good food, including free breakfast, lunch, dinner and lots of snacks
* Some of best and enthusiastic minds to work with
* Flat structure, CEO uses same chair/desk as other employees, eats the same food; in fact, you won't recognise who is who unless you know personally. Level playing field, scope for everyone to improve and do great work
* Regular feedback loop, say whatever you want to say and they hear
* Extra activities, TGIF, game tournaments are some of regular events at place, HR team doing good work on keeping employee engaged in such activities
* cutting edge technology at work, you name the hot technology, and it's in use there
* Some of the new initiatives (agile workshops, sprints, standups) are good to bring bright minds forward and sprouts new enthusiasm across the board
* Fantastic office space, beats any other startup in India","* Nothing specific if you mind your own work, no obstacles at all. The issues I'm putting below are minor ones and you can relate them to any other company how good or great that may be
* Few teams/people receives undue advantages because they work closely with upper management while other few who work in isolation or in transparent manner round the clock, barely find their name popping up in discussions
* Too much attention to employee's patty demands, bunch of college kids who doesn't have any experience or know-how do tantrums like infants and company like a good mom bend over to fulfill them 
* Some people believes common utilities like pool, tt, foosball tables are their own property, they stick to them as soon as lunch is over and keep chugging until the office is empty. Looks like hired by company to participate in olympic instead of doing some tech work, management feels they will one day realize in their dream that they are doing wrong and become good human being afterwards.. oho company has a special word for such day dreaming.. ""self policing"" 
* No cab or shuttle facility, should at least start shuttle to common places since the office  area lacks public transport facility specifically to Gurgaon. Btw, they one time introduced cab facility and kids abused it so much that their individual biils ran in tens of thousands, forcing abrupt end of facility"

Some great people (At least some people who I know)
ok place for freshers as they can be moulded to do what their seniors want them to do
company only favours people in design team","bad language is used in office as thought it's cool to use those
bad  Work Life Balance (even if you don't have work you have to act to be busy)
Have fear of getting fired anytime (based on CEO's mood)
 Cannot freely ask questions to the senior management
 Your opinion does not matter. Neither does anyone else's except CEO
Only one way discussion happens.
There is so much push on bringing culture fit that it kills the enthusiasm among people to even hire due to process and need for 3 page packages
some people come late and sleep in the office and their examples are given as hard working people (design team can do anything they are exceptional people).
 The most surprising thing is that the top brass here takes pride on the bad work culture. Contrary to being open to criticism and improving themselves, they only want slaves who can do what they are told. Original thinking and ideas are discouraged.
Experienced people are treated very badly. Their earlier experience means nothing. In short, Fresher = Experienced.

I have been a part of a few organizational changes myself and yes, it can be a bit frustrating in the start. But if you embrace it and try to understand deeply then most of the time, it makes sense. If it doesn't then I most probably go and talk to someone about it - someone who is managing me or someone who is leading the team I am in. The stuff that is happening at the company, is quite different and new -- it will honestly take me time to change the way I think as well -- but I am beginning to see how it can help hike as a company move forward quickly while reducing the risks. Eventually if a change works on an organization level then it will start becoming a part of the culture. Culture and flexibility to work are the only things that makes Hike stand out among the rest ---- other good stuff and perks are all second.","If we can nail prioritization and getting awesome talent inside the company quickly, then this company has a chance of becoming the best."

It's close to Delhi so traveling time is less and salary is ok,"Only one sided decision comes from top and no one is clear about the direction. The leaders use cool terms from Google and Apple and think by copying that we'll be like that. Too much favritism and people in some teams get all benefits like stocks and good pay raise.

Quarterly team outings, monthly beer bashes and lot more. Sometimes I think these luxuries are not good specially for freshers. The culture and perks they get here are not found everywhere in India. They will come to know about this reality later when they will look for other opportunities outside hike.","If you are somebody who can keep yourself motivated, or somebody who can boast about your work or somebody who can pretend to like your manager, good for you. Don't expect HRs or managers to encourage you in any way. Few of the managers are doing adhoc work. Their role is undefined. They don't know what they are doing. People having no idea about the product are making product decisions. Members of the people team have nothing to do with the people. They are into themselves. There is no fixed time for a meeting.

199,Hike,Company is totally misdirected. Leader under wrong guidance.,2015-10-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Company with brand name. What ever the inside problems it still has name in market. The money is good if you want to stay in NCR and want a decent option. If you want to get the rush of a fast moving company with a lot happening everyday join. Look at it as 1+ year stint to work up fast and get into finer league. Best place for quick climbing and self success.Don’t make long term plans.,"Company is facing many problems specially over last few months when suddenly its values changed or stopped existing. Let me tell you about the culture of the company and every word of it is true.
 
{1} When employee use is over he is made to leave without dignity. CEO is brainwashed to fire everyone old. When a person heading people and culture is not employee centric and believes in firing after their use is over there is nothing much to say.

 
{2} All old employees are called worthless and are removed. Only 1% of older employees remain. But if the old employees are useless how could they make a company meaningful enough for these x team to join? We joined when company was nothing and worked hard to get the funding. Now they come and boast about the company which they have zero contribution towards and are finding ways to throw all older ones out.
 
{3} Someone who has never seen a a start up before is given all power, he is equivalent to the CEO but cannot relate to our journey, he brings mightier than god attitude not knowing what it takes to work in small team at 4am. What it means to work when brand is not big and we are short of resources. We never took vacation and stayed in office every night till 2am because that is what start ups does. Start up does not have a 20 member HR team, it has 50 member in total including CEO and CTO and still at lower cost.

 {4} The company behaves like it has become google. The X team is the elite leaders who are far above the common workers they don’t even talk to those below them.
 
{5}. Only language which is spoken is money, free benefits, expensive online tools, free rides, luxurious and fancy office, party, beer, goodies, how to make wealth …are we that cheap that you think this makes us happy?  When we joined it was not for brand or money but for vision, we sacrificed our weekends, holidays, and time away from family not because we wanted money but because of work and colleagues. But the new x team will never understand this.
 
{6}. Every company goes through change but management here has never handled change before and lack experience and maturity to do it, and those teaching have no idea what to do that is why everything is falling like earthquake."
200,Hike,Awesome Place to work only if you know to blow your own trumpet,2015-10-08,1.0,Software Engineer,Nothing really to talk about.Compensation is not the only thing people work for.,So called New Management doesn't really care about you unless you are one of their favourites.HR Team talks about Culture & Culture Fit. Seriously do you guys even consider this while hiring people for your own Team or it applies only while hiring for other teams?A latest addition to HR team has absolutely no basic etiquette on how to talk to people or respect them.We really don't care if you are from Google  as long as you know how to RESPECT people.

With the pace of Hike growth, we are still able to maintain the start up culture, but in a very structured way. With a young team, smart minds around and very encouraging work culture - you got all the fuel you need, it just depends on how badly you want to excel. 

Compensation: Hike pays on par with industry standards. In many cases, pay is way above as well. 
Work - Life balance: As long as we deliver our core work, everything is so flexible here. Work timings, work locations etc. Well, there is no concept of leave here - this should say how flexible we are. 
Perks: Perks are something that appeals a lot during joining (even more than salary) and Hike got good enough of them. iPad, Mac for work, 30k worth mobile, Food at work round the clock etc. Whole company (120 ppl) went on a fully paid Goa trip recently - well, now that's something right.","Though Hike is growing at great pace, still the start up culture is well maintained. In this process, if you are looking for a guide/mentor all along, you might not find one around always. Many times, you might have to take an extra effort to learn yourself and implement. With the pace of work here, learning curve is always steep. 

I should say, this is not totally a negative but again depends on the work culture one is looking at. I should also say, self learning is many times great fun. After all, a start up is known for this - great learning & kickass energy and Hike got both."

Directly see how my work affects million people using my product. Very few products will give me an opportunity to affect 35m people and potentially a billion people. To me what drives me is the unique opportunity to create a large-scale consumer product from India. 

- Zero degree of separation from all layers of tech: Being a startup, I have a great flexibility and visibility to chose technology to be used, hardware to be used, storage to be used etc. Unlike bigger established players, each developers get a chance to work on all layers of stack (right from fine-tuning TCP layer setting to better manage the sockets, to comparing various storage choices like which NoSQL DB to use, to make sure your services is always healthy and running).  We own our service end to end and there aren't departments abstracting developers out from things like how to fine tune linux settings etc. To me the amount of learning when you get to work on different layers of stack is just phenomenal.",- Startup demands a lot from you and sometimes that does mean war mode and fighting all kind of technical problems as well as tough timelines. The same situations give a lot of satisfaction once the product is out and you see a lot of people using it.
