I actually hit Quota a few times, after much agony and pushing by management - I was in the 4% not a brag but just sharing how rare and your likelihood of making money here is low

b. Goals and quote is a moving goalpost that's irrelevant to the probability of attainment. You will be jerked around for no rhyme or reason

c. The managers albeit no choice of their own are forced to push to sip the kool-aid. Ask you to come in late and burn out and pretty much fight and be desperate. The product frankly sucks and it takes a lot of relationship based sell to get anything through.

d. So many layoffs and hirings. No job security. This is a direct result of apathetic management and product teams setting you up for failure. Sales is a team game and there's no I in team."

32,Hired,Not a company to grow your career,2021-03-25,1.0,Account Executive,snacks water not much else,Vettery used to be a good place to be.

They also have an unlimited vacation policy - some teams are more encouraging than others of using it though. And they have happy hours and free lunches occasionally, which I think is all HR does.","When I first started at Vettery, it was such a young, fun environment where everyone was excited about what we were building. Fast forward a few years, and any energy and excitement has completely evaporated. The product is an utter joke. Adecco knows they made a mistake and have to climb their way out of this mess but I don't see how that's possible. We overpromise and underdeliver and clients know it. It makes it a hard product to sell and an even harder product to renew year over year. No one in management is qualified so they have no idea what they're doing and change goals and benchmarks every other week."
36,Hired,Great place to work!!,2021-03-13,5.0,Software Engineer,Company gives you the flexibility to work in any possible way,Scope to learn new technologies is comparatively less

39,Hired,do not work here - reviews on glassdoor are fake,2021-02-12,1.0,Sales,"like the other reviews, the office is pretty. great lighting, snacks, pretty place to physically do work on madison square park so you have options for lunch and post work drinks. Easy to get to from every subway so you can live in whichever neighborhood you want.","They will just lie to you. They will lie to you while you are interviewing, and then when you get hired you'll be completely blindsided by the responsibilities and the excitement by other employees. Furthermore, they'll just keep lying to you while you work here about success of the company and growth opportunities. Be careful of this as you chose your next role as you will likely never hit your threshold quota to get paid, so the base salary is your yearly salary. They will tell you it's a sales role but its a glorified recruiting role, with the addition stress of selling a software that is saturated, oversold, and does not impress clients whatsoever. Opposite to what they say in interviews, this industry is not booming (and certainly not exciting), and Vettery is no trailblazer for that matter. 
Unfortunately, this place is a dead beat startup. No one is truly excited about the product except for the executive level staff - and I'm pretty sure those are fake smiles as well. The company used to be vibrant with happy employees, great work spaces and a growing business, but ever since the two co founders left (and the team they built the company with left), the company has really taken a turn for the worse. 
I say this with complete empathy that if you have other options, choose those other options. I'm not sure if the people reading this are perspective employees, or clients or whoever - but if you are considering working here and have the means to go somewhere else, do it."

Business metrics are constantly declining.
Vettery's NPS score is utter trash.
The product is shoved in clients' faces by a strong sales team.
The engineering org is led by inexperienced management hired with a touch of nepotism.
The goal is the company is just to stay afloat while Adecco (parent company) funds it.
Engineers are not recognized and credited for their work.
Upper management holds grudges against people. 
The engineering org has shrunk in size due to poor management.
Compensation is extremely poor.
Vettery should not call itself a 'tech company', it is a 'Sales company'.
Our interview process is a joke. 

Engineers who are poached and reading this, be wary of the fake promises, almost every engineer here is unhappy. Ask tons of questions during the interview process and get in touch with real engineers."

65,Hired,In serious trouble,2020-04-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"HR puts a sincere focus on employees and their career development. Competitive compensation in some departments.

Interesting problems and challenges; people are engaged trying to manage a complex two sided marketplace.

Meaningful mission, matching people with jobs.

A generally positive culture (outside pockets of insane politics). Intentions are almost always good,  even with execution a disaster.

The above all attracts and retains great, talented people. Many people stay despite its problems just “for the people” and “for their team”, and efforts to fix those problems are sincere. The informal alumni network is unusually strong.","Serious price pressure even before coronavirus threatens revenue at an alarming rate. This is true for their competitors too, and reflects a fundamental product problem as much as a company problem.

Trust between execs is very low; at times it could feel “Game of Thrones”. Departments became siloed accordingly, and everyone else was left with the hard work of bridging the divide. With the CEO nearly completely absent, trying to unite the company was thankless at best and politically dangerous at worst.

Lack of transparency and honesty at the company level. An inability to say no at a top-down level created overcommitment, confusion and uncertainty. The resulting lack of focus spread everyone too thin.

The positive culture often became delusional, especially from execs, discouraging feedback. This often caused small missteps to escalate into big ones. 

Rounds of recent lay-offs were very top down; chaotic situations arose after each with directors and managers caught off guard. While it genuinely tries to make the right call, sometimes people feel like Hired “shoots itself in the foot”, cutting in the wrong places and laying off the wrong people. In general, executives have poor understanding of the ground situation when making key business decisions. 

All of the above serves to erode trust in the company.
I loved many things about Hired, but its problems directly hurt my career and my ability to perform while at the company. They also threaten its existence. If they can’t figure out how to lead the good people they have left, they’ll be left with none at all."
66,Hired,Great People to work with!,2020-04-21,4.0,Sales,"Amazing and young culture, great office",There should be more realistic quota- most companies have a 10 meeting/per goal while Vettery has 20.

67,Hired,Inexperienced Leadership,2020-04-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Dogs and snacks and that's it,"Vettery is a place full of nepotism and therefore, inexperienced leadership. Managers have no training and get promotions, full time staff is left confused and uninformed. After many years as a full time employee, I watched lots of changes happen, and at the end of the day was still at a company that lacked transparency and failed to successfully support staff. Inflated titles are given out, and the product lacks in usability and design. If you're looking to work here, hard pass."
68,Hired,"Poor engineering standards, low pay",2020-04-16,2.0,Software Engineer,"Unlimited PTO, people are nice, work/life balance","Absolute mess of a company from a tech and management perspective. 

Code base is archaic and difficult to work with. It's clear that management and product teams only care about pushing out features so they can please the higher ups instead of fighting for better engineering standards (engineering goals are always about business, sales & money). Pay is on the lower end but they expect you to push out quality work. There is no motivation for engineers to go above and beyond when they aren't heard in the first place.  They want to behave like a top tier tech company but refuse to address the pains of the engineering team and invest in their team. 

Management involves people who have little to no experience on how to run a team. There are only one or two managers who are actually concerned about the engineers while others only have their own interests in mind. 

Benefits aren't great either and HR has a tight grip on controlling engineers' compensation packages."

The sales team had little to no understanding about what their targets and markets would be quarter to quarter.

You could work the 8:30-6:30 that was absolutely mandatory for the sales team, but if you didn't make appointments regularly at 7-7:30 for ""sales training"", which consisted of a manager or director trying to fit you in as they caught up on the work that they needed to get done because they were under as much stress as the rest of the sales org, you weren't working hard enough. If you didn't stay for moral support for the rest fo the team that was ""working hard"" after 6, you were putting in the bare minimum and they could see clear as day that you weren't interested in the cool-aid. Stress gets kicked down the totem pole, so the team members that management is relying on to pull the weight and bring in business, are being crushed by expectations that no one above them can meet. It was obvious as word spread that it was just for the paycheck of the original team that sold the company. Anyone who was new was working for a pipe dream of a start-up that bluffed their way out of minors and couldn't keep up in the big leagues. There was a lack of tools, lack of experience, and worst of all, a lack of empathy.

79,Hired,Worst Decision I Ever Made,2020-02-13,1.0,Senior Account Executive,"Free lunch, unlimited PTO, great product if they left it alone for 5 minutes","Coming to Hired was the worst decision I made in my sales career. The market for reps is completely over saturated, the accounts are beat to death, quotas are constantly changing (4 times in the 8 months I was there). Reps who have markets to themselves (with lower quotas)  are the only ones who succeed and therefore regarded as strong sellers (they're not). My team was pacing to 23% when I left- a team of incredibly strong, formerly successful and tenured sales reps. They are constantly changing the product, taking away logical streams of revenue. Everything is dictated by them trying to raise funds. They only care what investors say, never listen to those in the field.  People are constantly afraid they are at risk of losing their jobs, and their spirits are shot because they are seen as unsuccessful. Upper management ONLY cares about fund raising, not morale."
80,Hired,Challenging in the best possible way,2020-02-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"My experience at Hired has been one of the most challenging that I've ever had in a work environment -- in a good way. You have the ability to make a tremendous impact because of how much exposure you have to the business and cross-functional teams. It's a collaborative environment and you are consistently working on meaningful projects and with extremely intelligent people.

If want to come to work, knock items off your to-do list and clock out, this is not the place for you. If you want to be challenged in ways that will set you up for success in your next role, this is the scrappy start-up environment you are looking for.",Leadership has changed a lot and it has been difficult to navigate the whiplash and relearn preferred communication and management styles. This is great for priming your managing up skills but there needs to be some mailability on your part.
81,Hired,Avoid This Company At All Costs!!!,2020-02-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits, Free lunches, Nice people. Great gadgets and tools.","With Hired, it's all a facade. The benefits / comp package, reputable investors, prime office locations, flexible schedule options, and free snacks too! But the sad part is its all a front for a terribly run organization on a downward trajectory. 

Many of the previous reviews shine a bright light onto some of the major issues that make Hired a terrible place to work. The moment you join, it is immediately apparent that there is a huge lack of transparency from the management, as well as the extreme lack of strategic direction. You will never really know what is going on with the company, and so much his hidden under wraps. 

The culture isn't well established, and norms aren't set in place. This is not a place where you go to win as a team, as everyone on the inside is only hustling to cover their own personal bases. They do this because there is little to no job security, and layoffs happen on a quarterly basis. Oh, if you are looking for a place to feel secure, good luck, turnover and layoffs leave numerous departments operating like revolving doors.  The goals are utterly unachievable by normal human standards, and when you factor in how outdated the product is, it becomes impossible. 

I could continue, but to save you time I've summarized the cons here: 

- Extreme lack of transparency from management 
- Lack of job security and high turnover rates
- Toxic company culture with tons of politics ( when push comes to shove, if management doesn't like you personally, your performance doesn't even matter) 
- Upper management team is swapped out every 6-12 months
- unattainable goals with lots of pressure to hit them 
- Terrible place for minorities, women, and people of colour (first to be laid off)
- No career growth opportunities, due to a lack of growth
- Your opinion will never be valued, unless you are part of the upper management you will just get fake answers to any serious inquiry you have 
- CEO and Founders never show face 

Ultimately, read through all the reviews on here and see for yourself. If this post helps ONE PERSON to take another opportunity and dodge the bullet called Hired, I'll be content."

- The sell of Hired is ""culture"", they even have a supposed ""cultures"" interview however the culture here is absolutely toxic, depressing, and it will lead to the demise of this organization. 
- Comp plans are made to start competition and arguments between AE's and upper management. As well as AE's and their respective SDR's. 
- SDR's are treated in such a negative and demining manner, pinned against their respective AE's and brought in with no training but expected to hit ridiculous quotas. 
- Remaining AEs and SDR's who were chosen to stay was based on company politics but lack the skill and intelligence of most of the team who was laid off. 
- TSMs and CSMs are comped on the basis of the success of the AE's vs Clients. 
- HR and PR personnel are constantly overworked with no bonus on comp or action. 
- Marketing is beyond delusional with a team of white men discussing diversity, women's issues and how the state of salaries are in the market.

On top of that, the founders are MIA and the CEO only shows up to deliver bad news. Two massive company lay offs in the past three months and let go of 95% of diversity.

The people are truly amazing and you get lunch 3x a week with a flexible work/life balance.,"This company appears to not know where it’s going or what it’s doing, and many employees like myself notice. Hired’s value proposition resonates greatly for enterprise businesses and larger scale companies who are located in either the SF Bay, NYC, and/or do their hiring in multiple cities. Outside of that, the product is having massive issues sticking in other verticals and markets. The strength of the platform differs from city to city given the quantity and quality of candidates on it, however, everyone is held to the same standard despite what cities you’re covering. Other than the Enterprise reps, most teams are struggling to hit their targets. 

In addition to struggling teams and a feeling of a directionless business, Hired is absolutely brutal for new employees. There isn’t exactly a ramp period for new sales hires and a vast majority of them I’ve seen start within the past year or so have struggled mightily. They essentially throw you into the deep end with no life jacket to force you to sink or swim. Perhaps not a winning strategy given the company’s struggles."

Toxic work environment where the CEO google's the word ""sexism"" in a meeting with employees to understand what it means, but then the company wins an award for best places  to work for women a year later. what a joke.

There’s a lot of fake reviews up here. Perhaps the company shouldn’t ask people to write reviews when they’ve only been here for a month. 

The turn over is quite real especially in sales. They’re getting hired right out of college and not trained properly and then get promoted to account managers without really understanding how to do that job. 

Diversity is the biggest joke here. With only one person of color in a management role. The few token minorities you do have, the company makes sure to include them in photos to act as though they care about this. 

You do have to applaud the engineering team though that does make the best effort out of every other department to actually have a decent mix. They truly make an effort to bring in more female engineers."

The previous director was verbally abusive and blamed us for our lack of success when we were never trained how to book a meeting. There was never a career path and the people that were getting promoted never hit quota or their metrics.

The leaders of this company simply do not care about their people. The turnover rate at Hired is crazy high, even for a startup. Tenures of less than a year are common. Everyone is treated as disposable.

There is an exorbitant amount of fake positive reviews here which I think is a testament to how the company as a whole treats disgruntled, overworked, and undervalued employees (i.e. covering up valid concerns and questions with over the top positivity) 

The management is horrendous. Many of them are young, homegrown, and have no previous management experience. This means managers have no idea how to motivate their teams, don’t consult them when changes are rolled out, and have no idea how to receive or respond to feedback. A company full of 20-something year olds holding Director-level positions is, to be frank, a joke. 

Many departments/teams have no career pathing set in place. There is no comprehensible promotion structure for many of the teams at the company which leads to new grads becoming “Seniors” after 1 year and then having nowhere to go from there because management has no idea what to do with their senior team members. 

The company as a whole has lost its tech/product focused thrust and is motivated entirely by generating as much revenue as possible. It’s an oversold product that doesn’t do half of what it’s supposed to which is evidenced by how many employers and job seekers raise complaints about the quality of the leads they see on the site. The product is simply not where it needs to be and there is insufficient effort being put into improving it. 

And everyone is unhappy! There is a widespread unease amongst the entire company and they’re currently experiencing very large turnover as a lot of people are moving elsewhere. It’s killed the morale of what used to be an exciting and inspiring startup environment, and management doesn’t seem to care that literally entire teams are jumping ship."

Good people who you can learn from, individually
Dogs","It's a mess. With checked out founders and nobody to steer the ship, managers with no management training—many of whom are home grown from within—are left scrambling to make sense of setting goals and leading teams. Individual contributors are encouraged to be creative, but are given limited resources—and often their ideas or suggestions are ignored. There's limited sense of keeping things at industry standard, for anything. (Marketing, product, sales—for anyone with a degree of outside knowledge, you'll feel like you've stepped into the upside down, although I have faith that the product team is moving in the right direction with new hires.) Favoritism is rampant, particularly directed toward those who were there when the company fit in one small room. Morale is low despite access to free snacks, a pool table, and strongly suggested team outings. (Maybe, just maybe, this isn't the kind of support that all people want from an employer, but who am I to say.) Culture skews very young, particularly on sales."

They trust you to do the work you take on and are happier when you decide you want to take on newer or other projects

Unlimited PTO,"First off – the amount of fake reviews on here is just ridiculous. “There are no cons at all” – well there’s also no such thing as a perfect workplace so clearly there are some disillusioned employees. “Office can be loud at times “- yes, in an open space layout you hear everything and therefore the office WILL be loud at times. “Office gets chilly in the summer” – I literally LOL’d at this one. 

Now let’s move on to an honest review. Just a few cons that stick out:

1. A LOT of favoritism. Pray that you are on your manager’s good side or else you might be gone 5 mos down the road. 
2. Inexperienced managers – there are a ton of scrappy & smart people in the company that think they can just be thrown into senior positions, but unfortunately experience only truly comes with time. The company likes to promote from within and give leadership roles to those who were a part of the company when it was much smaller. Good for them – but this can also backfire when you’re actually supposed to lead a team & manage multiple personalities but don’t really have the proper knowledge or training to be able to do that. Not every skill can be googled. 
Oh & I’m sorry but Directors in their late twenties? Anyone with half a brain would see that as a red flag & for countless reasons. You’re basically at the level of an Associate in the corporate world, so if you actually end up leaving the startup world, this reality check might be a huge slap in the face.  
3. Unprofessional work environment & super clique-y. Can feel like a college dorm at times. 
4. Lack of transparency across the org. One week you are told that the company is hiring 100 people. The next week you hear about another 10 people who were let go. What's going on?"
123,Hired,Know what you're getting into,2019-05-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are some amazing people at Vettery that will make you excited to come to work everyday. Additionally, there are some great benefits in regards to PTO, snacks, etc. The sales training program truly is great, just be aware what kind of sales you're getting into (starting as an SDR you're making ~80 cold calls all day everyday for a year with almost no flexibility). If you're not certain inside sales is for you, you'll likely burn out and grow resentful.","There is a severe lack of transparency - especially in regards to the sales team. Unrealistic goals are set that force the sales team from SDRs to AE/AMs to essentially lie to customers - resulting in over-promising and under-delivering. The team is definitely young, however, that does not necessarily justify treating employees like children. Employees on the sales team are given very little flexibility/freedom and your activity is pretty constantly monitored. As an SDR, you'll be making ~80 cold calls per day with no client facing activity - as previously mentioned it's a great training program if you know for certain inside sales is where you want to be. Vettery prides itself on having awesome company culture, however, this often feels disingenuous and forced - company happy hours once a month don't make up for an otherwise generally toxic/stressed environment."

Unlimited time off (although beware if you’re in a sales role as you will almost certainly be penalised for taking time off)","Most of the management are from the same company and show blatant favoritism within the team. 

Unrealistic moving targets & excessive working hours, plus pressure to do over 14 hours a day regularly.

The worst type of ‘startup’ bro culture- watching grown adults run around the office acting like children is unprofessional to say the least. 

Fake reviews on here (especially!) and general dishonestly across the board with regards to clients and team members. 

Unprofessional work environment - messy work stations and just general disorganisation.

Lack of diversity. Most people are straight out of college and people are treated like disposable paper plates. HUGE turnover and apathy from management with regards to this.

Management regularly run up and down the office shouting to “dial more” 

Extremely volatile work environment where your personal privacy, internal messages, data, emails are constantly monitored by management.
 
Be careful going to the bathroom in this environment, you might find your desk seat has moved & you’ve been replaced by an automated bot (which is basically how they treat you )"

Tons of opportunity to try new roles.","LOTS of growing pains. Lots of trial and error.

You'll meet an overall amazing and you'll get really close- mainly because everyone is miserable and just trying to take it one day at a time together and help each other out. Much of this is due to poor management, unrealistic expectations, promotion decisions based solely on favoritism and not on actual results. For a company that boasts ""culture, culture, culture,"" yes, it does have great culture. On the surface, at least. Ironically, the most genuine friendships I have made were actually a result of all the negative pressures and mistreatments that we endured together as a team and less so from the bonding events. The only reason I give my experience 2 stars instead of 1 is because of all the incredible people on the SDR team.","Leadership, disillusioned CEOs, lack or organization, lack of transparency, overall feeling of sliminess and disingenuous energy."

Not the typical cut-throat sales org. Easily the smartest and most caring co-workers you’ll have. Everyone truly wants the other to succeed and will collaborate towards a common goal. There is a very high character bar set for sales reps. Easy accessibility to upper management if you have any issues 

Generally, Hired is much easier to sell than most SaaS business given the product works very well. We’re working on different product offerings to accommodate different sized businesses","Sales hiring has picked up quite a bit. Many new reps still ramping and feel the normal startup pressures.

There is so much opportunity for the sales team, and as long as you have the desire to get better and hustle, you have so much room to be successful and many have overachieved! Some obvious pros: catered lunches three times a week, dog friendly office space, great health/dental/vision benefits, 401k, 2 free dog walks every month, gym & cell phone stipend, etc. Your voice will be heard if you have value to add and want to add it, as people are always looking to grow and get better and share best practices.","There are some typical growing pains of a start up, but that comes with the territory of working at a startup!

- Interesting space to work in, super high growth and in demand.  You're able to work with all companies in all verticals.
- Flexibility if you need to work from home and being able to travel for on-sites/events in your territory is a nice change of pace.
- Regular company meetings that talk to the state of the business","- Despite company values, there is a widespread lack of risk taking which results in a lot of the same strategies being recycled y/o/y.  This is compounded by their attrition rate.  There are very few people at Hired that can help give context to what has and hasn't worked well with the business.  The same mistakes are being made repeatedly.
- Quota attainment for the AE team was under 20%  for a few quarters, so OTE is not attainable.
- Questionable hires in senior leadership which has created a hostile working environment for certain teams in the revenue org.  While inclusive practices are used in other departments, it seems to be lacking within the SDR org."

Office has nice perks and office operations staff are always throwing events for birthdays and happy hours. Pay is above market.","SDR Leadership is some of the worst I've ever worked for or with. Burn out culture is alive and well on the team, as motivation comes in the form of intimidation and bullying. Focus is put on activity metrics at all costs, which you'll be reminded of every day via individual slacks from Sr. SDR Leadership.

Goals and your experience change based on your personal relationship with Sr. Leadership. If you're not on good terms, you'll be told so with petty, condescending (also potentially misogynistic, if you're a woman) comments.

Great pay - Hired offers competitive base salaries and our new commission structure rolling out in Q1 is even better than before for equity
Office - beautiful SF, NY, etc offices. I work remote now and feel very lucky my company is allowing me to do so! 
Inclusion - Hired gives tons of support to pay equity and building a diverse workplace. They give our ERGs fairly large budgets every quarter to put on events and drive important conversations with our coworkers
CEO - I believe that Mehul is not only a great leader, but a really good person and this makes me happy to stay and grow my career here","Middle management in sales are mostly first time managers - all great people who genuinely care about their teams but I do wish for more experienced leadership sometimes
As we've grown, not all our new hires are gems. I wish we would grow more carefully and gradually (i.e. not hiring 10 people for a new team at once who then have a hard time ramping)

Marketing, Sales, TEX, Engineering, etc) which has not been overcome through various organized attempts. Division between the two floors should not be overlooked.

2. Upward mobility.
3. Product has potential.","1. Some of senior leadership means really well and genuinely cares - need to do a better job of soliciting feedback from team before going through time-consuming process of making changes that don't have the desired impact.

2. Vettery invests heavily in promoting from within which is admirable - need to be comfortable acknowledging when/where that is not the best fit and invest in outside talent/experience.

3. Product demos very well which makes it unfortunately easy to ignore key issues/shortcomings. Need to better leverage data and feedback to understand customer needs and product challenges. Many product challenges have existed for a long time and are made lower priority than rapid expansion into new markets.

4.  Sales team is extremely young and in many cases given unrealistic targets that do not appear to be based on data. The combination of very high goals and a product that demos well can be dangerous as it isolates both the young sales team who is forced to overpromise and the customer service team who must then manage those misaligned client expectations."

Well, I can proudly say I don't have that conversation with myself anymore; not since starting at Vettery.

- Regular training to keep skills sharp.

160,Hired,An Industry Defining Company with the Best Still Ahead,2018-03-18,5.0,Director of Marketing,"In Hired's short existence, they revolutionized talent acquisition and introduced a business model that has since been replicated in industries far beyond Hired's primary focus of tech. Being a first-mover has its advantages and disadvantages, but the ability to learn, innovate, and build a durable, consumer-facing brand has been impressive. The growth and change inherent in carving out a new way of business has led to opportunities to innovate and create areas of responsibilities for those willing to take it, and Hired's commitments to great compensation, work-life balance, and diversity make it a great place to take your career to the next level. Hired's early alumni now serve in leadership roles at name-brand companies or have founded companies around the world and it'll be exciting to see what the current cohort at Hired can achieve, both inside the company and beyond. If you're looking for a place to fast-track your career, have an impact, and work for an aspirational, mission-led brand, I'd absolutely recommend Hired.","When you're a company that's literally writing a new blueprint for how things are done, you're inherently faced with ambiguity, problems, and challenges. For many, these are opportunities to make an impact and grow. But, more often than we'd like, people want the flash and excitement of being a part of a high-growth company without actually facing the hard work and reality that success requires. Hired's appeal and early growth led us to fall into the easy mistake of hiring people that, while amazingly qualified on paper, fell into the latter bucket. That group ultimately became an entitled distraction and Hired has since done a good job of respectfully removing the bad apples from the organization and resetting the culture. While the future is still full of unknowns and challenges, if you're the type looking to rise to the occasion it's an amazing opportunity. But if you're looking for predictability and slower pace, a less ambitious or a larger, more established company is probably a better fit."

It's vital that employees take a step back and recognize that this is still a great company to work for and that these bumps are normal at a growing company at this stage.

175,Hired,"Bumps in the road, but the concept is gold",2017-06-15,4.0,Sales,"- Actually disrupting recruiting and fixing long-time issues (transparency in hiring), efficiency, finding the right candidates. This concept is the future of recruiting and is not going to go away. We have a lot of copy-cats and are working hard to stay at the head of the pack.
- The people! A lot of older favorites (who have been here 3+ years have been leaving lately, but that is common in tech). Don't be turned off by some of the recent reviews. It's been a bumpy year so far with turnover, but that is normal at this stage of growth. The leadership team is actively making changes to address the other reviews and I'm confident (as an individual contributor) that there will be a lot of positive changes over the next 6+ months. 
- Incredibly equipped and qualified leadership team has been built out over the past 12 months. It's only up from here and I have full faith in this leadership team to help re-focus the company on its goal: finding everyone a job they love. 
- Very flexible work schedule and vacation, the managers here honestly care about your wellbeing
- The benefits are really good, base salary is slightly lower than at other companies for sales roles, but worth it now that we have commission 
- I love working for a company where I not only trust but also like our executive leadership. They are great people and I trust their judgement.","- With all of the changes and new leadership, there have been delays in promotions and career progression. The leadership team is very aware of it and to me, it is worth it to ride this out because I love the team and what we do.
- A lot of middle management and newer leadership seem to be butting heads on the direction of the company right now. Middle (and OG management) need to listen to people who were hired for their experience and know how to scale the company. We have a gold concept and strong product and now just need to unify under a common vision to bring Hired to the next level."

179,Hired,The juice is worth the squeeze.,2017-06-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Hired is out to completely transform job search--on both the candidate and company side. That's an extremely ambitious and transformative mission. Turning that ambition into a reality is freaking hard and isn't something that happens overnight. That aspect isn't talked about very often in some of the employee reviews on Glassdoor. As such, I wanted to provide an alternative, and hopefully more realistic, view of the culture and company. It should also be noted that although I know our HR team monitors Glassdoor ratings as a general employee/recruiting health metric, I was not asked to write this by HR or from anybody else in the company. Instead, I was compelled to write it after reading several posts from ex-employees who have had distinctly different experiences than I've had at Hired. 

Pros: 

- Product: our tech is solid and we have very strong product-market fit. We're still working on pricing and expansion into other geos and industries, but have the luxury of knowing that our product consistently delivers value to candidates and clients alike. We recently rolled out a new paradigm in the product called 'Positions' which should drive a lot of growth. 

- Compensation and Work/Life: the company pays well and is flexible when it comes to working hours, PTO, etc. It can almost be too lax sometimes (there's not a lot of people working on the weekends or staying late in the office every night). That's mostly a good thing, but there also needs to be a shared sense of urgency at certain points.  

- Perks and Benefits: great health insurance (100% paid), free lunches, snacks, gym reimbursement, cell phone reimbursement, parental leave, etc. There's no 401k matching yet, but that's because it wouldn't be prudent to do so until we're profitable. Otherwise, all the standard tech company perks are in place. 

- Career Advancement: It's there, but not always fully defined. The latter bit (it not being defined) is what can throw-off a lot of people. Although the company has put in career levels and some semblance of career paths, the speed at which the business has changed has made formal career-pathing challenging. That said, I've seen that if you deliver on your core job and then go on to tackle/solve other problems, you'll be recognized and will grow and advance professionally. However, I can understand how that level of ambiguity can be hard for a lot of people. 

- Leadership Team: 5 out of the 6 people on our executive team are new within the last 18-months or so (i.e., everybody but the CEO). This is exciting, but also shows the level of change that has taken place over the last couple of quarters. Leveling-up is a good sign, though. As such, I'm bullish on the leadership we now have in-seat, but am also realistic that it'll take some time for them to ramp/fully gel.","A few cons: 

- Goaling/forecasting has been inconsistent at times. This is largely due to the shift in the business, but has definitely hamstrung employee morale at points. This is rapidly improving as we create a true FP&A function and get more concrete individual goaling in place. I'd say that this is normal for any rapidly growing/changing business, but can be a bit of an unsettling feeling for folks that have never worked in high-growth startups before. 

- Consolidation to major hubs: the business moved from a city-centric model (where we had small teams of 4 to 5 people in all of our small markets) to a hub model (where most of our people are now in SF, NY or London). Although we're now at the tail-end of that transition, shifting where and how people work is never easy. And this was no exception. 

- The e-team can be a bit risk-averse at times. It's certainly good to be prudent and make smart business decisions, but I'd love to see the company continue to take more big/bold bets. 

All told, I'm extremely proud to work at Hired and am lucky to work with a ton of smart/ambitious people that are truly focused on the mission of transforming job search. It's not all roses, though. The work of building a company and category from scratch is hard. The next few years are going to be both fun and crazy as we scale the business from (basically) Software Engineers in SF to knowledge workers around the globe."

As Steve Jobs would say, I'd rather work with a small group of A players than a large group of B players - and that's what Vettery is, A players!","Vettery made the mistake of hiring some B players and they couldn't hang.

Thankfully management has put in a new hiring system to help better identify A players and a real time feedback process to help align the team."
186,Hired,Worst Career Move So Far,2017-05-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Young culture and good location in Union Square,"I could take this review in so many directions but I will try to only focus on the really bad/unfortunate things regarding Vettery. 

-Blatant favoritism 

-Founders are micro-managers with control issues, they allow for no other's opinions or perspectives when it comes to decision making -- the company only goes where they say it goes, not open to having their authority challenged

-Underpay all employees and do not offer an equity package, which is standard for tech companies

-On top of being underpaid -- expectation is to work at least 80+ hours with no incentives or motivation to work that many hours.. I love the startup grind and hustling everyday but with no real vision or motivation, feels like a corporate job 

-No marketable or tangible assets gained from this job

-No room for creativity or 'outside the box' thinking when it comes to your role

-Feeling of just being there to make the Founders money and no feeling that they took any personal interest in myself or my career

-Product is just a replica of other competitors in the market, they just play 2-3 steps behind competition's moves"
187,Hired,Love Vettery!,2017-05-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been at Vettery for a few years now, and it's an amazing place to work. I've made some of my best friends while working here, and the culture that we've built is one of a kind. I'm a woman and I have absolutely never noticed a difference in treatment between the co-founders and the male and female employees. We're a bunch of young hustlers all driven by the same passion, and sometimes you do have to be scrappy and work long hours, but that's what keeps it exciting!","Too many cute office dogs, sometimes it's hard to give the same amount of attention to all of them."
188,Hired,It's all downhill from here,2017-05-27,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"In 2016, Hired was a great place to work. Smart, ambitious people. Good food and snacks. There were growing pains and management issues, but morale was high and many thought the company had a promising future.","The layoffs in January 2017 changed everything. Morale was destroyed. (Recent 5 star reviews are likely a PR stunt from HR.) Despite several assurances from HR and exec's that layoffs were over, the next few months saw dozens of high performing employees being fired without cause or leaving voluntarily with no job lined up.

Prospective applicants should see the mass exodus of senior level employees and talented engineers as a major red flag. 

Additionally, many talented junior staff have quit due to a complete lack of career development opportunities. Hired boasts that they ""support career development"", but this is a lie.

The truth is that managers actively block employees from career development opportunities, and expressing any dissatisfaction to your manager or HR will very likely lead to your dismissal. 

If you're fine with your career trajectory stagnating and watching all of your talented coworkers leave, Hired might be the place for you. 

For everyone else, stay away. 

The Hired party is over."
189,Hired,"Good People, Struggling Management",2017-05-23,2.0,Software Engineer,"Hired has/had a very selective hiring process focused largely on pretty experienced folks. My coworkers were by-and-large talented, thoughtful, and insightful people, both about their direct engineering efforts as well as the product as a whole, and the problem of hiring. I really enjoyed working with almost everyone at Hired, but in the engineering org and the broader company.

Benefits and work/life balance were both good, and at least my team rarely felt excessive pressure around artificial deadlines.","High turnover, particularly after the recent management changeover (tail end of 2016) dragged down morale and robbed the organization of many of its most talented engineers. 

The new executives are very top-down focused, and there's an emphasis on creating multiple, unnecessary management layers (3-4) between executives & ICs. Executives don't seem to trust people they didn't hire, and treat others' opinions (even from long-tenured engineering managers) as threatening. 

Overall, the current direction in product engineering seems pretty old-school (lots of direction from managers, artificial deadlines, waterfall project management). Management frames this as a way to mentor & support career growth, but there aren't any internal growth opportunities, so it just ends up being micro-managey.

If that's the type of company someone wants to build their career, better to go someplace bigger and more stable, instead of a start-up that's having high-turnover and growing pains."

Teams are generally filled with smart, ambitious, encouraging people. Every day is different, and employees are encouraged to take on challenging side projects. We're an office culture, but there's a fair amount of flexibility around hours, working from home, and time-off. I look forward to seeing my co-workers every day, and I have a boss who is supportive, understanding and inquisitive.","The goaling process is over-wrought: goals shouldn't need to change every quarter, and they shouldn't cause collision across teams.

203,Hired,Struggling & Rudderless - the Dream is Fading,2017-01-31,1.0,Engineer,"Hired's genesis was a novel idea to upturn the recruiting industry, a massive industry ripe for some innovation. The brand is (was) solid and the mission is inspiring. Hired has been able to raise significant amounts of money and attract some impressive talent from other prominent Valley companies. The work-life balance is decent. A few catered lunches a week and some candy/snacks is nice. People are friendly and fun, especially when away from the office. It's exciting to have colleagues in offices around the world. The core application is fairly simple and doesn’t get much traffic so there are rarely any fires to put out. There are interesting internal tools -- decent chatops culture -- that can be fun.","As most reviews note, there are significant growing pains. However, at some point, that excuse gets tired. Leadership has been unable to move the company forward -- there is a major restructuring and reorg basically every quarter. The founders are AWOL and critical decision-making and long-term strategy is flat-out missing. It’s hard to believe in the mission -- find everyone a job they love -- when 19/20 applicants are rejected from the platform. With a lack of innovative technology, the company is essentially a tech-enabled recruiting agency.

Departments do not get along and seem to have independent and incompatible agendas leading to considerable friction and frustration that trickles down to everyone in the company. Leadership is very vain, and instead of improving the product and following through on the mission, they’d rather do a ton of fancy PR in exotic locales and change the company’s color scheme. Key functions are spread across many offices in multiple timezones which adds considerable overhead to any cross-functional initiative. 

The engineering and product organization is in major upheaval. There are limited opportunities for advancement and management is more interested in seeming busy and checking boxes than in learning, teaching or giving constructive feedback. Promotions are awarded not on merit or impact but on favoritism and nepotism. Biases are rampant which is ironic for a company that wants to be seen as a thought leader in diversity and inclusion. Engineering managers actively fight against helping other departments like marketing or sales and would rather focus on inconsequential backend processes or components. Troubling when focusing on growth and delivering value to users should be paramount."

It's the first role that I'm in where I get to be in sync with many different teams and this helps me succeed in my role.  Upper management takes time to know everyone in the company and you feel like everyone is on a level playing field.

The recruiting team definitely helped me to fully understand the company, my role, and it's culture - resulting in an overall great fit.","As many startups do, Hired has its share of growing pains. There have been personnel changes and people have to be ready to adapt to newly formed roles - be ready to take on challenges and tasks that may be outside of your exact position."
215,Hired,Nowhere but up!,2016-09-19,5.0,,"Very exciting, high growth company. The best company that I've ever worked for. We're printing cash and barely scratching the market opportunity.",With high growth comes growing pains... Feeling it a bit from the top.
216,Hired,Lots of change,2016-09-16,4.0,,"A mission-driven company I felt proud to work for, incredible product with a beautiful design, smart and fun team members","Key people who were amazing departing, poor communication processes, some senior leadership ineffective, constant reorganization"
217,Hired,"A Company True to It's Mission, Brilliant Colleagues",2016-08-23,5.0,,"Where to begin! This has truly been a dream opportunity. Something that really stands out to me -- Even through hyperspeed growth and a few re-orgs, I can confidently say that the same reasons I joined last year are the same reasons I stick around today. Of course there has been incremental change as we've doubled in employee size and passed Series C, but at the end of the day, Hired is a company that is still holding true to it's core values around acting as owners, working cross-functionally, setting aggressive goals, and taking calculated risks. I'm consistently being put outside of my comfort zone, broadening my strengths/skills, and it doesn't suck being surrounded by really cool people doing really cool things with a product that has made such a massive impact on the recruiting industry. 

I'd go as far to say I'm lucky to work here.","Certainly not a con, but a disclaimer if anything: No role at Hired is a cozy 9-5 job, you will have to put in extra work, but that is the nature of a high-growth startup."
218,Hired,Proud to work here,2016-07-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Strong leadership, good compensation, excellent benefits, fun company culture","Like most startups, the company has been through some reorgs that have been slightly painful"
219,Hired,Hell on Earth,2016-06-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Exciting and dynamic environment with lots of promise and potential.,"Extremely hostile trainer who pushed me out in a week and a half.  

I came to Hired ready to go and for the first week of orientation everything was fine.  Then I met the so-called ""trainer"" that had been assigned to me.  Immediately she made me feel like I didn't belong there and subsequently did everything she could to make me feel unwanted, unwelcome and not part of the Hired family.  Repeated requests for help with training were ignored and she was extremely rude and unreasonable.  It was the worst experience I've ever had at any company in twenty years working in my field.  I've never seen anything like it before or since.  Ultimately I had no choice but to leave as it was clear that this person was gunning for me and it would never work.  Sadly I chose to go and when I actually left that day, the trainer actually smiled and blew me a kiss!  Wow!!

If I could give zero stars I would. Even though this happened months ago, I feel compelled to write this review so that hopefully Hired gains better control of their training staff and this never happens to anyone else."
220,Hired,Flexible and Ambitious,2016-06-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Open environment with strong work ethic and transparent communication. Lots of autonomy and room for innovation and creativity.,Continue to achieve focus and alignment on what is important. Think short term and long term and continue to preserve the awesome culture.
221,Hired,Growth & Culture Issues - Hired is Flailing,2016-06-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Began with a novel idea to disrupt the contingency recruiting industry to benefit the candidate employees and employers. Helping people find jobs feels good and working with good people (many of whom have since left) felt great too! The new CEO, Mehul, is sharp and very forward thinking.","Hired is struggling. There have been several MAJOR organizational restructurings with the ouster of the original Founder and CEO, significant layoffs, and centralization of resources in San Francisco. There is also so much fear about the current funding environment and operating efficiently and profitably, that management's focus on metrics has eclipsed everything else, including the attention on employees at the company and the experience for employers and candidate employees on the platform. In addition, strong competitors have emerged with very similar models that offer just as compelling services and even more competitive prices."
222,Hired,Dream Job Gone Bad,2016-05-31,2.0,,"Hired began with the best of intentions and these intentions manifested in the form of intelligent, personable, and hard working people. Hired was once an amazing company to work for and felt like a dream job. The benefits were excellent, quarterly bonuses were paid out, and there was a friendly culture which made me so excited to come to work each day. We were also helping people really find jobs they love!","A shift occurred and Hired went from altruistic to all about the bottom line. Despite rapid growth, it was never enough to keep middle and upper management happy. The obsession with numbers became just that, an obsession. The candidate experience has suffered tremendously due to overworking Talent Advocates and very negative management. Hired used to be different than recruiting agencies, now they are just a search firm whose priority is profit."
223,Hired,Interesting Engineering,2016-05-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Interesting engineering and lots of leeway to experiment on things that interest you. One thing I like is that it's been possible to try new roles within the company.,Startup growing pains. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what's working in the business and what's not because there are so many moving parts.
224,Hired,Great overall environment,2016-03-21,5.0,Business Development,"Great place to work that doesn't feel like work. You get a lot done but since everyone is super-friendly, doesn't feel like work. You never have a moment where you can't wait to leave work, it's fun, but engaging and makes you feel like you're part of something important.","Not really any cons that I've come across so far, everyone is supportive."
225,Hired,Very Good Place to Work,2016-03-04,4.0,,"Amazing work-life balance job.
Management is great and the people really know their stuff.",Can be a bit hectic since there are hundreds of clients to work with.
226,Hired,Hired is the best company I've ever worked for thus far,2016-03-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been at Hired for 10 months now and I have not loved my job any less than I did when I began. I love the transparency that the company has with it's employees and the different tools we use to gage happiness at work, product ideas, and more. I also appreciate the variety of ERG groups here such as Women at Hired and Hired Pride as well as prioritizing the Diversity and Inclusion program. These types of actions are key to what make company culture at Hired one of a kind.

I am lucky to be working with mentally stimulating and hard working people every day- it's a work hard, play hard environment. My team hangouts with one another very often outside of work and they teach me something new every day- they've become my second family. I commute an hour and a half to work every day and I don't mind it simply because I love my job and team, and the commute is more than worth it to me.

In regards to management, my manager is awesome. She is always available to help me, is more than happy to teach me new things outside of my role, honors the unlimited vacation days, has helped me envision where I want to progress my career and is overall a great mentor.",I have nothing bad to say about Hired.
227,Hired,Vettery Review,2016-03-02,5.0,,"Really passionate, smart people. Awesome culture. Really exciting time to work at the company. Growing crazy fast.",People are really grinding in their work.
228,Hired,Inspired by Hired,2015-12-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The internal learning and development opportunities are endless, and the transparency of where the company is headed is beyond refreshing. Somehow the organization has done an amazing job of ensuring that the unbelievable culture does not change, even with the rapid growth. Hired’s mission & core values are clear, realistic and inspiring. By far the best company I have ever worked for!",There are quite a few internal tools utilized. Simplifying the tools that are used would be ideal so daily workflow is easier.
229,Hired,Fantastic People/Business with A Few Growing Pains,2015-11-19,5.0,Product Manager,"Hired has assembled a set of incredibly talented people to tackle an enormous opportunity. Finding a great job is a huge pain point for talented knowledge workers and Hired's marketplace model provides easy access to great jobs with compensation up front. 

Everyone wants what's best for the company - though sometimes people have different ideas what what that is.",Teams sometimes find themselves at cross-purposes. Also sometimes an emphasis on long-term business results can get lost in a desire to get a specific feature out the door or hit a short-term goal.
230,Hired,Great product. Promising future. Major growing pains.,2015-11-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Hired is without question disrupting a very important space. The brand is strong and growing stronger literally by the day. The executive team has a clear and promising path for the future and that's well communicated internally. The paid healthcare is a great perk, catered lunches are nice. The majority of people working here are wonderful people. As with any Corp, there are a few culture killers, but all in all-  the people are great. If you came from a recruiting agency, this place will feel like heaven in comparison. Easy place to make work friends across all departments. High growth mode, which poses natural challenges, but can be fun for people who like that. Open vacation policy is nice if you have a manager that honors it. Flexibility to work in other markets, again if you have a manager that honors it. Some managers are more open than others.","There's a very toxic layer of management that has been making people absolutely miserable. For a company this size, the middle management is heavier than you see at other places. Hired has quickly gone from feeling like a startup, to feeling like a major Corp. Think startup work expectations with a lot of increasing politics, which feels like a direct reflection of middle management. Also, unless you're an engineer or at a very senior level, the pay is exceptionally low, especially for the work load. Very Low reward/appreciation for how much pressure and expectation there is- and there's A LOT with more on the way. Losing perks pretty quickly and not really compensating for it any way.  The company is also dealing with a retention problem, mostly in new markets and on the west coast. Seems like people are staying a year and leaving mainly due to the issues above. Career growth opportunities aren't very clear, and there's a weird policy in place for promotion opps."
231,Hired,"""Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose""",2015-10-19,5.0,Client Executive,"+ Stellar management - the CEO knows everyone by name 
+ Given responsibility right upon arrival - no micromanaging or slow onboarding 
+ Killer team vibes - brightest and most driven group of people I've ever worked with",+ Career trajectory - the company is still young so it's just now becoming a serious discussion. Management is definitely addressing this though.
232,Hired,"Honestly the best job, company, and manager I've ever worked for",2015-10-13,5.0,Talent Advocate,"I'm a Talent Advocate and to start, my job is super exciting.  I get to be a value add for candidate's experience on HIRED and really get to be an objective resource to help them get the most competitive offers.  I even get a budget to give my candidates a white glove experience - taking them to dinner or giving them gifts.

Second, the company - HIRED is absolutely the best place I've ever worked.  So many times I've been given handwritten cards from the President/CEO & from the other teams we work with thanking us for our hard work in making the candidate experience superb (and they often have gift cards and treats inside!)  I feel really well taken care of in terms of having many company sponsored social events, great insurance, 401K, a great salary and quarterly bonuses, lunch 3x per week, snacks galore, etc.

Third, my manager is by far the best manager I've had.  I also interact and work with other managers in the company and I think it is a company focus to hire good managers, not just hire people who have a manager title or who have been with the company for a while - only if they are cut out to be good people managers. Our managers really stick up for & defend their team and care about their personal and professional development.  They are always encouraging us to take development classes, read books, whatever we need to do to move up in our careers.  On top of that, our team gets a long really well and we all strive to push each other & our metrics together. 

We are a very innovative company and always pushing the boundaries.  If an idea doesn't end up with a positive result, we still give it a try and abandon if it doesn't work.  We are constantly taking risks even if there are thoughts that this idea will not work in the end, we still give it a try.","The only real things I can point out are our lacking perks in some areas.

With the amount of money we bring into the company, We should have catered lunches every day, not just 3x/week.  We should have transportation benefits to help pay for parking or public transportation.

We are moving into a new building further in the city and parking will actually cost more, so the company should cover a portion of it.

We are also losing dog privileges in this new building - so that is really disappointing."
233,Hired,Great place to work,2015-09-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great company working with an amazing group of people.  Some of the best friends I've made in my professional career were made here.

235,Hired,"Great company, great team",2015-09-21,5.0,Senior Engineer,"Really love working at Hired.  Love the transparency and overall values of the company.  The team is fantastic and everyone is open to trying new things and hearing ideas from anyone in the company.  Overall, probably the best job I've had.",The only downside of working at Hired that I can tell is we're in a period of rapid growth and sometimes that is hard to manage especially when a lot of the staff hasn't been through this type of growth phase before.  We're all learning.
236,Hired,"Flexible, high growth start up that still manages to have fun and care about employees!",2015-09-10,5.0,Client Executive,"The entire business is going after the same goal and management does a great job of keeping everyone on the same page. Every team is like a little family and everyone works incredibly collaborative together. While they are in a hyper growth stage, I feel very secure in the strategy and being lead by 3 founders who have had successful start ups before and seen it all!","This is definitely a place where everyone works really hard (not unlike all of the other start ups). If you're looking for a cushy 9-5 job, this is not the place for you. Everyone goes above and beyond to get the most out of everyday and completes tasks/projects outside of their typical role."
237,Hired,Category Manager,2015-09-03,5.0,Manager,"Hired is transparent, forward thinking, friendly, fun, and growing like crazy! We have top notch people on every team that I learn from every day.","We are growing very quickly and we make mistakes often. That being said, Hired is great about   creating an open environment and rewarding those who own a mistake and communicate it to the broader org to insure it doesn't happen."

Flexible when you need time off / vacation & unlimited vacation! Great CEO!",General growing pains with trying to scale very quickly. Morale lower than when I first started based on resource constraints and not being able to hire fast enough for our business growth. No 401k matching.

-People make the company to unique.  Everyone is willing to lend a hand and provide resources at any given time.
-Platform we provide is incredible and unique.
-Constantly learning new things.  You are using so many tools and growing on a daily basis.
-Hired truly cares for the people who work here.  They are constantly engaged and asking employees for their opinions.  This is so important in having a happy work culture.","- With any start up environment, you have to be willing to wear multiple hats.  This is actually a great learning experience because you get the opportunity to learn new things."
240,Hired,I consider myself lucky to work here,2015-09-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've worked at a handful of tech companies in San Francisco, and this is absolutely one of the best. From day one, I've been amazed at how unbelievably friendly and welcoming everyone at every level has been -- from the CEO and founders on down. The company also takes employee happiness very seriously and has several initiatives in place to make sure that folks are feeling happy and inspired. Aside from all of the usual start up perks (of which there are many, including flexible work hours/locations, unlimited vacation, snacks, catered lunches, lots of social events, a beautiful office space that is dog-friendly, etc. etc.) there are three other huge benefits to working at Hired -- 1) amazing work/life balance 2) the ability to work for a company that is actually doing something BIG and worthwhile and 3) working for a successful, revenue-generating startup that is run by people who know what they are doing.","None worth mentioning. Sure,  a 401K match would be nice, but that really pales in comparison to all of the other perks and opportunities."
241,Hired,No day is the same and it's awesome,2015-09-01,5.0,,"Working here has given me the opportunity to take ownership over big projects, make an impact on the business and hone in on skills to develop and nurture.  My colleagues are some of the most intelligent people I've ever had the opportunity to work with and I learn from them everyday.",In certain situations the fast growth of the company outpaces the current infrastructure but I'd take hypergrowth to perfect process any day.
242,Hired,"Fun, High-growth place to work!",2015-08-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"Great culture, people are very friendly and excited to help you learn
Pair programming is truly embedded in the culture. Teaching goes along with that.
Engineers make up a relatively small percent of the company (less than 25%) so you interact with people outside your job a lot! Plus there are many social events.
Every employee's birthday is celebrated with their favorite treat and singing :)
High-growth, cushy margin business
Focus on quality and product because we don't have scaling issues
Great financials transparency","No 401(k) matching

243,Hired,Client Executive,2015-06-08,1.0,,Cool environment and free food.,Nobody knows what to do in the company. There's no leadership or proper training for new hires. Leads will connect you with new clients and leave you hanging. The platform is basically scamming candidates to get hired by other companies.

245,Hired,Hired is the best company I've worked at in my young career.,2015-02-06,5.0,,"The company is a terrific mix of young, ambitious talent and seasoned leadership. The founders are all successful entrepreneurs.

246,Hired,Happiest me ever,2015-02-03,5.0,Software Engineer,"1. lots of impact, tons of career growth opportunities. They don't land on you, but they are very reachable. You just need to be prepared by work the best out of you
2. Work life balance is superb. I've never left later than 6pm and I came in around 10am. Never done one overtime, and we agreed in our culture that we prefer quality over deadline met. Honestly, we don't set deadline to 99% of the things we are working on. I periodically do some overtime work my selves at night, but it's totally voluntary.
3. Constantly being improved engineering process. I've seen more and more automations, more and more process documentations and more and more retro feedbacks gets fixed/improved and make everyone happy. It's great to see improvements as you can expect things will be better and better
4. Constructive (seriously) feedback. I know it sounds hurtful but they really helped me improve. I grow a lot in just one year.","1. Benefits is definitely not matching like those tech giants

248,Hired,The only job where I'd rather work on site than from home,2015-02-02,5.0,Talent,"I've been a professional employee for 5 companies in 9 years of employment, and Hired has been my unequivocal favorite place to work. I've been here just over 6 months, though the time has flown by.

+The team is incredible. I used to love excuses to work from home, but now I wake up in the morning excited to come to the office. People here are authentic, fun to work with, and incredibly smart and effective. If you like fast-paced, dynamic people... this is your home. We also get opportunities to get to know each other. Each month we are assigned a random group and are treated to a lunch out in the city with that group. It makes so I feel like I really know everyone I work with.

+We are doing amazing work. Which job to take is one of the most important decisions you make in life. Most people spend more time at work than awake at home. Knowing that our whole mission is to make job searching not suck so much, is something I feel good doing every single day. More than that, we have a promising business plan that is totally turning the recruiting industry on its head.

+They promote from within. I feel like I have a future at Hired, because I have seen my colleagues who contribute as top performers in the organization move up. I was hired to backfill someone who got a promotion, and I feel confident that I can someday achieve the same. 

+Fun perks. We get a stipend to refund our gym memberships, our cell phone bills, lunch'n'learns on Thursdays, team events,100% covered health care plans, a stocked kitchen with snacks and drinks, and every new hire gets a bottle of Dom Perignon (a total treat). 

+Fast growth, but not at the rate that you feel like a number. When I took the job at Hired, I had an offer with Forbes' 2014 ""hottest startup"". I turned it down to work at Hired and I have never for a single day regretted that decision. While a lot of people might jump at that type of opportunity, I felt like I was a number, and like I wouldn't have the opportunities for growth I wanted.","-No employer matching on 401k

-Catered lunch is weekly, not daily

-No free parking available at the office for employees who drive (there are meters outside and a bunch of lots, just not free)
