13,Hootsuite,"Benefits are great, but you may feel like work is robbing you of all enthusiasm and joy.",2022-02-17,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"In terms of benefits, I must admit the whole offer is pretty awesome! I have rarely seen that in other companies (we all start with 4 weeks of vacation, an extra week for wellness during summer, a super generous policy regarding parental leave, etc). The group insurance is pretty cool too!

If you prefer a structured work environment and don't place a high value on your work or the impact you make, you could be very happy there, while enjoying the benefits and having a very good work-life balance!","However, although they claim to have this cool mindset where you can change things and be innovative, it's almost like working for a big elephantine company where everything is just super slow, super administrative. I really mean it: everything is slow, there's a specific process for every little thing, and I wouldn't advise you not to follow it or challenge it.

The key to success here is to know the processes and follow them scrupulously, even if it doesn't make sense or slows down the business.

I would not recommend this place to people who value a fast-paced, agile work environment, or to people who need to feel like they are making an impact.

My last point to the leadership team: you may not see it, but the way the company is actually focused on processes drains the innovation from people. In the end, many of us just give in and stop bringing innovative ideas to the table and just do the bare minimum. The worst part is that you stay satisfied when we do that."

42,Hootsuite,"Great company to grow at, but not a long term place.",2021-10-10,4.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"Early days Hootsuite was a high energy, fun, collaborative company where new ideas were valued and everyone could get behind a common goal. 
It seems most of their growing pains are behind them, and after a couple years of turmoil and high employee churn the new CEO and leadership have stabilized the ship and focused on employees and customers instead of their own ambitions.","Between 2014-2017 the company was constantly pivoting between focusing on the enterprise vs. self-serve market. It took them 3 years to decide on the Enterprise SMB niche as their sweet-spot. This was the cause of tremendous growing pains, largely attributable to the CEO's inability to make up his mind. This was reflected in the string of failed acquisitions (Brightkit, Zeetl, Adespresso, Liftmetrix) and failed expansions (Singapore, Brazil, Industry Principal team, etc.) 
While most of these issues seem to be in the past, there is still one lingering large issue at Hootsuite: their development team has almost no connection to customers, and is not accountable to customer success. Their product team never talked to customers. Things like customer advisory boards, customer facing roadmap feedback sessions, product ownership of showstopping critical bugs, etc. Were never implemented. As a result the product team is often building product in a vacuum, caring only about cool new projects that can further their careers rather than maintaining critical functionality customers rely on."

Often a serious lack of strategy and guidance, especially in EMEA .. it seems like Hootsuite goes through constant identity crises of who and what they want to be. Do we want to be Enterprise. Do we want to be edgy cool tech company. Its a constant rebranding with little to no platform product development despite being constantly told of roadmaps and new functionalities. With the Commercial Sales team you'll inevitably deal with a lot of tasks and customers that will in no way contribute to your own success and that is largely due to marketing pushing every single ""lead"" possible to sales teams."

135,Hootsuite,Lots of variables,2020-09-04,3.0,Billing Dev,"Cool people that really want to help and solve problems for users.

The product actually saves a lot of time so that's why people buy it.

Nice extra-comp benefits.

Good place to gather experience and even for some career-hopping.

Isolated teams of really good people: devs, product, dev-ops, marketers, sales, success, support. However, your mileage might vary.

Probably on a good path with the new changes in leadership (ceo, cto, etc.)","Vision changes yearly. A third of each year is wasted on planning the next year and on doing a slide for the company kick-off. I've never seen so many management/directors changing emails with C-levels because the graph in the slide for the meeting has wrong color.

For a couple of years there was a revolving door of product dev leaders: each new one changed the plans of the previous leader. At some point each of these product leaders clashed with somebody higher up (ceo, board, whatever) so they took some family time. Rinse and repeat for a year.

There's a ton of SaaS services used as tools for your day to day job: this means that sometime these tools will not communicate with each other. When you have to gather data you'll hate it.

Pockets of knowledge are really hard to get ahold of because the experienced people leave without writing documentation or some sort of ""here's who I used to talk to in case you need x"".

Very few teams have targets defined in full and know what's expected from them to succeed.

I've met a few leaders that said ""we have to do this, get to it and then I'll correct you after you spent a lot of hours on it because I had something else in mind"". 
Spend half an hour to write your damn project specs!

Compensation is pretty low in some areas. Certainly not ""successful saas"" level. Salary adjustments are not so motivational when they happen. You can get a meaningful salary adjustment if you promote to a different role. Loads of people get this and that's why the employee churn is often pretty high. Don't expect to do anything with those stock options you're getting."

They also only offer ""surface level"" perks

170,Hootsuite,All-around a fair and interesting work environment,2019-09-28,5.0,Solutions Consultant,"Before I go on, quick note: everything varies team to team, leader to leader. If you're considering working at Hootsuite, I strongly recommend speaking to a few people currently on the team you're interested in joining.

-Flexible work culture: Employees are trusted to fulfill their responsibilities on their own accord. Work times, locations, and approach can all be molded to your lifestyle. This of course varies team-team though. I also felt that most colleagues were relatively easy-going.

-Collaborative: Generally, in my experience, teams are collaborative and open to cross-silo input.

-Room for Creativity: Despite Hootsuite's size, there are processes that are lacking or outdated. As such, there's room to shape the role that you're in and bring new ideas forward. I never felt beholden to a certain approach to anything.

-Interesting Product, Ecosystem, and Partners: Hootsuite is so much more than the simple social media scheduling tool you may know about. There's several modules within the enterprise platform, multiple partners to resell, and 200+ tech ecosystem integrations - all of which make selling and supporting Hootsuite intellectually more interesting than you may think.

Broad Scale: Hootsuite has an impressive footprint across small, medium, and large businesses, across multiple verticals. This helps reduce monotony in sales + service roles.","While I really enjoyed working at Hootsuite, every pro listed above does come with a downside.

Product Strategy: The product direction can be spread between to SMB, Mid-Market, and Enterprise needs. It's challenging to do anything particularly unique with that broad of a focus.

Visibility = Work Quality: At times, it feels like the ability to sell your work internally is equally important to the actual work that you do.  There's so much happening at all times, so you do need to invest time into internal visibility in order to gain recognition and respect internally. As such, there can be unintentional bias against introverts or employees that don't focus on this. This could just be a reality in larger companies though (I came from smaller companies <100 people where the internal schmoozing / selling was as necessary).

Pace: While the business is still growing, it's no longer in hyper-growth mode. If you're looking for something extremely fast paced, this isn't it."

173,Hootsuite,Toxic Company,2019-08-22,1.0,Sales Manager,Good place to start your career. Spend some time at Hootsuite and then move on with a well known brand on your CV.

175,Hootsuite,Customer Support Advocate,2019-08-05,1.0,Support,Amazing colleagues. They care about their clients.,"No possibilities to evolve unless we're talking about backfills/they lose talent that needs to be replaced.

Management doesn't really hear the feedback that's given. They do create anonymous surveys, but it feels like it's only a task to be marked as done  on their checklist. No real improvements are made afterwards and there's a feeling that employees are easily replaceable. 
As a result, they lose talent and quality while effectively reducing some costs.

Very toxic environment. Different ideas than those already in place are not really welcomed (and it's very likely that those existing ideas are...toxic).

Lots of resources to help salespeople be successful.,"The CEO is so hell bent on getting his exit that after the unsuccessful attempt to sell the company for a price he felt it was worth, they continued hiring like mad just before leading up to a major layoff.

What kind of company keeps hiring at full tilt only to lay off people a few weeks down the road? And just so that they can pretty up the balance sheet and make it look more attractive to buyers?  

Let's just say there's a reason why so many amazing leaders have left over the last year and why turnover is so high on the sales side.  

You only have to look at how the company has failed to develop the most basic product enhancements or how they handled the recent ""re-org"" where they laid off more than 100 experienced people.  It's shameful.  Poor leadership.  

I think the leadership continues to make it clear they don't really care very much about their employees -just their exit.  Maybe that's why there's so little loyalty, and such a high turnover.  

And what's the CEO's approval rating?  62% ...yeah, that sounds about right."

202,Hootsuite,SnootSuite,2019-03-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I unfortunately have to limit to the perks of the job rather than its successes, innovation, people or culture.  
1.	Free parking (however, if you’re not an exec, you will need to arrive 1 hour before your start time to ensure you get one of the limited spots).  
2.	Dog friendly (however, if your supervisor is not dog friendly – or someone sitting in your area/pod isn’t – you will not be allowed to bring in your dog).  
3.	Work-from-home  (however, if your supervisor wants you around for whatever reason - even if you’re not in face-to-face meetings - this is not an option).
4.	Coffee, tea, fruit and granola.","1.  No formal training for your role – you’re given a laptop and put through a weeks’ worth of departmental presentations which are confusing and mostly have nothing to do with your position – and expected to go.  If there is someone in a similar role, they are not going to be supportive or helpful – they will view you as a threat and withhold pertinent information to ensure their job security.  In short, you are not setup for success:  you are positioned to compete with your fellow coworkers.
2.  (mostly – there are always exceptions) The successful peeps are the ones that don’t require a work/life balance and can stay until late and work the weekends (sending emails to their supervisor during these non-working times to ensure their ""grit"" is discovered) – and be patted on the back for doing so while you’re needing to leave at the end of your working day to go pick up your kids.
3.  HR aka ""People"" are void of professional sensitivities and emotional intelligence (at least in the department I was in).  If the People Lead in your department doesn’t personally like you, despite your work ethic, drive and successes; your days are numbered.  I witnessed and overheard countless conversations/gossip about employees that should’ve been behind closed doors – and with more neutrality and much less emotionalism which one would expect from HR.

- Good social activities, great for meeting people
- Fitness classes on site
- Work/life balance","Unfortunately there are a lot of problems in the organization. I get the sense that 4-5 years ago it was an awesome place to work and really grow your career, which is why I was so excited to work at Hootsuite. I wanted to learn and grow with the company.  However, there are major issues:

- Low Pay. Everyone says it, but these days for Vancouver, it's really, really low. This demonstrates a lack of recognition of what's happening in the market place.

- Lack of career growth. There are many people that have grown up with the company and experienced great opportunities. If you came on board in the last couple of years, it's been non existent. There's no standardization or documentation for career goals, promotions, training, etc. You are left treading water, wondering how you are performing and what you can improve on.

- Bro culture. If you had said to me that this was an issue at Hootsuite when I first got hired, I wouldn't have believed it. Until I saw it in action. Working there felt like a popularity contest. I was told by my manager that I needed to become friends with certain individuals if I had any hope of progressing - unfortunately the caliber of my work simply wasn't going to be enough. I have never experienced this attitude in the workplace before.

- Volatile environment. Key people would just disappear. People would leave and would not be replaced.

There was a common complaint from leadership about how difficult it was to find good talent in Vancouver, yet the company allows very talented people to walk out the door everyday. It's very expensive to keep recruiting and replacing employees."

There's all the pro's I listed above, but those perks don't play into your day-to-day there when you have to deal with everything else. First off, your pay is below industry by a lot (I was making at least 5k less than my peers). Secondly leadership and management are awful. You see people axed and laid off, there's a kool-aid culture where you can't say anything bad about the company, and in ESPECIALLY the sales team, every time we fail to reach a target as a whole, there's an organizational witch hunt to find out the reason why, and there's a strategy switch. I'd say our strategy changed every other quarter. It was exhausting, especially with sales cycle that were this long. I didn't see myself advancing and I disagreed with the frequent changes there were. Hootsuite isn't a start-up anymore and their leaders have to stop acting like it is. Everytime there is an impromptu switch from the leaders, we the employees are left scratching our heads with all the processes and other things that need to be changed. At the end of the day, those perks/pro's listed above are great but when you're really trying to build your career and establish yourself in tech, it's not the best place to learn and grow."

The smartest people I've ever met chasing innovative ideas.
Absolutely the best benefits. Maternity leave, bereavement, extended health, in-house massage - the Total Rewards team has built a top notch selection of benefits.
Casual work environment - dogs, jeans, be yourself and look like yourself.","Absolute chaos and lack of direction. Senior leadership tries to act as if they have it together, but if you get a chance to see behind the curtains it's clear they struggle to get along, and can't align on where the company is going.
Burnout culture. Expect to work 60+ hours per week every week, unless you're in Product and some pockets of Marketing.
Politics are incredibly thick and it can impact your ability to get a promotion or be rewarded.
The in-house benefits like yoga/fitness are just painting on the wall. When you are working 60+ hours per week and haven't taken a lunch break in a year, it's unachievable to go to a lunchtime fitness class.
Turnover is incredibly high and average tenure isn't more than a year and a half. It just contributes to the chaotic atmosphere.
Career opportunities aren't within, they're outside the Hootsuite walls once you've put in your time. Do your time, get the brand, and get out before the long hours and stress start affecting your health.

263,Hootsuite,Consider this a lighthouse warning and avoid sinking your own ship,2018-02-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"One of the things that really stands out here is the culture, they have it in abundance. Beer Fridays, summer local retreats, good vacation, pension & benefits. The WeWork office in London has spectacular views of St Katherines dock and the Tower of London.  Also they have a great approach with moving staff around if you are good, you can change career track or even location if the job warrants it.","If you are in Sales then be aware that the comp/bonus/targets are changed quarterly and usually not in your favour. You are also expected to only do deals above a certain threshold, anything else needs to be passed to the commercial AE's. If you are in Marketing you are generally ok as the team is the size of a U.N. peacekeeping force, results can vary though. The company's results vary from quarter to quarter, and if it's a bad quarter then expect headcount freeze or even layoff's to balance the books. If it's a good quarter then enjoy the party as it doesn't happen often. There is continuous restructuring every quarter so expect some turmoil while some senior management try to save their own jobs. Salaries are not competitive unless you know someone high up in which case they will pay whatever it takes to bring you in. The office will probably be changed later this year as the full cost of having the WeWork office vs the EMEA revenue will be re-balanced. There is also some infighting within the sales teams as each leader tries to grab territory to hit his or her number, lack of decision making from higher up only adds to the issues faced by AE's. If you are pregnant, I pray for you. The company doesn't deal with pregnancy very well and prepare to even lose your job after with a pay off."
264,Hootsuite,Too many inexperienced people in leadership,2018-01-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Decent amount of vacation time.
-Company tracks an internal movement metric to allow employees to try new roles and gain experience.","The amount of missing senior leadership is very apparent.  No CIO, COO, CTO, new CFO only just started in Jan 2018.  There is a complete lack of unified direction for the company.  With all of the missing pieces there is no experienced leadership that understands how departments functions together, or the business impact of what their departments decisions have on the rest of the org.  

Middle management is made up of people that just happened to take over roles from all of the previous exits.  They are trying to hire people with more experience (which is good), but the junior level middle management is threatened by the same experienced people they are looking to hire, so much of their experience is neglected or ignored.  The inexperienced leadership will burn endless cycles trying to solve problems that have simple solutions- if only they would ask for help.  This only further compounds cross org problems as the chasms between departmental silos grow wider.
Vancouver is still the center of the universe.  If you don't live in Vancouver...don't bother working here.  ALL of the ""good"" ideas come out of Vancouver.  For such a small company that is global, it is amazing how Toronto and UK employees have such little voice when it comes to helping shape or influence overall business impact.  UK employees stay late on calls to meet with Vancouver employees, but you'll seldom get someone in Vancouver to get on the phone before 8am.

They brand themselves differently as to what they actually are. All the ""cool"", ""hipster"", flex hour etc vibe is all dependent on being a favourite; there are different rules for different people. Do not expect anything to be confidential or for HR to do anything that is actually HR. I have a difficult time taking HR seriously when they participate in offsite activities in which hallucinogens are openly served and therefore must be condoned. How can they be objective in the workplace after grinding with staff in hot springs at an offsite event? Where are the boundaries? Most activities revolve around alcohol and drinking in excess. 

Culture: there is little substance behind the traditional office perks, which probably appeals to those with little work experience and think fresh fruit is cool. They always say they are ""transitioning from a startup to a global company"" but the constant ""growing pains"" from this ""transition"" seems more like an excuse for bad behaviour, bad decisions and incompetence - the fact is they don't appropriately address the bad behaviour (from people they like) and have little structure in the way of policies or direction.  Sales ""leadership"" is TERRIBLE and has made numerous inappropriate and degrading comments to staff. Favouritism is huge here with many people getting jobs because they know or are friends with leadership. 

They endorse and publicize the ""employee manifesto"" and the concept of #BSU when the reality is this: you can only BSU and offer your opinion if you're a favourite and part of the clique. If you BSU and you aren't a favourite you'll be fired after a while. Also, the manifesto was made years ago by employees who have likely left the organization; it's outdated and doesn't reflect who they REALLY are. It's mainly for PR."

- As I exceeded targets, opportunities to take on additional responsibility were presented to me and was promoted through the business on multiple occasions.

- Had the opportunity to work in an International office and gain that experience as well

- Absolutely loved the flat nature of the business and that any C-Suite leader had time to answer questions throughout the day.

- Lastly, left the company with an amazing professional and personal network. The people are truly what make this organization so amazing","- Not many companies grow from 150 to +1000 employees in 5 years, which naturally causes some growing pains. The biggest recommendation I'd give to new employees is to take the initiative in shaping the direction of your career and seek out mentors that know how to navigate the hyper-growth. With such growth, it's possible that your next job doesn't exist yet. It's critical to have those conversations early to ensure all parties are aligned on where you want to go next.

Being in the Top Right of the Forrester Wave is just awesome. Yes our product went through some tough times as we rebuilt it - but oh my, it's formidable now - and that ranking really cements it.

With that is coming some great confidence in the company, as we look to really take us to another level. We have a strong leadership team that is experienced, and I believe that we have weeded out some of the people that shouldn't have been here.

Also benefits have improved a LOT, there is some way to go, but we have private medical, life insurance, pension, RSUs, options, dogs in the office and good amount of holiday.

In EMEA I think we finally have a leader that can take us places. He gets social, gets people and also understands Enterprise.

The CEO has great vision for the company, is inclusive, has a great team around him with more experience than ever before and is importantly open to criticism, comment and debate - we have great discussions with him directly on Workplace. 

There have been mistakes, and we have all learned form them, including him.","Although we have a pension in the UK it is the most basic one possible. Would be good to look at having something more standard in industry.

Learning and Development is still lacking all over the company. There are no funds, and the in house courses are hard to come by, always full and no one ever knows about them. Also it's always delivered by internal people - we need to get real experts to deliver this and also have structure.

- Technical managers do not have much/any coding experience; you are dealing mostly with people that have ""soft"" skills - i.e. creating jira tickets, scheduling meetings. No actual mentorship of any kind takes place here. Poor developers have been promoted to managers - the louder you work, the higher your probability of landing one of these roles. Technical Managers pride themselves in staying away from the code. You will never see a manager raise a pull request in order to solve an issue. If you are looking for technical leadership, you will not find it here as there are no leaders.

- There is an over abundance of ""project/agile"" advocates in the company. These people have titles of 'software engineer' and 'development coach' , but they don't actually write code. They excel at scheduling meetings, editing google docs and creating jira tickets.

- Poor tech stack. Extremely hard to make simple changes due to the lack of a proper dev environment - you cannot run everything on your own machine (due to the unnecessary adoption of a microservice architecture, they have a dev ""cloud"" setup). You are dealing with a PHP monolith that lacks significant test coverage. JVM culture and unnecessary usage of design patterns are a common theme.

- Outdated laptops - 2011 MBP

- Developers lack fundamental CS skills; the bar is set very low. Take a look at the interview questions that are being asked.

- Co-ops and Junior Developers often outperform developers that have been at the company for years. It's common to see co-ops mentoring full-timers.

- Configuration over convention. As a developer, a significant portion of your time is spent setting up your machine depending on the project you are working on. There is an abundance of tribal knowledge. Deployments are not trivial due to flaky tests and inconsistent environments.

- Technical debt is seldom addressed. There is too much to count.

- Very poor code reviews. ""Extremely"" large pull requests are a common occurrence.

- Security and Ops teams are floating around creating unnecessary procedures to stay relevant in the company. Teams are more than capable of managing their own products, however they are not given the autonomy."

326,Hootsuite,A pure nightmare,2017-04-12,1.0,Marketing,"First off, I'll start listing the few things that are good with this company which sadly are all limited to the benefits and perks.

It has a nice benefits package which includes msp coverage, 100% dental and vision included as well as coverage for other health related services, (rmt, etc). Gym facilities are available as well as fitness classes and yoga.

Free coffee, fruit and social beer fridays are also nice but not really difference makers.

Mostly anyone not in management is actually a decent, fun and relatable person.

Various social clubs are also nice. 

Yearly summer and winter parties are a thing but are more of a frat-party-spring-break-in-cancun-get-wasted kind of thing. 

That pretty much sums it up :)","Management is very poor. Good leaders are very rare and few (if any). Good luck finding a leader who will actually have your career development in mind. 

Turn-over is quite high (2-3 people every week) despite any numbers you see externally, the only reason they seem to be growing is because they are hiring just as much if not more than people are leaving.

The hiring process seems more focused on filling seats than finding the right fit or people to develop.

All the posts that you see on the web about an open culture and internal promotions are purely PR and do not reflect the actual culture of the company in general. It's actually quite impossible to even be considered for anything like that.

The company has great external facing values but it only takes 3-4 months to discover the true values that most of the leadership live by: 'Cover your own a**' and 'Look out for number one'

There is little to no interest in growing and investing in the people already there.

Structure-wise, it's quite disorganized as projects are 99% of the time delayed, canceled or redone. Politics and competition between departments is quite prevalent and makes for a really toxic environment overall. Communication across teams is quite poor.

There is no overtime pay and tho it's 'not expected', workloads are nowhere near manageable for a 9-5 schedule.

There is definitely a mob mentality across most leadership. They either have blinders on or are 100% concerned with covering their own backs. 

That being said, once you have spent 3-4 months there you learn how much of a fear-based culture the company really is.

Execs pretty much have free reign over anything with little to no consequence to their actions, current social media darling CEO included.

If a 0 star rating was an option, it would be 100% appropriate.

Best Advice: find someone not in leadership in your department of interest and get their 100% honest outside-of-work opinion about working there otherwise you might regret it."
327,Hootsuite,Great place to be but fear its heading in the wrong direction,2017-04-11,4.0,Corporate Account Executive,Hootsuite was one of the best places I could ask for to start my career.,"Growing with the company for 3 years I've seen the culture slide and its turning into something many people didn't sign up for. You are seeing a lot of the old guard change at Hootsuite and there is a reason, I hope they can bring it back to what it once was"
328,Hootsuite,Their people focused culture is all talk,2017-03-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The product is great and you can work with some really smart people,"The HR team disclose confidential discussions on a frequent basis and can be very underhand and unprofessional with exiting people without sound cause. There is a huge turnaround in staff, including management and c-level employees
Management and c-level often make very emotional decisions and are not supportive when it comes to professional growth.
They claim to be focused on people culture but there is little work-life balance - you may be able to work from home, but you are expected to always be working. It's dressed up as something Ryan likes to call 'grit'.
About 60% of the people I worked with when I joined last year have been exited or moved on.
The management and c-level team are very arrogant."
329,Hootsuite,Good for junior devs only,2017-03-13,2.0,Software Developer,"- Nice people and comfortable, relaxed culture
- Lots of mentorship available to give and take
- Standard 8-hour work days, for Software Developers at least
- Very good place for coops and junior devs to learn the tropes","Not a good place for intermediate and senior developers.

Don't count on getting a promotion even if you should qualify for it according to their own statements. Your manager will tell you that you still need to work on X, then in a few months you will be moved to a different team in a reorg, the new manager will tell you that you still need to work on Y to get that Senior Developer position, then a few months later another reorg and a new manager, etc. This has been going on for the last 18 months with no end in sight. Meanwhile you're getting glowing ""exceeds expectations"" performance reviews from those managers and everyone you worked with, but that never translates into anything other than satisfying your ego for a moment.

In late 2016 they started paying for MSP, added another week of vacation to everyone (replaced the Christmas week off, the base is 4 weeks now), and promised small RSU grants that will take forever to vest, which is why I guess their ratings here on Glassdoor suddenly shot up.

But none of that advances my career, so I guess I'll have to advance it elsewhere.

The company is in general seems to be moving towards hiring more coops and juniors. I think the management's general idea is that they have too many seniors. You'd never tell looking at the codebase, because all the seniors are busy mentoring more junior developers instead of writing good code. Then good developers leave, unsatisfied with organizational chaos and lack of career progression. Literally all the people I've worked with when I started have left already. I stayed for so long because I had some hope for career development, and because I was waiting for my permanent residence which was tied to that specific job, another common theme here."
330,Hootsuite,The name of the game is hustle!,2017-03-11,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Very strong company culture that is spoken about all the time but until you work here you don't realize how much it affects you day in and day out in the most positive of ways. You actually enjoy your work. From your business decisions to your reviews to how you conduct yourself on internal Facebook it's truly amazing to see how our culture is actively formed, discussed and evolving. You have the ability to speak freely and actually shape the culture. The thing is you have the ability to do whatever you want at Hootsuite. Whether that's do nothing and wait for something to happen to you or whether that's to send a global email to run a program - it's completely up to you. People who can take advantage of that and who can take initiative do well. People who wait for instructions and complain about things that are entirely in their control to change do not do well. We recently had an incident where yes our CEO as you may already have heard sent a prank number to a male reporter. Those who work with him or know him know that it was a genuine mistake with long standing repercussions but what evolved from that internally is honestly quite special and made us all feel even stronger about the fact that we work at an amazing workplace and for an amazing CEO. We are close knit and think the outcome of it internally brought us all closer together as a company. A lot of ownership and heartfelt sentiment internally with a measure to do better moving forward not just in our dialogue but in our actions. We had honest and open discussions and I couldn't be prouder to work with a team that may stumble but constantly strives to be better every single day. It's easy to point fingers from outside or as a new hire but I work with a lot of people who really care, are super honest and radical and speak their minds. It's not a koolaid drinking company any longer. We have a lot of people that are in it to win it and are here to go the distance. Amazing leadership team. Executives are some of the best, most caring and personally involved in their team I've ever seen. They truly care and are invested in their team. When it comes to female diversity it's been great to see C level like Traci Mercer, Kirsty Traill who's brilliant, Penny Wilson who has an amazing mind, Candice Pederson, Dipti EMEA, Elizabeth for community, Leila one of the best CSM's, Crystal and Gillian in APAC, Susan Perry, Ashley Penning, Lara, Karolina, Michelle, Niamh in UK, strong females all across the globe and very tight knit globally. Coffee syncs and coffee chats are a great way to reach out to anyone from C level to someone across the globe. Everyone is very open to meeting you just need to put something in their calendar and you have the opportunity to pick some of the best minds in the business over coffee. #Randomcoffee also very cool way to get to know people in the company and connect with different departments via internal coffee match up system. Read a review complaining about the amount of work. This is a tech company, you get recognized and paid with bonuses or RSU's and promotions if you work hard. If you want a 9-5 where you clock in at 8:59 and clock out at 4:59 this isn't the job for you. My boss has never told me to stay late or expected me to have an email read at 11pm. Working hours are 100% respected but you have your own book of business and your own work to manage. I essentially make my own hours if you work really hard one evening you come in a little late the next morning or you work from home - that's called real life. You get what you have to do done. Great opportunities to work from different offices across the globe as well and save some vacation time if needed.",Some newcomers have heard of Hootsuite but think its a place where you can just come and drink beer on the roof instead of actually having to work. They often find it hard to adjust the perception they had in their mind and haven't worked long enough with the company to realize we are still growing and expect everything to be done for them rather than them using their own brains or initiative to get things done. They usually don't last long and then leave bitter reviews! Those newbies aside the only con is our HR team that don't focus on internal candidates globally enough. People have been given visas or are looking to stay permanently but HR does not do anything to help facilitate the next step. Employees often waiting till a week before having to move countries before realizing if they get to keep working with the company or not. Employee completely on their own for securing their next position regardless of seniority. Seen it happen to a few friends who had come into Canada on visas but luckily they were able to get PR. HR did not help or help move to different offices where they could have worked.
331,Hootsuite,Great for your early career,2017-03-11,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's a young company with a funky work space and active non work related activities to promote health, team bonding etc. Depending on your manager's style there's flexibility to work remotely. Fun work environment that pick up and run with the latest social media trends.",Little room for diversity although the company made improvements. Work culture is catered to extroverts in their twenties that are in it for the free booze and casual work environment. Not much room for personal development or salary increase. Weak organizational leadership.
332,Hootsuite,Reality Vs. Perception is very different,2017-03-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- People are friendly and welcoming here, and generally speaking there isn't a lot of ego. Most of the ego i've observed has been from the executive team. For the most part, people are just focused on trying to get the work done, and there is a huge amount of work. 

- Company is split across 3 buildings within a few blocks, which leads to a slightly silo-ed feel. Sometimes it's nice to get out for a few minutes of air and a walk between the buildings. This makes it difficult to be on time for meetings occasionally. 

- Dog friendly office","- They talk a lot about work/life balance but the reality is that people are still there way past 5pm and I regularly receive emails at 10:30pm at night and over weekends. Leadership are the worst for this. I've also noticed that because the workload is so heavy and they only give 5 sick days a year, people often come into the office sick and spread it around.

 - Like most tech companies, things move at warp speed. However, they're so focused on speed that basic yet important stuff gets forgotten about or dropped e.g. new employee onboarding leaves a lot to be desired and really does not set new people up for success. I've heard a number of new staff say they are left to figure things out for themselves (which isn't an efficient use of time or resources). They also need to learn how to work smarter. It's a regular complaint that there are too many meetings and the meeting-heavy company culture is impacting productivity.

-  I had to negotiate hard on salary as they tried to lowball. They also stressed about the free yoga classes and gym as part of the compensation package. i work 8 hours solid, often with no lunch and so don't get to avail of these 'perks'. 

-  I applied for, interviewed and joined because of a role that was mutually agreed upon. The reality has turned out to be different. I was in the job for a few weeks before they started ""moving the goalposts"" and adding additional heavy workload that did not fall under what was agreed on (effectively increasing my workload to that of 2 people). Others in my field have echoed similar experiences.

- I was very clear in my interview that i work well with all types of people except micromanagers and people who are disrespectful/unsupportive of their staff. Despite telling them this, I'm now working with a micromanager who is cold, unsupportive, plays favorites, and whose direct reports are fearful of their wrath.

- Very disorganized, very few processes and policies in place which makes things chaotic and means folks do things differently (often resulting in budget spend that is not necessary). There's a lot of the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. 

- Like many tech orgs, employee turn over is high. A number of my team have left recently to work elsewhere. I won't be too far behind them. My observations lead me to believe that folks stay here for a while, learn what they can, start to burn out from the workload for not enough pay and move onto better paying roles elsewhere.

- CEO recently tweeted/responded to an interview request by asking the reporter to call 1-800-EAT-DICK. I was horrified to see the head of a social media/marketing organization lose his cool on a public forum without zero regard as to how his stupid, homophobic and sexists actions might have affected the reputation of the organization or the livelihoods of his staff."
333,Hootsuite,Easygoing culture with some good opportunities,2017-03-06,4.0,Junior Software Developer,"Great people, laid-back and social work environment, but mostly respectful of developers' need for focus. Compassionate and reasonable people in leadership/management, at least in the technical part of the organization.

Good work-life balance, very few people choose to work long hours or weekends. Great insurance and decent benefits; gym, yoga, and massage all offered on-site. There is a well-equipped music rehearsal room, which is an awesome perk that I've never seen before. Weekly social with open taps for beer, wine, and cider. Cool facilities with lots of space.

Opportunities for growth and learning if you look for them. Rate of growth is crazy and performance can be rewarded with pretty fast promotion. Enthusiasm for integrating new ideas and technology seems strong. Technical employees get high-end laptops and the company doesn't seem to be stingy when it comes to training and professional development. Some good in-house knowledge sharing as well.

Decision-making process is decentralized, so teams have a LOT of autonomy in setting their direction; you rarely feel like you're following orders. Trust is high; not a lot of bureaucracy around things like equipment or facilities.","Immature and inefficient technical processes. Some systems are brittle and tightly-coupled, causing frustrations in day-to-day work; ownership of systems is in some cases uncertain and no one wants to take responsibility for improving or decoupling them. Overall productivity does not seem especially high. Quality of extant code, processes, documentation, and development tools is inconsistent, although new projects seem to be adopting better practices. Lack of standardization around e.g. internal APIs. Ops is probably understaffed, or just insufficiently automated.

Technical employees are a minority, although it's still a lot of people. Dev has a good culture but is pretty segregated from the rest of the company (largely sales). The messaging from up top sometimes feels kind of sales-heavy (""rah rah let's crush those targets"" and the devs all roll their eyes).

The decentralized structure, as well as fast pace of growth and change, means you need to interact with a lot of different people in day-to-day work, which can be plus; but if you're not socially outgoing, it could be really difficult to solve problems. You often have to initiate contact with a few different people to get anything done. There is not a lot of structure or hand-holding around onboarding either, get used to asking lots of questions or you will waste a lot of time reinventing things."

340,Hootsuite,A great working culture and a great start for those wanting to work in bigger organisations,2017-01-22,4.0,Software Engineering,"The working culture is pretty awesome and your fellow co-workers are always quite friendly and welcoming. Everyone is always open to questions and helping you. 

If you were previously working with small to medium companies and want to move on to bigger things, Hootsuite is an ideal organisation to start with. There is still a small company vibe but they are huge corporations trying to solve big global problems. 

The compensation packages are being improved since late 2016 as it was one of the big points raised during the company-wide survey. For example there is now maternity top-ups and additonal paid-time off the longer you work at the company.

Work-life balance is pretty good, you can leave the office at 5pm with no questions asked and not frowned on. There has been a minority of cases of staff working in the late nights but overall you are not expected to do alot of overtime unless you were a developer oncall.

The engineering roadmap is embracing Docker and microservices. Working with Scala and Go is pretty awesome together some pretty impressive in-house CI services.","The company still sees itself as a startup (despite started in 2008) , so alot of processes are fast and loose still. 

Senior management does not keep a long term vision that is consistent. Expect a change in vision and roadmap every now and then (was every 6 months or so when I was there).

Still struggling on old codebases and infra that have been there since day one. The engineering team are slowly moving towards more modern systems like Docker and microservices in Scala and Go but the pace is slow as no one wants to ""rock the boat"". 

There is far too many meetings every for managers. Managers are expected to do 1on1s with their subordinates every 1-2 weeks. When there is a team of 8 - 10 staff, this can get a bit crazy. This is in additon to regular standups and actual product meetings, make it near impossible for managers to get any work done. 

A con but a semi-pro - expect an average or slightly above average compensation package but I would say it is fair for the work-life balance. You can expect to be paid double at Amazon or the big players but expect to work longer hours. Hootsuite doesn't have those sort of hours."

348,Hootsuite,Make a small dent in the world with truly passionate and caring people,2016-12-21,5.0,"Senior Manager, Marketing Strategic Initiatives","""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.""-Margaret Mead

I joined Hootsuite in the relatively early days (~100 people) and while process and structure has formalized, we've scaled infrastructure, budgets are bigger, in many important ways the company hasn't changed much since - that's a good thing. I think many people would be surprised at the size of Hootsuite since our output and growth (one of the fastest growing enterprise software companies of all-time) assumes a company 10x the size! These are some of the most passionate, creative, principled people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Our core values are lived every day: be humble, always be shipping, have a laugh.

Joining Hootsuite was one of the best decisions I ever made; I can't recommend it enough.","The pace is exhilarating but exhausting! Make sure to always make time for self-care, our leaders are very flexible and encouraging of this. I've often made the mistake of heaping too much on my plate because there is just so much opportunity, so much to do, and people are truly empowered to run with things."
349,Hootsuite,Best Tech Company to Work for in Bucharest,2016-12-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It is by far the best place I've worked in so far (and it's not my second job :). We have an awesome and unique office location which feels very cosy and family like. The people are super smart and the standards are quite high with regards to the overall quality of the work. Last but not least, we have an open and distinct culture, our opinion is listened to, you really feel you can change and influence how things work.",The company's growth has influenced the overall alignment between offices but the most important thing is that they acknowledge what they've done wrong and they are open to improvements.

Work is not limited by one's job title.

Company growing pains are difficult, especially coming from a more mature business background."
351,Hootsuite,Best Career Move I've Ever Made,2016-12-19,5.0,Team Lead,I have been in this business for several years and Hootsuite has the best work culture by far! Coming to the office is so inspiring. My top career highlights have happened here at Hootsuite!,I can't think of anything negative.
352,Hootsuite,Amazing place for amazing people,2016-12-19,5.0,Customer Advocate,"There are so many nice things about this company I cannot begin to list them. It's a very employee oriented organization and you'll really feel that your opinion matters, regardless of the position that you're in. It's also a place where you can grow as a person and career-wise and there's a learning curve and there are trainings and all kinds of team activities. I love working here and I totally recommend Hootsuite to all the awesome people out there.","Nothing that I can think of that cannot be fixed. As I said, the employee opinion matters and if there's anything that you don't like and you have a solution for that, it's always taken into consideration."
353,Hootsuite,Customer Advocate,2016-12-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,It was definitely a really fun experience!,There is a lot of work and sometimes it is not recognized
354,Hootsuite,Great culture!,2016-12-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The culture is one of the main reasons I came to Hootsuite - and it makes me want to sty! The culture & people are amazing!!,Still considered a start-up - so there are some bumps along the road. But that is what makes it so exciting! You need to be on your toes and open to change.
355,Hootsuite,"Great company, but some growing pains",2016-12-15,4.0,Marketing,"- The team. Everyone is super smart, driven and almost always without ego. Managers back you and really hustle to get things done (especially in APAC where I'm based). If you have an idea - no matter your job level - it will be seriously considered and implemented if it makes sense.  Hootsuite peeps are also so interesting & diverse in their real lives too. Very inspiring. It makes for a great culture.

- The energy. There's a real sense we're in a changemaker industry, genuinely helping people and growing fast at the same time and that makes it exciting. Particularly here  in APAC. 

- Perks are good, especially for a company in Asia.

- Opportunity for growth: management is very supportive in helping you develop - personally or professionally. You have to chase it a little bit and identify opportunities, but once you do and  Hootsuite are on-board they are very invested in making it happen 

- The work (mostly). I am on the marketing team, and in region the work is varied and interesting. The balance of working with a global head office and being empowered to execute as needed in region is getting there, and we can mostly drive regionally. In fact we have some really interesting global initiatives being led by APAC which is awesome to be a part of.  Decisions and strategic direction are usually clearly explained, and it's refreshing that our regional marketing plans get sales input and buy-in at an early stage, which makes for a much more co-ordinated and successful execution compared with other companies I've worked for","- Needs to work more on a global outlook. This has improved, but it seems that decisions are still North America-centric (both in strategic direction, product development and staff development) and the regions only looped in at late stages. The hiring of more director level staff in head office with real global experience are helping this, but needs to cascade down through the teams

- There's been a high staff turnover in recent times, but replacements are pretty solid

- HQ teams are pretty siloed and sometimes focus on doing their job at the expense of adapting to a more efficient working process / strategic outcome

- Working days are long as you often have to attend calls in early mornings / evenings followed by a full day of work (although this is part and parcel of working in APAC as part of a global company). You are online pretty much all the time. (But hours are pretty flexible and you can work from home as needed)"
356,Hootsuite,"Great people and team, dynamic work",2016-12-15,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Hootsuite has great people, and one of the main things you'll hear about it is that it has a 
great/fun/vibrant culture. This is all true; what that means isn't just beers on Friday and dogs and ping pong in the office (but we do have those), but a really solid group of people who come in to work every day looking to make a positive difference in our customers' businesses.

I love working on the Customer Success team for a variety of reasons. First is back to those great people; I've never had a group of colleagues this smart and fun to be around before. When I started on the team I was blown away by how welcoming everyone was and also how generous everybody was with their time. Almost 2 years later this is still the case, we are an extremely collaborative team. I love the fact that we are given a ton (tonne?) of autonomy to get our jobs done, I'm never micro-managed, but am fully supported when I need extra resources.

The work itself is extremely rewarding; I get to work with some exceptional customers and work to help them achieve their social and business goals. Being someone who is motivated by forging strong relationships, I was very motivated from the start by our mission of empowering organizations to turn messages into meaningful relationships.

I started on the team in a junior role, and was able to work with my manager's support to achieve both my team/business goals and my personal development goals over my first year. I was promoted into the job I wanted from the time I started, and was given the support and resources to achieve this in a reasonable amount of time.

If you're reading this, this probably comes off as a gushing review, maybe overly so. Bottom line; I love working here, it's the best role I've ever had, and working at Hootsuite has put me on a path where I know I'm in the right career for my goals, values, and what gets me excited to come to work.","Vancouver is a tricky city to afford at times, so increased pay would be welcome as the company matures. We are in a very dynamic industry, and that leads to time-pressure to innovate and huge demands on our product team. It feels like we are pushing really hard for new features sometimes, and it can be hard to feel like we're not coming through for a customer when a new set of features or functionality isn't coming fast enough for them. All that said, our forward product roadmap looks great, and inter-departmental communication (e.g. Customer Success to Product) has been massively improved with the switch to Facebook@Work (aka Facebook Workplace) this year."

358,Hootsuite,Working with incredible talent.,2016-12-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Hootsuite has attracted some serious talent across a wide range of disciplines, and it pushes people to go the extra mile to perform. Over the past year in particular, the company has made huge strides in recognizing, compensating, and developing employees. There's still work to be done, but more than ever it has become an environment in which individual contributions are acknowledged and supported. 

The offices have a friendly, social, and respectful culture, and while it has certainly begun to lean further towards ""corporate"", there is still a lot of room to have fun, and a spirit of scrappy togetherness. Any company party is pretty much guaranteed to be a blast.","As the organization continues to scale, we sometimes can be slow to implement processes that befit a company operating on this level. In some areas there is a definite need to streamline approvals on work so that we can be more agile."

- Personal Growth - Huge opportunities for career progression if you're a hustler (#BSU) and for those with the travel itch, the ability to work abroad in the global offices.
- Executive Leadership - The talent this company is bringing in is awesome.  The execs have brought huge changes over 2016. I especially love our CEO's transparency with weekly video updates to share what's happening at the company to connect our global offices and all departments.
- Product & Customer Success - This ain't going to be no Blackberry failure story.  Hootsuite's ramped up product innovation to excel in this fast-paced, competitive industry and customer success team is going above and beyond for our world class customers to keep them happy and tell their amazing stories.
- Benefits - Salaries are getting more competitive, vacation is great and you'll find the most amazing community of owls (many who will become close friends).","Yeah, there's been many growing pains and we've lost a lot of the core OG Hootsuite people which has dampened morale a bit, but we've preserved the important values of our culture and we're shedding our start-up image to become a more respected Enterprise company."

The company is filled with truly passionate people, all striving to do their best work and #buildabetterway by constantly seeking to improve the product, the processes and their own selves.

A great community fostered by Social Fridays, offsites, and other team social events, great benefits and a gym - it definitely feels like Hootsuite genuinely strives to look after their people and their wellbeing.

Growth - As a rapidly growing company in a dynamic industry - many opportunities for learning and professional development present themselves.

- The dev team as a whole is great; I've had an abundant amount of mentorship and opportunities to learn from other people. 
- The learning opportunities have been immense. I don't think there's been any significant period of time since I've been here that I've felt stagnant or under-stimulated with the work. I've had the opportunity to work everywhere in the stack.
- The mindset on embracing change (and failure!) and the constant desire to iterate / improve on existing things is the right one.
- The tech stack / ecosystem is always evolving. There's always learning to do, but I wouldn't have it any other way.","- Compensation (has definitely gotten better over the last two years to the point where I wouldn't put it as an issue as of right now).

The company is invested in their people and take the feedback to heart which is evidenced by the numerous professional & skill development training opportunities offered, and the flexibility and confidence to build a better way. The corporate culture is second to none, and I can say with confidence that I have not worked with a more devoted and intelligent group of individuals. Many of the people I have met during my tenure here have become some of my closest friends. There are many opportunities for global placement, internal growth, and flexibility to those that are hardworking and prove themselves as valuable contributors. It is also a extremely interesting industry to be a part of and the skills I've learnt in this SaaS environment will help me with whatever the future holds.","With the advent of success in the space comes more competition...but that is what makes this industry so exciting and challenging.

We need more motivated, excited, skilled, awesome people as we are growing again :) Suggest reaching out to employees on LinkedIn who are in similar role you are interested in - they'll be happy to share their experience with you, people here are friendly.

Another note - Hootsuite's CEO Ryan Holmes is highly transparent & approachable.","Depending on your preference / experience.. Hootsuite's a relatively large company >1000 people, so that's a factor if you prefer small start ups. Hootsuite's no longer a start up, and yet it changes quickly like one. Change is a constant at Hootsuite, and though I enjoy that aspect, others may not. Just a head's up, it'll keep you on your toes! Good thing is change is normal across all LOBs, so people help each other out in time of change and step up. With change comes opportunity too, so cup's half full.

-Lots of career opportunities around the world!

-Lack of bottom line accountability outside of sales. Departments like Product and Marketing, are rarely made accountable for bottom line numbers. As a result, some product gaps are ignored despite being paramount for business.

*I see some complaints about lack of transparency and I TOTALLY disagree with those. Maybe this was their first job or something. As someone who knows what it's like to work for organizations w/ 20,000+ employees... this is about as transparent as it gets. I love the level of transparency from the C-Suite -- you don't get that everywhere.","If you work hard and have no clue what you're doing... you will spin your tires and flounder (in my org, at least, leadership is there to guide you not babysit you).

The business is filled with incredibly talented, but equally humble leadership who rarely turn down the opportunity to connect with anyone across the business. Working and learning from ""the best"" is something I truly value, and Hootsuite delivers.
2 - Stretch Program
As many reviews state, the business is always growing fast and needs top talent to fill these roles. There is always opportunity to move to new opportunity and departments within the organization, where you may make a bigger impact and develop your career. The stretch program allows you to test the waters, meet the leaders, and work on the team before any commitment is made.
3 Culture
'Work hard, play hard' comes with the territory, but the personal rewards and benefits of the culture are limitless. It's a youthful atmosphere that thinks big, isn't afraid of risk, and enables people to create every day. Friendships, dogs, guacamole, retreats, skills, parties, technology and lots of support here day to day.","Change management is an issue for any company growing this fast. It seems to come hot and heavy, or is dreadfully slow to implement both short and longterm changes. Whenever I am asked for reference or give advice on working at Hootsuite - I say the ability to deal with, and be excited by change is a MUST.

The benefits have tripled in my time here, but fair salaries are still something the organization struggles to even-out across the board. At the time of writing this however, initiatives are in place by leadership to responsibly correct discrepancies."

Culture has changed and has a focus on excellence. I'm excited everyday to go to work and I 100% trust our leadership. Yes, there are challenges but there are challenges in every company. If you didn't like challenges, go work in government or something!","Untalented old guard employees are still in some high places

- Learning. Again, you can learn as much as you want, but you have to be motivated to. There are great courses you can sign up for, lunch and learns, and pretty much everyone in the business would teach you something you want to learn. 
- Challenging. Because things change so fast, you always have to be on your toes.
- Amazing culture. You come into work feeling like you can fully be yourself. There is something every kind of person can connect with, countless groups and events to get involved with, weekly get togethers, work retreats, volunteer opportunities, you name it.","Surprise, Hootsuite doesn't have everything figured out. We're not a perfectly structured, perfectly functioning business. Sometimes we move too fast for our own good and make mistakes along the way.

If you thrive in an environment where barriers to doing awesome work don't exist, it's the best. You'll get to work with some of the best people in their chosen disciplines, and work cross-functionally to do impactful things together. Generally speaking if there's a project you're passionate about that adds value to the business, you're empowered to pursue it.","Less structured environment isn't for everyone. It can be sink or swim based on your ability to operate effectively in ambiguity, and you won't always find clear direction. You need initiative and drive to get things done, and it is often fully incumbent on the individual to make things happen. You also have to own your own career development, advocate for opportunities, and demonstrate value at every opportunity to advance (you won't be promoted based on tenure)."

395,Hootsuite,An Unstructured Mess of a Company,2016-10-09,2.0,Marketing,"- looks good on a resume. Get a year in and get out.
- some smart/cool colleagues
- dogs","- low pay and nearly impossible lateral/upward movement. I can think of a handful of people who have climbed the corporate jungle gym successfully in a company of nearly 1000 people 
- terrible middle management. great talent at the very bottom (social coaches, customer advocates, copywriters, SM specialists, etc.) and the very top (C-suite, some VPs), everything in the middle is a giant mess of incompetence, defensiveness, paranoia and poor work ethic.
- many managers promoted to positions they are not qualified for and are not removed when their lack of qualifications has negative consequences 
- many older employees (4+ years) have a Stockholm syndrome-like relationship with the company. this can be good as they are generally the most upbeat and positive, but it's also sad to see. 
- internal communication tools enable a culture of popularity contests that leads to a skewed view of who is truly valuable and who contributes meanigfully to company goals. 
- terrible HR department. if you have an issue with a coworker or a manager, be prepared for excuses and no action. 
- bullying behaviour from the above mentioned incompetent managers. 
- bro culture on the rise. things are being said and done now that would not be tolerated back when i joined. 
- lots of top brass is leaving. Many are very experienced and well educated people who have spent a lot of time trying to steer this unwieldily ship in the right direction 
- Ryan Holmes has said in multiple company wide meetings that those who don't like it here can leave. While that's true, it also doesn't differentiate between those for whom Hootsuite is not a good fit and those who have expressed legitimate concerns about how the business is being run and how they are being treated 
- The CEO is a marketer at heart. He knows what to say and how to say it to appear relevant and ahead of the curve, but in reality, the product is outdated, doesn't meet the basic needs of today's social media professionals and many solutions rely on workarounds instead of being properly built. The price points are also insane for anything beyond the $10 plan. If you're in sales or marketing, be prepared for some sleepless nights after days spent trying to spin and position something cumbersome and ineffective as sleek, useful and fast."

As growth remains at a high pace, opportunities to move up are abundant.  Independent and self-starters are rewarded and thrive in this workplace.  It's also one of the more high-profile companies in Canada so brand reputation is a real plus on one's resume.  Foot is on the gas 90% of the time so you're always engaged.  Social and high-performing culture is amazing, which can turn mundane work into something quite enjoyable.  There is a place for everyone; introverts and extroverts.  Semi-annual staff functions are off the chain!",Not a place for someone who needs clear existing rules and structure to follow; ie. not a place for a lifer to settle into a routine.  Growing company still is just starting to add benefits so other more established companies have more established benefits and perks.

Hootsuite employees are called Owls, but they are really just Sheeple drinking the kool-aid

Leadership is a bunch of social-political freaks obsessed with gossip, love office drama, chat behind peoples backs about rumor etc.

I was honest about a situation where leadership went overboard, took it up with HR anonymously, somehow by the NEXT MORNING my manager knew and I was being punished for speaking up.

Management would rather poach talent from the outside then nurture and promote from within. I've seen top talent get hired then totally flop when it came to producing quality work, not because they lacked talent, but because there's a ton of internal politics, lots of departmental overlap, and a major void in leadership vision and company direction. It a lose/lose situation for both existing and new employees.

Not the shining tech company it once was. Overall not as ""fun"" of a place to work. Way more corporate. Zero emphasis on professional development. Culture/people are very clique-y and fake.

459,Hootsuite,A Great Company with Management that Cares,2015-06-10,5.0,Revenue Strategist,"I've been with Hootsuite since it began as a company. From its inception, the leadership had clear vision, were ambitious, and were mindful of all stakeholders. When Ryan Holmes says that he wants to revolutionize communication, he really means it and tries to make it happen. 

For many workers, Hootsuite is not just a job but a passion. This isn't a place you go to punch in then punch out, but it's a place to live and grow as a person, and contribute towards the greater good. 

This, of course, sounds slightly new age-y but it's not. Even when I've had cynical moments (who hasn't?), I've been able to have honest conversations with management about how to make this company better—even when these conversations seem insignificant. 

For example, some years ago, I casually told Ryan Holmes that there might be opportunities for Hootsuite to teach people about social media. This wasn't a serious 1-on-1 conversation, but just something I told him on a lark. Within a week, Ryan already had a plan to build Hootsuite University. 

Another time I proposed that Hootsuite write personal rhyming couplets on Twitter for Valentine's Day to anyone who requests one. Within a month that happened. Why? Because our leadership saw an opportunity and executed. 

By no means will they jump on every whim, but they will do what they can to grow Hootsuite.

And that is why I've been with Hootsuite for over 5 years and counting!","Having seen this company grow from a handful of people to over 800, there's been a few missteps. 

Sometimes in our zeal to grow, we've hired talent that weren't always a great fit. Sometimes they didn't understand Hootsuite's greater vision, or sometimes they'd have a cultural perspective that didn't respect our internal diversity, or sometimes they'd put their own ambitions first before the company's long-term health. To our leadership's credit, they've mostly been able to fix these small problems before they become big problems. 

Every so often, it takes more time than I'd prefer to fix these missteps. 

However, almost always these problems have been resolved."

463,Hootsuite,"Amazing culture, adult playground...",2015-04-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"People at Hootsuite are very outgoing, really friendly environment to work in. The workspace is great, management gives a lot of freedom to work however you like, as long as the work is done. Lots of great perks, company is very involved with the community.","As a startup, the pay is not competitive with industry average. The open work space can get loud in the afternoon, making it hard to concentrate."
464,Hootsuite,"A company filled with passionate, culture-focused and skilled people.",2015-04-29,5.0,Sales Department,"The culture at Hootsuite is awesome. I had come from working with various small businesses consisting of 3 to 10  employees over the course of the last 8 years of my life (from non-profit and interior design to branding agencies) and at first I had some hesitation transitioning into a ""big company"" (over 500 employees). I can say that all of those hesitations were wiped away once I started working here.

The culture is a big plus for me. Obviously a fairly competitive salary matters, but I'd rather take a little less money and work with amazing, smart and entrepreneurial-minded individuals in a team setting than make a few extra bucks. I just want to say that is important to me, might not be for you though. People here are extremely friendly and having the support from people from various departments is awesome. 

The environment and culture here is relaxed (pretty much get to wear whatever you want and people can even bring dogs) but I do say that people are passionate and work hard when they are here. I appreciate and respect that. Overtime is not expected to be a ""good performer"" that I've experienced in every job except this one. People leave when their work day is over, but when they are here, they're friendly but still get stuff done. It's refreshing.

As far as benefits and all of the fine print, they were very upfront before I started with benefits and compensation and I found it to actually be pretty competitive (remember, there's lots of departments and lots of people so benefits and salaries may differ). It's definitely a step up from not being able to take vacation because you're over worked in a small company that only allows you to take long weekends and not extended holidays. In fact, they discourage overtime and not taking vacations!

There's a lot of small ""perks"" that paint the bigger picture. Everything is modern and well-maintained and the interior design has had a lot of TLC put into it. The open atmosphere and ""flat"" organization is something I dig so it fits my personality.

When I first started, I was even able to express my desire to expand my skills and move up eventually and they were very receptive. I find the management to be approachable and extremely friendly. I've had a bad taste from bad management in previous companies where it was hard to approach them and express issues, requests and even feedback. Here it's very circular and open.","Obviously everything has it's cons, but for me, the pros outweigh the cons by a landslide. The ""open"" space may not jive well for people who need privacy to focus. They definitely hire a certain type of personality: people who are driven, passionate, friendly and have an interest in a variety of areas. It definitely helps to be outgoing here. They have a strong collaboration and team-focus attitude so it's important that people be willing to step outside their comfort zones and work well with a variety of people and personalities. 

It's easy to get distracted here (but that's not really a con, more like something you'll need to get used to) because people are so friendly and there other things like a great kitchen, gym, nap rooms, ping pong, foosball and more. 

It's actually pretty tough for me to come up with a lot of cons. I mean, I can nit pick, but the role I'm in is perfect thus far and my team is incredible."

- Young inexperienced managers leading to wildly varying management styles
- Canadian employees brought in to Singapore office has a strange tendency to dislike Singapore and thumb down their noses at the culture here in Asia which is strange considering this should be their main area of focus

Hootsuite management does not seem to support the idea of training and retention. Furthermore, communications between departments are almost non-existent. One department does not know what the other department does even though they work on the same product. For a company that is now facing a lot of competition offering the same services at a more affordable price, the company is oddly not focusing their attention and resources to support the external Non-North American market. This is an example of too many cooks in the kitchen whereby too many people believe in their own opinion that their way is right and so steer their own agenda and resources into their own projects without coordinating and communicating with the overall company management."
