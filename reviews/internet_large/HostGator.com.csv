11,HostGator.com,Opens you up for better opportunities,2021-11-28,2.0,L1 Customer Support Engineer,"-Respectful coworkers
-Competitive Pay
-Sales Incentive
-Free lunch (at my time of employment)
-Good benefits (one of the few things I miss)","I can list a ton of things but I will keep it short. At first, it was great working there as I never had IT experience of any sort so I appreciated the opportunity. However, after working there long enough I could see the flaws in the dynamic. This is just my personal experience so please keep this in mind. 

-Pay- 
The pay is low compared to other entry level IT jobs which give you less work to do

-Amount of work-
When I was hired, I was hired on as a technical support agent that takes calls, fixes websites, and that's it. However, they were too focused on sales and required you reach a certain amount of sales each paycheck or you died...or something. I always barely made it or was just barely under the range they liked that they let it slide. They had a sales department at first which was awesome and helped with the work flow since you could just transfer people to them. When they got rid of the department, sales was on us. I know to walk out the door if I have a job that pulls this again.

-Promotions-
 -As mentioned above, this is my personal experience so others would probably disagree with me on this, or just had a different and luckier experience. So I was there 3 years and never got a promotion. I was constantly told that I was so smart, knowledgeable, great with customers bla bla bla and that I would be a great L2 support agent. My only ""issue"" was that I wasn't the best sales person. When I'd ask for the opportunity to be a L2 agent, I would never get the position and someone else less trained than myself would get the position. That could be my opinion, but there were some L2 agents that would ask me questions so...it made me wonder. In general if you were up for promotion you would be required to work the higher queues which should be illegal if it is not already. 

-Write ups
 -This might be more of a me problem as I never talked to old coworkers 
 about this. As a rule in the employee handbook, you would have 15 minutes to deal with a customer's problem and if you didn't solve it, you send them to the next level of support. I had done this midway through my time there and would either be yelled at by the agent that got the customer, or get a write up. This is the only job I've had where someone has a problem doing their work that they agreed to when agreeing to be a higher level of support. Do. Your. Job. People!
Another dumb write up was a time I had to take an emergency phone call. My supervisor said not to take it and I ignored him because duh....it's an emergency. 

-Bathroom breaks-
-Another issue that may be more of a me problem, but after talking to a therapist (yes...got to that point at one time) I was told this is considered a normal issue. We would be provided with 15 minutes a day to walk away from the computer to do your business and get back to work. Sounds easy right? Nope! What they don't put in to account is the time to get to the bathroom, any lines, and so on. This 15 minutes could be used for anything so what if grandma called and is in the hospital but oh you still have to do your business before she happens to call? Time to get a write up for taking the call and peeing! This got to the point where a couple people I knew there would wear depends...very gross. I really hope this changed."

53,HostGator.com,Fun but with very real flaws,2020-02-02,2.0,Administrative,"Pros: Culture committees which are excellent, free food several days. Enjoyable coworkers for the most part. Diversity at the Web advisor 1 level. Most managers & trainers with good intentions to help, a few are very good. Found a better job with higher pay elsewhere, but I did learn there and enjoyed most of the people there.","Cons: They fire 50-60+% of the workforce each year, with draconian PIP policies. They hire for the busy season, Black Friday then create changing policy reasons to fire for revenue later. You could work there years and do a great job, but if you fall a half percent in one metric you are on a PIP for two months for all metrics. Ask veterans, most are the only ones from their training classes left.

After Web 1, onboarding and very minimal HAL (billing software) and 365 email training, training disappears at the WA2 level. Many managers at all levels don't know what to do for highly technical calls/cases and ask you to ask others for help or escalate. Also Confluence staff works hard and is good, but is small so articles are often very dated, you've never been told about several by management or you don't have access to many sections.

Most managers (not all, some are very technical) don't have root experience and can't train, so it's blind leading the blind after basic things. Not their fault, it's upper leadership for not developing or funding their training. The company doesn't pay for outside training like Linux Academy, nor do managers or trainers show you beyond Bash basics, but you are expected to know about them and breaks to move up often or succeed at upper levels.

Very little diversity on the Tier 4 level, although there are a few good people, it badly needs to be addressed, a lot of tribal knowledge which creates a gate keeper system. Many gossipy cliques who are extremely nosy and won't genuinely help others there not friends within upper tiers. The company doesn't fully fund trainers for needed advanced classes or have leadership that is trained with root and case experience, so the company would rather fire via 2 month PIPs than train or retain.

They have fun/engagement but don't be fooled by the Gator mascot and party themes. They don't care and will mass fire at the drop of a hat to save their numbers in competition with Bluehost and other EIG brands."

They removed their food catering, bi-monthly shoulder massages, team outings, anything that helped with morale was taken away. 

The company started to majorly outsource jobs to other countries, where customers suffered from sudden jarring language barrier issues, ticket and chat queues that were well into the hundreds [meaning extremely long wait times, especially tickets - taking WEEKS] and took their anger, frustration, and confusion out on agents, who would then suffer via management. 

Agents aren't paid well to deal with the ever-increasing high stress environment, and often forced to do tasks that were well outside of their paygrade constantly, yet were never compensated or given promotions despite working on tasks/queues that were meant for higher level agents. 

The US offices are now down to just one I believe, the rest being completely outsourced."

Customer service training is great however, when you hire people JUST for their customer support experience and not for their technical knowledge it makes it really hard to provide a positive customer experience when you are not knowledgable in the area that you are required to assist. We are trained on how to use the internal systems and how to submit support tickets. We are given a free domain and hosting package as a way to train us technically. We are told to build a website for a final grade in training...that is the extent of our technical training. We are taught ""big"" words and do not know what most of them truly mean. When asking for assistance or clarification, we are told to read an article...often the same one available to the general public. Once we are out of training, there is virtually no managerial support. Even if a customer requests a manager, we are told NOT to escalate the call. Managers will not take customer calls. We are actually TOLD to put customers on hold (up to five minutes) telling them that we are waiting for an available manager...after the five minutes are up we have to get back on the line and tell the customer that there is no manager available and that we can submit their request via support ticket. The biggest issue that I see with HostGator is that they push upsells, although they tell you that you are not a sales agent. If you do not make a certain amount of offers and produce leads to are placed under disciplinary review or even terminated. The biggest problem is not upselling but the fact that we are not given full information on what exactly it is that we are upselling. For example; we are required to offer website design and marketing however, we are not given prices or even a breakdown of what is included with those services...we transfer to another department who then closes on the lead and gets full credit. They have increased the amount of ""sales"" required and removed the commission that you would make for those sales. So in short, you have a company that pushes out mass amounts new hires with little to no technical knowledge. They are only given the tools to work the internal systems and look up technical information (while having the customer holding). Agents are forced to upsell on every call with the threat of being terminated (even though this is not a sales position)."

No more training.  Everything was on the job learning.  I am older (about 41 at the time) so my mind had a hard time grasping some things.  Younger people seem to excel though, so this could be a great entry level job for someone who wants to start in the industry.  You will quickly learn if you're meant for this, but with that being said, I had been in I.T. for 13 years when I got this job as a Desktop tech or HelpDesk tech, and I thought I would be more than qualified for this job.  I was wrong and it was very discouraging.   Although I had my days when my numbers met expectations, they were few and far between.  As much as I think someone young starting in the industry will know soon enough if they can excel, I think it can also make others who take longer to grasp concepts feel like they don't belong in the industry.

5 chats minimum at a time or had to be on a call and 1 chat at the same time.  Some days my mind did well if I took my Xanax, but if not, it was very difficult for me.

128,HostGator.com,"Highs and Lows, great way to get experience",2017-03-21,3.0,Junior Administrator,"-Free lunch (when it was edible), I usually brought my own lunch anyways

-Decent health plan and PTO

-Gym

-Free beer once weekly, additional free beer/booze (depending on the event) on holidays or any other random event.

-On holidays or other celebratory times of year, they bring in outside catering that is usually pretty good and do it up pretty big with kegs and frozen margarita machines (this is Texas, so even if a margarita doesn't sound like it would go with a holiday, it really does)

-When I left, you had your own desk. It wasn't like that for most of the time I was there, and I don't know if they have kept it up. I hope they have though.

-Vape rooms if you vape. You still aren't allowed to vape at your desk, but if there is extreme weather (being that both offices are in Texas, this usually boils down to either too damn hot to breathe or raining or both)

-If you are willing to learn and work, there are agents willing to help you. This is one of those jobs where you are dealing with many abstract concepts and trying to relate them to less experienced users. They typically hire new agents that have little knowledge of the field and train them. Its basically understood by more seasoned staff that if you are still in your first 3-6 months, you are not going to be that great at resolving issues on your own. If you are already that good, you would probably be working somewhere else for better pay. We were all there at one point, and remember it well. Because of that, most agents are happy to assist you if you own your derps and noobness and show genuine interest. There is definitely a kinship amongst the support staff.","First, some minor environmental complaints:

-The food sucked. bad. I realize its free, but you know they are justifying paying you so much less to feed you garbage as a perk. How on earth can you make all meat look grey, every single day? They were changing caterers when I left, so it may be better now. But even if it starts out decent, its usually cold before you get to your desk after waiting in a long line to get it. They have coolers with fresh-ish looking sandwiches/salads/snacks for sale, but they are way overpriced. The average prepackaged sandwich is $7-8.

-If you are without transportation (temporarily or long-term) be prepared for a long commute and nothing within walking distance. The only bus line within a mile only runs every 40 minutes at peak hours and even less so if off-peak. Aside from one quickie mart about a half mile away, there is absolutely nothing else (aside from other office buildings, warehouses, and apartments) within a mile of the office.  

-Filthy, the whole place. When I first started working there and we were in the old building, I often saw at least two cleaning staff on the regular. When we moved to the new building, they only kept one person on for a building twice the size. When he left (I assume from burn-out) they replaced him with a lady who they apparently didn't even hire full-time. She was gung-ho when she was around, but I don't think I even saw her once in the last few months I was there. Our workspaces got a little better when they assigned desks, but that's only because we had our own spaces and didn't have to come in and find an empty desk that the last person left a mess.

-I get the need to relieve workplace tension and keep up morale, but nerf gun wars are only fun to the people that have nothing better to do. When they split up the office to give A Small Orange a section, they basically had nerf gun wars right next to you while you were on calls when they closed at 5pm. They also got rid of the in chair massages and replaced them with massages you have to pay for, while on your break. How is that even a replacement? If I am having to pay for a massage on my time off, I surely am not going to do it at the office.

Now, company wide complaints.......
-EIG is a huge corporation that clearly only cares about money. But I guess you could say that about all corporations are like that. They have this terrible habit of making huge changes in a reactive way vs. a proactive way. Call/chat wait time too long? Get rid of Internal Support and demand everything go to ticket. Want to make some changes to the training program? No new hires for six months while we work that out. Oh wow, why don't we have any employees? Hire a bunch of temps to answer calls, making calling into support the equivelent of going to your dog walker to get a root canal. Whats this? Now initial ticket response time is 2+weeks? No more tickets, L1s can't create them, L2s need supervisor approval (in which there are none ever available). Create a new tiered system where depending on what options the customer chooses to direct their call, they can get a different queue where the speak to someone specially trained and given access to resolve the issue. That sounds great, only you forgot to separate the queues by dept and now the vast majority of incoming contact eventually end up in L2, and you don't that many L2s. Call/chat wait times skyrocket again.............

-Over time, many services that the company offered have been replaced with sub-par 3rd party support for a price. We still treat them as our own services in regards to who you pay for it, but when these services need support we send them to the 3rd party. EIG is very keen on getting you to upsell these services instead of trying to solve the issue, and they actually now own all of these services under their umbrella. There is usually very little training (if any) on how these services work, we aren't supposed to support them, but they login to them via our billing system.

-The billing system is so nighmareish its comical. You know, if you are the kind of person who laughs when everything has gone to hell.  Bugs have been there for so long we now call them features. Services that get paid for don't renew, or services that have long been cancelled get double charged a year down the line. Domains expire and go into redemption even tho they were paid on time.

-Make sure to become best buds with your supervisor. Your work alone will not get you anywhere promotion or raise-wise. They can promote the most useless employees and leave some of their best workers in the cold. Obviously, not all supes are petty or play favorites, but there are enough of them there that are for it to be noted.

-PTO/flex time policies seem to change drastically every year or 2. When I left it seemed fair, but I have been told by employees I stay in touch with that they cut the amount of accrued PTO allowed to use as flex time in half with no notice at the new year.

- Free food / coffee; beer on Fridays.
- Gym
- Okay breakroom","- Safety concerns. Forced to park on the street in a very ghetto neighborhood while the new building was being set up. One of the employees was mugged at gunpoint in the parking lot and we got a couple of ""security"" officers for awhile. The first building was often very insecure. Homeless people often wandered up to the second floor where the billing/pending/cancellations department was.

- Dress code: While very lenient on how to dress, there are some employees whom choose to abuse the dress code as much as possible. As in wearing the same outfit every shift and not taking care of personal hygiene. 

- At the time when I was hired by HostGator, I was offered either a second shift (5PM to 2AM or a third shift (aka GraveYard 11PM to 8AM). There was no pay bonus to take either shift like there is at other tech companies (couple of dollars difference) while sacrificing any social life or decent sleep schedule. Additionally, if you had either shift, they would give you serious hell if you even brought up prospects to switch to a somewhat normal schedule. On top of this, the management favors the day time employees over any other shifted employees. They would constantly make crappy/useless tickets, mess up the tickets, promise the customers the world, make constant mistakes, et cetera, and then the issues would be dumped to the 2nd and 3rd shift employees. You rarely saw any of the grave yard employees get Employee of the Month until the CEO felt sorry for us and gave someone the award every sixth months.

- Sexual harassment is rampant. Be very aware if you are female. You will hear rape jokes daily and may even be threatened. ""Don't worry, my supervisor will help me!"" you say, but don't count on them. No one above you cares about you because they fired anyone that did care. If you don't have some kind of witness/proof, be ready to be brushed off by your boss or HR. 

- No room to grow in some departments. If you want to grow your career, stay away from billing/migrations/pending/cancellations/windows. You will have a tough time escaping these departments to go into the more favored Linux or Security departments.

- Disgusting, vile work stations. Since you don't have an assigned work station, be ready to bust out those Clorox wipes and REALLY wipe down your station. In fact, just bring your own keyboard and mouse. Also make sure you wipe down your chair & deskspace as someone who doesn't know what personal hygiene is probably sat there before you did. Oh yea, and I hope you like roaches because they come out into the light like they own the damn place."

146,HostGator.com,"Great company for starting out, though quality has gone down.",2016-09-07,4.0,Billing Internal Support,"HostGator offered healthcare benefits and a matching 401k contribution, plus I frequently received raises on a 6-month or annual basis, depending on my performance.  There were multiple opportunities for advancement, based on your skills and your dedication to your department's needs.  I had good relations with all of my supervisors, as they appreciated any employee who put in a good effort to do their job well.  

As a 24-hour customer service company, you could usually find a shift that works well for your lifestyle.  I attended school while working at the company, and I was able to schedule my work days around the two days a week that I had classes on campus.  Plus, some employees preferred the environment of the graveyard shift.  

HostGator put effort into improving the work environment for employees, to compensate for the more frustrating aspects of the job.  Lunch was provided, as well as coffee.  On Fridays, they would bring in a keg and let everyone of age have a couple beers (with reasonable restrictions).  Once a week, a physical therapist would come and give shoulder/back/arm massages, which always felt amazing while being hunched over a computer terminal all day.  

When I first started, there was a very strict policy against browsing the web while at work, which created a lot of anxiety for employees who were legitimately looking up information for their work or who were simply changing what song they were listening to online.  Thankfully, the management relaxed this policy and just required that you do your job well.  

The dress code was quite relaxed, so long as you maintained hygiene.  Some employees on the graveyard shift often worked in their pajamas.","The billing system and its various iterations, were quite problematic.  We had issues with:
* Invoices not being generated automatically for domain renewals
* Domains not renewing when the customer had paid
* Random invoices being added to customer accounts
* Invoices not containing clear descriptions on both the customer and employee side, which led to more customers flooding the Billing department with questions
* Customer credit cards being charged incorrectly, with some extreme cases of Customer A being charged for Customer B's invoices, due to a bug in the back-end card processor
* Credit cards not being processed when they should have, with customers adamant that nothing was wrong with their card
* New products being introduced before the billing system could handle the invoicing and activation properly
* Etc...

Versions of these problems persisted throughout the entire 5 years I worked at the company.  The system improved considerably near the end, and I surely hope by now that HostGator no longer has these issues.  Part of the problem was the difficulty of trying to rework a live, complex billing system without breaking more things in the process.  Another part seemed to be that a broken billing system was not an emergency so long as we kept making a profit.  

I don't list these criticisms to malign the company.  I just find it unacceptable to have these problems for so long.  I dearly hope things have improved in this regard.  If not, the company is doing more damage to itself anything that I could say.  

After HostGator was acquired by EIG, the quality of service to customers and the work environment for employees started to slowly degrade.  Specifically, I noticed:

* We started outsourcing some menial tasks, which seemed to have the effect of poor quality work from contractors across the globe that we could not effectively communicate with.  

* More emphasis was placed on up-selling extraneous products to customers, which greatly inflated the costs of their hosting services.  Many customers were not really sure of what they were purchasing, and the billing department was flooded with requests to cancel these services.  After I left, I heard from former co-workers that the basic support agents (front-line defense, we would call them) were being pressured to engage in sales activities with customers who were contacting us for technical support.  

* Wait times on customer support tickets (as well as chat and call queues) exploded.  Back around 2009-2010, we used to call in extra workers for overtime if the ticket reply time was over 5 hours.  Near the end of my stay, the queues were around 24-48 hours.  There was an apathy that developed among the employees, where we became desensitized to  how backed up support tickets were.  It was a self-perpetuating problem too, as impatient customers would then create more support tickets and flood our phones/chats to demand escalations.  

All of the problems described above made the work environment quite stressful at times, which the company, to its credit, recognized and tried to counteract with the perks I listed above."

Nothing is ever cleaned, no cleaning crew. 1 janitor cleans toilets weekly and empties trash.

Promotions are not based on skill or knowledge but rather how long you've been here. 

You will be lucky to get a promotion before one year and then still making peanuts.

L3 and Linux admin only make about $1 more than previous tier. 

Pay is VERY below average, especially for the area. Houston and Austin where HG is based are expensive cities to live in.

It will take you over 3 years to make l3/Linux admin from l1 support tech. 

Wages are non negotiable.

When you are supposed to get a raise it takes several months before its on your check.

Depending on your supervisor you may get wrote up for any silly mistake with no verbal warnings ever.

There are invisible barriers to everything in this company when you want to move up.

The only schedule changes are when they want your schedule to change usually, if you request a certain schedule you most likely will not get it.

Want to transfer to another HG office? Forget it, they would rather you quit. Then two weeks later hire a new wave of trainees in the office you wanted to transfer to.

Want more training so you can move up in the company? Purely up to your supervisor, and mine is apparently too lazy to give me any.

The convenience store has some seriously marked up prices.

148,HostGator.com,Beware of HostGator / Endurance International Group (EIG),2016-08-25,1.0,,"It is easy to get hired at HostGator aka Endurance International Group. Like many others, I was hired after just a phone interview with no face-to-face interview. 

The medical benefits are decent (BCBS) and time off is standard (although see below remarks).

Free lunches.","The entire corporate culture is centered around your rank. How long you've been there, what department you are in and how far you've been able to move up the ladder in responsibility and pay grade. This is so severe that some employees are intimidated of talking to those above their rank. If you are an outsider, you better start at the bottom and work your way up. Almost all promotions are internal. However, if you are an outsider that is hired above others in your group, be prepared for hazing, a poor attitude towards accepting you, sarcastic remarks that make you feel worthless, a lack of interest in helping you and resentment of how you were granted more privileges than them. This is an extremely poor environment for a newcomer. You are not given adequate support for success, so you are destined to fail. I do not understand a company that hires first and later figures out if they are a good fit for the position and company.

Recently sick time and PTO have been merged into a single pool of ""away"" time, so many senior employees lost a lot of their vacation time. While HR tried to spin this as a positive, since management has the final say if you can take time off or not, many feel they are losing time they were entitled to. It is now up to your manager if you can take time off or not."

There is also an in-house supermarket with snacks and drinks at a reasonable price.

There is a game room with a big tv and ps4/n64 where they regularly hold tournaments, a rec area with pool table, air hockey and table tennis. 

Everyone in the company starts at the same position, with only a handful of positions hired externally. The current CEO of the company and upper management  started as front line support also, then worked their way up.

From front line support, or jr admin, the next promotion is jr admin level 2, from there, every aspect of the company is available.

They laid me off after 3 years of pretty loyal service. Maybe it was because I cyber-slacked, but everyone did, so I kinda doubt that was it. I honestly think the worst thing I ever did there was send personal messages to my friends outside the company (via services like FaceBook) and maybe browse Reddit on the clock a bit. Supposedly they just didn't have a use for me, but I highly suspect there was much more to my termination than they let on.

When I first got hired, it was a great job. Then EIG bought the company. And that's when it started getting crummy. Our perks were eliminated, and the code of conduct was strengthened. I was shuffled from team to team. Very poorly managed. Lots of bureaucracy. Crumbling infrastructure and unreliable IT. Under-staffed. When they migrated the dev cluster to a different rack, for instance, we lost a lot of capabilities, and no one really felt like bringing them back up.

Lots of people came and went from that job. They hire off the streets, and if you actually get good at what you do, they refuse to pay you more. So most people get a better job elsewhere eventually. 

Many times, I found cocaine in the bathroom stall at Hostgator. They had Wine Wednesday AND Beer Friday, so two days out of the business week, most people were drunk at work. The employees were promiscuous. Typical tech employee brogrammers. And I felt like working there exposed me to bad people: malicious hackers, con artists, intellectual property thieves, etc...  Not to mention the public-perception of my guilt by association.

There was also probably some investor fraud going down there as well: Fake sales and deferred revenue miscalculations. So yeah, all around as crooked as it was crummy. Also, there was at least one NSA agent who worked there. Undercover but pretty obvious. 

As an employee I contributed more value than I was compensated for. The layoff is a net loss for me, but also the removal of a stone from my neck. I can't wait to find a more professional environment. It was a job for mediocre underachievers, where they treated us like children. I've never been happier to shed an employer."

-- Management -- If you make a complaint about someone the management or HR doesn't take it seriously unless threatened by lawsuit. In my case my Supervisor literally sat there and played Facebook rather then worked. When I complained in less then 2 weeks I was fired. I have even asked for assistance from them and got no assistance at all.

Plenty of advancement if you are in the click.,I left a job making 22 dollars an hour to work for 11.00 an hour. I left to start a career in Linux. I took training at the community college and was studying for my LPIC 1. I liked the job but there was one manager there personally  I believed was prejudice. I was one of 3 black people working at Hostgator. My manager gave me permission to train on my Linux while I was on the clock because I did my job well. This other manager wrote me up and I explained my manager gave me permission.  Two months later I was switched to his team and I asked for a meeting and told him I believe that he did not like me. I was sick and had to go to the hospital and he fired me saying that I could not miss a day of work while on a write up. Now let me get this straight I went to both Hostgator Dallas and Austin. Dallas was wonderful but Austin was ok except that manager. I went above the manager and told them I felt the manager was picking on me. The next day I was fired.

Great if you are just beginning your IT career and need real world experience and don't know better.
Great if you are an IT veteran looking for a career change until something that pays enough to live on comes along. 
Room for rapid advancement in most departments due to turnover and also some managers being receptive to ideas.
Numerous groups that play MtG in the lunch room once you get out of being a JA and can take an actual lunch break.

Very LGBT friendly from what I can tell.","Dehumanizing scheduling: This isn't McDonald's. The way hours are scheduled for time off treats the entire company like we work in a call center. Very much unlike any IT departments I've ever heard of. The time off/late issue is used to frequently fire otherwise very qualified people while incompetent people that just show up continue to have a job. People show up ridiculously ill and get everyone sick to avoid getting fired.
Horrible communication: New product lines get launched and quite literally nobody (seemingly) is responsible or serves as a point of contact for those products. In theory, there is training but that leaves much to be desired. 
Some departments are black holes of productivity that are manned by sycophants. People deliberately avoid coming with solutions if they involve those departments since they know that nothing good will come from dealing with them.
Communication is horrible. We literally have products and services that nobody knows about as well as ever changing brands we have to manage. Various divisions really have no idea what others are doing and don't care to know since it doesn't directly effect their KPIs."
188,HostGator.com,Linux System Administrator I,2015-12-27,2.0,Linux Administrator,"If you want to break into the high tech. sector and you have no professional experience HostGator might be just the stepping stone to a bright career in IT.

There were some incredible people who worked there, and the contacts that I made through that job I'm very thankful for.","There are several problems that existed, mind you this is just before the EIG buy out so things have progressed, from what i've heard mostly detrimentally for most of the workers, however while I worked there the primary issues for me were,

1. Quota and NPS system of review means you can do an objectively superb job but completely fail meeting your metrics.  The implications are interesting because it implies that it's not actually one's skill level that is important but:
    a. How well you are able to reassure the customer that everything will work out for the best.
    b. How quickly you can complete tickets, keeping point a. in mind.

So as long as you don't expect to resolve issues, and are fine telling platitudes, and happy stories to clients then this shouldn't be too great an issue.

2.  The level of maturity on all levels was comically childish, and I don't mean the use of Nerf guns.  I appreciate a certain amount of professionalism.  You don't get your own desk, or to put it another way you must earn your stationary desk by becoming some sort of manager.  

3.  You will never become rich working at HostGator, or even well to do.  This may not be an issue for you.  You might be married and your spouse is raking in the dough but you want some pocket money.  

I don't know your situation but if you are trying to make a life, and a career for yourself I can assure you that there is a short window where working there will make sense, and then it won't.  Statistically I suspect it's roughly a year, which from an investment standpoint on HostGator's side seems like quite a waste but well the business strategy appears to have at least done the former owner some good.  So really who's to say."

EIG has implemented a dehumanizing level of statistics which base your performance solely on whether or not these metrics are met. 
Your ability to advance within the organization is dictated upon a path of HostGator conjured accomplishments. The architecture of advancement favors the ignorantly-charismatic over proven intellect of a topic.
e.g. ""Oh, you definitely have the knowledge to be a Linux Administrator/Triage Admin at this exact moment... but I see that you don't participate enough in support chat. We're going to need 6 more months to review this promotion."" 
*change in manager*
""Oh... Yeah, that timeline was solely for your last manager. I'm going to need to review a few more pay periods before I can make a decision.""

-They accept beginners with little to no web hosting experience(at entry level jr admin, of course)
-If you are a hard worker and fast learner then you can likely become an admin
-The pathway to admin will teach you many things about Linux and networking
-Free lunch (usually edible, but sometimes not. still way better than what was previously offered with ""Thai Nu"" and ""Chef"" (AKA previous CEO's family member), now the food is handled by a supervisor that owns a restaurant.
-There USED to be some job security if you were hitting your numbers, but now that is gone with EIG and outsourcing
-HG will reimburse technical certification exam fees that are on a designated list and related to your job (no training/class assistance offered, though)
-There used to be some smart and cool folks, and there still are, but you will also now see people that you can tell are just there for a paycheck and don't really care about learning much
-HostGator USED to be a very respectable and popular host due to its amazing customer support (i.e. nothing is out of scope, etc), but after EIG started with their management it declined","-Outsourcing. Owner of EIG, Hari K. Ravichandran, has multiple family members that directly own and operate an IT outsourcing firm under the names of DIYA and Glow Touch Technologies. They operate out of Mangalore, India and multiple positions have been moved there which put USA employees out of a job. That is a despicable practice and unnecessary. Brent Oxley was able to grow and operate HostGator without outsourcing any USA positions, but then again he wasn't a slave to investment groups like Goldman Sachs and Warburg Pincus along with shareholders. If you aren't in a position where you speak with the customer on the phone, then I would seriously question your long term job security(they only lease the office instead of buying a new one as Brent Oxley had wanted to do with his own leasing company).
-EIG(parent company) directly manages everything, which is a exactly opposite of what they said would happen. ""we bought HostGator for a reason, we like how you guys operate, so we don't want to go in and start changing everything"" - Hari during his visit relating to the buyout, 2013
-Unnecessary add-on services that almost nobody is trained on, they just show up one day and not even your supervisor will know how to answer questions on it.
-HostGator *heavily* stresses add-on sales now. There used to be no real outgoing sales team  and now it is probably over 20 outgoing sales members in HTX alone. 
-Service has gone seriously downhill, so much that they had to close down the Reviews section of their forum years ago. Many long term customers left due to multiple datacenter outages and ridiculously long wait times for phone/live chat."

Great for Entry Level! You need little to nothing other than a high school diploma to get a job here so that's one major perk.","They really look at you as a number on a revolving door. Turnover is so high here due to the lack of compassion and stress that comes with the job that it'll literally make you want to leave.

Never get sick or have to go to the doctors here either. They don't accept doctor's notes and if you have to be out for any reason and not have the PTO to cover it, they will dock you an occurrence. Doesn't matter if you can't walk due to breaking both legs, you better be in for work or have the PTO to cover it or you're dead meat.

Favoritism is also played here, they state to follow an escalation path but nobody's usually available because they have their own things to do. 

Low pay for the stress levels and quotas they expect you to meet.

I was employed at HostGator prior to the EIG buy out, was on the front lines of the migrations to provo and have seen many good and bad techs come and go. I apologize in advance if this turns out to be lengthy and I'll try to keep this as current as possible without dwelling on the past.

The biggest con is the lack of advancement to another position. The churn rate of employees is so high they cannot promote agents to higher level positions (like triage, security, linux admin etc) only because they would lose their chat and phone support. You could literally, (yes literally, this has happened) be a senior linux/windows administrator with an impressive resume and be offered a low level support tech position (like junior administrator or whatever they call it now,  which answer chats and calls that dont actually login as root to servers). They need admins with experience but choose to promote from within, I'm sure you can see the problem here. 

If you are one of the lucky ones to be promoted to a different position, I can guarantee it's not because of your knowledge but because you've been with the company for a while and have made friends with the right people. I have seen some of the worst support agents be promoted over highly skilled individuals only because they were friends with the right people. They end up with a false sense of entitlement and are generally poorly trained/skilled.

There is no help, everyone is swamped. All of your level 2 general support techs are extremely busy with their chats/calls to take time out of their day to help you. Dont blame them either because they have a high quota to hit otherwise they get put on a performance plan and end up getting canned because they cant hit their numbers. If you are new, it's really sink or swim. 

This is ""face value"" company. They look good on paper and that's all they care about. They dont care that they have upwards of 20 day response times on support tickets because there are 900 new signups for hosting services which equate to higher revenue, they are EIG's highest source of revenue. 

Your training will consist of general policies and how to's of cPanel. You will be taught to document an issue to the best of your ability and make a ticket to support. This is a huge problem as it only adds to the support queues and pushes back responses to tickets. You can easily fix a simple issue by yourself but because of certain policies and lack of access, you will be pushed to ticket the issue and move on to your next chat/call. It is extremely counter-intuitive. 

Management is a huge problem, especially in the linux department (namely the direction of the linux department). The people/person in charge were/was handed the job/jobs not because of experience, but because they are/is a yes man/people. Once the admins figured out they could make almost double their yearly salary at other companies, they moved on. cPanel is not a complicated piece of software, nor is the administration of a server (lets be honest). If you know what you are doing and have experience with system administration or cPanel, you can easily find a job elsewhere. Dont waste your time struggling at the gator. On top of this, your quota will be set extremely high and is almost ""unattainable"" as a linux administrator. The caveat to this is, if you are smart and either ask for more information from a customer, or string the customer to 10 replies on a ticket, you'll be fine. You really REALLY have to work the system in your favor but it is absolutely possible to hit your numbers (notice I previously said ""almost"" unattainable).

You're supervisors care, but cant say anything. They cant go to bat for you because all you are is another spoke on the wheel. There are 100 other spokes and losing you wont stop the wheel from spinning. You are definitely replaceable. 

All in all, if you've made it this far I hope you have a good idea of what you'll be getting into if you apply. Entry level, you'll learn a lot, or you wont. If you're just looking for a job, its easy to cheat the system and keep a steady paycheck for a few months but you'll burn out quickly. If you consider yourself to be knowledgeable in hosting aspects and feel you are more than just a number, find a different job. You'll probably make more waiting tables."

I have a friend who's been working there three years now and only now makes my starting wage of $12/hour. 

Junior Administrators were required to be in no less than 5 chats at any given time (a friend tells me it's been dropped to 3), and were routinely encouraged to do much more than that. However, they're instructed to ""check back"" every two minutes or less, or whenever the customer types anything (which is constantly). This is all to give each customer the impression that they have the junior administrator's undivided attention, when they clearly do not.

Some people can handle 10 different issues in there head at any given point. I could not. As a result, I failed to give the level of customer service that I would have expected, had I been a customer (and I was, until just recently.)

Their QA also were primarily there to write up and fire people for security violations and saying the wrong things, not to offer suggestions or help to more junior admins."

The trainers do their best, but they are tech support folks who came from the floor to train poorly planned and executed training programs.

Also, when warned, I asked for remedial training... they said ""look at this web page""...and that was all the remedial training there was.

Everyone from the lowest junior admin to the supervisor, IS, and Linux admins were those who couldn't find good jobs elsewhere. They had no choice, so they stuck with Hostgator.

Not to mention temp workers and unqualified agents who get promoted to roles more deserving agents should get. Hostgator doesn't care about you, and neither should you about Hostgator. Maybe once upon a time this was a good company to work for. But like all startups, it grew into a big bloated company that emphasized more customers at the expense of service.

I've gotten food poisoning so many times, and the air quality in the building is really bad (and it's really cold at all times).

The interview process went smooth, and the recruiter was honest with all of my questions.","To be honest, HostGator is not a great place to work. The demands are high, but you'll get very little support along the way. The metrics to get bonuses are very unattainable. You will always be treated like a number. They offer extra benefits and sell the extra benefits, but they're really a joke. For example, the food they serve for lunch everyday is catered by one of the supervisors on staff, and it's not cooked and handled properly. It's not that the food is cheap, but that it's not cooked properly in the Houston location. Also, the workers are not really heard. The top leadership are very young, and they do not associate with the workers. They're very out of touch with the current workloads and demands of the job. They say things like, ""when I took calls..."" but they haven't taken calls in years. The job is very, very different now. It's very difficult to understand the attendance polices and other policies, because the policies are not written down. When I e-mail HR or the leadership about it, i do not get a response.

Angry customers who will curse you out with a quickness due to the incompetence of themselves and/or the company. (Yes, the stupidity suprisingly went both ways equally.)

You can't find a better health insurance plan anywhere.,The first three months are difficult and you will need to spend a lot of time studying but again you get out what you put in.

If you can put up with this you will survive. Don't let this deter you though because I believe the pros outweigh the cons greatly but you need to go in knowing what to expect so you can be prepared.

Everyone is really helpful when you need the help, my trainer when starting was very informative and exceeded my expectations. Although I know it's kind of impossible to cover everything during training and some people feel that they're just thrown on the floor afterwards it's how you learn and everything starts to get faster the more times you do them. You also have to have thick-skin when working here, just keep in mind you may never talk to this customer again nor will you ever meet them again in your life. As long as you are good with your conformance and you follow proper verification procedures you'll be fine. Also, this job is a great job for people that enjoy helping people fix their technical issues and have the drive to learn more not only inside of work but outside.

Relax working environment. Even when the the call/chat ques are high, you can still work at your normal pace. 
Basic game room, gym and cafeteria. Very watered down perks but they're still there.","***Moving into 2014 when Hostgator completed their transition post buy out by a mother company. Just about everything about Hostgator and working there has drastically changed. ***

Management (apart from Supervisors) do not listen to any input from the people on the front lines and years of experience. They take it upon themselves to test out theories and business tactics that are intended to bring in more profit rather then satisfy customers. 
Career advancement is nearly non-existent. You are trained barely enough to do your job and any advancements are from your own personal skill set. 
You have to be stellar at everything you do, for them to advance you in the company to do work which no longer need those skills. (Read that again and let it soak in)
Be prepared for the angry customers. Hostgator use to be a company with no wait times for support and puts the customer first. It is now 100% the opposite, meaning they went from award winning customer support to now one of the worst of any industry."
277,HostGator.com,Truckstop,2014-10-09,2.0,Security Administrator,"It's right off the highway, bathrooms are somewhat clean, some really good, friendly, helpful people work there. 

Little scope of support means you have the opportunity to deal with just about everything. 

There is some training, in house tools, decent break rooms. 

They do promote from within.","Supervisors for jr admin's are over loaded, and under paid. There are rumors that they may get write ups to pass on to their subordinates from the higher ups with little over sight or chance to review and agree to the conclusion. Be sure to be aware of your working enviroment and provide feed back on any paperwork  that you get. Supervisors may not agree with the write up, but the choice is passing it on, or losing their job. You're going to get the write up. 

Quality assurance is there for the customers only, they don't always know more about computers than the customers coming into the chat room. Their behavior and roles in the company liken them to the gestapo. Information goes in, and almost nothing helpful comes out. 

Advancement can be a very bad thing, supervisors may not know enough about your job to be helpful. there may not be level 2's that will help with problems, and there may not a line of support if you genuinely just need help reaching a resolution. But there is an out  if you ask to move to other departments. 

Quota has been pushed hard in that company to the point where there are issues with just generating replies to tickets to keep above the waterline. Resolution based approaches are not as  important as how you look on paper. 

The food they bring for lunch can be very terrible. Really. 

When I worked there stagnation among employee's was frowned upon, get a lot of raises as a jr admin, you're going to be moved up or moved out, why pay someone well for doing the front lines when they can roll someone else in for minimum pay to just be another face.

You didn't even get to keep your workstation, as you could come in for a shift and someone else would be there.  It was ""grab a station"" but I found that highly annoying.  There didn't seem to be a sense of permanence.  Also, even though lunch was free every day, it was a grab and dash affair and you only ever had 2 options.  Also, they didn't want anyone leaving the building, so you had to either bring lunch or eat whatever they gave you.  The quotas were super high, meaning that they wanted you to talk to customers off the phone/chat quick so that you can move on to the 5million other people in queue.  Wasn't worth the pay. There were also only 4 or so other female reps in the whole place and you were always looked down upon as if they didn't really think you knew computers.  There was also a number to call in if you were going to be late/absent and it was a pain to work through about 3 numbers to get to an actual person to let them know...and usually they had no idea who you were."
283,HostGator.com,Still no such thing as a free lunch,2014-09-06,1.0,Junior Administrative,"Not many pros. There is PTO, and 401k, though you'll have to probably do your own research for how to enroll. Lunch is served, though it is not always completely edible. Ability to schedule 4 ten hour shifts per week is nice.","There are too many to list, really. The pay is, in fact, quite low for the knowledge and products you are expected to support. They like to tout things like ""free beer on friday!"" or ""5 minute chair massage!."" And these things may be successful at distracting some workers from the terrible compensation, by making them think it's a ""hip"" place to work.

They continue to run promotions to gain new customers/subscribers, and they cannot handle the current call/ticket volume. Customers routinely wait on hold for 35-40 minutes to speak to you. 40 minutes!

Once they do speak to you, it can be difficult to manage the call, as the customer is reluctant to hang up before the problem is completely solved. They don't want to have to call back, and wait on hold again for 40 minutes, and I can't blame them. They've brought on some temps/contract workers recently to try to help with the call volume. These folks have received minimal training, and more knowledgable techs are already having to pick up the pieces. Whether this trend of hiring temp workers will continue is anyone's guess. I'm sure it ultimately saves the company money, so it doesn't seem implausible. As another reviewer mentioned, they've also farmed some tasks out to India, so I think we can all see where that's headed.

The escalation path is broken. So-called level 2 technicians are people with some experience there, and they are taking calls or chats right along side of you... they're not there as a dedicated team to take escalated issues from tier 1, as one might expect. This means they're often just as busy as you, and getting answers to even relatively simple questions can take quite some time. Not their fault. But it is a terrible way to run tiered tech support.

You are expected to cover calls that span a wide range of topics. In a Kafkaesque twist, they lock you out of many of the tools needed to effectively solve the problems for the first 90 days (at which point you can take a test to prove that you can type ""ls"" in a linux terminal.) Which leads you back up the broken escalation path. Which leads you back to taking 30 minutes to solve an issue that probably should take 5. And you also may end up taking calls for topics on which you have zero experience or training. Customers get pissed, think you are an idiot, and question why they've spent their hard earned money with Hostgator. And then you begin to wonder why they have either.

They no longer have a food handlers permit, and employees frequently get e.coli . This, combined with the refusal of doctor notes and lack of sick days given, makes it a great place to get fired. 

Workstations are outdated, and crash. Running Firefox and chrome? You're at the limit. Prepare to restart you're computer 2-4 times a day while on call.

Employees promotions based on numbers instead of quality or skill. If you want a promotion, and you take calls, prepare to be aggressive and get used to hanging up on people. You are expected to make 5 calls per hour, do you think it's possible to provide meaningful server administration support in less than 12 minutes? What a joke.

Unreliable servers, and bad NOC technicians.   EIG, the company who purchased Host Gator, moved all servers away from one of the best datacenters in the US, SoftLayer, to one of their own 'new' datacenters in Provo, Utah. The technicians and servers are unreliable, and amateur, resulting in extremely poor service (which causes *ACCEPTABLE* EMPLOYEE ABUSE PER EIG POLICY*) but saves EIG millions per year.

Slowly these morale boosters were being phased out and are probably gone.

 I personally learned the trade quickly, but the methods to advance were held from me as you have to take tests.  You will be taught a procedure, be told to follow it, and when you do you will be scolded for doing so. The billing system was a mess that would get you scolded because some Linux development member did not do their part in finishing the programming. This results in customers leaving and you getting scolded again. 

Eventually you quit in disgust or you're fired for ""not doing your job"" despite you've done everything asked of you and met quota. 

You'll be asked to promote a scam someone runs as an affiliate program. The gist of it is that if you make a website, you'll make xxxxxx figures or more in cash. This brings in loads of unhappy customers because the affiliate told them that Host Gator would help build the site from scratch and they don't even know what a domain name is.

 EIG takeover left everyone worried about their job. Management's always worried about lowly techs rising through the ranks to take their jobs because it was rather easy if you knew what you were doing. Not the case anymore, HR fires you. The same HR that parks in a handicap spot despite not being handicapped. One guy bothered to complain,  and the company's response to us all was ""don't complain about that, it's private property and we can do as we please"".

I've personally seen many people come in with no Linux experience, and exit the door with jobs offers they couldn't have dreamed of getting before working here.","Unfortunately the take over of EIG killed many of the good qualities that the gator had. 

Everything seems to be poorly managed now. We killed off our internal support departments without having any kind of contengency plan. Needless to say this has negatively affected our ticket volumes, and upper management seems unwilling to hire more administrators to handle the higher loads. This comes back on my department, when customers contact us to complain about waits.  

Base pay for employees in my department was increased from 10$-12$ to 12$-13$. For the scope of products that our agents are expected to be able to support, this is not enough, and the market agrees. Several entry level positions around Austin that require FAR LESS techincal apptitude hire in people much higher than we do, usually around $17+(BigCommerce, Time Warner, WpEngine, etc etc).

Advancement can be slow. A direct line to advancement is laid out fairly soon once starting at HostGator...unfortunately when a position opens up, management just sits around saying they aren't currently filling those positions. This drives high turn-over and harms morale. 


And lastly, many of our tasks are being outsourced to another EIG brand in India. This is the first step in a long process that ends with support off-shore.

The best part of this company is every manager I met was an actual technician capable of doing the job they were telling you to do, and when it got busy the managers and even the owner take calls. A nice contrast to other companies where the boss is related to the owner and doesn't know anything accept he is the boss.

While at this job there were very few times I could just outright say I was the smartest guy in the room.","Pay scale is on the lower end, but the Web Host industry is just too competitive to pay more, so it is not bad overall.

The only problem I had is when I started they were really laid back about attendance because  they knew they grossly underpaid (college degree getting $11/hr) and the managers don't want people coming in on their bad days, which is logical.  So that sort of made up for the low pay. But HR changed it, so I left. I make 2.5 times more working part time for other companies now than I was making there full time. I don't mind getting underpaid when there is the incentive of being able to miss whenever you are not feeling it. 

But to be under that point system and get underpaid was too much for me. I like everyone in the company, except HR. Now that they got rid of them I would go consider going back if I was broke."

*Bonuses if you are REALLY good at your job
*Pay is good for those with just a HS diploma
*Friendly staff (being friendly really affects promotions)
*Semi-intelligent clients compared to most technical support positions.","*Steep learning curve. Be prepared to study on your breaks and when you are home.
*Lots of red tape. Don't expect to advance if you are part time. Expect to work 8 hour shifts only. Be ready to be requested to work graveyard. Be ready to jump through hoops for promotions.
*Constant changes with little notification and even less documentation. Systems/issues/offerings roll out and usually the customer knows more about it than the staff helping said customer.
*Thrown into doing work that usually you won't have the tools to complete for several weeks/months (new jr admin agents have to wait 90 days for access to tools that help immensely)
*Huge cuts recently which results in larger queues for clients (which just aggravates them). In addition, constant hiring to replace older agents (fresh inexperienced staff = more aggravated clients). Plus lots of recent issues/outages (even more aggravated customers)
*40% of clients suck (you end up with clients saying things such as agents giving them the wrong information, or yelling about how awful we are, or pretending they know what they want and getting pissed off when they confuse you because they don't know what they are saying or people who won't follow company policy and rate you badly because you follow policy).  Yes there are a few good clients who get to the point or actually know what they want.
*Bonuses based on how client feels about company (survey at the end of the call/email/chat specifies company) Also if you don't get 9's or 10's, your ratings will suck. 8 or lower is bad. And expect some 0's which are near impossible to recover just because you are following policy.

Money seems to be pumped back into communal purposes rather than directly back to pay checks.  There have been occasions where supervisors were paid less than their subordinates.

Questionable choices when it comes to staffing higher end positions.  Very little transparency from B class management due to lack of communication.  Some directors/managers (not all) are ""green"" and aren't motivational.

- there are smart coworkers that you can learn from

- flexible hours (depending on department)","- no communication between management and the employees. this results in most employees not knowing anything until a policy or product has been released and customers are asking about it. another example is that they randomly start enforcing policies that aren't very well known, and they enforce them very sternly (i.e. first warning is a piece of paper that says you are going to be terminated unless you begin to immediately start hitting your quota which results in higher tickets but much lower customer service)

- HG management still has retained the good ole boy club mentality when it comes to management positions. There are supervisors or managers that are absolutely horrible and just get switched from department to department as people get sick of them. I always wondered why they just weren't let go, or moved to a different position. Only thing I can think of is they are related to someone or they are just in the good ole boy network.

- Lack of career opportunities. The administrator salary/wage ceiling is around 40-45k. Once you get there, raises are very seldom and you will only get additional money if you are promoted to an L2 position. Guess who gets L2 position? People that are trying very hard to get into the good ole boy network. One guy would literally buy food for his supervisors, drive them to lunch, etc on a regular basis. If you are going to be happy at 40-45k for the rest of your life, then it may be for you.

- They have started laying off/terminating people for stuff that was perfectly fine a year or two ago, but now they just terminate you for it. I'm not sure if this has to do with so many customers leaving HostGator due to the epic fail that is the Provo datacenter.

- A variety of technical issues to solve
- Wonderful place to learn Linux and cPanel
- Free beer on Fridays
- Many shifts are available to work
- some flexibility in changing hours temporarily
- success is measured by hitting a quota
- EIG is a big company and may help Hostgator deal with growing pains.","- very low pay
- In order to advance, you really need to advocate for yourself.  Many of the front line managers do not feel that it is their job to help their direct reports achieve their career goals.  They feel that they just need to make sure that you do your job and correct your errors
- Recently,  many new hires were hired at a higher pay rate than current employees.  The current employees have not had their pay adjusted to reflect the same pay scale as new employees.  Some of the new employees are starting at a salary of possibly 30% higher than employees that have been there for 2 years.  About 3 years ago, salaries were fair.  Then the owner decided to prepare the company for sale and found a great way to reduce operational costs.  Hire people from out of state at a very low salary and pay their moving expenses to move to Texas.  Hold them to a year contract or return moving expenses back to Hostgator.  So there is quite a difference in pay among employees at the same job level.
- very difficult to get a promotion.  Management keeps changing the requirements for promotion just as you complete them.  Imagine being told you are done if you run 10 miles.  Then at 9 miles, you are told you really need to run 15 more and so forth.  
- success is measured by hitting quota.  This means that the employee  with 100 responses a day which are mostly just basic replies that are pasted into the ticket is seen as a ""good employee""  but someone who takes time to research an issue and send a thoughtful response with only 30 replies is not such a great employee.
- In order to help those who take time to create thoughtful replies, there is a ""help hours"" system.  This help hours system takes at least one hour a day to document the time you took to help a customer with an issue.  You have to search for the time you worked on the ticket then be sure that this does not conflict with a reply or any other activity on the system, or you won't get credit.  Do you see how hard that was to explain?  Did you get any of that?"

+ The office atmosphere is so despondent that not only are quirks accepted, but full throttle antisocial behavior and the type of fallacies that would land a HR complaint at other companies are typically overlooked.
+ There's a 90% chance that if you're not male, you can put yourself into a position in which you can learn quite a bit from some legitimately talented people.

- The Linux Administrator I position is much like the above, but with less calls and more tickets. Company is probably also one of the few ones in the industry to implement a ticket system that has a quota system based on quantity.
- Starting pay is way low across the board and stays low.  Raises are infrequent at best.
- Insurance benefits are only 60% covered for employees and are so bad that you'd be better off going through a third party provider out of your own pocket.
- Misogyny runs high in the upper management of the Support (technical) side of the company, especially if you're based out of Austin.  Its less of a problem in Houston.
- Management tactics are extremely exploitation driven and  based around the concept of seeing how much they can get away without pushing you to just leaving.
- Free lunches are usually inedible and the employees that can afford to buy their own lunch or bring one from home, do.
- The company reputation for low hiring standards and liberal use of the word ""administrator"" have reached a point that other companies have a hard time taking these positions seriously when listed on a resume."

Management started making you clock-out if you were to go to the restroom, AFAIK this is illegal and just wrong ethically. The building wasn't located in the best area, there were constantly issues around the building with bums, prostitutes and the occasional gun shootings. The only way to advance in the company was to befriend the management frat boys and if you were a chat tech this was not an easy task. You were expected to take 6 or more chats at the same time as well as 1 phone call which didn't allow you to offer good support to the chats and would result in poor ratings by customers.

If you have a passion for IT and an aptitude to learn fast, HostGator is a great company to get your foot in the door. There is a strong focus on providing employees with education to get them on the career path they desire.

As an employee who might be new to the industry, every interaction with a customer exposes you to an opportunity to learn something new, master that subject, and become an asset that can allow you to move up the ladder.

Sure, there's free food, massages, beer, a game room, and all of the other themes that are commonplace with hip startups, or laid back tech environments... and don't get me wrong, these are all really nice perks, but the glue that holds everything together are the people. I can't speak personally for the Houston office, but the Austin office is home to some of the most sincere people I've ever known.

Every Shift Lead and Supervisor I have had, I was happy to also call a friend. My sentiment isn't persuaded by any acts of favoritism or activities outside of the workplace, but because they were excellent leaders. They looked after their employees, worked to the best interest of their subordinate's career, and remained professional and loyal to the interests of the company.

If there is any advice I can give, shoot for the most challenging technical position available, and take every opportunity to further your education. You won't find a better place to gain this knowledge.","Sadly, I've witnessed many quality employees leave the company during my time with HostGator. This may have been encouraged due to the comparatively low pay, political conflict, or direction that the company heading. HostGator would be wise to hold tight to their most valued employees, and shower them with a pay increase.

The metric requirements are nothing more than a demoralizing roadblock that only encourages sloppy work so that one can reach quota. It is a completely broken system. An employee could churn out a days worth of sub-par work and fly under the radar, while someone else treads in hot water because they had to clean up their mess. There is also a bonus system, however, should you be the unfortunate soul who catches an undeserved low rating from an irate customer, you are just out of luck.

The most heartbreaking situation of all, is the nosedive that internal systems have taken. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that ""everything is broken"". The development team has pushed forward with ""updates"" that weren't needed or asked for, which only result in multiple mission-essential functions breaking. All the while, there is a back log of show-stopping bug reports that remain untouched or flat out ignored. There is no policy for employees to follow when working around these broken features, and the work environment is often a chaotic joke.

There was a constant cry for improvement from employees at all levels, but it either fell on deaf ears, or just never made it up the chain. HostGator used to be an exciting thing to be a part of. There were a good number of ambitious and talented employees, and the esprit de corps was invigorating. That flame appeared to die, upper management appeared to quit caring, and senior employees just seemed burnt out. I loved HostGator, but it was clearly time to jump ship."

422,HostGator.com,"Great Company, Great People",2012-03-02,5.0,Linux Systems Administrator I,"HostGator is a great company to work for.  While working at HostGator.com, I was able to boost my abilities with Linux by performing in both their Linux Support and their Migrations departments.  These departments dealt heavily with not only their server support (Linux Support), but also with customer code, and application support (Migrations). 

This company is a great place to go for any aspiring administrator, as you can easily learn more than what you would think starting out at a hosting company.  There are multiple departments where anyone with technical ability can easily excel.  Their monitoring department, for example, is a great way to boost skill with regards to load and I/O issues, and anyone who would like to know more about a particular aspect of systems administration could quickly change departments and learn the aspects they were interested in.","One of the downsides I can say is that the company needs a bit more inter-department communication.  Sometimes there are some issues from management in departments, and changes may be ""pushed out"" without many employees being aware.  Additionally, even though you may be skilled in a particular field, if you are in a particular position, you will be limited to that position.  That was one of the issues I had at HostGator.com, as I was able to help out every department, however I was responsible for a particular department and it's work."
423,HostGator.com,I have enjoyed every day that I have worked for HostGator.,2012-02-27,5.0,Linux Administrator I,"Some current and former employees will mention the fact that the dress code is really lax, there's free catered lunch, a game room with an Air Hockey Table and multiple arcade machines, flexible schedule, and the relaxed yet professional work environment.  What they won't mention is that HostGator thrives on it's culture of family and team work.  Since I have started with the company, I have developed a great network of friends/coworkers.  The mindset to me feels like ""we all have a job to do, let's help each other get it done"".  I walked into HostGator knowing virtually nothing about Web Hosting and in less than a year advanced to Administrator.  The opportunity to learn the field is fantastic and HostGator provides the opportunity to shore up your working knowledge of day to day operation in order to improve and advance yourself.  Also, the positive feedback from direct and upper level management is excellent.  When you are doing a good job, they certainly let you know.","At the risk of sounding like a homer, the only real complaint I would have is that I wish the pay was a little higher, and that the incremental raises were a bit more."
424,HostGator.com,"Brief, micro managed.",2012-02-21,2.0,Systems Administrator (Commonly Known As Technical Support),"When you're off, you're off. No overtime.

Unusually high number considering the position includes debugging customer applications and server issues. And if you are not making that number after a couple months, your terminated.

- Was informed after a week that I had to make a phone call to request taking my break, going to lunch, and using the bathroom! Was informed to be prepared to wait 15-45 minutes for a manager to call back giving permission to use the restroom.

- The free lunch when I was there was bologna sandwiches with exception to one day of the week. The ""free lunch"" is the poorest employee comp I've ever seen. It was insulting. Would have been better off with free snacks or nothing. It makes for a very bad impression on new employees."

2.  The company consistantly leads the web-hosting industry in Customer Service ratings and continues to improve those ratings with every policy change.
3.  No member of senior management is ever too busy to help the newest Junior Administrator learn, develop, and contribute to the overall success of the HostGator Team.
4.  An entreprenuerial spirit is both highly valued and well-rewarded through both internal employee suggestions as well as external marketing strategies.
5.  Attendance is the primary factor in career advancement at HostGator.  Everyone from the Founder of the company down to the most recently hired employee knows that if you prove you can be trusted to clock in when scheduled, the knowledge and experience required to advance within the company will be acquired naturally.
6.  Free meals on every shift.
7.  Although the job involves various levels of stress from time-to-time, I have laughed on every single shift I have worked in my two years at HostGator.
8.  Our employees have a wonderful habit of taking ownership of our mistakes, and we share our successes with those who contribute to the correction of those mistakes.
9.  There isn't a single person on our staff who is commissioned to make sales or incent any customer in any way to spend more money. This makes our technical recommendations for upgrades and auxillary services carry more merit and certainly sets us apart from most of our competitors who tend to focus primarily on profitability.
10.  Our CEO started on the lowest rung of our corporate ladder in 2009 with little experience in our industry and proved himself worthy of the highest promotion in less time than one of the billing cycles we offer.","1.  Not enough emphasis on structered forms of higher education.  Lack of a tuition reimbursement plan.
2.  Lack of a more forgiving bereavement-related leave of absense.
3.  Lack of home-sourcing opportunities for employess who can prove to be both trust-worthy and deserving.

436,HostGator.com,I should have left much sooner,2011-12-26,1.0,Junior Administrator,"The free lunch is really convenient. Sometimes the quality of the food may not be good, but you can’t really complain about a free lunch.

HostGator.com is really good about working with your schedule.

HostGator.com provides great customer service to their customers.

The direct shift-leads and supervisors are friendly people.","HostGator.com can be a soul crushing place to work if you stay here for too long. My advice is to get in, obtain knowledge and skill, work hard, get money, and get out as soon as possible.

The management monitors everything you do while logged into netboot! Be mindful, that anything you do while logged into neboot can and will be used against you! Do not log into anything personal while logged into netboot! Be very careful of what you write in Pidgen or Spark.

Socially, Junior Administrators are generally look down upon by other employees and even some the customers.

The company as a whole is a little juvenile and cliquish. You won’t advance at HostGator.com through work ethic and skill alone; you’ll need to become sociable with the right people. Generally, if you become buddies with the right person, you’ll be put in the right place.

The upper level management is literally like one big fraternity. The CEO is aloof and not really sociable with low-level employees. The CEO will periodically monitor the floor talk on his phone at the same time and never once was a simple greeting exchanged. Don’t expect the rest of the management to get to know you as a person either. They’ll walk right by you without a simple greeting unless you initiate a simple, “Hello.”

Communication within the company is terrible. For example, HostGator.com’s handbook states that we don’t officially support coding or web design related issues; however, Quality Assurance (QA) department advocates that we support “everything”! Realistically, HostGator.com doesn’t have the resources to support “everything” for the lack of training or skill and the amount of time it would take to support certain things. Junior Administrators are encouraged to at least investigate what we don’t officially support by escalating these issues internally; however, when an internal employee tells us that there’s nothing we can do, you (the Junior Administrator not the Linux Admin or QA agent) must deal with the customer’s raft…

HostGator.com’s bread and butter is customer service so you can expect some customers to have a false sense of entitlement. Some customers think that just because they’re paying for a service, they can just treat employees like crap.

Some of the customers are just stupid (not ignorant) and you’ll have to deal with them. For example, you’ll have an irate customer request a supervisor just because he or she cannot login to the billing system because of minor typo their part.

HostGator.com has a bad habit of announcing things way too soon.

To my knowledge, the gym in Austin is great; however, the gym in Houston is nonexistent.

The break room always looks filthy.

The temperature of the building is always seems to be too cold.

During busy hours, it’s difficult to find a parking spot."
437,HostGator.com,A bi-polar egocoaster.,2011-12-09,1.0,Junior Administrator,"HostGator is good for people who don't have a lot of experience. They hire a lot of people and offer interesting perks that a lot of other jobs would not. It is mostly subsistence based stuff (Food, candy, drinks, etc.) 

- They have nap rooms
- A pretty cool break room
- Sometimes have fun events

They have been pretty flexible with schedules.

The only thing I really like about HostGator is they have a lot of really good people that try really hard to get things done. I've met a lot of good friends here.","Hostgator hires people without a lot of background experience, training or education so that they can pay them at the very lowest end of the normal pay scale. We get a brief training period that is mostly there to cover the basics. 

The turn over rate is really high because of the general lack of skill and it is made worse because of the expectations they place on us. It feels like mostly everyone at HostGator is just there while they look for something else or until they get fired for incompetence. 

The real HostGator seems like a group of around 5-10 people who have been friends for a really long time and everyone else is expendable. I always see those 5-10 people move around to different positions in the company messenger but I've never seen what they do if they do anything at all."
