Working hours are too long with no empathy for the execution teams and people overseeing those executions. 

Sucking up is appreciated and late night slack pings and updates are rewarded (read only way to prove that you work).

HR is doing a lot to justify org failure via monthly happiness surveys, NoEmailNoMeeting days, Wellness seminars but are only limited by senior leadership’s incompetence of running a business and team that can retain talent and build a revolutionary product.

Internal tools and systems are archaic and you can pretty much do nothing without involving 10 teams and getting 20 levels of approvals.

People are expected to work even during Covid isolation periods and are considered not impactful if they don’t do a good job of stealing credits of collective wins."

Hotstar is essentially a game of passing the parcel. Any work gets thrown away from team to team and no one wants to do their work. Everyone from the leadership to developers/executive/analysts have just developed a habit of evading work.
No collaboration between teams and mentoring or helping isn't even in the radar of the Hotstar employees.
No vision or long term goal, leadership is narrow sighted and only wants to fulfil their own quarterly/annual goals.

Same is true for companies. I have witnessed that Hotstar's DNA is the tendency to constantly challenge status quo, find the next bigger mountain to climb and dare to go forward where others step back.

History has been made and continues to be made at Hotstar as we can see from the massive expansion of viewership on the platform. A rare company across the world which does both VoD and Live streaming sports. I was lucky to be part of the recent Ind NZ matches at Hotstar and the scale at which viewership went up is unprecedented for a normal ODI in India.

The potential to be a world leader in OTT is massive, which invigorates everyone in the company to put in more of themselves than they ever did elsewhere. The company's culture is tech-driven, we talk technology and probably live and breathe it too :) :)

From my time here, I can note some pros amongst many of working here:
- SCALE (millions of users is a lifetime achievement in some companies, at Hotstar we begin there)
- Tech depth - the most enviable engineering talent and tech stack in the industry
- Leadership - Probably the best minds in the industry whose vision goes beyond the next 2-3 years. They are in this for the long haul !
- Reach - Hotstar is on 120+ million devices and counting, its sheer reach is astounding, considering the company started as Indian ops only.
- Quality - Having using Hotstar in my mobile devices, web and on living room (Chromecast) I can easily vouch the product is of top notch quality - after all seeing is believing !
- DOERS - no need for permission, if you find something to fix - you can fix it.
- Transparency - Worked in many companies, the bias for openness and speaking your mind on the floor is unique. 
- Opportunities - BE what you want to be. But first make up your mind what it is!
- Free kitchen, beverages, snacks
- Team lunches, outings, unlimited time off !
- Recognition - rewards, awards for top performers - however could be done even better
- Learning - last but not least, sometimes I feel like an imposter with so many smart engineers talking about cutting edge tech, debates and discussions around engineering excellence. Its all good though, just smile and nod in approval :)","Cons:
- Office space - massive expansion means we are becoming too big for our labs now :)
- Not enough space for amenities - would love some open spaces, TT/video rooms etc. 
- Work hours - with commute in Bangalore taking significant chunk off of our day, would be good to make start and end work hours more flexible"

You are expected to work on weekends, no comp off, no extra salary for doing so, no decent appraisals ( applicable only for non-tiny owl people). In dec CTO will mail all manager to ask employees to come on sat and sunday to prepare for IPL in April. 3 months without leaves, sat / sunday off and spending atleast 12-15 in office. This is what is expected out of you. Employees' opinion matter, does not exist.
- Also, CTOs boss doesn't really care about glassdoor reviews since he says and I quote ""As long as we are giving money, people will come.""
- You or your work will not be valued here. The credit will be taken by your manager or your PM. 
- High attrition rate is compensated by hiring below bar folks. A smart person typically stays for 1-2 months in this company. 
- Promises of good work are made and also buried in town hall meetings. The CTO takes pride in saying, work as I say or leave the company. Basically treating everyone like a blue collar factory worker.
- All the good work is outsourced. Hotstar or it's developers are nowhere involved in scaling or delivery of its content. They use these numbers to attract talent, but the truth is, all the scaling part is handled by akamai. The max TPS observed on any API that we have build in house is less than 1,000. 
- Nepotism still exists. If you're from tiny owl you can become a director with 6-7 years experience. 
- Gatekeeping by CTO and Senior Leaders above him. You will have to send a msg to entire org even if you're 5 mins past 11 stating the reason. Sometimes the reason is private and you would not want to say such things in a public forum.
- The HR team is non existent or they do not have any power. They do not respond to developer's plight only obeys what is told to them by the CTO.
- I am not sure if this is true ( heard this from a friend), but they do not give Full and final settlement when a employee decides to leave the company. Earned leaves are compensated against their 3 months of notice period. Yes you read it right, the next time they use the word ""industry standard"" while negotiating your salary, please tell them what is the industry standard for notice period.
- The Talent Acquisition  team realises the importance of glassdoor reviews and hence, from time to time keeps on adding fake reviews giving 4-5 star rating. You can easily identify such reviews. Before joining it is a good idea to talk to someone who is working ( better : used to work ) in Hotstar. Use linkedIn to connect."

PMs are so dominant and influencer that they can spoil engineers' rating and make you fire if engineer says no for anything or doesn't meet timeline even single time. 
If you see that track record of PMs they haven't done anything significant. Majority of PMs have started the startup with zero revenue and closed it. (you can check on the professional networking website)
They think that they have done something great in life short span of life and treat the engineers as labour.
Their Job is to find competitors' feature, read their engineering blogs and dictate engineering team. (if hotstar just needs to copy features from competitors' why they need PMs)
Engineering Directors/Managers act as Delivery managers. Their sole purpose of existence is to licking PMs and saying yes on their all crap ideas.
Though they don't do planning for their features release, asking engineers to planning events in life such that don't impact their feature releases. (it means your vacation planning should be advanced at least by 1 year, will be canceled as last-minute feature release)."

Hiring people from silicon valley.","While joining HR potrays rosy picture. They say that HOTSTAR has got very clean work environment and STAR Network has lot of internal politics. Its completely opposite. STAR Network's work culture is very clean.

They claim unlimited leaves, but employees can't take leave even if thye are sick. Forget about family time or vacation. People have to slog on weekends, whatsoever. Even if you are travelling or attending social functions, you are expected to carry laptop along with you.

Eventhough they say flexible working hours,  Hardly engieers leaving office before 9 PM and working till late  night from home. WFH option is available only on offer letter.
You are expected to respond  on slack even if it is 3:00 AM.

Senior management monitors work statation area through CCTV's. You are questioned even if you are late by 5 mins. Lot of micro-management !!

Hiring new people and firing existing ones is normal.
Management says work is only life in new era. no work life balance.

The pace with which people are leaving speaks volumes about the work environment that exists there. Sales team is operating at 50-55% capacity; Pricing team is more or less ruined. Even the HR has moved (one has moved to TV in Star and the other has left). If the senior management still can not see the massacre that has happened in the revenue team, I don't know where will the product go!
