39,Houzz,There's a reason SDR turnover is high and they're always hiring,2022-02-03,2.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),The only plus side is that it's a remote position,"The pay, the leads, the promotion length of the Houzz University program.

When I started at Houzz, there was a manager that conducting himself inappropriately; there was no physical abuse that happened to my knowledge but there was some sexually inappropriate behavior. The rumor mill went in full swing before management stepped in, they didn't give much information to the team and didn't offer anything to the team that would allow them to come forward if they hadn't already. That manager went on to work for a different company as a manager in a matter of a couple of weeks.
Secondly, everyone was disposable. They released one wave of sales personnel and reassured us that it wouldn't happen again, then did it again 3 months later, only after telling the team how well they were doing despite selling through COVID.
Finally they want results first and foremost, they will condone cheating to get there. I won't go into the specifics but there was a rep that reporting a different lead source to make more money and the manager was signing off on it every time. Instead of firing both of them, or even the rep that was cheating (the manager could have just been careless and didn't know that is what they were doing), both of them stuck around and the rep got to keep their MRR that led to a quick promotion.

This is not a company that you want to involve yourself with."

I don't think I can praise career opportunity when people leave/are dismissed so often.

Lack of loyalty to people who work hard - saw a whole department get laid off in front of our eyes, can only imagine how this company dealt with COVID 

Very judgemental management when onboarding - many of which I can see have now left?

Doesn't feel like any staff members are truly permanent or loyal here - it has only been a few years since I left and there doesn't seem to be any long standing team members.

Disconnect from the CEO - never met her, never spoke with her, no real attempt to reach her employees. Maybe because nobody sticks around long enough to see it as worth the effort?"

94,Houzz,BEST CAREER OF A LIFETIME,2021-10-27,5.0,Account Executive,"I have had the distinct pleasure of being with HOUZZ.com for seven years now. Like I said , it's the best career choice of a lifetime. The money is fantastic ,the people are wonderful to work with and the management they hire is top notch. There's so much room for growth if you're looking to climb the ladder, but you have to put in the work. If you're not looking to work hard this is not a job for you. The benefits are amazing for families and individuals as well.",Honestly there's not one thing I can say for cons. It's a truly wonderful company to work for.
95,Houzz,The best people,2021-10-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Houzz is every evolving, both the company and the product. This makes it a very exciting place to work, bringing new opportunities for learning and development. It's a great product, and feels good to contribute to a company that's helping people create homes they love and helping small businesses. 

Most importantly, the people are the very best. Houzz has a great culture. The benefits are top notch.","The fast paced environment is exciting and energizing for some, and not the best fit for others."
96,Houzz,"Houzz ""Culture""",2021-10-18,2.0,Account Executive,"When I worked at Houzz, they tried to make it fun with roasting smores in the kitchen, unlimited free coffee and food, team outings and more.","However, I quickly realized it was a toxic culture that was all based on politics and as a sales rep you're just treated as a number. We had pointless team huddles at 6:30AM every morning to play games, rather than focusing on our actual job. People hooked up with one another and even cheated on their partners with other employees at Houzz. It's a revolving door of unethical sales tactics and a failed attempt at keeping morale alive."

In the office they go the extra length to make you feel comfortable and make sure all your needs (and beyond) are satisfied. From unlimited smoothies to cookies and healthy snacks and great coffee.

I simply could go on and on about how amazing it has been to work here.",Maybe it would be great that we had a dental plan or access to private health insurance discounts and similar.

107,Houzz,Fun place to work - not somewhere you can make money or grow,2021-09-16,1.0,Account Executive,"Fully stocked kitchen 

Coworkers were friendly and the office was a cool setting to be in","The company is set up in a very strange way. Success is definitely not based on merit. It doesn't matter how good you are at sales - unless you are in the inner circle at houzz you will not do well. There is a handful of AE's - out of hundreds in the position - that actually do 'well' and make money. These people are spoon fed leads and are shown as an example to the rest of the company as ""what you can become if you work hard"". The truth is , with the current perception of the product you are selling, this is next to impossible. 

The most frustrating part is that managers and other superiors will try and make it out to be your fault if you aren't hitting numbers, and put you on performance plans to ""keep you on track for success"". 

I would not recommend anyone who is serious about growing their career in sales into management, or even making good money in sales works at Houzz. The company is a revolving door when it comes to employees, no one stays there more than 1-1.5 years because once you hit that mark you realize exactly what is going on."
108,Houzz,Fun culture and good benefits but you wont be rewarded for your efforts,2021-09-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pre Covid-19 there were great perks, lots of activities, and great people.","Poor raises, no opportunity for growth, underappreciated"

114,Houzz,Terrible Place to Work,2021-09-02,1.0,Account Executive,The work place culture is OKAY but could be alot better,"They pay is terrible, the leads are terrible. They need to invest more money into marketing vs having their reps waste time cold calling people that are just not interested. Toxic positivity is a common theme at Houzz & upper management is very fake. Company meetings is basically the head of sales trying to brainwash their reps that the company is doing great and on the right path to stop people from leaving."
115,Houzz,Make an impact!,2021-09-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are so many things to love about working at Houzz, but one that stands out is the ability to make an impact. The company is established and solid, but not so big that you feel like just a cog in a big machine. What's more, you can feel good about the company's product - both helping small businesses and helping people to create homes they love. 

On top of that, the people at Houzz are top notch, there are great benefits and it's fun!","Some people want to be a cog in a big machine, and that's okay. It's not a fit for everyone!"

117,Houzz,Great experience,2021-08-30,5.0,Account Executive,Houzz was a great stepping stone for me to find my passion as an Account Executive. Great product and can sell itself at times. All my coworkers were very supportive and it really felt like a family!,"If you aren’t an Account Executive 3 or higher, your accounts aren’t the greatest and have been worked several times already. But that’s definitely what will motivate you to try harder and work your way up the ladder to get ISR meetings!"
118,Houzz,Don’t do it,2021-08-26,1.0,Customer Service Representative (CSR),"Snacks. That’s basically it. I made some good friends while I was there, but sadly the job itself was horrible. They would fire people without real reason or lay off people in groups at a time. There was no trust.",This was the worst company I’ve ever worked for. It truly scarred me.
119,Houzz,"Could Be Better, Could Be Worse",2021-08-20,3.0,Account Executive,"Health benefits seem to be good. The base pay seems to be in line with entry-level positions in this industry. I would say they were honest in the hiring process regarding what a Rep could expect to make in their first year if they hit their sales goals, which is about $70k-$80k annually. Decent equipment and an overwhelming amount of self-training resources to make sure if you can't figure something out that the blame lands squarely on you. It sounds like it's a rapidly growing company, at least from what they tell us in company-wide meetings. They're aggressively focused on making an IPO ASAP and will provide stock options to levels AE3 or higher.","It's a grind, especially for new reps. Outreach, their CRM, is my biggest Con so far. It's a beast with a ton of functionality but it's not very intuitive so you really need to know how to use it and most of the people training you will not know how to use it properly. When you start you're given 3 months of training in what they call ""Greenhouzz"". You start with a smaller group of maybe 6 reps so there's a decent amount of personal attention. my best advice is dont afraid of deleting leads out of your pipeline. As a new rep most of your 300-500 leads will be heavily picked over so it's a big needle in a haystack hunt. Having all the leads provided for you is kind of a double edged sword. If a lead doesn't seem like a good fit or they dont really seem open to talking just get rid of them quickly. There's a lot of focus on the pitch and discovery process which is great training but I do feel like managers are preoccupied with assigning blame to rep for not following their myopic sales process whe it could be more produtive to focus on how weed out bad opportunities. It's not uncommon to make 100 dials a day and only get a few people on the phone, no matter how good of a sales person you are."

Fake leads were very common unless you were part of the “buddy system”.  Company culture took a dive once WFH took place. People drop like flies.

Too much focus placed on the importance of metrics and the speed in which you can complete cases. Not enough focus is given to customer service; it's all about how fast you can clear the queue, and how long you're in ACW. Your customer retention resources are weak with customers that aren't diehard Houzz fans.


Coachings are given out for everything. There's quite a lot of mistakes made by agents on the floor, and you have to wonder why. What's with the training curriculum?

There are constant issues with Houzz product listings, which creates customer escalations.


Training sessions and even supervisor introductions are under strict time limits. Training consists of slides, working live cases and later on, roleplays. Yes, it's a remote position, but there are games and scavenger hunts to break up the monotony and help retention of information. Or modules could be created.


Very little time was spent on dummy cases, and there is no dummy system. May not suit certain learning styles.

Almost all of the perks of working for Houzz were for in-office days. Working remote, you don't get catered lunches every Friday, you don't get a table full of birthday treats, or an hour of Yoga off the phones. You don't get to converse with coworkers in a fun office setting. So, working from home, you pretty much just get all of the cons I've mentioned."

There is plenty of opportunity for growth within your existing role and promotions. I have personally been promoted twice in 2 years and am constantly evolving as an individual performer thanks to extensive and consistent training & development.","Like any sales role, some days can feel repetitive. Since switching to work from home environments it is more challenging than ever for many companies and sales people to lean on your team when you are experiencing a challenging day or just need a quick boost from a colleague.

I truly respect everyone I've encountered at Houzz from the cofounders and leadership to my immediate team to people in other departments who I work with less often. Everyone brings their A-game, supports each other and we're all excited to see Houzz succeed.

I've also been incredibly impressed with how everyone at Houzz handled the transition to working from home during the pandemic. What an insane shift that must have been for every company and yet, at Houzz I felt supported, connected and empowered through it all.

I worked as a community support specialist during the pandemic and felt isolated due to the quiet nature of my job, which was to respond to email inquiries several hours a day, followed by a meeting or two throughout the day. I am by nature a person who prefers to conduct guest relations and customer service in person and I decided to leave the company to pursue other aspirations since the nature of the job didn't fit my career objectives."
165,Houzz,Don’t buy the hype,2021-06-22,1.0,Senior Account Executive,"Salary, benefits, coworkers, schedule, and some managers",Everything else. Literally everything else. This is a burn and turn operation. They do a great job disguising that on the front end. I started with about 15 other account executives and within about a year only 2-3 are still with the company. To quote a coworker “Houzz is a great place to work while you’re looking for a better job.” The leads you get as a new Account Executive are on average 3-4 years old and have been worked by half a dozen reps before you. You might get one to two new leads a week if you’re lucky and while they tell you they’re warm leads they aren’t. Even new leads are just people that created a free profile on the site and aren’t expecting a call. They’ll set you up on a comp plan with unrealistic targets so your chances of actually making the money they tell you up front are minimal.  They disguise the extremely passive aggressive management style behind a  “modern tech company” vibe.
166,Houzz,"Unless you have less than 1 year of corporate experience, RUN.",2021-06-21,1.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),Hours are 6:30AM to 3:00PM (you are off of work by 3PM),"1. Pay is 18.04 an hour and as many SDRs used to say, that is starvation wages in CA.

2. There is NO autonomy in this job. You clock in at 6:30AM, meet with your manager and their other 6-11 SDRs for about 10 minutes. Then you cold call construction workers until 11AM when nearly everyone takes lunch due to hourly employee regulations. Don't forget to clock out and clock in after your whopping 30 minute lunch because you can get fired if this happens more than a couple times. You then meet (aka huddle) for about 10-15 minutes and then smile and dial until your end of day huddle usually at 2:50PM, meet for 10 minutes and are clocked out by 3PM. 

3. Commission structure is PATHETIC for a tech sales role. After 6 months going without commission (mandatory probation period) you are able to get 600.00 (pre tax so really 300.00) if you hit their metrics which even the underperformers can do. If you have bills to pay and your parents didn't buy you a home then you will have to work VERY HARD for the 1,000 commission which means one check is about 1,900 (that's the big check for having 24+ demos show in one month where most companies in tech and in SDR/BDR roles require 8 meetings a month and 15 meetings a month is fantastic. If you are single and have 0 dependents your other non commission check equals about 1200-1400.

4. Peers do not like top performers. I worked this role for close to a year and the turnover is mind blowing. Most months we have atleast one usually two reps leave for Better.com and hiring paying roles. In my 10/11 months here I saw AT LEAST 12 reps leave. If you are a top performer you get on management's good side but that's all it gets you. The 18.04 an hour and commission is not enough to work as hard as some of us did and that's why there is such high turn over. You will work VERY HARD in this job stressing every minute about getting some construction worker to agree to a software demo and trying to book 3+ of those a day so you can barely make rent in a low income area. 

5. The account executives you partner with are usually very rude and not understanding of the HEAVILY recycled leads we are given. Most prospects have been called by 3 others reps 15X each plus emailed about 5 times so nearly all leads have been harassed by Houzz 60 times.


6. ""Houzz University"" tells you nothing about how to be a professional sales rep doing outbound prospecting. This was implemented in August of 2020 so top performing reps would have to stay as SDRs for 1 YEAR because they got rid of early promotion to account executive 1 (1 is entry level AE paying 19 an hour).

7. Peers are beaten down and hate their job. I was in hundreds of those 6:XXAM meetings and not one face showed happiness. 


8. Team chats routinely see posts about politics, racism, and sexism. One rep remarked how he was disappointed about not being able to use his riot gear after the guilty verdict of George Floyd's murderer and never had to speak to HR after that. There were DOZENS of comments like this including a ""memorable"" comment about how the United States was ""finessed"" from the Native Americans and NOT taken by rape and murder. 

9. During the 2021 bombing of Gaza and Israel, the CEO Adi moved our company wide all hands zoom meeting because ""Israel is being bombed"" but did not signal any care for the lives of the Palestinians."
167,Houzz,"Transparency, Grit, and Ongoing L& D PT 2",2021-06-16,5.0,Sales Executive,"There is something to be said here. We all say for Houzz u need grit! As a previous Houzzer u definitely need it. U need to be task oriented willingness to learn and take it full force and apply it to your sales technique! This is my 2nd review and why another because I was in the middle of other things. But, Houzz is a lot of fun and compared to other companies THEY do give u the tools , lap top during work from home, desk top set ups I can go on and on. Every AE has the opportunity to be successful, fair chances, fair leads in que! The owners are amazing, they opened this platform worldwide and took care of their Houzz family world wide. The owners are super transparent and they love to talk and I respect that. They made sure for PTO we were taken care of during the pandemic. So I want to say thank you for such an interesting year! I see great things for Houzz! So readers if you take a moment , don’t just look for the worse only find the best, find that grit! Find a way to take that challenge. Houzz is a family, be together grow together and make tons of money together!","The con was all the struggles world wide impacted everyone. But in my job, in my role.

169,Houzz,Leadership is out of touch and you will be over worked with no pay!,2021-06-11,2.0,Customer Service Representative,Work from home for now due to COVID. The peers are great and some managers and leads are awesome. They give you 16 hours of Personal Holiday at the beginning of the year that you can use anytime. They do pay for food from time to time (Uber Eats vouchers).,"Last year, April 2020, they cut more than half of the staff and their whole pre-sales department. Due to this, Customer Service reps were required to take on the roles of the sales department without any additional pay. They have not offered an annual raise in over 2 years. Leadership is nice nasty and are out of touch. They do not listen to the feedback posed by those who actually work the position. They expect you to work beyond what they are willing to pay. It is unspokenly known that at the top of the year they could make cuts and you can be laid off. So job security is not there."
170,Houzz,Truly a wonderful place to work,2021-06-10,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"- Great company culture (have met some of my favorite people since starting with Houzz 4 years ago!)

- Love that we are most likely moving to a hybrid model once US offices do open back up post covid (we did a company survey and they really listened to what we are looking for moving forward)","- If you’re not a top AE it can be difficult to really hit the jackpot commission wise, but they’re always holding trainings (more than ever before) to really ensure reps are being developed and have lots of opportunity."

The potential for growth here is huge, and the company maintains transparency with their employees which i value highly.","I will preface this by saying, this is not unique to houzz. You need grit. Its a sales role, you are communicating directly with people all day lon. The prospects get calls by many companies. Some have gotten calls from houzz before as well. So you need to stay focused, dont take anything personally, and remember your doing your job! Again, not unique to houzz, but sales is not for everyone."

184,Houzz,Make up your mind,2021-05-21,1.0,Account Executive,"""fun environment"" they have an open work space and themed meeting rooms. Plus breakfast on Monday and lunch on Fri and a stocked kitchen.","They changed metrics every 2 months. Youre doing great, you're going to get fired, you're doing great, you're about to get fired. Over and over again. That fun environment they create god forbid you use it. Just the typical ""start up"" that got too big too fast and have no idea what they are doing."
185,Houzz,Not everything that glitters is gold,2021-05-15,1.0,Sales Representative,We use up-to-date computers and technology,"Houzz was once an exciting, thriving and rewarding place to work. Majority of the sales reps were hired selling advertising and now have been forced to work leads for SaaS sales. It's an extremely inexpensive product that Houzz offers free trials and gives their clients the ability to self serve on Houzz.com, essentially stealing the sale from the sales reps. The Leadership Team secretly pick sales reps that they think deserve to work special leads. Said leadership will lie about warm lead opportunities to top level reps to get them excited and never deliver on them. It seems the company pays for leads when they need to boost sales at the end of the quarter but doesn't communicate this to sales reps when they aren't spending money to generate leads. Instead leadership makes reps think they may just not be working hard enough and need to make more dials. This has caused major friction across the sales team and the 'fight or flight' mentality. This explains the extremely high turnover in the last 2+ years. The new Leadership that was brought in does not take feedback or criticism. He doesn't listen to the needs of the employees at Houzz. Any time he is given negative feedback he immediately rebuttals it and will avoid ever asking for your feedback again. It seems many of the reviews on glassdoor are fake. Also a lot of the reviews rave about the stocked kitchen and great perks which is not the truth either. The kitchen dwindled majorly in the last year before the pandemic, all team functions were on freeze due to no budget and since we have been remote Houzz has not once sent out care packages, party favors, swag, nothing during the pandemic to their entire staff. The company celebrated the 10th Houzz anniversary recently and employees didn't receive anything. Holiday zoom party? No. Not a box of snacks, not a zoom party invite, nada. The company is so cheap and will use any opportunity to cheapen the deal. Since the pandemic there has been no virtual team functions which pre-pandemic there once was. Our owner of the company raves that our sales are the 'best they've ever been' but the perks of the company are the worst they've ever been. Now that businesses are beginning to re-open, Houzz will expect employees to come into the workplace and possibly be vaccinated when in reality they should allow permanent remote positions since it saves the business so much money and they are constantly squeezing the budget. Last but not least, this is the least diverse company I have ever worked at. In my time I may have seen only a handful of black people working at this business."
186,Houzz,Great place to work and foreseeable growth!,2021-05-13,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"They have a great onboarding system in place for new hires. There wasn't a moment where I felt lost or unsure what my responsibilities were. On top of that, the culture at Houzz is extremely strong and they encourage you to express yourself. From my own personal experience, there is little to no micromanaging and as long as you do your job they don't bother you. Semi-competitive environment. There is room to grow in the company which is great. Pay is also reasonable.","The only personal con I have is that they are strictly WFH for covid. Depending on how you look at it, this may be a pro! However, there are nearby plans where you have the option to return to the office if you feel comofrtable...which is great!"

192,Houzz,Structural problems and uncompetitive pay,2021-05-07,2.0,Marketing,"Great people and great middle managers
Culture was great pre-pandemic
Amazing health insurance
Learned a ton from different projects and great mentors
I got good pay raises for a few years before it plateaued
Ivy acquisition was a strong business move","Houzz has poor project planning and doesn't listen to the expertise of even their director level hires. Things moved too fast where new ideas would come up and people would work crazy hours to get things in motion instead of scheduling new initiatives for a few weeks out. The upper management often ignores data and they'll make decisions that are contrary to what customers and potential customers have said that they want. 

Houzz was unwilling to invest in external pro marketing for years and it impacted them in terms of SEO and a slowdown in warm leads - initiatives that my former manager proposed in 2017 didn't get up and running until 2021. 

Houzz tries to operate on too lean of a team, meaning that often you are the only person that can do your job which makes it nearly impossible to take like a week off any time that isn't around the winter holidays, so it can be hard to travel. 

Layoffs every year. I got really good at saving my money because you can never feel safe about your job.

There was definitely a divide too between the older managers who earned enough to own homes and renovate and younger renters who couldn't afford to participate in the renovation industry and I always felt a little embarrassed to just live in an apartment. 

My last pay raise was may 2019 and in 2020 they only gave us RSUs. But RSUs can't help me pay my bills today. When they were finally hiring another person for my team with the same title, the pay ranged from $2500-$12500 more than what I made and they were willing to hire someone remote who lives in a lower cost of living area than Orange county.

Also the UK team members got way more maternity leave than US team members which always felt like a point of jealousy even though I never went on mat leave myself, and they would get temp workers to fill the gap because they are gone for up to a year but that didn't happen in the US

They talked about career pathing in 2017 but it must not have applied to marketing because my manager had no idea what it was when I asked about it, and when I left in 2021 the leveling for marketing was still in the works after being revisited in late 2020."
193,Houzz,Life Challenge,2021-05-07,5.0,Account Executive,"This career path is not easy. In fact it's the hardest job I ever had in my professional career other than running my own business. But it is the most rewarding career path I have found thus far. If you take your future seriously and value yourself and your craft, Houzz will give you the tools to develop into a true sales professional. You have to make the decision to succeed. And that decision must be backed with focus, dedication, work ethic, and grit.",Just like everything that is good in life this job requires the work ethic and emotional energy and positive vibes. At times there will be days and weeks and even months where you feel like nothing is going your way. And the toll it can take on your mindset can be difficult to overcome if left unchecked. Take your vacations and stay in shape.

(For the most part). The benefits are nice, the pay was decent.","The actual job itself was horrible. To be honest being in sales is tough already, but selling a product that doesn’t work for everyone made it 10x worse. You will get cussed out on 20% of your calls daily. They say they don’t like to micromanage but then check your daily call volume, listen in on your calls, and will put you on a blueprint if you don’t hit daily goals even though sometimes you can’t control the number of people who pick up"

 Sales in Berlin for sure. Trainers aren't just right, managers are super inexperienced and do not show any interest on changing that. How can you ever take this job seriously with those managers? 
If you're ready to repeat the SAME pitch 100 times a day and sell a product that is an idea rather than a service (no one needs it and you feel terrible asking poor interior designers in Italy for 200 euro when you know it will only work for 10% of them) then take the job. They have no idea how to motivate people, and they offer just money and commissions until you feel like in a casino or like a cash-robot.
At the moment everyone is looking for a job (for more than a year) on a daily basis, be ready to hear your colleague's daily complaints.

Do not expect your manager to help you or teach you anything, she/he will redirect you to someone else to do the job for them."

All managers were at the right place at the right time. And managers need to be more open to feedback and not defensive.

I have made many friendships through the office which I will always be thankful for. For a while, I felt like the product we sold was quite stagnant, but all of that has changed in the past year. Because of the product changes, it now feels like a lot more of a consultative sales role now which is great! The transition to a saas company has come with its growing pains for some on the team (reflected in some of the reviews here) but if you're a hard worker, want to be challenged at work, and want to learn new things then this is a good place for you. I'm very thankful for the opportunities I've been given, the new skills I've acquired, and the overall rewarding experience Houzz Australia has been. The office/company perks such as flexible hours (when you're hitting target), Perkbox memberships, and healthy at Houzz program are a great incentive. Thanks to managers for always supporting me and making me a better salesperson.

I have always liked my job but having the hybrid work model and work from home flexibility has driven my personal happiness and success in my role. I really feel I've achieved a healthy work/life balance because of this - thanks Houzz!","I can't think of any that stand out. Not having work from home flexibility on the sales team was previously a con, but with covid and remote work that's irrelevant nowadays."

241,Houzz,A real review.,2021-03-02,1.0,Sales,Best & long lasting friends made whilst at Houzz,"LinkedIn states Houzz has approximately 1600 employees. Let’s say that some have not updated their status since being made redundant so perhaps that number is closer to 1500 globally. 

However, on Glassdoor Houzz has a staggering 1020 reviews! Many of which are 5 star, lacking any real substance apart from a few exclaimed sentences describing ‘Great management! Wonderful job! Fantastic company!’ Strange, no?

It’s very clear that Houzz is jamming up this feed fraudulently to drown out the very true and upsetting real reviews that show the company for what it is: a company that pays women less than men, has no clear career path or ambition to grow incredible talent (who all end up leaving), and that has given many of its past employees mental health issues due to stress and mistreatment."

This got even worse while working from home. Unfair lead distribution, if you are a chosen one, and liked by leadership you will go far. Unrealistic goals, majority of the sales floor doesn’t hit quarterly goals. Comp plan changes often, and typically not for the better. Over the course of my sales career at Houzz my pay keeps getting worse. This is not uncommon, they keep long time employees with stock options. This trend is starting to fade as many current employees are unhappy, and are actively looking for new opportunities. Leadership is out of touch with reality, and exude false positivity."

The culture is really inclusive of all people and I love everyone that I work with.

308,Houzz,DO NOT BE FOOLED,2020-12-17,1.0,Account Executive,"Let me start by saying, the 5 star reviews that were written here are very clearly created by higher up management, or senior level reps who are put on a pedestal and do not have a similar work experience to most houzz employees.","When I first started at houzz, I had nothing but amazing things to say about the company. The training was great and the friends I made were even better. I had a great relationship with every manager I had, but beyond that, it’s clear that Houzz does not care about employee retention. This is simply a place for you to get your foot in the door in the sales world. 


If you aren’t a senior level rep, be prepared to work your butt off and get very little return. I’ve seen reviews that say “the more you work the more you earn.” This simply is untrue you. You might make 100 dials a day and stay persistent with the people you pitch and finally get a payout on it. But then there are the “top reps” who get fed inbound leads and make 7 dials a day and are praised for making such high revenue for the company. I would make high revenue if I had people picking up the phone to call me too! 

The way they handled corona virus was the cherry on top. Raising goals and firing people left and right for not meeting that new quota in the middle of a pandemic AND the slowest quarter of the year historically?! That was incredibly disheartening to see. This was when I really realized that the only thing the company cares about is making money, not the livelihood of others."

Stocked kitchen of food, good coffee and amazing catered lunches on fridays. Sadly those days are over with Covid and I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was. Very good insurance.","Low salary for Orange County, commisions are very up and down depending on the economy. If you crush goal you can make solid money but if you don't like right now its pitiful pay. sine the pay is low and the perks are zero now that everyone is working from home they have lost half of their sales force to better paying companies. Shares are passed out if you promote only, not if you hit goal or work there for years. ESU Shares only have value after years of vesting and they are only worth something if Houzz goes public which isn't happening anytime soon."

This is mostly in part due to the people - everyone is great and you really make lifelong friends here. However, work is not all about the people. The role is equally important. The leadership & development team go above and beyond to make sure you're prepared in all aspects of the job - product, self-improvement, management etc. This makes you feel supported and that you have a solid team behind you to help when in need. This is also a place where you can be yourself and unlike most other companies I've worked for, I truly treasure this. It makes working that much more fun when you're comfortable giving your thoughts. I feel thankful to have the opportunity to work for such a great company.","Honestly, can't think of any. I might have had a different answer prior to COVID, but I've been super impressed with how upper management has handled the transition from home.

330,Houzz,The people make the place!,2020-11-10,5.0,Marketplace,"When I joined, Houzz was still in its very early stages and the first few years were explosive. We were in growth mode and pioneers within our industry. With that came the opportunity for quick career growth as new teams and positions became necessary, most notably within the Marketplace department. 

As of the last few years, I would say that Houzz has entered a more stabilized state. No longer considered a startup, we’ve more or less established our inner structure and departments. Career progression has normalized, with more time to deeply develop within a role.

Pros:
Very strong female leadership (and leadership in general). 
Great office perks, PTO, and health benefits. 
The culture and people are unparalleled. 
Prior to COVID-19 and work from home, coming into the office meant a fully stocked kitchen, ergonomic desk setup, and the friendly faces of those who, over the years, have become family. Having worked at other corporate companies, something that still strikes me today is how hard Houzzers pull for each others’ success. I feel this support from the top down.","Historically Houzz has been pretty against remote work, but that may be changing now. Opportunities for career growth at higher levels are less available. 
Individuals have been spreading themselves pretty thin for well over a year, but with COVID-19 that has been greatly exacerbated."

After that, you're supported in the ""Green Houzz"" to ensure you make a smooth transition onto the floor and are able to reinforce the skills you learned. The culture Houzz has created in incredible and I have met some amazing people by working at his company.",With any tech company processes change often. You must be able to adapt with these changes and be open to implementing new processes to ensure youre always prepared.
342,Houzz,"Wonderful company, culture and vision",2020-10-23,5.0,Editorial Staff,"The people are truly great. Super smart and creative, but also nice, encouraging, helpful and empathetic. There's a lot going on at this company -- product launches, redesigns, new initiatives, etc. -- and it's inspiring to see things handled in a low-stress, low-ego way. 

Houzz has always emphasized a welcoming and engaging company culture. A lot of companies do, but here it feels genuine. Even during months of working from home during the pandemic I've felt connected to my team and the company at large. And the encouragement from upper management to take time off is something I've never seen at other companies I've worked for. The health and wellbeing of employees here is clearly important to the company. 

I've always felt like I can pursue what interests me in my work and try new things to keep things fresh. And the company as a whole has always had tremendous stamina for innovation, which keeps things interesting. I've been with Houzz for almost 8 years and there has never been a time when I've felt like the company has taken their foot off the gas pedal. Its constant pursuit of new technology and products for its users and to redefine this industry is what has made it such a successful company — and such a great place to work.","I think with most companies and teams there's usually a feeling that you could use more staff. In an ideal situation, we'd add new team members and contract workers to accelerate growth."
343,Houzz,Great company and great people!,2020-10-23,5.0,Product Designer,"Houzz is truly like a family. With such an amazing group of people and unique product, I was always able to learn from others and have new challenges.
I worked in the TLV site and was in charge of the site and app designs. The teams are well structured and the management is working hard to support and cherish Houzz's employees. 
The TLV site has grown a lot since I joined and there were many growth opportunities for people. The site focusses on design and development and the environment is super technological and dynamic.

351,Houzz,So Worth It!,2020-10-15,5.0,Account Executive,"2020 has been a wild ride and many companies have had to go through difficult transitions and make hard decisions. Houzz is no different. The landscape has changed but I think they have done a great job at making sure it's been as smooth as possible. I know a lot of companies are scaling back product development right now but one thing Houzz is doing that is giving us all tons of confidence is continuing to develop new and exciting offerings to help the people in our industry. This year has really proven how adaptable and innovative Houzz is and it's incredibly exciting to be a part of a company that doesn't shy away from a challenge but rather accept it head on. It doesn't mean it hasn't been hard, but continuing to move forward in times of adversity is very motivating.

Early this year, Houzz made the move to working virtually with all employees working from home. This move was as seamless as possible for how quickly it was done. There were definitely those that criticized decisions that were made, but of those that did, I do not think they would have been able to pull off a transition so quickly themselves. Unfortunately, some of them have left before they were able to see the feedback they gave implemented and the changes they asked for realized. The fact that upper management and senior leadership are still incredibly open to feedback from all employee levels during a difficult time reinforces how much of a family we all are. 

Lastly, if you are looking for a sales job I would strongly consider looking at Houzz. We just started hiring again recently and I'm really happy I took this opportunity when it was presented a few years ago. We are all virtual right now, but you get to work with amazing people, sell something that actually can help the people you are selling to, expand you skillset and grow professionally, all while being part of a company that is a true disruptor.","No real complaints, it's been an awesome journey. Maybe embracing working from home more rather than viewing it as temporary."

It is a great career stepping stone to meeting many people who have gone on to multiple industries and have amazing success stories. Everyone works diligently and hard. I've been thoroughly impressed by the flexibility of the teams to work remotely and to still get things done.

People are genuine who work at this office. Sometimes we have to give one another bad news, sometimes we're overworked, but we recognize it. Our teams don't shy away from the truth, and how to overcome them. I appreciate the transparency.

Houzz is an international company, and during quarantine I have felt closer to my international counterparts than before. We schedule meetings, we share projects, and we learn from one another.

If you step out of your comfort zone (your team), it is pretty easy to meet and connect with people. That kind of bridge allows you to be exposed to so much great knowledge and experience. Some teams I have worked with:

Ops team is one of the most solid I've ever worked with. They adapted, they found amazing ways to bring people together, and all around they are just lovely to hang with. 

Finance team is close knit but open and inclusive, and I don't know any other company where I actually look forward to visits from the finance team. 

SP team is so hardworking, they work some of the longest hours in the company, support so many different offices and teams, and are always communicative. 

IT/SFDC are amazing. End of story, never be rude to IT/SFDC.","Different team goals are not always in alignment. This creates some confusion and disjointed messaging on priorities.

Transparency on mistakes/messaging and goals could use some improvement.

Decisions should always be made, after thorough testing, vetting, and open and honest conversations with all stakeholders. This is being improved upon now, but still has a ways to go."

There have been multiple instances where changes were made but this was never communicated to the CS Team or felt like they considered the implications these changes would have on the CS Team, making a really poor experience for our customers (when we're the ""front line"" servicing customers but are being asked about things that we haven't even been briefed on) as well as negatively impacts employee morale."

I have had fantastic leadership & have always felt heard by them. I also feel that my talents are recognized & I've been given unique opportunities & challenges based on what I've been able to prove - they really put their trust in their people & the results since I have been here have not disappointed. Being in sales is great here as well because the product is outstanding & the training (both as a new hire & continued on throughout your tenure) is top-tier.
Something else I feel will be extremely important in the ""new normal"" is a company's handling of Covid-19. They've shown empathy, grace & have been extremely transparent through one of the most challenging times most companies have faced.

I work with amazing peers and the leadership team is very supportive and eager to see me grow. The company provides all the tools to make sure I can continuously develop my skills. Houzz has created a great sense of community for me and I feel proud to be part of this culture. The product offering also really makes me feel like I'm helping our clients and creating an innovative solution for them to keep growing their businesses.

381,Houzz,We are a family,2020-09-21,5.0,Sales Manager,"I would say the vast majority of the employees at Houzz would agree with me that one of the best parts about working for Houzz is the PEOPLE. I have met some of the most hardworking, caring, intelligent, and passionate individuals at Houzz...many who I would consider to be life long friends. Houzz is also extremely innovative, we care about providing the best technology for our customers and are constantly leading the charge in our industry which is exciting...there's never a dull moment when it comes to product updates (this could be a challenge for some - see cons section). We have a leadership team that truly cares and values their customers - both internal (employees) and external (website users) and they demonstrate this through transparent communication, great perks/contests, quality training programs and conditioned education, and more. As our world has changed and offices are now WFH, many employees have missed some of the perks of working in a Houzz office ( beautiful office space, catered lunch, stocked kitchen, celebrating wins with co-workers, etc.), however, the reality is that you don't work for a company just for the perks (which there are still plenty in a remote environment!), you work for a company because you believe in the product, enjoy the people you work with, and you feel connected to the heartbeat of the mission...and for me, there has never been a shortage of that!","Houzz is a very innovative tech company, constantly updating product and streamlining systems/processes, which requires a high level of adaptability from employees. To me, this is absolutely a pro, but for anyone who doesn't prefer a fast-paced environment it could be seen or experienced as a con."

The teams values and goals are aligned with mine so that's an added bonus. We've certainly come a long way and have much farther to go in building our systems and better processes and this'll keep us busy for awhile which makes the work exciting. I think leadership for the most part understands this but it's also a game of priorities where we can't solve everything at the same time. Knowing this coming in would allow people to stay more patient through the process. Overall a positive environment that values progress than perfection. Allows us to be agile and move quickly.","1)We've grown quickly and fast so some of our processes and approach to situations are catching up (good news at least from my POV several key roles on my team have been filled so we are better prepared to support the business than let's say a year back) 2) Recent budget cuts mean we've had to forego perks and other monetary benefits which means we'll have to systematically prioritize to bring them back 3) Would love to see all groups be eligible for standard benefits like merits, bonuses, promotions etc over time."

I have never worked for a department that is as hardworking and creative. My direct manager and director invested in me, gave me opportunities and pushed me to do my very best.","I don't have cons for working there.

403,Houzz,A Company With Heart,2020-09-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Houzz is an incredible place to work for so many reasons. The two main headliners for me are:

The Product: It is pretty amazing to work for a company that completely transformed an entire industry. From homeowners to home pros, when I tell people that I work at Houzz I almost always get a reaction along the lines of ""No way! I LOVE Houzz!"" It never gets old and gives me such a sense of pride to work for a company that people see so much value in. I also love that our product is always improving. We are continuously pushing to find new or improved ways to make the home remodeling and design process more efficient, streamlined, and fun.

The People: As you can see from so many of the other reviews listed on here as well, the people who work at Houzz are what draw you in and make you want to stay. It is such a supportive community filled with hard working, smart, fun, humble, and inspiring people. One of our core values is that Houzz is Family and it truly does feel like that. An example of this is when my Grandmother passed away who I loved dearly, I came back to the office after the funeral and a whole group of my coworkers had pooled together to have flowers waiting for me on my desk and included heartfelt notes with their condolences/personal antidotes about their own experiences with grandparents. It is little moments like that over the years that make me reflect on how incredibly lucky I am to work at a company (especially these days) that still has heart.",Houzz is always evolving and growing so if you don't like change then working here may not be the best fit for you. But if you do like the idea of continuously getting to learn and grow then Houzz gives you great opportunities to do that.
404,Houzz,Houzz is a Great Place to Work!,2020-09-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I thoroughly enjoy working at Houzz! We have a collaborative and innovative team! You can't beat our culture of winning. Our team consists of talented and hard-working individuals who push each other to be the best they can be. It's a fantastic company to work for.,We are working from home right now and I miss my fellow Houzzers.
405,Houzz,Great Company to be a part of!,2020-09-04,5.0,Senior Sales Manager,Houzz is an amazing place to learn and grow. There has been so much opportunity to advance your career while I have been with Houzz. Even those that have decided to pursue other opportunities have been able to land in a position that would not have been possible prior to their experience at Houzz. Hard work and diligence truly does pay off here. There is a real quality of people that you will enjoy working with as a team every day. Houzz has a unique product offering that is constantly improving and upgrading. To find those attributes in a business while maintaining a quality work/life balance I feel is special.,This is a results driven business so you should expect to drive results. Part of being part of a company like this is the constant of change. You will need to see change as an opportunity.
406,Houzz,Honesty is the Best Policy - A Real Review from a Top Performer,2020-09-02,1.0,Sales Representative,"I’m going to try to keep this review as HONEST, organized and useful as I possibly can - my purpose is NOT to bash this company, but to provide authentic insight and feedback on what it is like working for this company as a sales representative. I hope this can be helpful, as there is a glaringly obvious influx of fake 5-star reviews by Houzz managers due to their recent mass hiring.

The GOOD: I spent about a year and a half working for this company, was a top performer and even received a promotion throughout my time at Houzz. I was absolutely in love with all of the company amenities, events, free lunch, and how I met so many great friends here (who also left.) When you remove the bells and whistles (which were actually removed indefinitely because they cut costs & employees due to the pandemic) what do you have left?

Being a sales representative at Houzz is not a glamorous role, and they are completely transparent about that. They are transparent about the cold calling, hearing “no” frequently, and making hundreds of dials a day - totally normal and expected in an inside sales role.

I would really like to see Houzz reply to my constructive criticism rather than leaving a vague response that only acknowledges the positives.","The BAD: Unfortunately, Houzz is not transparent about the favoritism, overly touched leads, poor management, and severe lack of ethics when it comes to selling. 

To touch on the favoritism, there are a handful of sales representatives who are spoon-fed hot inbound leads which are reportedly ""given equally"" to reps of the same level, but that is extremely far from reality. 

While this select handful of representatives are being handed hot leads and closing at an “inspirationally” high amount, the rest of the company’s reps are left sifting through dirt to hopefully find enough golden nuggets to make enough money to not get fired. 

These same favored representatives who are being fed credit cards on a golden spoon and who do little to no prospecting of their own, are the same people they have sharing pieces of “advice” and “inspiration” at company-wide meetings on how the rest of the reps should be prospecting and closing our COMPLETELY different leads. 

The leads that are given to over 85% of the representatives are overly touched to say the least. They are called hundreds of times by several Houzz reps per year, for the past 4-6 years. Management will try to teach you tips and tricks on how to close prospects who have repeatedly told the company no, have gone through multiple presentations, and have repeatedly asked to be removed from the calling list, HOWEVER, the chances of you closing the small handful of people who will agree to another Houzz call, are slim to none.

The UGLY: Houzz’s selling techniques are extremely aggressive to the point that it feels uncomfortable and wrong. A prospect could tell you they can’t afford groceries, had to lay off half of their crew, and their wife died from cancer but it doesn’t matter to Houzz, you should still try to force this small business to spend hundreds of dollars per month on something that may or may not work for them because of the small odds that it could “help their situation.” For example, one representative convinced a prospect to literally sell their car to pay for our program in the middle of a pandemic.

In fact, in company meetings, they openly discuss how “hey it may not work for everyone, but if it works for someone here or there - we did something good, right?” That is not ethical or transparent selling, I felt as though I was so pressured to take someone’s money even if they weren’t a good fit, because I was so stressed to actually make a sale out of the garbage leads they give us when I was given the rare chance to close. Also, because our managers are listening in on the calls and telling us to “not let them off the phone and to just close them.” 

Houzz has such desperate selling techniques because it is so rare to find someone who will actually consider pulling out their wallets for this product. Because of this, they train you to grab that wallet before the prospect can even think twice on evaluating a very serious purchase for their business. If you genuinely value selling a product you can stand behind and genuinely want to help people, this is not the company for you."
407,Houzz,Great place to work!,2020-09-01,5.0,Data Operations,"Great benefits, including a health benefit, tuition reimbursement, breakfasts on Mondays and lunches on Fridays, great events and culture, ongoing training, mentorship, dog friendly office, frequent check-ins with employees about what can be done better",It's a global company headquartered in the US - the international part of the business can sometimes feel like it gets dragged behind.
408,Houzz,Great company culture and career progression!,2020-09-01,5.0,Strategic Account Executive,Great work life balance and benefits. Incredible people and company culture. Amazing office spaces and now the option to work remotely! Sales roles are leveled out to give reps the options to climb the ranks.,"As a growing company things are constantly changing and evolving. This can be a con for some. I personally enjoy the growth and change - it makes things more exciting for me, but I know that’s not for everyone."
409,Houzz,Make an impact,2020-08-28,5.0,Branding & Communications,"- At Houzz, you have the opportunity to truly make an impact. Ideas for new tools, products, projects, etc. come from all teams and levels at the company. There are opportunities for personal and professional growth. 
- The best team and company culture I know of - fun, friendly office environment (and programs during SIP!), great work/life balance, minimal office politics. 
- Great product - telling people you work at Houzz and hearing their stories of using it for their home projects is the best!","Great environment for self-starters, but isn't the right fit for everyone."
410,Houzz,A Great Challenge|  For Those Who Like That,2020-08-27,5.0,Senior Client Success Manager,"Houzz is a great place if you're a high ambitioned professional looking for a challenge. All my coworkers support each other and people like to see each other win here. We've always had great perks like lunch on Fridays, but even so with Covid the team has been coming up with creative ways to help keep the culture that is Houzz.","You will work hard. This is not a laid back, check-out type of position. It's full of different types of customers . Those that strive best I think are those with a strong work ethic, great people skills, and a strong results-oriented mindset. If you don't think these are your strong suits, I wouldn't recommend this particular position."
411,Houzz,Hard but rewarding,2020-08-27,4.0,Client Success Manager,"The position itself is stable, It's easier to maintain stability as a CSM than as a salesperson since we don't have the stress of generating new business because we're supporting an existing book of business and have a relationship with the clients.

The job is done within business hours and has a good work/life balance. We never work after hours.

We get to have control over our meeting schedule, so we can block off times between calls to recover and not end up having multiple back to back calls.","The work never ends. An average book of business is 350-400 accounts and there are always clients that need assistance with something or those who want to cancel the service.

Since we are in charge of retention, a large portion of calls tend to be on the negative side with unhappy clients, and some days are mentally tough.

The job has a wide range of responsibilities, and sometimes it's hard to navigate between all the different roles, especially since the company is very dynamic and there are constant changes."
412,Houzz,A Dynamic Work Environment with Endless Growth Opportunities,2020-08-27,5.0,Client Services Manager (CSM),"There are SO MANY value propositions that Houzz offers to their employees, from the unparalleled company culture, to an ""open door"" policy that enables you to be radically transparent with upper management. This is how a company grows, and effectively retain employees in my opinion. I feel like my voice is heard due to this fostering environment that Houzz promotes, and this makes me committed to help digitize the home improvement industry. My workdays at Houzz never get mundane, and the work I do feels meaningful. I've jotted down my overall experience coupled with some great takeaways I've had with the company.... 

My onboarding experience with Houzz contributed to all the work milestones I hit within the Client Success channel. You can tell that they invest HEAVILY into Learning and Development, and it pays off dividends (not to mentioned, you'll have continued education from the L&D department). I had all the resources coming out of my two-week training camp, to quickly acclimate into the role of a CSM. My advice for incoming CSM hires, is to take this ""boot camp"" seriously if you want to be successful with the company. You wear MANY hats in this role, and have to be versatile & self-sufficient at times. Bring your A-game, ask a lot of questions and retain as much information as you can (be a sponge). 

Once you've completed your training camp, you're on the way to hit the floor! Long story short, I've learned how to provide value and build meaningful relationships with the clientele that I work with. You will develop new skillset(s) throughout your journey in the Client Success role, and this is by far my largest takeaway from working at Houzz. 

The management team is another reason why I'm happy to be a part of this dynamic company. From your direct Manager to the VP of Sales, you are encouraged/welcomed to ask questions and speak your mind. We've had so many company initiatives, and built a more effective company roadmap, because management actually hears us out. Also, no one has an office, even our directors of the company. You can literally walk to their workspace and ask questions, they're super receptive and encourage employees to do this. 

Of course, top performers of the company will be recognized. If you put in the work and yield results, you'll be put in front of upper management from multiple departments. This is where you can provide your insight(s) and also hear directly from upper management on the trajectory of the company overall. I've found these meetings to be super motivating, and also put me in a position to advance into a more senior role. 

The company culture is the cherry on top. In short, it's AWESOME... You dress casual, and we have workout Wednesdays every week! The workspace is super vibrant, with themed conference rooms for you to visit or host meetings in. We have catered lunch every Fridays, coupled with two kitchens that are fully stocked (I typically start my days with 2 scrambled eggs and a nitro cold brew coffee). Also, management makes it a point to celebrate your birthday and/or personal milestones in life. You feel welcomed and motivated to work here from the uplifting company culture.","The biggest challenge with working for such a dynamic tech company, is that your role will be constantly evolving. If you're not adapting, you will be left in the dark, and your numbers will reflect this. Luckily, you have the support of your work colleagues coupled with management, to ensure you are evolving and adapting with new company initiatives & product updates."

Also some extra ""spiffs"" like gift cards... when you hit goals. I liked the people and I liked going to work everyday.  Very cool/modern offices with game rooms etc...","It's a big organization and they have to consider the bottom line. That's probably true most places.  On a few occasions they over-hired and then chopped salaries or cut headcount dramatically because they miscalculated the need. Recently,  a lot of focus on their planned IPO for 2020. In 2019 they started cutting back to make the IPO look good. This is understandable to an extent. Of course it's just business. They did offer generous severances.. but firing people, not due to performance, but to cut costs so your IPO might be more financially successful is something the owners and investors will have to live with.   You hired those employees and made a commitment. Some had families.  (I, personally was not directly affected by this specific issue btw, but some friends were)."

Mostly young employees so it feels like an extension of college.,"Due to the young employees, not a lot of experience in management roles at the team level. Not a very transparent culture. Managers used an approach where they would keep tabs of everything you did, messages sent, bathroom breaks, chats, etc. but rather than having a conversation, you would get mysterious chats about how they saw your phone on a break status so they switched you back to ready to receive calls. The problem with this was that if you actually were taking a bathroom break, you come back to a phone ringing and your performance bonus dropping because of missed calls. Conflict resolution could be improved with more direct communication."

458,Houzz,Post Covid Experiences,2020-05-27,5.0,Consumer,"Like most tech companies, the last few months have forced the company to really think through its priorities and act on them swiftly. Here is what I've experienced relative to my experiences in other companies having to undergo changes: 

- Little to no discernible politics. No posturing, no power struggles, no kingdom building. Everyone top to bottom just wants to do the right thing for the business 
- Lots of debates but with a healthy level of respect. With a much smaller organization managing a larger workload, everyone seems to trust that everyone has the company's interests in mind. Not to mention that everyone is actually very nice. 
- There is a lot of work to be done and it's fulfilling. The impact is immediate and it's easy to see the value you bring to the org as a result","The company isn't for everyone. The reporting structure is an ongoing matrix, you need to have a deep understanding of your perspectives and be able to defend them logically, and everything needs to be maniacally prioritized. All the cons of a larger organization like the politics and the excess amount of time people have to get things done don't exist at Houzz. But all the luxuries around a larger organization like significant budgets and resourcing don't exist at Houzz as well, especially now."

You were cold calling unqualified leads and became sleazy sales people just trying to make a sale. There was favoritism, cliques and micro managers that were over your shoulder all day. You felt like you were in a sorority. On top of that, if houzz paid next to none for the hours and effort we worked."
471,Houzz,Proud to Work Here,2020-04-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"As it has been said time and time again, the  people at Houzz are truly a joy to work with everyday. I am consistently surprised by the amount of talented, driven, innovative, supportive, and intelligent people that I am surrounded by. 

Just like in any company, people can become overly critical of their leaders and others in general. Reading some of the reviews written on here are surprising, but I think a lot of it comes from the fact that individuals fail to put themselves in other's shoes and lack empathy. Just because someone higher up than you makes a decision that you disagree with, it doesn't mean they don't care about you/only care about the money. A lot of this comes from a lack of maturity, but people will learn over time.

I'm actually very impressed with how the company has handled the COVID-19 situation. While some may be critical of the length of time it took for the entire company to go into a full work from home mode, I honestly think the company was doing the best they could. It's not as if Houzz saw this coming, this entire situation is so out of left field. They scrambled as quick as possible to scale everything, so I appreciate that. I can only imagine how much of a logistical nightmare that was. 

This week was obviously very tough for the company, as they had to lay off the largest number of Houzzers at once that I've ever seen. I have been fortunate enough to have worked in several departments, so I have various connections/friends and it is sad yet also encouraging to see how this week's layoffs have affected people. It is amazing to see the level of empathy that my peers have had for our friends that were let go, and I think that speaks to the family culture we have all helped build over the years. It is truly heartbreaking to see my friends who have also been here for 5, 6, 7, years be forced to go, and people are shocked/sad/upset, but everyone understands this was unavoidable. It's not as if we are the only company dealing with circumstances out of our control. I am especially proud of how the leaders of our company handled this situation...things were well communicated, people were met with privately when told it was their last day, and people are being given generous packages. I have had my fair share of frustrations with decisions in the past, but I have nothing critical to share in regards to this. I truly just have respect and compassion for the people who had to make these tough decisions and lead these conversations. 

The day after this all happened, our CEO addressed the company in a live video call to provide context on how they came to this decision. She was concise, direct, and gave us only the necessary information as well as a plan to move forward. You could tell she was visibly upset by having to have made the call to let go of people, as she choked up multiple times. I have been with Houzz for a long time, and have never seen this level of emotion from her. It made the video call feel much more intimate and that we were all in this together. It truly meant a lot to see that she was also as equally upset as we were. 

There are many obvious perks to working at Houzz: the snacks/food, modern office space, fun events, AMAZING health benefits....but times like these remind me why I've stuck around. At our core I know that the company cares about each of us individually, wants us to succeed, and wants to us champion the Houzz mission.","Every company has its areas of opportunity. My ""cons"" at Houzz are lack of career advancement/promotion opportunities (which I understand is complicated, you can't just make up a role so that someone can get promoted and it speaks to the company that people in higher positions don't want to leave); a lot of people in upper management happened to be ""in at the right time"" and lack leadership skills and I know it would be widely appreciated if those individuals worked with their own leaders to develop those skills more; and I do feel that many individuals aren't being properly compensated for the amount of work they are doing/the massive contribution they are making to the company."

475,Houzz,Houzz Response to Corona Outbreak - Thank you!,2020-04-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Our office began working from home in the first wave because our area was one of the most impacted early on, and local authorities began issuing shelter in place orders. At no time did I feel unsupported by my manager or team in needing to prioritize health and concern for my extended household - especially those with underlying health conditions over being in the office. 

Many roles in our office were not dependent on systems requiring you to be physically in the office, so there were teams and employees that began working remotely a bit before local guidelines dictated and that was absolutely supported. 

It was a relatively easy transition to setting up virtual meetings instead of in-person meetings, and because we have multiple offices and people who work with teams in other locations regularly, we were lucky that we already had the foundation for this in place. 

Our office and people services team have done an amazing job in trying to keep people engaged with colleagues through games, contests, etc. This is especially appreciated by those that are even more isolated because they live alone and are not getting to see people in person. It's so important to keep those human connections when we are in the middle of such a weird time. 

We receive regular updates on office status and news from our leadership with is super helpful in not getting into a spiral of worry because the world feels so uncertain. 

Thanks also to coworkers who have really stepped up and embraced working remotely so projects can keep moving forward. You guys are killing it.",I actually miss my commute for separating work / home life.

The leadership team is amazing too, they are great mentors, they encourage you to push yourself to achieve your goals, to continue learning new skills and growing in your career. They make you feel part of the company’s mission and business strategy.

Besides that, what I am really appreciate about working at Houzz is how much the company cares about giving first class ongoing training to employees. We are very lucky to have access to very comprehensive career development, progression and training programmes that help us to continue evolving and growing in our careers.",Nothing to add at this moment!
477,Houzz,A Joke,2020-04-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"As many previous reviews stated, you will make LIFE LONG friends here.  Your coworkers are amazing, no doubt about that. You are going to meet people here who are hardworking , innovative and ultimately, deserve better. many previous reviews stated, you will make LIFE LONG friends here.  Your coworkers are amazing, no doubt about that. You are going to meet people here who are hardworking , innovative, and ultimately, deserve better.","BUCKLE UP.  A lot of what I am going to say will sound redundant because it's been mentioned time after time in previous reviews.. But nonetheless, if you are considering Houzz as an employer PLEASE I beg you, take these reviews into consideration. Do not make the same mistake I did.

First off, the office perks -- cute decor, fun monthly activities, and free food will soon hold no value to you when you realize you are being severely underpaid- (they claim it's due to the preparation for the IPO) however frivolous amounts are still being spent towards unnecessary fluff around the office-- INCLUDING perks in the virtual office (podcast they spend company money on producing while working from home that no one, I repeat NO ONE listens to).

As a sales rep, your time here will include: Countless company/channel meetings where they spoon feed you the same uninspired motivational speeches based around the performances of the same 10 reps who receive all the hot inbound leads. Meanwhile, the rest of the sales floor is calling the same leads TIME AFTER TIME that have been recycled over the last 10 years. This is to the point where you will call a lead for the first time and they will curse at you when you even mention the word ""Houzz"" (great reputation).  Your managers will tell you not to put anyone on a DNC list, instructing you to reply with ""we are not calling from a list.. you have a profile"" -- one they have not used in years and probably didn't even consent to.
In fact, every morning I have about 5 new hate emails or voicemails telling me to F off or that our company is criminal for refusing to stop harassing them numerous times throughout the years. Your manager will tell you to try calling them instead of retiring the account when you bring it to to their attention.

That brings me to MANAGEMENT. Oh yes, a popular topic among every negative Houzz review, and for a REASON! Let me tell you, I have no idea why Houzz decides to promote internally for sales managers. These are individuals with ZERO prior experience in management. Just because someone is good at selling a product does NOT mean they will be good at leading a sales team.

The managers at Houzz are incompetent at best, they force you to do ridiculous and child like activities every morning that are simply a waste of time and an insult. If you enjoy being micromanaged and criticized on every single call by a twenty something year old who sold a product in it's early stages (before the leads had been called time after time for 10 years straight) then this is the place for you.  

They claim ""we are a family"" but will write you up for every single time card violation POSSIBLE. This includes when you are MEDICALLY ILL and have a doctor's note. Not enough PTO?  Written up, even if you are physically unwell.  Worried about getting the COVID-19 when EVERY OTHER COMPANY in the BUILDING has been dismissed to WFH? SORRY, your, manager will shame you for not being a team player, and then the VP will email you a generic link to a CDC article with basic tips on prevention.

What a joke! This company does NOT care for it's employees, and it's only going downhill from here. They boast giving stock to reps being promoted when in reality, it's as fake as all of Houzz's empty promises- what I would equate to being as valuable as MONOPOLY MONEY.

Run, run far!  P.S. If you made it this far, I had one amazing manager during my time here. Also, Learning and Development Team is GREAT (I guess it has to be when you are selling a flawed product that does not work). Aside from that, they are all fake and you are just a number to them."
478,Houzz,Cares More About Money than People,2020-04-09,2.0,Customer Success Manager,"Great people (except leadership,) cool workspace, everything is Apple, stocked kitchen","It was a great place to start working at, however, things got worse as time went on. During the first quarter, I did not hit the expected goals for a CSM 1 and because of this, I was placed on a temporary probationary period. To end this probation I had to hit three sets of numbers: cancellations, renewals, and add ons. I was able to hit 2 out of 3 with cancellations being the one I could not hit. To give you an idea when an account goes to the customer success manager they are responsible for all aspects of the account. So if an account decides the program is not for them or they were lied to by the sales executive (which happened a lot) they would cancel their credit card and then the account would eventually fall off, going against your cancellation allowance. Some of these accounts went immediately into cancellation as soon as the CSM would get them and they would refuse to respond to any correspondence. So accounts would cancel that you would have absolutely no control over. Another piece of the cancellations would come from accounts who were not getting what they expected and they want to cancel. Because Houzz has no cancellation policy on new accounts I would tell them they could not cancel, they would then demand to speak with the manager and most times the manager would allow them to cancel, with that account again going against your cancellation policy. So even though I was doing everything correctly accounts would be added to my cancellation allowance and because if this I was placed on probation. I would say 90% of accounts in my cancellation allowance I had no control over and could not have done anything to keep them from canceling. 

So during this probationary period, I was again expected to hit certain numbers in regards to cancellations and add ons. It should not have been a problem except the coronavirus was just beginning to spread throughout the country. I had accounts calling me saying that they had no cash flow and had to lay off their entire staff. I pretty much forgot about the probation period as I spent all of my time trying to calm accounts down and stop them from canceling. But I was informed that I was still expected to hit these numbers by a certain date. I called the senior manager (we were all working at home at this point) and she did say that it's still an open discussion but ""it would be very hard to find a reason to keep me if I did not hit these numbers.) Really great moral their. So the day comes and I am $750 short on add ons and my cancellation allowance was slightly over and they fired me, in the middle of a global pandemic with the economy pretty much shut down. When a company fires you because you could not get them an extra $750 a month it's clear that they care more about money than actual people. 

I will also echo what other people said here: no sick time is such bs - if you get sick before a vacation you are pretty much screwed and have to be written up because of this. And the pay needs to be more competitive as well, especially when the cost of living in Orange County is so high."

Mass hiring and mass lay offs happen at least once a year. The company goals shift rapidly, and the remaining employees have to scramble to catch up.

-Benefits start day one","Well I don't have to say much because all the reviews have said it for me. Take them all into deep consideration while researching Houzz as they are spot on!! I'll try to keep it short, I don't want to take up too much of my time. Houzz has done me and others wrong in so many twisted and different ways. I started to lose hope and think all sales jobs were like that until I got laid off at Houzz, along with many others, and started working elsewhere, with better pay and commission. Did I mention as an SDR at Houzz you don't get paid commission? Which is in itself absurd. Most of the times, they have given me a little treat (a mini sample size of candy/chocolate for an appointment I've set.) The pay isn't the only thing that's terrible, the undignified treatment, the constant changing of goals, and the micromanagement make it extremely difficult to succeed. Managers will literally sit behind you in a rolling desk and watch over your shoulder for no reason and scold you like high school teachers if you talk for a little bit with your team mates. I can assure you this is not normal and not how it should be. Management has a superiority complex and likes to talk about ""transparency"" all the time, but don't practice it at all. It's all fake rainbows and sunshine. Beware."
483,Houzz,Accountant - UK office,2020-03-13,4.0,Management Accountant,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Houzz, mainly for these reasons:

+ Good team atmosphere and eclectic mix of young, enthusiastic people
+ Company is continuously evolving - new ideas are constantly being introduced and so work is varied and interesting
+ If you are hard-working and dedicated, it is possible to get involved in many different projects
+ Modern office makes a very pleasant working environment - helps keep you motivated and happy at work","These points may have changed since I left, but the following points are some frustrations I had at Houzz:

- I felt like too much weight was placed on how many hours you worked in determining how seriously you were taken. Those that worked longer hours (above the normal 9-6) were given greater consideration, especially if you were more able to work on California hours
- Lack of responsibility passed down from head office to the regional offices made taking initiative harder. Anything other than trivial decisions had to be routed through HO
- Some of the management groups were quite cliquey. One individual in particular that I found this to be a problem with I know has now left, so this may have just been a one-off scenario."
484,Houzz,Houzz vs. COVID-19,2020-03-13,1.0,Account Executive,"Houzz Core Values- ""We're a family, we make things happen, we build a future.""","Where we are: The continued spread of COVID-19 presents employers with an array of unprecedented workforce management and public health challenges. This virus is causing significant business disruptions. Employees find comfort in communication that their company has their best interest in mind, ""we're a family"" after all, right?

How we reacted: Copy/Paste emails from our CEO last Friday and again on March 12th were anything but comforting. It was simply robotic. It included external CDC links, FAQ sheet and wash your hands. The follow up email received shortly after this emotionless address was from our channel VP attempting to soften the blow with an opening statement that said the welfare of our employees was important to him. An obvious attempt to keep calm and carry on. 

Why we are not prepared; September of 2019 it was communicated to our sales channel that working remote is in the works! What exciting news to hear, these felt like encouraging words. Yesterday our CEO put simply, we have teams that are not currently set up for remote work. The teams she was referring to are two revenue generating teams for the company. These teams are deemed superior and valued to the business - the referral money alone for a Sales Rep vs a Support Specialist makes our value obvious. Could you imagine seeing teams all around you head home to ""safely"" work remote while being asking to continue to work on sales floor with well over 250 people for 8 hours a day midst this pandemic crisis?So let's be real, getting the sales teams ready to work remote was never part of any action plan, not in Q3, Q4 or Q1. So here we are, smiling and dialing until COVID-19 hits someone in this office and leadership is forced to take action.

Why I'm upset: This was a huge missed opportunity for Houzz. Good press, happy employees but we aren't prepared. We tout to our customers every day that we are a progressive tech company but here we are with no laptops to send people home with and not enough licenses to operate remote. Trust has been broken, integrity gets an eye roll and there's team animosity. 

Final thought: We're a family until a pandemic affects our bottom line. Oh and our pod is out of hand sanitizer."

It will wear on you, even as a seasoned veteran. You will absolutely be calling people who have been called by another reps within the past month before they were closed out. You will be working leads that have been not only touched, but taken out to pasture. Some of them are not even qualified and they were pulled from social media with no vetting. There will be long periods of time where you make zero sales, so you have to keep your own confidence and self esteem up -- It'll be a gut check, and you'll start to question yourself.

Be prepared to make 85-100 dials a day to accounts that have been called repetitively. There's no real do not call list, so if a business owner asks to be on one, you close the account so they can be called by someone else in a few months.  Dials are of the upmost importance here and I cannot stress that enough. Several people there are calling the same number 10x a day, calling numbers they know are disconnected and just overall having miserable days to hit that number, regardless of talk time.  
Although I asked several times throughout my tenure, still couldn't tell you what it would take to get a promotion from AE2 to AE3, not really sure if the managers know either.
There are tons of inconsistencies from one manager to the next. As soon as you go from training or their 'greenhouzz' to the sales floor the overall message is 'forget everything you learned in training it gets better over here' except it doesn't."

In the close to three years, I've been employed at Houzz Australia, I've been able to take on new roles and challenges, learn new skills (which is super important to me) and make a difference––it's been really rewarding.

506,Houzz,Toxic Work Environment,2020-01-16,1.0,,"The people in the office are by far the best part of the job, met some of my lifelong friends here. The office is beautiful, has great views of the city, and is in a good location. Lunch is catered on Fridays and workout clothes can be worn on Wednesday’s. Benefits are also pretty good.","I don’t even know where to begin. Micromanagement is unbelievable, you will get in trouble for clocking in seconds late or too early (got a warning for clocking in 12 seconds early from lunch). The managers all have desks on wheels so they can roll up in your cubical or sit in your row all day to manage everything you are doing. You will get talked to if you get up and go to the bathroom too often or go to the kitchen. They have an amazing office with ping pong and fully stocked kitchens, but you can’t use them because you will get the employee handbook sent to you about breaks and how often you can be up from your desk. Managers can be across the office and tap into your phone calls without you knowing and will then criticize the way you speak with pros if it isn’t perfect and you’re not following the script. 

They stress when you are hired that they focus on work/life balance and even though they give you pto, they will question you every time you request off even if you have the time. They don’t give you sick time so if you happen to be sick and don’t have the pto, they will write you up which leads to being terminated. 

Most of the managers are amazing and great people but they also have some who are extremely unqualified. Learning and development is a joke, they read word for word off of power-points and when you ask questions they have to “get back to you”, because they don’t have the answer or they will just tell you it’s an irrelevant question. 

Whenever there is an issue in the office, such as management taking girls personal cell phones and syncing them to their laptop, or being too flirty with people in the office; all of this is just swept under the rug instead of being addressed properly so they aren’t faced with a lawsuit and their image isn’t ruined. This company is run by children so things are extremely unprofessional and handled poorly. 

They lay off people like crazy, so if you’re wanting job security, run as fast as you can. They just laid off half the industry solutions team, as well as marketplace and this is the second time this has happened this year. 

They lie to you in your interview. Most people were told they would be on a salary which is not the case at all. You will be so underpaid in this job, you can go anywhere in Nashville and do the same thing and make close to double. We were also told that our day to day would be different, which is also far from true. You can’t even think for yourself in this role, all emails you send are typed up and generated for you, leaving you with zero room for creativity. 

Any positive review you see on here is written by management or the recruiting team because the morale in this office is at an all time low and extremely depressing. The turnover rate is through the roof; 17 people have quit since the holidays if that says anything about this work environment."
507,Houzz,Your Everyday Corporation,2020-01-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- I met some of the most amazing people I have ever known. Houzz does a great job at hiring intelligent, friendly, and like-minded people (only to kick them to the curb later, but I digress).

- Always felt respected and cared for by my direct team leads and managers.
- Stocked kitchen, you won't go hungry.
- Friday lunches, holiday parties, and team bonding events were well-planned and enjoyable.","- No room for upward mobility. Career growth is a pipe-dream at this company.
- Zero transparency. Massive decisions are made for the company with no communication. Sometimes, we were not even told of changes to software, policies, etc. ahead of time and would only know once we ran into an issue.
- False promises left and right from upper management.
- Upper management (by this, I mean people you most likely will never talk to or hardly see in your whole time working here) do not care about you in the slightest. I truly mean, not at all. Do not think in the long run this company cares about anything you have to say or you even you having a job. 

To continue on my last point, the true kicker is going to work every day and hearing ""we are a family"" from upper management non-stop. Sweetie, this is not the Brady Bunch. If I could compare this to any family, it would be the family from the movie ""Hereditary"".  Why you may ask? Simply because they had no problem cutting off the heads of almost every employee. I state this figuratively, but they were the pole and I was the Charlie sticking my darn head out the window. If you have not seen the movie that will make no sense. To explain it better, hundreds of us gave Houzz all of our energy, our sanity, and years of our lives to be laid off with no reasoning or explanation. This is common in many corporations, but I find that Houzz tries to pride themselves on being different. Houzz is no different than any other corporation and you are only a cog in the machine. If you are looking to be treated well in the long run and grow in your career, please do not apply."

Your day to day includes calling 135+ people a day. Yes everyday. Your goals change probably twice a month, nothing is consistent.

The people there are the best part of the job, and the direct management team, as in direct sales managers were great.","To begin, I have never felt more expendable than I did with this job. Upper management, as in management anywhere above the regional manager, is completely out of touch with the Nashville office, more specifically the SDRs. No matter how well you do, or how far above goal you are, it’s never enough. They lie to you during the interview process. Many of us were told it was a salary job with capless commission. It is not salary, and once you start the job you realize that you don’t get any commission unless you get promoted to an AE. Essentially as an SDR you don’t feel like the company sees any value in what you bring to the table. They just had a mass lay off of SDRs, and this is the second mass lay off they have had within the last year. If you want any sense of job security, stay far, far away from Houzz. Also any positive review you see about Houzz, I can guarantee is someone from the management team or recruiting."

512,Houzz,A Houzz with a Weak Foundation,2020-01-09,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The pun invites itself and I will explain to you why. In short, the founders had a brilliant idea, the gumption to see it through and the intelligence to hire the right people to make it a success. Now they need to get out of the way. 

First of all, the pros. Without a doubt the single most positive aspect of working at Houzz are the people. Houzz attracts amazing talent that are also wonderful human beings (for the most part). Retaining these people is another matter and recent losses of talent have been staggering. I have made friends for life at Houzz and for that, I am deeply thankful. It is for their benefit that I truly wish the best for this company. 

Other important positives are the beautifully decorated offices, decent food and transportation benefits. You’ll certainly need that last benefit to make it in one piece and with your sanity intact to and from the most inconvenient location in the Bay Area. You’ll get your head bitten off if you even dare to hint at remote working.","Now for the cons. Take a deep breath and join me, won’t you?

1. The most disturbing and utterly baffling con is the complete and total lack of leadership support for diversity and inclusion. One would assume that in 2020, at a fairly well known interior design tech company, ensconced in the warm embrace of the liberal Bay Area, that I wouldn’t have to warn potential job candidates about this. Well, I do. Please note that I said “leadership support” because the recruiting team is doing their best and is fully on board with D&I, they just don’t receive any support for their efforts from above. The President of the company stated in 2019 (verbatim, I wrote this down at the time because I was so shocked he actually spoke these words in 2019): “Houzz will never do anything publicly to support diversity.” I’m going to leave it at that and not boil your blood with all of the other sordid supporting details. The standard Houzz leadership party line is that “Houzz does not engage in diversity efforts because it is considered ‘political’.” Wake up, we are talking about human rights here. If you care about D&I at your future employer, do not come here because D&I is DOA at Houzz. 

2. The Palo Alto HQ location and aforementioned outright refusal to allow remote working … with one big exception and I will get to that below. If you are going to choose to base your company in Palo Alto, far from anywhere remotely affordable or culturally relevant, then allow for flexibility in where people work. It’s 2020, knowledgeable talent will take their skills elsewhere once this becomes apparent. I’m not suggesting a remote work free for all, you can set boundaries on it such as one or two days per week once you’ve been employed for a year. The biggest rub is the exception I mentioned above; if you are an engineer you can do whatever you want, remote working and truly unlimited PTO included. 

3. Along that vein, the two tiered structure is another con. Houzz is basically two different employers rolled into one. If you work under the President, you have freedom and flexibility to work as you please. If you work under the CEO, well, gird your loins. Prepare to have your very existence questioned any moment you are not at your desk. Prepare to have the most mundane requests scrutinized by her personally. Her lack of empathy is terrifying. Houzz laid off over 100 employees last January, most of whom were based in Europe and she couldn’t even muster the nerve to break the news in person. Instead, they were left with a tone-deaf video call at the end of their workday that was more reminiscent of a hostage video than a remorseful CEO breaking bad news. Questions were not permitted and she couldn’t even inconvenience herself to accommodate the time difference. It’s a business, we all understand that, just run it with a modicum of human compassion when things get rough.  

4. An incompetent “branding and communications” department. If any team needs to be cut it’s this one. These duties should be farmed out to actual professionals because no one can ascertain what they do beyond blatant sycophancy. [Begin heavy sarcasm]. Oh wow, you landed Houzz one tiny reference in a board game that no one has played since the Eisenhower administration! Congratulations on 2 years of hard work. You’re absolutely correct, no one uses Instagram these days, best to avoid any engagement with those pesky kids on there. Our key demographic of boomer midwest Karens and Eileens are going to live forever and keep buying all of the beautiful Trump-branded table lamps available on Houzz marketplace. We are a family … but only internally and we don’t publicly advocate for diversity in said family. [End heavy sarcasm]. I did forget the most important duty of the “branding and communications” team: strong arming unsuspecting people into writing positive reviews after a negative review is published on Glassdoor. So take many of the positive reviews on Glassdoor with a heavy dose of salt. Because attempting to actually deal with the consistent and endemic problems presented in those negative reviews would mean delivering bad news to the founders. 

5. No 401(k) matching. 

6. Pay scales are terrible. Know your worth, do your homework about Bay Area market rates for your position and be firm about it. This will be necessary because if you ever want a raise in the future, you will need another job offer in hand to get it. 

7. PTO policy is a total scam. Houzz will go on and on about “unlimited PTO” but DO NOT FALL FOR IT, it is highly monitored and controlled. It is an attempt at having their cake and eating it too. If you don’t have fixed PTO amounts, you don’t have to pay an employee out upon termination of employment. Any amount of time over X days requires supervisor approval and good luck with that if you are in certain departments. I put in “X” because it depends on your business unit. As noted above, if you are an engineer … the limit does not exist. 

8. The overall culture of secrets and distrust."

Depending on the size of the team you’re on, you’ll probably meet some lifelong friends here. However, your friendship will likely be forged on the foundation of your mutual dissatisfaction with pay and the lack of a reliable career path, as well as the ever-present worry that your role could become unnecessary to the future of Houzz and you’ll be laid off because of it. But don’t worry, there’s cold brew on tap!","For the sake of time, space, and the attention span of those reading, I’m only going to expand on what I believe are the two most significant cons of working here: 1) Horrible pay and 2) Lack of trust in the employer/loss of self-worth as an employee

Let me preface this part of the review by stating that I worked at Houzz for over 3 years with the majority of my tenure spent in a more specialized role. This isn’t a review based on the ups and downs associated with a less consistent position like sales or customer service, or a review of a company that wasn’t what I expected it to be. It’s a true reflection of how things have changed drastically over the course of my time at Houzz (which was a place I saw myself staying long-term) and why I honestly would not feel comfortable recommending a job here to anyone. 

Houzz was the first company I worked for post grad, so it was easy to show up on day one wide-eyed and bushy tailed. The ~culture~ Houzz prides itself was on apparent at every turn. I’m not the first to say that the excitement of a fully stocked kitchen, catered meals, and team events doesn’t last very long. You quickly start to see the surprise coffee cart and holiday décor as less of perks that come with working at a fun company and more as non-essential fluff that’s coming straight out of your paycheck. 

Speaking of your paycheck… or lack thereof. A quick comparison on Glassdoor will show you’re probably being underpaid in comparison to the salary average of your title in whatever city you work in. There are sooo many employees here that work another job in addition to their job at Houzz in order to afford living comfortably in the expensive cities Houzz decides to open up shop in. In my humble opinion, if someone is working 9-5 in a corporate environment at a “well-respected”, “successful”, and GLOBALLY recognized company, they shouldn’t have to have a side hustle or second job to make ends meet. Know that if you work at Houzz, it’s possible that a time might come where you have to consider picking up hours as a server or hostess on the side. If that’s the case though, I’d instead consider picking up and moving to another company — countless others are hiring with better pay. (Edit: I’ve heard through the grapevine that since I left pay has gotten an inch better… still not worth it in my opinion)

As far as feeling like you’re important to the company and its mission... you’re not. Unfortunately, you’re entirely replaceable (even managers/team leads who aren’t top-tier are). And this comes from someone who had been promoted and survived layoffs, so I’m not being spiteful by saying this. After over 3 years at Houzz with plenty of praise and encouragement by managers that my contributions were above and beyond, I was somehow still left feeling that the work I’d done and the impact I’d made weren’t worth anything if they were going to cost Houzz an extra dollar to keep me around.

Case in point: A series of lay-offs at the end of 2018 left me with barely any team, a much larger workload, less support, and little guidance as my manager was one of those let go (told you no one’s safe). Though I was lucky that I survived those cuts, the entire framework of my job had shifted as an outcome. Against my better judgement I ended up staying, working hard to prove my worth and attempting to remain hopeful that in the coming months things would change and I’d get the raise I deserved given the circumstances. Nope. Even after my annual review at the end of Q1 where I was told in so many words that I had excelled on almost every front, I still was left questioning my value to Houzz when a substantial raise or a promotion wasn’t put on the table (they offered me less than 5% increase on a low hourly wage — something like an extra $0.60 per hour — for going “above and beyond what was expected of me”). Unfortunately, this was the last straw and what led me to look for work away from this company.

In conclusion to this well-informed rant, if you’re simply looking for a job, by all means, go for it. But if you’re looking for a career with a company that supports your professional growth and wants to see you succeed within their doors, this ain’t the place.

Note: I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because while I do believe Houzz can do much better in pretty much every facet (don’t get me started on their lack of 401K match and the Big Brother mentality), the individuals I met along the way were fantastic. They deserve(d) much better than what Houzz provided and then took away from them."

I quickly grew in my role with multiple promotions within my department within the first year. 

Once  the dust settled from the excitement of rapid growth at Houzz, I could see clearly what was going on around me.

They quickly build you up in your early tenure to sell you on how amazing the company is to work for, knowing well that they would have you brainwashed and under their control in now time. If you left within your first year, you were one of the lucky ones. For those that were there for 2-3+ years I'm truly sorry. 

The daily routine was walking into the office and sitting down at your desk with the rest of your team at 6:00am, while your manager stroll in no earlier than 9:30am. Once they were in, they would almost immediately go into a room not to be seen for hours on end. This gave us a false sense of autonomy. 

We would attend round table meetings as a team once a week for updates on our progress. These were always fun. Management would pretend to seem interested in our ideas on how to better achieve our team goals, improve processes, and grow within our role. Jokes. Everyone knew those discussions died at the door.

There’s no accountability from upper management who brought in a team of senior account executives promising the world. Most of these people have left, and there were some really talented salespeople among the group. Despite the failure of this no one at the top is held accountable, yet these talented people were. Half of the floor is on blueprint(performance plan) and like 20% of the floor actually hits their quarterly quota. They even had to lower quotas by 25-33% to try to create a winning culture. What growth company lowers goals? They’re hiring a ton and might as well turn the doors into those revolving ones like hotels have. The churn among AEs is absurdly high, management doesn’t seem to care about this, but hey “We’re a Family.”
They give you the leads, which sounds great until you realize they’re terribly vetted. A total crapshoot unless you the top performer who spends her time hanging around the sales planning team. Sales planning is useless, leads come in from profiles created on Houzz which can include accident lawyers or escorts, it’s not hard to vet this garbage. Have fun making 100 dials/day to the same 400 prospects. They want one call closes so bad and offer same day incentives for signing right now by negotiating prices down just to sign up a pro, not holding any value to the product. Once a pro gets off that call and does research of their own they won’t take another call from a Houzz rep. Basically shut down the co-op program, which should really be a focus to bring in growth of national brands and help small businesses launch their online exposure.
Product is terrible, It won’t work for the majority of pros. The reason most renew is because they’re auto-renewed without notice for another 12 month term, without an early termination clause now. This isn’t really communicated on the front end and they most likely aren’t reading the fine print on their contract. Check out the BBB reviews, these reviews paint a really good picture of the pros experience.
CEO is uninspiring, gives the same quarterly speech to show what she thinks is transparency. They’re conflicted trying to IPO, focus only on bringing new pros into a saturated platform without growing the actual user base who will bring business to those paying pros. Their revenue is based on selling marketing but they can’t effectively market their own company. When have you seen or heard a commercial for Houzz?

As such, a lot of management's emphasis is placed on daily activities; dial rates per day, client meetings per day, meetings booked per day etc.... Can quickly feel like you're essentially in a glorified call centre. Little to no 'consultation' done per client because the product is stagnant - you just end up using different aspects of the same core product to push for a sale.

A large chunk of the workforce are consistently late, take long lunches, take an excessive number of sick days and spend an insurmountable amount of time chatting with their friends or on their phones as opposed to actually working. 
As an external management hire it became very clear very quickly that the senior management had no idea of the extent of the toxic behaviours present in their sales teams, and more importantly no plan of how to root them out and correct their culture.

Some of the other sales teams had better performance (and management argued behaviours were also better, but they were really blind to a lot of what went on). In general line managers were in agreement that the overall standard of reps was low and therefore most teams required micro management due to a lack of capacity. There was a need for absolute hand holding, mindless repetition and a tolerance for teams being constantly and openly negative, giving themselves cute nicknames, or playing loudly in the kitchen whilst colleagues were on the phone.

There have been a fair number of internal promotions, but these have not been backed up with enough training/support/development. Houzz therefore have a number of people in positions that they are not qualified or experienced in, leaving them to execute their role poorly. Its great to promote people with great attitudes and potential but you have to EQUIP them to be trainers, managers etc.

The first thing I noticed was the countless empty cubicles.  The reason is because of a very high turnover.  There are people that have been there for more than 6 months without a sale.  
They have ""pre school"" roundups every Monday to get everyone excited to grind the phone for the next 8 hours calling leads that have been pounded. 
There was another clue that I missed when they announce the  daily deals through emails.  What a joke!  Insurance takes a huge bite out of your paycheck.  There is no stocked kitchen.  The 4 step interview process is all smoke and mirrors.  They need young and dumb salespeople to drink the Kool-Aid.

Great operations team that is always putting on office-wide events.,"There is not much opportunity for growth in the company and you are constantly reaching out to companies/ leads from years ago that have constantly said that they are not interested, which leads to my next issue...it is very hard to make any money due to the leads being very old and overly contacted. One lead actually told me, “I feel like I’m being stalked by Houzz.  Please take me off of your call list.”

It is also very very cliquey at Houzz. I had an issue with a manager and was worried about the consequences if I went to HR, due to how close of a relationship they had. I ended up actually having an issue when I left and was going back and forth with HR and after THEY asked If I would like to talk on the phone about the issue, to which I responded yes. They stopped responding to the emails I was sending and never reached out to me. Essentially, it was a slap in the face and basically seemed like they  were saying you are no longer employed here anymore; therefore, we don't really care about what you have to share.

An additional con is the constant revolving door, due to a lot of people being forced to leave quarterly, because they couldn't hit their unrealistic goals/ numbers. From the time I started, until I left; there were promises of better leads, which were never fulfilled.  This is the direct correlation to salespeople not being able to meet their goals.  No joke, 80% of the hires are gone 1-2 quarters after training ends. My co-workers went on to find something better, essentially employment opportunities where upper management actually cares about the employees as individuals, instead of as disposable numbers."

Commission structure is not very typical
Just over the course of a year the environment has become micro managed. When I started we were able to roughly choose when we come in and leave. This allowed us to worked a little bit earlier on some days and get off earlier or come in late and work late. They enforced strict times with 10 minute late rule. I understand the reasoning but it sort of feels like you are being treated like a kid or working a lower level job in retail.
Also lunch is timed weird. The reduced lunch to 30 minutes which isn't terrible but they strictly enforce it. You cannot clock in a second early because the company will get charged. So you need to clock back in a minute after 30 minutes."

Recruiters promise you a career with full growth opportunities. However, they’d rather hire talent from outside of the office than actually promoting people from within. They expect you to make 150 calls a day and hit unrealistic monthly goals with a horrible software and leads.  I was hitting my numbers for 4 months straight until they changed the software and you couldn’t even get somebody on the phone that hasn’t been called by other reps 100 times. You basically do the same boring job every single day. Managers love to micromanage you which make the job function even more miserable. The pay is not that great for how they expect you to perform.

Conflicting decisions from higher ups about what to do/how to carry out specific tasks due to poor communication. Poor documentation leads to lots of questions being asked over slack with limited number of people who know how to answer them. Most of the time your question will be lost in the waterfall of other questions/posts in the channel and you are left to your own devices to figure out a process that was put in place by someone else 

Engineers are focused on their own tasks and do not care much about working as a team to bring a project to completion. Lots of meaningless drivel across the office which lacks professionalism and sometimes leans towards borderline harassment.

576,Houzz,Very disappointing experience!,2019-07-18,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,The company is backed by top VCs and they have some talent was from FAANG.,"-Lack of leadership - The company does a really bad job of training their engineering and product leaders. Most of the engineers report into a single engineering director and there are no real EMs with formal training.  You have people with absolutely no technical background who have been asked to lead the analytics org, there is no HR head in the company so you can't express your concerns to anyone. 

-Most of the PMs here have no technical background so they have unrealistic expectations from engineers and want engineers to reply to them at 1 am at night over slack or email. Some of the PMs even shout on engineers  and have even used curse word in the meetings. They also have a tendency to throw each other under the bus and are mostly trying to suck up to the executives for promotions. They often tend to misrepresent experiment numbers in company meetings.

-The sales org is under a lot of stress and they are given unrealistic targets to meet. There is a high turnover due to the unreasonable targets being setup by management. The small businesses they call are not at all happy with their product. E-commerce business is also not doing well either and they are always just trying to copy Wayfair or Amazon. 

-Their A/B testing infrastructure and other data systems are horrible. Their infrastructure can't scale if there are more than a couple of analysts running queries. Their tables etc are also all wrong as a result often times the numbers presented in meetings are incorrect. 

-The engineering org really lack diversity. Almost 95% of engineers in the Palo Alto office are Chinese who speak to each other in Chinese. Which makes it very hard to communicate and build trust and relationships with your team mates. The mobile team sits completely in Israel which makes product development extremely hard in a mobile first world. 

-A lot of talent has left the company in the last 6-7 months and the moral in the company is quite low."

- ""Fun"" work environment - the people you work with are young and lively (there are downsides to this).
- Company pays for parking (at Nissan Stadium and you have to shuttle over to UBS... there is also a downside to this)
- ""Wellness (i.e. Workout) Wednesday's""
- Summer and Winter Party (there's a downside)
- Technically proficient office - everyone work's on Mac's (no Windows, no Microsoft Office Suite), dual computer screens, limited use of printers, ""click to call"" system (i.e. no dial phones).
- You're whole job doesn't rely solely on you - if you go out of town or get sick and are out, other reps are there to support you/ pull the weight. 
- Wonderful managers - they will be like your family and they do truly care. 
- ""Task Us"" - Overseas call center representatives (pros and cons) significantly lowered the average amount of calls you get per day.
- ""Cool"" office setting - not that you get to enjoy it, you sit in a cubical all day.
- ""Gifts"" - Houzz ""gear"" (honestly, i'd rather have a raise)","- You will never grow - sure you might get a ""promotion"" but 99% of the time its a ""lateral move"" (i.e. no raise) or you'll get a joke of a raise
- Internal positions very rarely come up and if they do, its a vertical move monetary wise.
- You will never be compensated for the hard work you do.
- Customer service is on the bottom of the totem pole of importance (you will be last to get anything, last to be thought of, last to be cared about, etc.) - they call our floor ""the forgotten floor""
- This is many people's first job out of college and you can tell - a lot of unprofessionalism, immature whiny attitudes, temper tantrums, etc.
- Your PTO is your sick days, so I hope you're a healthy person. 
- When applying for an internal position, they don't care how qualified you are. All they care about is if you interview well.  Great people have been looked over for internal positions and given to people who are garbage at their jobs. 
- No yearly raises (this may have changed, but I was there for almost 2 years and never got a penny more for my tenure).
- New (and lower level) representatives were getting paid more than the reps who have been in the office longer/ higher level - in one case management's ""fix"" to this problem was to give someone a pay cut. 
- No security - massive lay-offs (entire departments were required to ""re-apply"" for their own jobs or leave and take severance.  Some didn't have that choice).
- You live an die by your bonus stats (average handle time, average customer satisfaction score, ""schedule adherence"")
- Your Quality Assurance team (who checks your calls, reviews your ""tickets"" and gives you a score based on how they think you did) are under qualified and don't understand what each position does that their scoring for. 
- ""Task Us"" - Overseas call center representatives (pros and cons) - to put it lightly, they don't know what they're doing. Examples: Customer spoke to one who informed her that he ""doesn't know English"". They would keep ""tickets"" until the customer issue was so escalated that by the time it was transferred to you, it was an absolute mess. Incorrect call transfers (because what customer doesn't love being transferred 20 times).
- Higher level management could give two craps about you - they'll ""show face"" when it doesn't matter (i.e. monthly meetings), but when it does (i.e. employees being laid off), they are nowhere to be found. 
- Required to take lunches and breaks at specific times or you get penalized - have fun rushing to the bathroom and eating alone.
- Management's excuse for any complaint or issue you have is, ""well, we are a new company and still figuring things out"" 
- Summer and Winter Party (2-3 drink max - because they like to treat us like children)
- Working weekends (not all the time, but you do.  They claim everyone works the same amount of weekends a month, but in the beginning that was not true).
- You're opinion doesn't matter - your manager will listen to your concerns, but if you are looking for change, trust me it will never happen and management doesn't care what you think. 
- Don't be fooled by the ""fluff"" - Houzz thinks by giving you goodies you'll be content enough where you are at and will never want to move up."

581,Houzz,There is LOTS of room for improvement,2019-07-01,2.0,Sales Representative,High base/benefits day 1/stocked kitchen/good people,Mediocre training. SDR's (appt setters) are trained better then the sales reps. Hot leads not evenly dispursed. The largest revolving door I have ever seen in sales. Way too many fish in a small pond. 17 in my training class 6 left. 4 out of 6 left all have write ups. This company will not hesitate to write you up for whatever reason especially if you get on more tenured reps/management bad side for whatever reason. Attendance policy needs updated especially for those with children.  In terms of the program your selling.... Pro plus can be a great fit for some pros however it is way over priced. Fudging user  numbers to pros in theyre market area is not cool in my book as well as not providing inaccurate lead details to pros. They dont record calls so some reps say whatever to get the sale. Too many reps not enough managers and way too much favoritism. Way too many meetings that take away from management time for the reps.

- You get a Starbucks gift card (for $5 - #SellingYourSoulForPennies) if you write a positive review on a job site similar to this one or social media, screenshot it, and send it to Operations.","- Leadership is so incompetent (like SO incompetent)  that clients won't even consider talking to management because management has NO people skills, nor do they have any idea what's going on. Maybe having a manager to ""manage"" you from another office location isn't the best idea? 

- Fun Fact: You work harder and faster than most of your counterparts/coworkers? No worries! Houzz won't even notice. In fact, that girl who is on her Instagram all day will get just as much credit and pay as you! So sit back and ride the free food train, half the team spends their time in the kitchen anyway.  

- My favorite thing I hear is the salary they promise in sales. I remember I was promised $70-80K and made half that 4 years ago when I worked sales. So can we please stop this nonsense that you'll be making that much?  First off - The salary they promise - Cut it in half. Seriously. The leads you get have been called upon 3-8 times in a year consistently for days. You know those random numbers you get calls from on your phone and ignore? Same thing, what makes you think they will pick up for you? So hitting your goal is never going to happen. If you're good at sales - move on to a different company. At Houzz, you are 100% dispensable - ask the many employees who were laid off right before Christmas this last year. 

- Houzz is BIG on FAMILY and inclusion. This may work when your company is a startup with 10 people, but not when you've scaled to the size it is now. ""We are a family"" means you have NO social life outside of Houzz. You are required to be best friends with all your co-workers. (At least it feels that way). Done with work at 4 pm? Perfect! It's time to workout together. But wait there's more! Let's get drinks together after working out and do this EVERY day. How dare you have friends outside of work.  I remember being swamped with social commitments outside of work not pertaining to Houzz and Management told me I needed to be more of a team player and go out with the team. I'm sorry, not going to happy hour is me not being a ""team player"". I'm sorry, NO FELICIA."

587,Houzz,Houzz as a whole & at its core....problems are company wide & start at the top,2019-06-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The best thing at Houzz is definitely the people I’ve gotten to know and work with. One of the few things they started out doing right is that they hired really great, smart people on the front lines. These people have not only become life long friends, but have been the support and the reason to continue to stay so long, and put up with the daily mishaps that come from the CEO and upper management’s poor decision making and leadership. 

The other great part about the people, is that an increasing amount of employees have reached their breaking point, realizing that Houzz will continue to make the same poor decisions that negatively impact their employees/morale, and have left to better companies and opportunities. They then become great references for you to join them. So many people at Houzz have jumped ship to amazing neighboring companies together. Salesforce did a huge sweep a few years back, then Amazon, and now many are leaving for WeWork. You’ll bond over the Houzz dysfunction together, and help each other get out.","To preface, I have been at Houzz for 5 years, and have experienced extensive time working on different revenue channels and with plenty of teams at the company. In these 5 years, I’ve learned that the same frustrations and problems run company wide, no matter what team you’re on, and it is because it all starts at the top with the CEO. Some blame gets improperly placed on middle management, because employees don’t realize that middle management’s hands are tied, as it is the CEO who is not willing to make the needed changes. 

The “needed changes” I’m referring to are anything ranging from proper salaries (most teams are ridiculously underpaid, but people take jobs to pay their dues or get experience in a new role, and later realize that they won’t be rewarded with a raise, and then leave)….to leadership problems (lots of managers are completely checked out, take advantage of the seniority by coming in late and leaving early, and don’t support their teams) ...to company strategy changing literally every quarter. The ever changing strategy is probably the most frustrating, as teams will have their comp plans, tasks, and work load constantly change. You’re also put in an awkward position with the home professionals, vendors, sellers, etc. you work with, because you hard sell them on the growth and opportunity of a strategy, and then look like a fool when that strategy is no longer in play after a few months. Job security also becomes a worry as you constantly wonder if your job is relevant in the next strategy. Several teams have gone through huge layoffs (almost 200 people total in the past year) due to strategies changing. More and more people, especially those who have been there 3, 4, 5 years or more, have finally reached their limits and left. 

My advice to any experienced, worthy professional who is considering working at Houzz at the company's current stage, is to look elsewhere. First of all, Houzz is incredibly cheap, and you likely won’t get what you could get at another tech company. So many of those veterans who have left, have been getting significant salary increases to do the same job they have been doing at Houzz. Most open executive or senior level positions have been unsuccessfully filled for almost a year, most likely because the offers are so terrible and can’t compete. The standard excuse upper management communicates is that they cannot find someone who fits with the “Houzz culture”. Just so you know, the “Houzz culture” that is so often referred to, is basically being willing to be taken advantage of. Sometimes Houzz will miraculously score a great outside senior hire, because they promise them growth and opportunity. Those people quickly experience regret once they realize how empty that promise is, and how the executives are in over their head and don’t know how to make the right calls. Not only that, but they’ll realize how much they’ll be micromanaged. The smallest, most ridiculous things require approval from the CEO. Literally, there was one point where requests for business cards needed to be approved by the CEO. Also…PSA: Houzz has a strict NO working from home policy. They supposedly are looking into starting a policy (after years of extensive employee complaints…and yes, I really mean years because that’s how much it takes for the CEO to give in to what employees want) but the policy is going to start out as 2 work from home days a QUARTER. If you’re not an entry level applicant, chances are, Houzz won’t be the best place for you long term. 

Aside from the poor business aspects of the company, it’s important to know that the company is a total fraud when it comes to personal company values they pretend to be in line with. Different publications have praised the CEO for being an immigrant and female CEO, and therefore an advocate for women in business, diversity, etc. That image couldn’t be more of a joke. 

On the women in business aspect, aside from the CEO, there are no women on the board of directors. There are only a couple women holding VP titles. International is even worse where there was only 1 female country director among the 7 male country directors for many years. The pay discrepancies between men and women are so sad and embarrassing...there has been knowledge about some male employees earning more than their female managers. Worst of all, one of their main former male executives remained at his position for over 5 YEARS, despite his long and well known reputation of sexual indiscretions in the workplace throughout his entire tenure. I recommend any doubters to ask former and current Houzzers about this. Where there is that much smoke, there is probably a forest fire…and to me, the CEO is a total disgrace for allowing it to continue for so long.

In regards to diversity or inclusion, the company makes little to no effort to celebrate or support those things. Black history month was never acknowledged in past years…this year, they last minute acknowledged it on the very last day of the month. Pride month is also not really celebrated. Last year, they gave out shirts with a rainbow colored Houzz logo, but never outwardly associated it with pride. Sorry, but if you’re gonna support something, support it all the way. It’s so crazy to see so many companies and CEOs take public stands against the different human rights issues going on today by making public donations or supporting on social media. Houzz and their CEO on the other hand, remain silent. They try to run with the other tech companies who actually take REAL stands for or against political issues, but realistically, they choose to remain silent because they are more concerned with their image and money. The “we are a family” core value is constantly mocked by everyone at the company."

-reputable company
-confidence in product 
-management","When Houzz  changed the commission structure basically raising all levels salary, it was all exciting but you can’t get paid out on commission until you’re at 80% to goal. This has been attainable until about 6 months ago. In sum, reps here are making the same or less than they were before this change for a few reasons- the leads used to be way better and they got paid out for their sales entirely. The goals are far from attainable and it’s no secret the majority of the office isn’t pacing to hit goal. 

There is little to no effort in generating the leads for the employees, absolutely no vetting- so you are calling funeral homes and retired professionals.
The top sales reps performing right now are sourcing their own leads in their own time. If you don’t believe it please check the lead type of these sales and tell us otherwise. If this is going to continue, please tell future reps on the job description you are now generating your own leads and sourcing them on your own so it’s no surprise when they learn this is their only shot at not getting a blueprint.

Why are there 100s of leads that are reputable businesses and good chances- that are unassigned? They are literally just sitting waiting to be assigned and contacted. Why is a rep pointing this out and not a sales analyst?

Why do other offices get better opportunities with the inbound leads? 

Why is 95% of the office new from the last year? No retainment of employees of over a year. 

Have you wondered why such a large percentage of the new hires team has left for better opportunities or have been fired because they were scouted poorly? Try less in hiring in masses and focusing on quality employees that are currently here before you lose them all."

For me, the biggest pro is the people. The team at Houzz is made up of smart and driven people who are also nice. It's a leave your ego at the door culture. Houzz is also very outcome-focused versus process-focused, which helps things move quickly and gives employees autonomy. 

Beyond that, another pro is the perks and benefits. In addition to the great benefits package we've always had, the company has recently rolled out a series of additional perks like Heathy at Houzz workout classes, a tuition reimbursement program, and more, which are in response to requests from employees. These are such great programs, and it's wonderful that the company listens to employee requests.","As mentioned, the perks are amazing, but 401(k) contribution matching would be the cherry on top!"

I have personally been promoted multiple times over the course of the past two years, and have been able to witness coworkers almost triple their salary by just moving up the sales levels, over the course of a few years as well.   Growth potential is something that initially sold me on this job, and it has more than exceeded my expectations.","No promotion is ""given"" to you at Houzz.  You definitely have to prove yourself with a combination of sales numbers, attitude, leadership, and experience.  Promotions are not going to come in the first 6 months in the role, because there is a company policy against that, but it is definitely achievable after that, if you are succeeding in all different aspects of the role.  However, If you are someone who wants to grow, but not put in the effort, then this definitely isn't the job for you."

From day one with the company I was treated like family.  It seems that everyone is vested in the success of those around them - which ultimately drives a high performance culture.  Yes you're going to work hard, but you're not going to work longer than your 8-hour shift; the work-life balance here is unprecedented.  Come in, give the best 8-hours you have, leave, and do it all over again.  It's awesome to never have to bring work home or worry about always being on-call. 

The Irvine office has a beautiful aesthetic.  Catered breakfast every Monday, Catered lunch every Friday and free, healthy snacks every day (to be honest, I haven't paid for a lunch since I've been here).  Additionally, the health/vision/dental benefits are OUTSTANDING!

The leadership has a great finger on the pulse in Irvine as well.  Managers are transparent, deliver great feedback, and help you get better.  Senior leadership CARES - this is huge.  They shadow the front-line employees, they value feedback and implement changes.  It's an awesome company and exciting culture to be part-of.  I've never been part of a team where a senior manager rolled up their sleeves and sat with me because they truly cared.  If there is one word to describe management here it's ""caring."" 

Expectations of employees are realistic.  Numbers are achievable.  Training is incredibly robust and meaningful (did I mention they want to see you succeed?). The team spirit here is amazing and it seems like everyone who works here really LOVES working here.  

Things have changed over the years, but they have changed for the better.  As a technology company, they know it's important to stay cutting-edge and the teams here really understand that.  I would recommend this company to anyone who values working hard, having a rewarding job, and fostering growth (both personal and professional).",You may deal with an upset customer from time-to-time but their training and support gives you the tools to handle any situation.  This is a very fair company to work for.

I started my career at Houzz completely enthralled by the website, its vision, the company culture, and what I saw as a huge opportunity for career growth. My naiveté was shattered pretty quickly, as I started to get into the actual job. Houzz has great promises, but ultimately cannot keep them. Management's organization and long term plans seems to not exist. Goals (and compensation) shift almost quarterly, communication from upper management is minimal, and the focus of the company changes regularly. Additionally, while ""We are a family"" is a tagline that Houzz likes to employ, employees are treated more like Cinderella was treated by her step-family. Many employees who were in at Houzz at the right time were promoted quickly, and allowed to coast there without growing, leading, or innovating. Their main purpose seems to be to cheer on Houzz, talk about how incredibly we're doing (while results do not support that), and leave disingenuous reviews online to combat the realistic ones. At the same time many hardworking employees are taken advantage of, told that if you just are willing to work hard at Houzz you can succeed, and then are treated as expendable when the whim of upper management changes and we need to ""refocus""."

627,Houzz,Went Downhill Fast,2019-03-27,2.0,Customer Support Specialist,"The free food is the number one best thing about this place. They cater lunch every Friday and breakfast every Monday. The kitchens are fully stocked and I rarely ever had to go out for lunch or bring mine from home.

It is in a cool location in downtown Nashville with great views, (but the parking sucks, more about that in the ""cons"" section).  

Fun in-office events and perks. The office is super interesting with themed rooms and most of the people are nice.  I met some super great people there. 

The supervisors I worked under were actually good people, one of which I can safely say was the best manager I have ever had.","Sheesh, where do I begin. 

First of all, it pains me to write negative things about this company because it started off as a a pretty good place to work. I mean, it is a call center and the job was customer service but still, it was not terrible and the environment was different and much more relaxed than most. The free food is really nice and they did do a lot of extra small things that made me feel appreciated.

Boy did that change quickly.

First it was the constant change in bonus structure. When I first started, it was decent but they were constantly changing it and it gradually got smaller and smaller. Eventually they added ""adherence"" as one of the points of bonus, literally docking you percentage points when you had to step away from your desk to use the bathroom. Forget it if you are sick, you are just out of luck and your adherence and a good portion of your bonus is out the door for the month.

This leads me to the shift bidding. 

How you perform along with adherence to your schedule, (they literally schedule your two ten minute breaks and they are always inconvenient and poorly spaced) will affect what schedule you get and you will be stuck with it for an entire quarter.

Then there is the lack of growth. 

When I first interviewed, it was emphasized how much growth opportunity there would be. That proved to be untrue. There would occasionally be job postings but rarely were they anything that the average CSS would qualify for and even then they were few and far between.

Then came the layoffs. This is really the worst part.

At one point, earlier in 2018, they began pushing people to go into the Trade department, only to layoff the majority of those who transitioned into that department by the fall. Then again in January, came more layoffs. A ton more and all across the board, nearly all departments, even in the international locations. The thought going around the office was that it was due to the company  preparing to go public and wanting to appear more profitable. Some of the cuts made absolutely no sense and a lot of really good and hard working people were unceremoniously let go. I can tell you from then until I left in late February, the morale such as it was, had thoroughly tanked. They even made the customer service managers reapply and interview for their jobs only to let one of the hardest working and dedicated ones go, leaving some other not so great ones still working. Go figure.

The parking.

In a word, it sucks. You have to park a half mile away from the office in one of the lots at Nissan Stadium. Granted, there are shuttles and the company does provide passes but on cold or rainy days, they fill up fast and some of the drivers need to retake their driving tests. When there were events at the stadium, the lots would be closed for us and  we had to rely on finding our own parking and paying for it, which if you know how parking has gotten downtown, it is not cheap. If you were lucky enough to live in town you could Uber/Lyft or commute in with a co-worker. If you were like me and lived quite a distance outside of town, this just meant you got to pay steeply to park your car.

Then there was the issue of accountability, or lack thereof. 

It is very easy, if you are lazy, to ignore a case and just hope that the customer would call in and that someone else would have to take it from you and clean up your mess. The, ""touch it, take it"" mantra they sing there is not effective and does not hold the not so great reps accountable. You could take the case to your manager and be expected to give a verbal essay on why the rep should have to take the case back, only to be told that you were more than capable of resolving the issue and that they would make the lazy rep's manager aware of it. Yet, the same reps were consistently doing this, causing most to assume that if they were made aware of the issue, they were not held responsible for it, ultimately leaving you with a crappy review which directly affected your bonus.

Honestly, I really feel like I was sold a bucket of gold and got a pile of excrement instead. It really isn't my goal to bash this company but it is my goal to be honest about my experience. Essentially, I would NEVER recommend working here. It was not worth the anxiety and unhappiness it caused me for the nearly two years that I worked at Houzz."

They’ll feed you something good one week then three weeks later turn around and serve oatmeal or cold cereal or fruit.,"Everything.  Low pay, no opportunity for advancement, makes you compete for 1 promotion every year and a half.  Houzz fixes everything with food instead of actual resolutions .  They’ll feed you doughnuts till you die instead of hiring managers with experience and personality and the ability to lead through inspiration.  I cannot tell you how drained I am after trying my best for so long only to be turned down for promotions and opportunities for some arbitrary canned reason.  

This place is extremely cliquey .  They are like high school girls who decide who is cool and who isn’t.  Congratulations if you get to be the prom queen, but in the real world the people who get promoted are promoted on merit, integrity, and performance.  Not at Houzz though.  Just pretend you love The Office and can’t wait to show everyone pictures of your dog and you’ll be a shoe in for a promotion in no time.  Just smile and nod and never ever question anything.  They want people who drink the koolaid, they’re not interested in actual feedback."
629,Houzz,Honesty Hour,2019-03-20,1.0,Customer Support Specialist,"Houzz Nashville is located downtown in the UBS Tower, and the office views are incredible. Our floors are well-decorated and unique, and it’s the coolest space I’ve ever worked in. It’s also nice that Houzz pays for parking as well as a shuttle pass unless a special event is happening at Nissan Stadium. 

Easily the best part about this job is the people. It’s easy to bond with your coworkers over escalated customers and shared workplace frustrations. After moving to Nashville, most of the friends I’ve made have been from work.   

As many reviews have mentioned, the food perks are great! Free breakfast is catered on Monday and free lunch on Friday. The kitchens on each floor are stocked with enough food to make yourself breakfast and lunch even if you don’t bring anything from home. Ops will also sometimes surprise us with treats for different food holidays, and we have quarterly office birthday parties with favorite desserts served. 

Houzz is great about providing random presents: nice Houzz apparel, Java Hut in the office, exercise classes, standing desks, and team bonding outside the office. 

The dress code is fairly casual (jeans) for an office setting, and participation in Workout Wednesday (wearing leggings and other athleisure wear) is encouraged.","Here’s the thing about Houzz. As many cool perks as we have, there’s growing frustration that Houzz hasn’t covered the “basics.” They’re willing to pay for us to run/walk a 5K but refuse to contribute to our 401K. They surprise us with new stuff in the office but seem reluctant to give tenured employees the raises we deserve. They spoil us with nice Christmas presents then lay off 180 people without sufficient explanation, but I assume it’s in order to put us in a better financial situation to go public. 

For most of the time I’ve worked here, Houzz has not offered raises unless it’s with a promotion. As you can imagine, the competition for new roles is fierce, and everyone wants out of customer support and/or off the phones as soon as possible. There’s also too much office politics surrounding the internal hiring process, and it’s honestly discouraging to apply and know that it’s not going to get you anywhere. 

When I started, CSCs made $14 an hour and CSSs made $15 an hour. There were no negotiations and no raise processes in place unless you received the automatic promotion from CSC to CSS or moved to a different role. In the summer of 2018, Houzz hired a new class of CSSs who started at $17 an hour but refused to acknowledge and/or address the wage discrepancy for employees that had been there for over a year. I brought this up to my direct supervisor as well as to his boss, and nothing more was ever said or done about it. It was really great for office morale to find out that new employees are valued at more money per hour than you are. 

After the results of the 2018 employee survey, we were FINALLY promised an employee review (and a raise IF applicable) in quarter one. We were also promised tuition reimbursement in Q1. With the layoffs that happened, we have been left in the dark about the full raise process, yet the employees lucky enough to keep our jobs have taken on additional work. Currently, we are in the process of doing self-evaluations to receive a raise “if applicable,” but the raises certainly won’t take effect in Q1. It’ll probably be the end of Q2 before we see the raise “if applicable” go into effect. 

Speaking of the layoffs… I am glad I didn’t submit this review before all this happened. I’ve never worked for a company that’s laid off employees before, but I know it happens for many different reasons. However, it’s not okay to let your employees come to work, call them into a group meeting, then tell them the number of employees you’re laying off and that a manager will follow up with you. I left that meeting angry, not shocked. (The same restructuring happened to Trade in November, so I was just waiting for it to happen to customer support and sales as well.) I had to return to my desk and go back to work, like nothing was wrong, while a manager walked around and took employees into meetings one by one to inform them they were being let go. The rest of us who remained were left waiting anxiously at our desks for three hours before we finally had a team meeting and were informed that the initial cuts were done. Needless to say, there were plenty of tears across the office while we waited to find out our fate, and you did your customers who were helped on this day a real disservice because they received less than stellar customer service."

642,Houzz,Applier Beware,2019-02-17,2.0,Account Manager,"1) The Houzz platform grew significantly in the four years I worked there, and therefore the brand awareness definitely increased. I liked working for a well-known company. 

2) Houzz does a decent job with their hiring. Some of the members on my team were driven, passionate and huge team players- sharing their knowledge and expertise to help the professional development of their teammates/peers. In addition, some of my coworkers became my very good friends who I still keep in touch with.

3) Houzz had some great perks- breakfast on Mondays and lunch on Fridays, snacks in the kitchen, and themed celebrations for holidays.","1) No recognition for employees who over perform. Compensation payout based on team goals, even though individuals owned their own accounts. This lead to decreased motivation and poor work ethic. In addition, as individual performance was not recognized it eliminated potential for promotions.

2) No transparency. Often times, initiatives were rolled out with little to no warning/reasoning/explanation. In addition, our objectives were constantly changing and the reporting was very limited. Not only were decisions being made very hastily, but there was no data to back those decisions up. 

3) Management- those in management positions had no management experience or training, they were simply in the company at the right time to move up. 

4) Disconnect between Houzz mission statement ""we are a family"" and reality of working for this company. When I had a serious medical issue that resulted in my being out of work, I was required to use my PTO. When I returned to the office that same week (out of necessity as I had no PTO to spare) my manager did not check in with me to see how I was doing or to make sure that I was able to work without issue (i.e. being able to type with a broken wrist). I heard so many similar stories from coworkers. It felt to me that Houzz had a lack of basic humanity - requiring employees to come in when they were sick, had sick family members, or other things going on in their lives. To tout that the company is a ""family"" and then treat your employees like a cog in the wheel felt incredibly hypocritical.

5) To follow up on that point- Houzz had no sick time. This means employees were coming in sick and spreading all sorts of illnesses throughout the office because they could/would not dip into their PTO. As a result, everyone was always sick.

6) The music being blasted on the office wide speakers was distracting, and often inappropriate. Having music constantly blasting did not create a productive work environment.

7) Layoffs- Houzz has had mass layoffs over the last year. Job security is limited. Because goals were based on team performance, high performing individuals who had been with the company for years were not spared."

As with any start-up, the rate of change is exciting but can be blinding and communication can seem muddled or murky at times. It can take some getting used to - you may never get the full picture.

After being promoted numerous times already and more things geared up in the pipeline, I couldn't imagine leaving.  While no company is 100%, Houzz is pretty darn close.  Built on strong values, I appreciate that they make sure every employee is heard and looked after in Sydney. Everyone is extremely close and works together to make things happen. Some of my favourite pers include the social committee who put on events each quarter, workout Wednesday where we are allowed to wear workout closes to work and Friday lunches.

Constantly put SDRs in a position to fail by changing the role and responsibilities every month and wonder why no one performs to their metrics. I was at the company for 11 months and after 4 they hit a reset button on career progression and totally ignored the fact that I was number 1 in the company for those 4 months. Management steam roles their team even telling us that “you could be building mud huts in the rain” when we had an issue. My direct manager was amazing and between her and the team they are the only reason I stayed as long as I did. This company is taking on water and they think that going public will help. I’m telling you. Don’t apply. They prey on recent grads and customer service people without degrees to fill positions until they can bring in the next crew of people as dumb as you were. Please.

Constantly changing procedures.
The steps to solve an issue and what was an approved resolution would change from week to week and it was frequently not communicated to the entire team. 


Steadfast, consistent employees have a tendency to be overlooked for more popular, less dedicated employees.
Apart from the standard medical
Issues and illnesses that come with having a young family, I was there, was late maybe twice, and always followed internal procedures. Consistent high ratings and satisfaction of my customers and yet, there were still servers other employees that were constantly distracted or neglected to do as directed, that were either allowed to continue to do so, or got stern talkings too. 

There was literally a meeting added to one of the many (3+)programs that have to be opened before you can even begin to work, 2 or 3 hours before it was scheduled. I was out the door within an hour of the 15 minute meeting.

You can’t honestly tell me that this was a last minute decision. This is an issue for two reasons. 

1) This could have been on the schedule more than a few hours before. At the very least, you wouldn’t have had entire departments stewing and talking to all of their co-workers desperately hoping it isn’t then or a friend that’s on the block. Especially when you put such emphasis on Houzz being a family. 

2) Such an emphasis is placed on being a family and caring for each other as well as our customers. This situation is not indicative of a company that truly feels this way. Business is it’s own beast, that necessitates hard decisions, and I get that, but this entire situation came across as sneaky when the above atmosphere is such a priority."

This office is almost completely sales so you constantly hear reps cheering on each other's sales and encouraging each other to succeed- there are also lots of incentives and contests on top of the uncapped commission structure

In my interview process, I was promised development and I have seen much of that take effect from a very early point. I respect and trust my manager and know he is committed to helping both me and the team succeed

Work-life balance is definitely valued as all of the sales team members are hourly and never work more than a 40 hour work week and the salaried team members are also strongly encouraged to only work their 40 hours as well

If you are willing to stay on task, follow up with pros when you say you will, remind pros of appointments so they show up, and read a script verbatim if necessary until you get it down then congrats! You have what it takes to be successful at Houzz.

If you want to spend your day looking at instagram, texting your whoevers, and backing down when someone says something like ""I'm not interested"" in an annoyed tone before you've ever even discussed any specifics of why you're calling, then you'll probably wind up leaving a review like the negative ones you see here in a few months, don't waste your time.

This is a multibillion-dollar start-up that will go public in the imminent future, there are no truly cold calls as you only call people participating on the site who have consented to be called in the terms and conditions, the office is super nice with a private deck that can accommodate ~100 people that sees all 4 plates at Petco Park, there are two stocked kitchens that have fruit, vegitables, meat, eggs, bread, and more and cooking stations that you can use whenever you want, there is coffee, including espresso and cold brew on nitro on tap out of a keg available with a drink whatever you want policy, there is also kombucha and tea on nitro on tap, the base salaries are competitive for sales, there is a comprehensive healthcare plan that goes into effect day 1, the sales cycle is short, and you have the opportunity to make good sales and income IMMEDIATELY if you come in ready to grind, I have seen a decent amount of reps earn thousands of dollars in commissions in their first month on the floor in my short tenure.

The product offered has no apples to apples competitor and is a major part of the number one online community for its industry (a >$1 Trillion dollar industry that has come online slower than many others) and the management is very laid back and accommodating relative to other organizations I have been in. So I am just shocked that this is at a 3.5 star at this point. This is a good opportunity for anyone who is willing to work hard and wants to hone their skills in an environment rich with competition, opportunities for advancement, and money to be made.

If you want to focus on selling and honing your skills, not doing account management, clerical tasks, and talking to big clients about their families for hours out of your week, this is a great company to be at.

My manager Claire Pardun is a wonderful, nurturing personality. Claire has been able to provide me with coaching that has made a difference in my average sale here. I like to point this out because I had not found that with any of the companies I have previously worked with and trust me, I asked because I don't believe you can ever stop improving yourself as a sales person. 
My team members are positive, caring, motivated sales people and honestly I have never worked for a company like this. I really enjoy coming to work every day!

Houzz sales environment is fast paced, extremely competitive. If you work here you need to work hard, work smart with the leads your given, have the ability to stay focused, hit your numbers, pitch with integrity and close when it makes sense for Houzz and the business owner.

Houzz is like the Fyre Festival where it’s a huge sinking ship sold on lies that thousands of people have bought into and ultimately got screwed over.  
As an potential employee, Houzz will sell you on: 
- salary that sounds too good to be true
- free food and great perks
- huge opportunities for growth
- transparency
- fun vibrant atmosphere
What you actually get is an oppressive work culture something similar to the novel 1984. What I experienced first hand was: 
- a failing product that leaves you with an option of lying your face off to make a sale or simply failing at your job and being shown the door
- lies built on overly fake and peppy speeches fed down your throat in every sales meeting with an aperitif of workforce gossip all over the salesfloor
I was in the sales team and my colleagues in other departments have had this happen to them: 
- skype calls where your entire department is let go without warning 
- being fired less than two weeks before Christmas
Before you take a job here, I beg of you to take a gander at one single Fyre documentary because this company is run in a similar fashion. Houzz’s product is based on a beautiful cover and the management team lies through their teeth. They will smile to your face and talk about team spirit and bonding, but you’ll soon learn that it was all a facade with nothing to back it up. 
Heads up: Houzz encourages new hires to post positive reviews within their first few days to push down the honest reviews made by employees who have been at the company for more than a few weeks. Don’t let Houzz’s HR shady tactics fool you!"

The leads have been worked so much, there is hardly any chance of closing deals. Management is so out of touch and told to always be positive, there is no real truth or grit to help you succeed. They changed from no quota to you must hit these benchmarks or be fired and a week later cut our base pay $10,000 and increased commission payout 10%. To be blunt, we all knew we were screwed. Everyone started to leave, sometimes even 2+ people a day. Desk cleaned off and the sales floor turned into a ghost town. I stuck it through, but things did not get better. Morale was down, management didn’t talk about the mass exit and told use to focus on hitting quota. 

A new department opened up, and I quickly took the opportunity to internally interview and join the team. Having to take a pay cut to do so. At this point I am making less that what I did straight out of college 5 years ago. In Trade, the team grew from 5 to 50 over night. I knew the same thing was going to happen, and I quickly started the career hunt. After I left the company, they did a mass layoff to Trade, downsized and restructured. I am lucky I left when I did, but you would hope they would learn from their mistakes and stop messing with peoples careers and money."

Great Views of Nashville from UBS Tower","I have worked with Houzz since pretty much the beginning of their Nashville branch. I have seen all of the ups and downs, relocations, company changes, etc. And what I will say is that I have wasted 2 years of my working life. 

Everything I mentioned in the Pros section is honest, but there's more to it behind some of them. The people you meet here are amazing, you will instantly connect with them and hang outside of work. However, they were also fooled just like you by the glamorous office design, the free food, the great location. Nothing compensates for the lack of growth and absence of knowledge in the company during your time here. When you are hired, you will go through training just like any other job, but that will be the extent of learning, no matter how long you're here. You are told to stay in your lane and excel in your position the best you can. You'll find out that once you achieve all that you can achieve, or learn all that you can learn in your position, there is nothing else but repetitive routines and bashing of morale.

When they hire, they promise there is opportunity to grow. Please take me seriously when I say, there is none. Look elsewhere if you want to grow in a career.
The micromanagement is absolutely horrifying. This company does not trust their employees so they review every piece of work you do, check over every second of your time clock (seriously every second, if you clock in 5 seconds late you will be given a written warning, and your monthly bonus will be effected.) And your manager will constantly chat you to follow up on a case that you just worked on 10 minutes ago.
They created a new Professional department with the promise that they will succeed, make more money and help Houzz grow substantially in the marketplace. 4 months later, they decided to close that department and lay off 40+ employees. You can't trust this company and you never know if you're job is safe.

Management will reply to this review just like they do the rest, asking to reach back out and discuss how they can improve. But I've been a very loyal, respectful employee the past 2 years trying to help Houzz improve but they refuse to listen to anyone that isn't an engineer or designer. 
The greatest decision about Houzz is that there is free food. It's pretty sad that is my view after being with the company for so long.

If you watch The Office, this company is exactly like the night shift call center Michael worked at. Just clean your headset and tuck in your chair if you want to leave. They do not care."

Like another person before me I am going to list them out to make them easy to read in case you don't want to read my long essay
*Pay is not what you are told it will be- they recruit and move people across the country to make less than what is told, and we aren't talking about a few dollars, I am talking THOUSANDS of dollars less per year*
*They say they want help improving things, but they don't listen to anything from anyone who knows and has been in the industry*
*They don't promote based on what would be smart or put people who should be in the higher positions in them. They allow the people who are the puppets on a string to be in those jobs because they don't talk back or have any sort of actual opinion (similar to a doll or robot)
*There is zero sense of urgency for things that need to be handled in a short amount of time due to the way the industry works.
*The way processes are done make no sense, and consistently made me want to poke my eyes out*
*Don't expect them to care about you as a person, they don't.  They laid us off via a video meeting in the OC office.
I am not going to spend any more time on this, because you get the idea, they don't deserve another single second of my time.  If you choose to ignore this.... good luck to you.

-Tech support is located in the building (I've worked in places where you would have to call the company's tech support and they would take over your computer screen and try to fix the problem. This was not very efficient

-Team outings","-Houzz is more like high school than it is like a job in alot of ways. For example, there are the popular employees who are there to socialize and gossip and there are the employees that are there to work. The divide is extremely noticeable. If you look or act a certain way or if you are ""fake nice"" with everyone you are one of them.   The leads have favorites who they are more likely to assist. Once the company actually started monitoring things like attendance, phone utilization,and the systems we use a little closer , they could see who was actually working and who was not and not surprisingly, alot of employees were no longer employees. 
-Not all of the managers are trained the same. There are some who are extremely knowledgeable and helpful and there are a few who have very little knowledge of the system that we use. A team is only as strong as their leader and if the leader is not strong, how can upper management expect them to effectively lead their team members.
-Micromanagement from some managers
-Fake sense of family and togetherness
-Young managers who have never managed before this job  in charge of others
-Office moves far too frequently
-Long drawn out company meetings that could have been an email
-horrible tasting coffee in the break rooms

Good benefits 
Events
Good friends","No common sense
No sense of urgency 
Lack of communication 
Being treated as a number
Houzz does not like people who think differently or push boundaries = won’t get promoted
Tolerates low-performance
People are not motivated 
Inexperienced management 

1/ “See the case, take the case” must be the stupidest and most frustrating rule ever. 

So, you do your very best to touch and work on ALL your cases every single day (even when WFW dumps 40 untouched cases & reassigns on Monday on top of getting back to back calls). But then let’s say you get an angry customer on the phone because the rep who was “working” on that case didn’t do anything for 3 days.. Well... you get to take over the case & of course get the bad review when you solve the case under your name. 

What happens to the rep who didn’t do anything / being lazy etc? Nothing. They maybe get a “serious” conversation LOL they will tell you that you cannot assume that the rep was being lazy, “it’s not black and white”, “there is a customer on the other line who needs help, you have to take the case”, “who can handle it best at this point?” 

Please tell me why should I work my heart out? 

That rule definitely helps reps who don’t want to work. You get a case that looks messy or complicated? No problem, don’t touch it. You know the customer will call and the lucky rep who gets that call will have to take over anyway. And let’s be honest, that rule helps managers do less work.

It’s downright debilitating to a high achiever. Is that a standard here? No thanks.

2/ They will ask you to help on “projects” if you have good numbers. 

Ok that’s fine but what do I get? 
A raise? No. 
A promotion? No. 

Worse, the projects may actually hurt your numbers. 

* Glitch in our systems - we do not receive notifications from customers when their items arrived damaged/defective etc. Some have been waiting for weeks to hear from us. Can you contact the customers and assist? 

Oh sure let me call the customers 2 weeks after their items arrived damaged and hope that I won’t get yelled at. Oh also, who solve those cases? What do you mean what do I mean? Dude, common sense... do you really think customers are happy when you call them after 2 weeks? Hum yeah I don’t think so... oh you want me to solve the case under my name? And take the bad review if there is one? 

Wait, why should I help at this point? 

3/ The lack of communication is real 

WFM, HR, upper management don’t know how to communicate with us. 

For example, they will tell you that the 8:30-5 shift will no longer be available the day you are supposed to pick your shift for the next quarter. Hello? Hello? Hello?? 

They will tell you how to use “workday” just minutes before you have to use it to log in.. Oh and don’t forget to log in to salesforce, 8x8, okta & teleopti as well... YES I’m at work honey. 

4/ Culture is more than free food and an awesome office

I need to be surrounded by people (reps and managers) who love what they are doing, who are motivated and who think differently. Only one manager fit that description and her name is Zoe. 


Unfortunately, working at Houzz has been too frustrating for me (& for most of my coworkers). I am ready to move on."

- Gender inequality (despite having a female CEO and more women in the company, all the managers are unqualified men)
- Treat their employees like children
- No brand awareness and terrible reputation within the design industry. Not very well respected by interior designers, architects. Understandably so, as they lie their way to convincing many of them to pay for advertising that doesn't work."

- The coaching, guidance and training put in place is an incredibly supportive environment that also encourages professional as well as personal fulfilment. 
- Your highs are celebrated as a team, as are your lows. 
- There is a strong emphasis on the connection between your mental and physical wellbeing. Employees are shown genuine compassion and empathy when needed and are also provided with suitable support avenues outside of the workplace. 
- The environment is the right balance between risk and reward. You're pushed to be better each and every day without feeling overwhelmed.

Top mgmt has a proven track record and will settle for nothing but the best,"You are either in or your out and if you are out or not good enough, with an open workspace, don’t be surprised to be insulted in front of others. Can be a toxic work environment and though top mgmt (CEO, President, etc) has been very successful, they lack humility and it’s odd to hear them openly call interview candidates or others stupid. It’s surprising of mature adults and if you think this doesn’t trickle down, you would be wrong. Instead of fostering growth, they are quick to hire and fire so even though you may be able to get equity that could be worth a lot in the future, if you aren’t a “superstar” in mgmt’s view, be careful to accept a job offer because you’ll be shown the exit as quick as you were shown the entrance."

685,Houzz,"It's Like High School, But With Cubicles",2018-11-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Just like high school, the job isn't hard, you won't be challenged and you won't learn anything valuable for the real workforce.  When you're done with you exact 8 hour work day,  you'll leave and go to happy hour with some of your coworkers because you are all basking in the misery of working 40 hours a week for a low orange county salary that prohibits you all from affording full priced drinks. 

PROS:
The people:  Houzz hires with the intent to be exclusive. They want to be the jocks and the cheerleaders and for the most part everybody there is between 23-31 years old.  You get to pick your clique and make some pretty good friends that you'll keep once you all get fed up and leave.

Food: The kitchen is stocked with fruit, chips, coffee, bread, eggs, cheese, oatmeal, protein bars, tea, flavored water. Breakfast is catered on Mondays, lunch is catered on Fridays.atered lunch on Fridays. You and your clique can spend 45-60 minutes each morning eating free free food before doing your job.

Benefits: You get great Medical, vision and dental benefits. Probably because they know you can't afford to see a doctor otherwise. The CEO once said she gets the same benefits because it's ""what she believes in,"" so take that as you will.","Everything else.
CONS:

Management: It's a running joke that almost every single manager at Houzz sat in the wrong chair by accident to become ""THE DIRECTOR"" or ""THE MANAGER"" of any given department. What gives a few 25-year-olds the experience to lead a bunch of other 20-something-year-olds? Nothing, except the fact that they probably have nice hair and a nice smile. What do these managers do? Honestly, after three years, I still don't know. What I know they don't do is help their employees. 

Compensation: This isn't worth spending time on. They pay you a dirt minimum HOURLY salary. That means you still have to put in a time card every single day. Want a promotion? Cool! You're not getting paid more. Oh, and annual raises? Never heard of 'em.

Schedule: Some departments have mandatory hours, while others have the liberty to come at their leisure. Only certain departments get  the special treatment to come in when they want, so it sets up for a superiority complex for those who can get to work whenever.
But don't worry, everybody MUST stay for a full 8 hours. Finished early? Cool, don't walk out the door until your 8 hours are up. Not done yet? Go home, you must be here for 8 hours tomorrow and you won't be paid overtime if you stay. 

Growth: The company is NOT set up to support career growth because the incompetent managers have been there for years and will stay because they are getting paid 50%-80% more than everyone else. Here's to hoping one of them gets pregnant or quits! And then maybe you'll be considered to get interviewed internally 4 more times to maybe take their place! Good Luck!

Layoffs: Houzz had 3 different rounds of layoffs between Q4 of 2017 and Q4 of 2018. What does that tell us? Leadership has no real business strategy, they eliminate and rehire because they're focused on short term solutions to long terms problems. Three days before the company holiday party in 2017 an entire department was laid off for the sake of restructuring. In November of 2018 nearly 200 employees were laid off. It's just a mess. 

Work: Let's face it, I worked full-time but only half of my time there was spent working. In high school, all you really did was show up. Welcome to Houzz. You show up, you do your work at a mediocre level, but you're talking to your friends and hanging out most of the time. I'm not kidding when I say people spend an hour getting toast each morning. Then an hour at lunch. Then you go on a 30 minute walk, or two, or four, depending on where your manager sits in relation to you. It's all fun and games until someone notices though, if so you're chained to that 3x3 cubicle forever while you're friends get to play around half the day without you.

While that might sound appealing to some, the truth of the matter is the work is not challenging and when you do try to make improvements or go above and beyond - nobody cares. You won't be recognized for trying to actually do something unlike everybody else. You will not be promoted. You will not be compensated. Sit down, look at your computer and enjoy the poorly brewed Stumptown coffee and you'll collect your pathetic paycheck like everybody else with hardly any transferable skills for your future."

Monday Breakfasts

Kitchen","It's funny to read all of these positive reviews. In my two years at Houzz I met only a handful of people who really loved working for Houzz-- most people refer to Houzz as the Titanic. You know the ship is sinking, and you either decide to stay aboard or jump off. I found that 95% of people felt like Houzz was misleading in their hiring process. I worked with people who were recruited from Boston and California for their positions at Houzz. They were duped in to believing they would make 100k plus in a year. Unfortunately this wasn't true and when the department suffered, these women who were recruited from different areas, were laid off within 8 months of moving. 

Houzz is a great idea in theory. But the website is flawed. As an AE, I was overwhelmed with the pressure to sell a service that no one wants, and ultimately most professionals are unhappy with once they're locked in to a year long commitment. I kept tabs on every account I sold, and while some had few complaints, Houzz CSMs did not reach out as we had suggested, and they were auto renewed after not being in contact with a CSM for an entire year. 

Pay is a major issue that the CEO continues to ignore, regardless of how many ""employee surveys"" we engage in. 

Leadership is mostly flawed. I worked for a director who I didn't meet for 8 months. Management style is really different depending upon your team. You can have really overbearing managers and you can have really great managers it's totally luck of the draw. Don't ask to change managers because they'll push you to leave. 

Anytime you find an issue with a department system, you're approached with defensiveness from all angles. Leadership is hesitant to take on new ideas unless it's one of their own. 

Before I started at Houzz, I read a review that said you will hate your life working here. The only thing you will look forward to is spending time with your colleagues who you'll bond with because your work life is so damaging. I found this to be the most accurate description after working there for 2 years. You'll hate working there. The first 6 months are good, and then you recognize all of the issues, and have difficulty paying for rent. You'll bond over this and you'll find Houzz does hire some of the best women I've ever met. It does become a family."

They're really big on a culture of winning, so there's constant opportunities - specifically in the Industry Solutions sector - to compete in contests for prizes and awards. Their benefits start day 1 which was a huge plus and I would say their benefits played a huge factor in me accepting the job. We have catered breakfast every Monday morning and lunch every Friday. People at Houzz are always willing to help... however there is cons",Pay is tough especially if you're just beginning. There have been a handful of complaints about pay especially because a lot of times employees go above and beyond for the company without the necessary return. In fact many employees left for that reason. Some left because the majority of the company works east coast hours... so if you live on the West coast you will be starting at 6am (this can be a pro as well). There has been times where the company failed to transparent.

700,Houzz,"Excellent company, great people",2018-10-24,5.0,Research Scientist,"First of all, Houzz has its main Engineering site in Palo Alto, CA and a large Sales organization in Irvine, CA.  Employee experience could be very different in two sites/two organizations. I am writing my experience in the engineering side in Palo Alto.

Strong and steady leadership. The founders are in their late forties, they are smart, capable, experienced and mature.  Strategic decisions are made thoughtfully and deliberately, totally opposite of 20 some year old founders chasing the latest  fad which you see a lot in the valley.

The company still has a start up culture where things move relatively fast given it's size. The engineers are pretty strong on the technical side.

The people(again I can only say people on the engineering side) are super nice to work with. I think there are two reasons for this. 1. There are several founding/early engineers who are technically very strong yet very humble. They hired people just like them and the DNA propagated. 2. The company is pre-IPO, the incentive for people is still very simple and aligned,  i.e. work together to build the best product, grow the company and get it to the next stage.","It is in a very traditional industry that is moving online gradually. The company was growing at decent pace, but you won't get explosive early social network type of growth in the short term.  On the other hand, it is a huge market that will be online eventually, the potential is huge if it can be cracked and the company is really in a unique position to crack this market."

-Team and office events are fun and trendy 
-The pay is decent if you’re just getting out of college and have a  ton of roommates 
-Sometimes the drama is so outlandish it’s comical  
-The new Regional Sales Manager in San Diego and new VP of Sales are doing a great job addressing what they can and rebuilding a broken department. In the future, I’m sure the two of them can find an equilibrium it just depends on whether or not you’re okay with your wallet and personal happiness taking a hit along the way.","I’ve waited a while to write this review purely because of what this office has done to my mental health. The people that are in the top tier and doing well (the same five people that win all the contests and trips)  are happy. If you are one of those people, you’ll love it 

-The drama is that of no other. Managers talk poorly of each other and their team members openly. The entire building is one big rumor mill. It will feel like you’re back in college. If your sales are off one month or you aren’t cute and trendy you’ll be treated like the black sheep. 

-Compensation plans change constantly and without warning. Expectations and titles also change constantly. 

-Upper management treats you like children. 

-Your day will consist of calling around 100 professionals who have already been contacted 40 times in the last year. 

-Higher level reps get a lot more “hot leads” that are actually good and because of that, are rewarded with essentially all of the viable leads. Which in theory makes sense, except it means lower level reps are stuck with the hot leads that were never truly interested in the first place and get punished for not closing those. They’re constantly looking at new ways to approach pros but it’s the same pros over and over and after a while it’s just plain embarrassing. 

-Sometimes the office is unintentionally culturally insensitive 

-Those that stay and succeed are a type of human that I simply never want to be. The friends I made along the way at Houzz all came to the same conclusion. This job will give you more anxiety and self-hate than you ever thought a job could. We would compare it to an abusive relationship."

They hire straight out of college and I appreciate this because it gives driven young people otherwise lacking years of work experience an opportunity to dive into the workforce and *hopefully* grow within.","Please note: this review is specific to the Client Success Management channel.

I want to start by saying it saddens me to write this review.  I wanted to be Houzz's number one fan through all the tough times--we were a start up, we were bound to experience hiccups and speed bumps along the way but it was exciting and we believed in the journey so we all put our heads down and pushed through it together. Towards the last year of my employment, I realized I didn't believe in what we were doing or how we were doing it. Possibly worse, I found that our feedback as reps and even the feedback of our direct managers was not being heard and addressed effectively (or with any sense of urgency) which made it very difficult for us to effectively advocate for the best interests of our clients. My moral compass told me to run in the other direction because it seemed there was a growing negative trend: many of the changes I had a hard time swallowing were to the exclusive benefit of Houzz and had a direct negative impact on reps and pros (our clients). I'm going to try to outline the issues as concisely as possible.  I want to be clear, I still believe this is an incredible company that has a ton of opportunity but I was never going to have a loud enough voice from within, so I hope this review will be used to better the CSM channel.

New Sales: I'll keep this brief. We are scraping the bottom of the barrel with leads and it shows in our sales. Furthermore,  we've built a system that consistently rewards AEs for getting the signature and credit card and CSMs are left to clean up the mess. Major issues with new sales include: pro is truly not a fit for what we offer, they are sold into a failing category or an area that consistently under-delivers, they don't realize the importance of their involvement for their own success with it, or more broadly, the expectations were not effectively set from the start.

Product: Roughly 2 years ago we completely changed the product by adding a lead gen element in. This change caused irreparable damage, not because the concept or intention was bad, but because we refused to listen to what pros had to say about the low quality/low budget and fake leads they were receiving as a result.  If time is money, our pros were suddenly wasting substantial time following up with bad leads and this loss of time and increased frustration meant a loss in credibility for Houzz. This shift towards lead gen also created confusion about how to sell the product (AE side) and how to effectively manage clients through their lifecycle (CSM side)...why work on building a compelling profile when you get the same leads either way?  The ""data"" was telling us things were going well, so the direct feedback of pros and reps was ignored for months and now we're seeing the rising volume of cancellations as a result.

Process: Roughly a year ago, we were told that we were going to start exercising auto-renewal. This wouldn't be a problem, had we been transparent about the process change and sent one email out to all our clients telling them this was going to be the new way we manage renewals.  Instead, we were asked to ""not poke the bear"" and avoid triggering conversations about renewal because we wanted to see if anyone would really even notice. There was a distinct assumption made with this decision that pros were truly happy with the program, which given the product changes and various challenges with new sales/expectations outlined above, was not the case. Now people were upset with the leads and even more upset that they have been auto-renewed without notice and CSMs were left to handle it. I and many of my coworkers experienced anxiety (literal panic attacks in some cases) about coming into work because it was so deflating to face these negative conversations day in and day out without any sign of improvement on the forefront. 

Lack of Professional Growth: My professional growth at Houzz was in large part due to the lack of training and structure as I entered into the role. It was trial by fire and I failed often and learned to figure it out on my own as a result. My interests and skills were not nurtured or grown in a real way, despite the mutual efforts of myself and my direct managers. Unfortunately, since it’s not really encouraged to seek out opportunities in other departments, once you hit a dead-end in CSM, the only viable option is to leave.

Leadership: There are some exceptional leaders at Houzz, but unfortunately the best ones don't really have any autonomy. We have a few of what we call ""right time, right place"" managers who moved up the ladder rather quickly, despite their lack of experience and exemplification of any leadership skills. Some leaders rose to the occasion when given the opportunity to advance, others most certainly did not and there was nothing CSMs could do about it since we don't have an opportunity to review our leaders. It's offensive to come into sales meetings (which are largely AE focused) and be told how great things are when our job is largely comprised of cancellations and our paychecks are diminishing as a result. We do not need to be reminded of our great benefits; we need to be addressed like adults and have an honest conversation about the state of the business, victories as well as pain points and the clearly defined actions being taken to make the job and product better. As another reviewer mentioned--benefits don't pay the bills and frankly, Houzz cannot rely on their great benefits and perks to keep people around because it's industry standard in the tech boom to offer perks that keep great talent around. I would argue that reps 1) want to feel the work they do is impactful 2) want to be heard 3) want to feel valued in their role and 4) want to be compensated fairly for controllable job responsibilities. I'd bet if you ran anonymous surveys with the CSM channel, you'd see that is far from the way your reps feel today."

However, since we are now actively hiring for the role, I feel compelled to let the potential candidates know what type of a company and role they’re getting themselves into.

As you’re reading throughout the rest of the reviews, I think you’ll be able to find some common threads across the negative reviews, as well as the positive ones. Management has offered gift cards on multiple occasions to write positive reviews for the company….keep that in mind.

First, I must discuss management at Houzz. As I had mentioned in the pros above, the CSM channel has some strong managers directly leading the teams that truly care about the success and well-being of their reps. Unfortunately, upper management is the opposite. She could care less about the extremely high turnover in our position, how low the channel’s morale is, and how the ineffective product reps are defending everyday isn’t working. She completely disregards the feedback that we have given to try and improve the role. Her lack of responsiveness in regards to all things - including our commissions/paychecks is extremely disturbing. Often times we won’t find out what we were being paid until the day before our paycheck comes...and by often...every month. If they don’t listen or respect outcries from our direct managers, how do you expect them to listen and respect us as reps?

We recently brought on a new member to the leadership team. He doesn’t acknowledge problems within our department and refers to reps as lazy and spoiled.
Now back to the high turnover in this position. Let me tell you a few reasons why all of the top reps are continuing to quit and look for other jobs. About a year ago, they switched the renewal process in our role to an auto-renewal model. Although pros had been having renewal calls for years, we were instructed to not inform them of their upcoming renewal and instead auto-renew their program for an entire year without warning. Although being auto-renewed for a full new term, the cancellation option we give them is paying for another 120 days before being removed. As you can imagine, this has turned our job into a customer service role, where we are no longer servicing accounts, but instead are being yelled at daily by pros demanding to rightfully cancel their programs. Due to the high turnover, our account load has tripled, which gives us even less time to effectively service our accounts. The department that is actively selling the accounts is so desperate to make sales at this point (because all of the leads left are so overworked and awful) that they have resorted to dishonest sales practices in order to hit their goals for the month. They are selling to people that aren’t a fit for the program and then wiping their hands clean once the pro requests to cancel two months in. The pro has already given their billing information, so once they’ve signed on the dotted line, it doesn’t matter to the initial sales rep. Guess whose paycheck it then affects? The CSM that was unfortunately assigned that account. This isn’t few and far between. This happens everyday. We are the only department that is held accountable for anything within this company, including blatant snake oil sales and beta tests where the product ultimately ends up failing. 

Overall, the program that we’re defending everyday is a completely confused product. It’s not being managed the way it’s being sold, and not performing the way that it’s being sold. The disconnect is evident and continues to go unaddressed. The unethical business practices do not help. They coach us not to discuss renewals with the pros and the auto-renewal is hidden and buried within the fine print of the agreement. Run if you have any moral compass.

If you come into the office for an interview and are directed away from certain areas of the pods, it’s because there are so many empty desks and the poor recruiters don’t have a good excuse as to why so many people have left."

725,Houzz,Smoke & Mirrors - Beware,2018-09-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Modern work environment

Decent work/life balance

Health insurance is respectable","The free meals, stocked fridges, and other “complementary"" come at a cost to the employee. No 401K and no paid sick time are just a few examples. Personal appointments are a nightmare to schedule, unless you want to use your vacation time. 

Upward mobility is limited by unrealistic goals and an environment that has you feeling like you are nothing more than a lab rat making cold calls. They frequently change the pay structure, stating that it is “for the benefit of the employee”. Here’s a secret – it’s not! The pay is poor to begin with – there are many other employers out there offering much better starting pay/salaries – get out there and find them! 

The work environment is plagued with favoritism and a ""clique"" like environment. You’ll fit right in if you like to talk about your night out on the town (on a Wednesday night that is). If you enjoy an environment that feels like high school, rather than an environment filled with growing professionals, then this is the place for you!

Management is some of the worst I have seen. The only management is micromanagement. Middle management is primarily young individuals (many in their mid to late twenties) who have virtually no management experience or training. The lack of accountability for managers is nothing short of disturbing. Managers who show up to work late and hungover, yet expect their underlings to be there an hour earlier. Don't forget the “personal” appointments (a.k.a. botox). Where is the accountability here? Where is the professionalism?  Get rid of these managers! This is not the precedent I would want to set for my future managers.

Houzz seems like a great place to work for the first six months, but after the high has worn off you soon realize the work environment is nothing but smoke and mirrors. This is confirmed by the incredibly high turnover rate. If you have a college degree, save your dignity and look elsewhere."

727,Houzz,Thoughts on Houzz,2018-09-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I don't have any pros for this place.,"Where to start? During the interview process Houzz played off the customer support role as one where you may speak to a few customers a day, but mainly you will be emailing customers in regards to inquiries. They should have been upfront in that this is strictly a call center environment. Coming from a previous call center job, I was excited at the process of getting out of that environment and being able to utilize my customer service skills in a less chaotic environment. Boy was I wrong. First of all, Houzz had my training class taking calls after 2 weeks of training with literally no scripts and no idea what to say to customers on the phone while using a computer system we had never operated! Now looking at a tutorial of the system in training doesn't count..

Houzz prides itself on its customer service, but how can I give good customer service when I have 300 emails to answer a day and the expectation is that I ""touch"" every ticket while also taking 70 calls a day? Seems a tad unreasonable don't you think? 

Oh, but you get a monthly bonus! Ha! The bonus maxes out at $300 and the comp plan is constantly changing. I was there for about 6 months and probably had to sign 7 or 8 new comp plans. It's also impossible to get a good bonus because customers are always so upset because they can't get answers. Some customers go 3-5 days without an update because the workload is too much for the reps. 

Now let's talk about the management. How do I put this? Houzz hires managers with absolutely NO experience and No training on management skills. Literally these people are straight out of college from Orange County. Pretty sure I was older than all my managers and had way more customer service experience but of course I couldn't apply to be a manager or have a fair shot at it because they only promote from within. That being said, Houzz only promotes favorites.  Promotions are not given fairly at all.  I would watch co-workers get promoted out of the blue. There would be no job posting, no indication that there was a position open and I had expressed to my team lead several times that I wanted to move up and would be interested if other openings became available. 

I definitely would not recommend anyone work at Houzz. Just apply at any other call center and you'll be better off."

729,Houzz,Honest Customer Service Review,2018-09-05,1.0,Customer Service,You will make some great friends.,"I had been at Houzz for almost two years and used to thoroughly enjoy going to work. I used to give it my all and take on any task given to me, however over the past couple of months the environment became so toxic, it took a toll on me mentally and I just gave up.

Houzz has become such a gossip culture. You can overhear managers and HR talk about reps and meetings they’ve had, which I’m sure should be kept confidential. 

From the beginning Houzz created an unhealthy and unnecessary divide between leadership and reps. When I was promoted, one of the first things I was told is that I could no longer be friends with the coworkers I became close with. It was strongly recommended that I delete any Houzz employees from my social media. That policy has since changed, but the divide has not. 

In a leadership role, I was told numerous times to “lead by example,” yet the example set forth to me was that I could come in and leave whenever I wanted, and openly express that I was bored and didn’t want to do my job. 

Shortly after I put in my resignation (due to another job opportunity), I learned that two managers took bets on when I would quit. I confided in my manager that I was unhappy with the job. So it is comforting to know that when I hated coming to work everyday, she and the other person turned my misery into a game. 

I think one of the most frustrating things, however is when you voice concern, it is ignored until there is a poor review on here. They pride themselves on being proactive, yet are the most reactive company I have ever worked for. They wait until there are major “dumpster fires” before they make change. 

It is easy to see why there is high turnover and such negative reviews from both consumers and employees."

They pride themselves on being proactive, yet are the most reactive company I have ever worked for. They wait until there are major “dumpster fires” before they make change. 

It is easy to see why there is high turnover and such negative reviews from both consumers and employees."
731,Houzz,Account Executive,2018-09-05,5.0,Account Executive,"Houzz cares about it's employees. It has done A LOT recently and have made A LOT of changes to show that. I personally am someone that got to experience some of the turbulent times at Houzz and feel that was largely due to being a start up and figuring out the direction to take the team. Recently we have brought on some great leadership with great experience and now have a clear vision. Whether you want sell and make 100k+ or you want to learn and grow as a leader/professional, Houzz truly has that available to you. 

Great benefits (you pay 0) 
Great perks (catered breakfast and lunch and a full stocked kitchen)",The only Cons I can think of is that sometimes its hard to get to communicate with every employee in the SD office because we are on two floors.

2. Management is the equivalent of 'Mean Girls' in high school. They got on board early and were ""top sellers"" when people were literally calling in with credit card numbers. They love to talk about how hard it was for them too but can't do any better of a job that their current sales team. Houzz lost the best sellers that were managers and who is left are self-entitled, overpaid, lazy bully's that go into offices privately to gossip or online shop/blog and are quick to throw their team under the bus in leadership meetings without taking any personal responsibility.  First take the log out of your own eye so you can remove the speck out of your employees....
3. No opportunity long term

Absolutely no business acumen. Mid level management is inexperienced, or worse, incompetent. Upper level management clearly does not value their employees as they invest nothing in the training or resources, nor do they actually care about perpetuating certifiable lies when trying to find talent for the role. 

You will be given unattainable goals and micromanaged to the minute. They will offer sign on bonuses and moving fees but this is nothing compared to deficit to the salary promised. 

There are no processes, no procedures, no fluidity and there is absolutely no room for free thinkers, innovators or problem solvers. 


The start up “vibe” aka the chaos and volatility would be appropriate if they were still a start up but as they company trying to go public, the inconsistency is unacceptable."

The teams and managers care about each other and that culture is very evident at work. All of our teams partner really well together to ensure that we all succeed, from sales to IT to recruiting. The leadership really cares about making changes when things aren't working, as evidenced by the increase in company holidays and giving us personal days in addition to our PTO. The catered lunches are also so good! Compensation was in line with the industry and the benefits are great.",Continue updating the compensation and commission packages as the market changes to make sure that we are staying competitive.
740,Houzz,Customer Support,2018-08-10,3.0,Customer Support Specialist,"-Hip modern office
-Free breakfast on Mondays and lunch on Friday’s 
-Great people are hired 
-Good benefits","1. In the customer Support Specialist role there are no raises unless you become a lead which can be difficult to get into this position as managers are looking for something very specific. I believe in order to keep great employees there has to be some type of incentive to stay. So many other companies have a year end performance review where a raise is given or some type of bonus. A lot of the internal position “promotions” are actually a pay decrease so at times it feels like there is nothing to work towards which shows in the turnover rate. Dedicated and great employees will stay if they feel like what they are doing is recognized and rewarded. I also would like to add that Houzz now expects us to have to pay to get to work when the parking lot is closed. A lot of my colleagues live over 30 minuets away and this can become very expensive. 

2. The system teleopti that is used now is very strict and can at times feel stressful. You are expected to login at the exact minute and second of your shift, which is pretty impossible. Because of this, I always login a few minutes prior to my shift due to anxiety. I’ve known many people that have been pulled aside or just called out in front of anyone who can hear from a manager about not logging in at 8:30 and 00 seconds. (we are not payed extra for logging in early, I simply choose to do this so I’m not considered late) I believe that a 2-5 minute buffer period should be provided so we can login into three different systems as well as our computer. I also would like to add that a lot of times teleopti seems to cause a lot of errors and no one really ever knows of the data is accurate or not which can affect our bonus. 

3) It has gotten a little bit better but I still hear managers gossip and whisper where anyone can hear about other employees. There are dedicated meeting rooms all across the office on all three floors for managers to talk to us about any issues, or talk to other managers. I find it very unprofessional to still hear constant whispering and I don’t feel like it’s productive. We also notice when managers are late."
741,Houzz,Best Place I've Ever Worked,2018-08-09,5.0,WFM Analyst,"I taught for a year and did small jobs around town before finding Houzz. I've worked my way up the ladder starting at their lowest customer support role. I've never worked in a better work environment! The people are all so nice and helpful and I truly feel like the management wants to see you personally succeed. They understand that when individual employees thrive, so does the company. There's ton's of room for internal growth with the company and some promotions are guaranteed after a certain amount of time, depending on the role of course.

They pay well and are a company that hires a wide range of people, but the mainstay is a young 20s to 30s age range. If you are looking for a fun, laid back, and supportive community, Houzz is the place. Oh, and did I mention they also have a free, fully stocked kitchen, catered breakfasts every Monday, and catered lunches every Friday!?","They are still considered a start-up and are privately owned. I wish they were public because I'd buy stock in them immediately! I wish we had more than 30-minute lunch breaks and that the retirement benefits included matching from the company, but that might change as they get bigger. All of the other benefits they offer are great though! As of the time of this post, there is not a guaranteed annual pay raise for staying in the same position. As you work your way up into newer roles, you make more, but if you stayed in one role for more than a year, you won't be rewarded for your loyalty which is a bit of a bummer."

The lowest level “manager” all the way up to the “directors” are so under qualified  and completely incapable of holding millions of dollars of revenue in their hands. They do not inspire, mentor or lead teams to achieve results. They do not understand business acumen enough to navigate through the complexity of a sales cycle, compensation, results and performance. This is the first major flaw. A sustainable, strong business starts with your leaders- and people want to work for people. Leaders that are seasoned and understand through experience, passion, and the genuine care for others’ success. This is not present with the managers at Houzz. They are not equipped to lead people to success. Instead, they take advantage of their positions, take advantage of their people, and their title. 
Second, the word “transparency.” That’s a bold, big word. Not to be thrown around lightly to follow with every lie in the book. In every meeting, event, email, phone call- people at Houzz love this word. Problem with this is that people take what you say at face value. All the lies to customers. The amount of times I heard this word in meetings- when all the lies were being masked with dessert, trips and free clothes. Be honest. Be kind. Your product is a direct result of your people- and your people are breaking. Some that can’t afford to provide for their families and pay their bills because of all the flawed comp plans. Forced into de-valuing themselves and lying to pay their bills. The scripts and handling objections have merely turned into teaching us to lie, be deceitful, and ruin your relationships with your customers. It’s the only way to get ahead at Houzz. Disgusting. If you could only hear what went on in those walls- all the lies, yelling, cussing and threats by customers that were completely taken advantage of. 
Lastly, the product. Pro+ Platform (Industry Solutions channel)  is such an amazing, intelligent, incredible product. The design, functionality, everything. Or once was. Then, Houzz became too greedy. It became more about dollars then cultivating relationships and Houzz having an impact for our customers. It got bigger then us and it was then ruined. False Data to make a sale, product updates that only benefit Houzz, features taken away that gave credibility in the product. It’s now not sustainable- and all the petitions, reviews and cries for help you see by employees and previous customers are SO warranted. I can’t stress this enough. 
Everything is about going public- on a product that will never last. On a product that is failing and not being improved. And on people that are broken."
748,Houzz,Houzz: The Leading Platform of Lies and False Promises,2018-07-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You’ll probably get complimented on your cute shoes.

You’ll probably get complimented on your cute outfit.

If you the words “ohh myyy gahhdd” and “sooo cuteeee” are in your vocabulary, you’ll fit right in. 

Every 5-star review is fake and written by the same handful of people using the same verbiage (come on managers/recruiters, step your intellectual writing skills up). Don’t think that’s a pro, just wanted to make sure you saw that. 

Working at Houzz makes you really ramp up your job search.","You might want to grab some popcorn because you’re in for a wild (and very truthful)  ride… now, where to begin:

Pay: atrocious and downright disrespectful. The pay at Houzz is by far the lowest in the industry. I was lied to about every compensation plan within every role at Houzz (not to mention, it changes on a monthly basis). As soon as they come out with a new compensation plan, they will quickly adjust it, making it nearly impossible to gauge your average pay. You will be given goals that are unattainable even for the “top reps” (even though they have all left by now). So what if a miracle happens and you hit your goals and you happen to make a livable wage for a month? HA, don’t worry, they will change it for you so that never happens again! Don’t even try to consider a pay raise, the pay you are given will always be decreasing and raises for tenure are never given at Houzz. I repeat, if you stay in the same position for two years, you will never receive a raise. 

Transparency: this word does not exist in Houzz’s vocabulary. There is an unbelievable amount of disconnect between management and employees. Employees do not trust their managers because every single employee knows there is something going on behind the curtains. The managers, directors, and leaders will not tell you anything until it is announced to the public. This makes you feel completely undervalued and not trusted. You are always left wondering “what is the bigger picture behind this?” “I wonder why they are using this strategy instead of another” “why are we doing it this way when there is a much more efficient way of going about this?”

Managers: don’t get me wrong, some are fantastic, intelligent, honest and open. Others are the farthest thing from a manager you could possibly imagine. They will be scrolling through their phones, shopping, and g-chatting all day while their reps are literally struggling to pay their bills. Some are just “yes” people that will never voice your concerns, fight for a raise, or bring up new ideas to the directors (I’ll get to them next, don’t worry). So, there is literally nobody to go to besides your peers for help, guidance, or ideas. 

Directors: like managers, there are some fantastic ones who are personable, smart, caring and dedicated. But man, there is a handful that are downright monsters. Talk about being at the exact right place at the exact right time. They have brought absolutely nothing to the table and have let the sales fall an ungodly amount.  These directors are the definition of false promises and lies. They have created a company-wide morale that is so low, it makes San Quentin Penitentiary look like Disneyland at  Christmas. These directors completely and utterly abuse their power and only care about their core friends and let the entire company fall beneath them. They are paid an ungodly amount for driving the company to the ground. 

CEO: where I think all the problems stem from. Houzz’s turnover rate is so bad that it’s comical. My original statement has been flagged too many times, so I will let your imagination do the talking for my thoughts on her. 

Colleagues: you will meet some fantastic people working here. I have met lifelong friends because when you share the same depression, you become attached easily. But just a heads up, you will be working in a sorority house. The words “like” “omg” “cute” “adorable” “aweeeeee” are among some of the most commonly heard around the office. People will spend countless hours in the kitchen gossiping about the latest Bachelor season (which was fantastic, btw) instead of working. And when these people get back to their desks, the last thing they do is work. If you need help from a different department in completing something, good luck having it done. If it is not on their comp plan, they will not help you one bit and use the saying “sorry that’s not in my goals” over and over again. 

Goals: this somewhat correlates with the whole transparency section, but Houzz is notorious for going 110% all systems forward on one small section. Then a month or two later, completely drop that section and go 110% all systems forward in something completely different. Then another two months, bam, something else. Which leads to your compensation and goals changing on a monthly basis. Take a deep breath, let’s try to scale in an efficient, cost-effective way that doesn’t completely upset and confuse your employees. Upper management, you have monthly/quarterly/yearly goals in mind, please disclose it with your employees so we can see the big picture behind everything. What you’re currently doing only causes confusion and anger among reps on the floor. 

HR: probably one of the bigger jokes at this company. Literally, nothing is kept confidential. You see HR reps sitting in the kitchen more often than not gossiping about employee meetings. If you have a confidential meeting with HR, just know the entire office will know within a few hours."

Less so by the managers and more by the system the company know uses to track time and schedule our breaks and lunches. 

-some of the managers arrive late and it's discouraging to see this as we are held to very high standards 

-morale feels low around here. It seems like there are a lot of changes at once and none of them were explained as much as they should have been

-parking. while it's nice that our downtown parking is paid for, it still takes 15-20 minutes to get from the lot to the building. there are a lot of factors that can affect this which could cause us to be late

-when our lot is shut we are now expected to find our own way to work. I realize it's not required by the company to provide transportation but this can get incredibly expensive

How she wanted Houzz's culture to be just like Zappos and how if you take care of your people and invest in your people you'll never fail... What happened? The exact opposite.

As of right now the ONLY thing this company cares about is going public. If you don't fit into those plans.. you're out. You have 0 job security. They have been laying off entire channels of people at a days end but have the audacity to say ""were hiring like crazy!"" 

The problem with going public.. is you need a good self sustaining product to do so. and guess what..
The Pro+ product is near awful. It was great when it stared and then they got greedy and let anyone with a flip phone and a free profile sign up.  Then they lied to them and sold them on false pretenses, unrealistic expectations, ""lead generation, etc. Things the program simply could not deliver. But hey, we got their credit card and their locked in for a year.. or more. Good luck CSM! because if you don't keep them happy it's coming out of your paycheck! Lose a 200$ account due to a credit card decline? Oh ok well looks like were taking $400 out of your bonus for the month to over compensate for our company loss. You are essentially paying for their poor product and mistakes. As if having to put a smile on your face and lie and defend the product everyday on the phone isn't bad enough.

Houzz ""Industry Solutions"" is simply not sales or marketing. All those position you see available are glorified customer service with fancy titles. It is in fact a call center environment with no real incentives to ""sell"" like it used to once be. There are better options elsewhere.

The management: (Here is where the fairytale part comes in) Imagine you're a brisk 22 year old who just came out of college and you decided to apply at Houzz for an entry level sales position. Well guess what! 1-2 years later you get to slap yourself with a sales manager or director title. In all seriousness, what happened was they got into houzz at the most perfect timing. Where the sales were easy and coming in the boat loads and to the higher ups that seemed to mean that if you can make a sale (when it was so easy) and be a top performer then you now have the skills to manager 10-20+ people with no prior management experience. Good for them! that's incredible and pretty much never heard of outside in the ""real"" world and now they're suffering greatly from it. Not having the skills to develop people and manage them effectively has left this place in shambles. There are only a handful of managers that work here that genuinely deserve this title and the rest just legitimately struck the lottery and sit on their computers all day online shopping and gossiping about other people. sign. me. up.

There is no career growth in this company because they change your compensation plan and goals every 6 months and instead of making more money each year.. they keep reaching into your pockets. Giving you less money and more work! Sees to be the Houzz way, but at least you get catered lunches and a donut wall to over compensate for not being able to pay your bills."

Apple products and new office space,"Where to begin. The level of micromanaging has reached an all time high. They have now implemented a computer system that tells you when you are allowed to get up from your desk for a break or for lunch. Morale is pretty low as anyone in upper management is negative and un approachable. The customer support team is heading down hill fast. Customer experience is extremely important to Houzz business model and the way they have things going, quality of customer support will continue to decline. My advice to anyone applying: do not be fooled by the fancy office and free food. It is a show. What good is free food when you are not able to get up from your desk when you want to get it? This is becoming a highly micro managed call center with negative attitudes and the pay is also very low. Save yourself the trouble"

781,Houzz,Amazing team and great changes in Aus,2018-05-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some of the best reasons to work at Houzz are the people, the growth and support. You create true connections and friendships with the people you work with and the level of genuine support and honest feedback you receive daily is unlike anywhere I’ve worked before. For me, since I started, I’ve had amazing opportunities to grow within the company, in my role, learn new practical skills and as a person, I have definitely grown (for the better!) since my time here. 

The respect everyone has for each other is amazing; it comes from a place of real kindness but also from the recognition that the everyone is amazingly self-motivated, smart and great at what they do. 

There’s been major changes internationally for Houzz in the past year or so and the Sydney office has experienced a lot of this. Years ago the office at times did feel isolated and had pockets of negativity. But the current Mgt and wider-teams strategic and empowering changes, their consistent positivity, sense of fun and transparency has completely turned around the office. Personally I so appreciate the thoughtful changes and ongoing support from management. 

Houzz in general & the Sydney office is a fantastic place, where I and I really think, the wider team, are proud to work.",Changes in roles and a smaller team means stretching/increasing your workload and putting in more hours.

Casual dress code
Cool office 
Having flexible hours is nice...can choose what you work within a specific timeframe","Honestly, everything. The job was made out to be so different in the interview process than it actually is. Pay is a joke, base salary alone does not cover cost of living in Nashville. In the interview they don’t tell you that commission is basically a 1-month waiting period, so don’t expect to make ANY money your first month (and that’s only if you are lucky enough to get a sale right away....you won’t) micromanagement is insane. Taught in training to “stick to the script” but when you do, your manager talks down to you and tells you not to use the script. But then when you don’t, you get in trouble for that. The only way to please management is to have sales. That’s it. And they are hard to come by. 
This company also uses scare tactics. New hires are put on a 90 day probation, which makes sense...however if you don’t get 8 sales in 90 days, you are fired. Doesn’t matter if you have 7 sales at day 90 and are very promising- you’re done. NO job security. And they love to remind you of that. 
Just...stay away. It’s not worth the stress and anxiety that comes with the job.
Oh, don’t get sick or you’ll have to run your PTO into the negative. Or come to work and not be productive and get in trouble."

785,Houzz,10/10 Would NOT Recommend.,2018-04-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Catered lunches/breakfast.
Fully stocked kitchen. 
Fun parties.","ZERO career development if you don't fit the company aesthetic.
Terrible management. 
No raises. 
If you aren't a sorority girl, you won't have friends. 

I applied and interviewed for SIX different positions in SIX different departments and got turned down each time because I, ""wasn't a fit for that team"". It was demoralizing and heart breaking every time. Eventually I ran out of new positions to apply for and ended up applying for the same departments a few times and I wasn't the only one with this experience. When I was finally offered a new position (after being turned down again, someone else rejecting the offer and they circled back to me), I was already putting in my two weeks for a new job at a different company. The best part was me telling my manager that I was leaving and her replying ""That's probably for the best."" 

Every position I applied for was either a pay cut or a lateral move, even though there would be more responsibility. I was chastised for not taking a 10k pay cut to work in operations because, ""If I was truly interested in the position, it wouldn't be about the money."" 
 
Our quarterly meetings were a joke, all they did was pat people who have been there from the beginning on the back, brag about how much money the company was making (while never giving raises and lowering bonus structures constantly  might I add), and tell us how much more work was coming in and to get ready for more holiday hours. The fact that they still consider themselves a startup company is a complete joke as well. 

Don't even get my started on the scheduling. Only after a major upset and a group of people quitting on the spot, did they start to adjust how they assigned sales shifts. Many people were forced to work 10:30-7 Monday - Friday when they could easily distribute the later shifts to the whole sales team to make life just a little bit better. 

I've also never dealt with such extreme micromanaging. Bathroom breaks, 10 minute breaks, and even just getting up to get water was closely monitored and not even by just your own manager. Have a question for a coworker? Better not let your boss see you because that would mean you weren't on ready and taking calls. Need to discuss something with another team? Better not be away from your desk for too long or you get a chat/email from your manager saying that someone noticed you were up for too long and reminding you to take calls. Even if you have the highest call percentage in your department you aren't safe from constant scrutiny. 

I really wanted to love working at this company. After taking the tour and seeing all the smiling faces and fun people I really thought I had found somewhere I could be for a long time! Its unfortunate that poor management and poor listening skills from those at the top result in such catastrophic issues within the company. The turnover rate is incredible and I really hope they can get it together and try to salvage what they have left. If any one asks if they should work there, I let them know to steer clear every time."

This director has burned more bridges in her short time here it’s actually impressive. She will openly discuss confidential employee situations among peers and members of her team like it is hot gossip. She spends more time chatting with her other director bff than actually working with her team. It’s cringeworthy hearing how much she’s being paid to do such an awful job. Every single team that has worked with her has openly told me how negative her attitude is and will literally go out of their way to avoid interacting with her.

The hiring staff does an excellent job at selecting intelligent, kind and motivated team members, creating an amazing culture in the office. 

Unlike the more corporate Houzz offices in the States, the Houzz AU office has a small, start-up feel where everyone gets along like family and your voice is truly heard and valued. Upper management has done a great job recently at keeping employees of all levels engaged, informed and involved with high-level information.

Social Club, who plans a social, philanthropy and athletic activity each quarter.

802,Houzz,The Glass is half full...,2018-03-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have friends, family and outside professional colleagues who always talk about how they either work for an amazing company OR how they absolutely hate their company.  I've also observed how they can routinely grow from a love to hate or hate to love relationship with their company for countless reasons. The only common thread I typically see is that whatever is going on within an organization, what it is or isn't, ultimately depends on your own perspective. 

The way I see it, if you're going to always look at the glass half empty then you're frankly never going to be happy. But if you're going to control the one thing you do have (your own perspective of things) and see things half full, then there can always be an upside to whatever ""it"" is. Some work environments can definitely make it more difficult for an employee to see things half full but that's not Houzz. Yes, it's not easy and yes this is a business and things will sometimes simply be business but I believe the intentions have always been to try to make things work or to try and make things better. 

I sometimes wonder if the Business itself was a person, what would it say about the people it employs and the community it services and the pressures it has to compete and survive as business......I think the business would say in a few words, ""..this is hard but the glass is only half full"".  That's why I continue to live, work, play and hold my head up high as an employee for Houzz.","As difficult as it might be, you need to better address areas for improvement by always taking on root causes head on instead of sometimes dealing with just the symptoms."

Teammates go out of their way to help each other and it feels natural to step up and return the favor. Additionally, people are encouraged to take initiative with expanding their responsibilities; if someone has a good idea, they can usually implement it quickly and without much hassle or dealing with endless rounds of getting proposals approved. Take this with the caveat that I work in HR, but a lot of my work is with our engineering and product teams and it is apparent to me that these elements apply there as well.","While benefits and pay are good in absolute terms, and are accompanied by good long-term equity, it is apparent that they are relatively lower than some other comparable companies."

The friendship's I have built through Houzz are now like family and am I will be sad to not be seeing them everyday.",Constant change can be both exciting and challenging as it can sometimes be hard to keep up. You need to be flexible and willing to try new things.
817,Houzz,Stay Away,2018-03-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Catered breakfast on Monday’s, lunch on Friday’s 
The people are amazing 
Casual dress code/workout Wednesday’s","Where to start? Basically every negative review I have seen on here regarding Houzz is accurate. Here’s what happens: you get lied to about how much commission you are going to make if you’re going into their sales team (i.e. they told me in my initial interview that top sales reps make 50k a year, when you’re lucky to make 30k if you hit your sales goals, which are sometimes unachievable). You are painted a picture of how wonderful Houzz is, and how much everyone loves coming to work everyday. HA! The morale around the office is grim and depressing. Yes, we do have amazing perks, but free food won’t help pay our bills! We have some amazingly talented and bright individuals that could do so much for the company, yet you fail to acknowledge us as employees, but simply as a number to make the company money. Oh, and if you’re looking to move up in the company, good luck. They promote favorites and people that suck up to management. Trust me, I have seen it first hand.
Lastly, if you don’t want to work in a call center environment, don’t work here. If you aren’t constantly on ready to take calls (I’ve taken up to 70 in one day before), you will get reprimanded, and possibly in public for others to hear. 
Houzz, I wanted so badly to like working here, but the culture and values are so atrocious, I can’t let other people blindly work here without them hearing the honest truth. 
Lastly, all of those “5 star reviews” are most definitely fake and whoever wrote them were probably forced to by upper management."
818,Houzz,Please avoid if you can help it.,2018-03-22,2.0,Trade Account Manager,Nice to have free snacks and coffee. Pretty flexible with PTO. Team leads are awesome.,"I could go on and on, just read other reviews for details. Basically, you won't get experience that other employers value, it's a strange/difficult environment to thrive in if you're not a perky girl younger than 26 with a cute boyfriend, and you'll do robotic and repetitive work and probably have to take inbound calls all day long regardless of role. Senior management is completely out of touch."

Fully stocked fridge and free lunch on Fridays.
The product really is great and should be more well known in the UK. 
Some of the people are amazing, and truely do become friends.","Working at Houzz is disappointing, the product is fantastic, but not enough is being done to increase brand awareness. 
Many of these reviews are fairly accurate, sales roles are boring and the accounts you’re given are on the whole pretty bad. There is clear favouritism in the team and hot inbound leads are always given to the same people. 
There is little scope for progression, and it is difficult to gain much professional development. 
The senior management have little experience in their roles, and some decisions are really questionable. 
The pay is not great compared to other similar companies."
822,Houzz,Best Company I've Ever Worked For!,2018-03-13,5.0,Customer Support Specialist,"I cannot begin to explain how amazing this company is. They truly care about their employees from the free health care, to the fully stocked healthy snacks in the kitchens, to gym membership discounts. 

I love coming to work everyday. My co-workers come from all walks of life so there's no two people that are the same. Everyone is so positive and friendly and I've never been in a happier position in life. Houzz is a refreshing and amazing company to work for. 

AND THE BIGGEST OF SHOUTOUTS TO MY RECRUITER KIRSTYN SULLIVAN FOR BRINGING ME INTO THE BEST COMPANY EVER!",I can't think of a thing I don't like about Houzz!
823,Houzz,Hyped Up Disapointment,2018-03-13,1.0,Customer Support Specialist,"Free breakfast on Monday and free lunch on Friday. Health, Vision and Dental are free. 15 days of PTO. No overtime.","Most of the team leads and managers are under 30 and while I am happy to see younger people excel, they tend to be petty with other younger people and treat the older ones like they are stupid. The customer support role is pretty much listening to extremely rich people yell at you about furniture all day and having to listen and call 10 different places to try and fix their problem. This position should be called ""Middle Man"".  Pay is not worth having to drive downtown, park 1 mile a way, take a shuttle into town with a bunch of grumpy workers, wait 15 minutes for an elevator and take it 24 floors to be yelled at for 8 hours. Management is never around & when you ask for help you feel like you just ruined their whole day. In training, they go over their ""expectations"" like: grammatically correct emails, no talking loudly on the floor so people/customers can hear, be on time, however, the ""favorites"" of management can do whatever they want and roll in 6 minutes late with another team lead and no one looks."
824,Houzz,Not what it used to be,2018-03-12,2.0,"Client Success Manager, Prev Account Executive","The friends I’ve made are incredible (tho most have quit by now). Stocked fridge, flexible hours, great benefits (medical, dental)","Recently restructured everyone’s compensation and even top performers are struggling to make any money. I used to make so much money and loved that I worked at such an employee-centered company but you can tell there’s been a shift and all upper management cares about is the bottom line. People are quitting left and right and finding other sales jobs. The company has lost so much talent and doesn’t seem to care in the slightest. 

Not transparent at all with how stock options are distributed. Seems to be no rhyme or reason to why some people have more or less or how long it takes to  vest."
825,Houzz,poor leadership + clique culture + awful pay = killing great potential.,2018-03-09,2.0,Account Executive,"From a product perspective Houzz is innovative and a great website for ideas.  The potential is huge - whats key is continuing to strategically innovate product for usage beyond idea generation for home design which am sure Houzz will continue to do.

The London office is located in a great area, has the usual perks: with food and funky office.","I can only speak from a sales perspective on the UK AE team. Where to begin: I suppose the best place to start is leadership. 

In the time I spent at Houzz from the early days in the old office to moving into the new one: I witnessed poor sales leadership. It starts from the top - the US leadership team got hoodwinked and hired a UK MD with no prior sales experience (and fairly boring) - mistake number one. The US leadership team should rightly know that to build out a sales team its mandatory to have someone with experience selling.  Sadly this decision had ripple effects that made the sales floor as a whole suffer.

I want to go a little deeper here - the reason why strong sales leadership is perhaps more important and necessary for Houzz versus other organisations is because the work itself is repetitive and at times mundane - selling to small business owners. The product had merit but didn't always work so signing someone up to Houzz was like a punt. Branding for the client. The brain slowly died, and you weren't able to up-skill, better organisations implement smart ways to help develop AE's and stimulate them, Houzz failed on this, especially on the UK team where the culture in the team itself was toxic. The churn on the team is indicative to the level of toxicity where all sorts of 'breach of HR' terms  were occurring under the watchful but ineffective eye of leadership.

The salary was just awful. I don't know how recruiters sell the job - I guess they have to lie.

Lastly I will say lots of male sales leaders across all the teams that behaved unprofessionally far too frequently in a majority female environment- again HR take note. Ironic considering Houzz has one of the few female CEOs in large tech firms."

The benefits are great
Apple computers used in office. 
Job duties are fairly easy","There is a serious problem with micromanagement here. I think they needed to hire so many people so fast, they hired anyone with a pulse and now they have disciplinary issues. Also in training, management tells you how much they are there to help but once you get into the job, they are no help. They will write you up for logging in 1 minute late. There is no sick time so people come to work ill so they don’t have to use paid time off. Management also has a tendency to be condescending especially when you challenge the policy. They also do not calculate numbers right for bonuses. Many of the managers can’t even clearly explain bonus structure. There is such a lack of organization. Houzz is a young company so some disorganization is to be expected but hire the right people for the right jobs and some problems will be fixed."

Cool Office","Just about what everyone else has said below. Over-promised & under-delivered. People quitting left and right. If you do not meet your quota (which only 3 people have in the past 2 months since they restructured) you instantly go on a performance plan. Then your pay will be cut the following month. No transparency in this company at all. Employees aren't people, they are numbers and if you aren't hitting yours be prepared to either be forced out or miserable and anxious every second of every day. Office morale is at an all time low. 

They promise you a fast track to management when you are hired, but you will soon realize that the managers now just were lucky to get in at the right time. Don't let the grammar and glitz of the tech industry and start up vibes draw you in, because you will be wasting your time. Honestly, I have heard the other departments aren't bad, but if you are considering Sales... just turn around and withdrawal yourself from consideration. JUST DON'T DO IT."

There’s an office dog, a fully stocked kitchen, they pop bottles of wine every now and then...","But there are way too many cons. I’ll try to keep this short, so here are the most pertinent:
- The place is a glorified call centre. 80% of staff are on phones all day every day. 
- They’re more concerned with reputation management than people management. Reading some of these reviews actually made me cringe cause COME ON. 
- It’s very heirarchial, which can be frustrating if you’re being managed by an inexperienced/unprofessional  manager. Think showponies with no real skills. 
- People move around, but not always the right people or in the right direction. You can have a cool title, but you won’t be able to do anything that title implies you should be able to do. Oh, you’re in marketing? Trust me, you’re not. 
- It’s not a fair workplace. There’s clear favouritism from managers, which can be disheartening for all the quiet achievers."

837,Houzz,Proceed with Caution...,2018-02-08,2.0,Marketplace,"-Benefits: Good health benefits with a lot of options; they don't match for 401k

-Free food: Free Monday breakfast and Friday lunch; fully stocked kitchen with snacks, fruits, cold cuts, eggs

-Coworkers: Everyone is young and this is usually their first job out of college so you get along with a good number of the people you work with. I made some amazing friends at Houzz and met people I wouldn't have met outside of work.

-Work: The work isn't too complex, which is nice at first. Easy to learn and people are willing to help you out. The shadowing really helps as well. 

-Hours: Flexible hours. They are strict in terms of making sure you clock your time in an out and for lunch, but they do allow you to come in earlier and therefore leave earlier as long as 8 hours are put in. 

-Team leads: Managers are a different story, but the team leads I had were AMAZING. They were genuine and a lot more transparent than Managers. It's nice because they know exactly what you're working on and are your best advocate for helping you do your job the best.

-Engineers: Weird category to have, but I have to say that the Engineering team at Houzz is tremendously small, but mighty. They have done some amazing work building out Houzz's Website, App, and all the fun features that should attract people to use the platform.","Where to begin...
-Work: The work that you're doing is fairly mundane and doesn't have too high of a learning curve. Therefore it does get tedious at times and when your suggestions for change and improvement don't get listened to, it makes the work more frustrating.

-Teamwork: Houzz needs to better integrate the goals of the teams across the company. It was extremely difficult and frustrating to try and reach our goals or do well in competitions when the other moving parts that a team is working with, doesn't have even closely related goals as well. This conflict does not help the company cover all the bases, but rather have teams running around in their own circles with different communication focuses and not able to drive towards the single goal.

-Compensation: DON'T PAY LESS JUST BECAUSE WOMEN IS THE MAJORITY. Houzz is probably 80% women, which means I think they have a great platform to empower the women that work there and pay them fairly, if not more, for how much work they do, especially employees that go above and beyond consistently. What you get paid when you are hired is most likely going to be the pay for at least a year, year and half minimum with a possible $1-$1.5 increase. They don't do negotiations.

-Management: Imagine you walked out the front doors of college with your degree in one hand and an internship or two of experience under your belt, worked for a year at a full time job, then wow! You're a manager! Would you trust yourself? Maybe, maybe not, but with a lot of the managers at Houzz, I felt like there was a struggle for direction and good leadership. Most of the managers aren't E-commerce veterans, therefore a lot of things are up in the air when you ask questions or bring suggestions. They're learning, but I still felt like they were more lost that I was as times.

-Growth/Career: This is a hit or miss. They do open internal opportunities, but a lot of the times the moves are lateral. Occasionally there will be an opening for something you really may be passionate about, which is great! And another way to have you stay at Houzz longer. Sometimes the new position could be a negative move and not at all what you signed up for. In terms of upward growth, there isn't a ton because Managers don't tend to leave and there is some favoritism that goes into play with promotions. This adds to why the turnover is so bad and people usually leave after 1-2 years."

Don't get fooled into working in sales at Houzz thinking you're entering a job where you'll  regularly engage with nifty designs and can claim you work in the  interior design/architect space .  In reality, the day to day dynamic resembles that of a highly supervised call center. Management is inexperienced, and overly focused on maintaining the company's reputation at all costs, often at the expense of its employees and customers.

Houzz is definitely an adolescent company finding its way from tiny living room-based startup to giant multinational rocket ship, and while every teenager has some growing pains, in my mind what makes Houzz so special is that it hasn't lost its family atmosphere.  I genuinely like almost everyone I work closely with, and we band together and don't fracture during tough times.  When I read about other tech unicorns and the infighting and politics that ruin their culture and productivity, I am thankful to have avoided that type of circus at Houzz. 

I've been surprised and pleased by the opportunities I've had for professional growth, whether it's novel and challenging work, the chance to work on  international matters, or collaborating with many other teams to tackle whatever comes up. 

Finally, it's great to be part of a winning team.  Having worked at a lot of startups where no amount of good ideas or execution yielded success, it is really a treat to see us continuing to bring in new talent to work on new and exciting initiatives, and then see those projects pay off.  It's been a tremendous run even in the time I've been here, and I can't wait to see what the future brings. 

Houzz is home.","Lunches in Palo Alto are expensive?

I was hired as an Account Executive with a pitch of ""this isn't like other sales environments, we don't have a quota we hold you to, we'll work with you to develop you."" I was not given any expectation on call volume or daily expectations and was not allowed to see a benefits package until after having already accepted the position and in training. Transparency is not a strong suit here. 

6 months into the office existing (a week before Thanksgiving) they placed well over 50% of the salesforce onto performance plans. It was billed as ""a way to help you get back on track, not a way to push you out"" but the documents stated that failure to reach the level of performance laid out in the plan would lead to termination. This was a stark contrast to the ""no quota, no pressure"" environment that was pitched during the hiring process. 

Several weeks after that point, the salesforce was gathered for a meeting that was titled as an Industry Solutions update but was the event where it was announced that the base salary of $46,500 would be dropping to $32-35,000 effective Jan. 1 with a 10% bump in commissions. When most sales are $250-350, an extra 10% is not going to make up a difference of $10k+. Similar to the performance plan, this was billed as a positive and a way for you to make more money.

They also raised the minimum acceptable level of performance to 6 sales/month for the lowest tier. Top performers are averaging 5ish sales/month in Nashville, and although management claims that there are reps doing it in other offices, no evidence has been produced to show that. If you fail to meet the new minimum level of performance, you'll be placed on a performance plan and will have your base docked by another 25% down to roughly $28k for the next six months, while boosting your commission rate to 120%. Again, on a $250-350 sale that does not add up. I know people who had signed leases and bought houses based on the base salary, not expecting a base to be ""variable comp"". 

Another issue with performance is the lead base. They claim to be hiring a Director of Lead Gen but at the moment the accounts that are being called on have been touched 3-4 times on average. It is very difficult to make 6 sales/month when the person you're calling has told another rep they're not interested 3 months ago. 

All of these changes have created an incredibly toxic environment. As far as I'm aware, at least 12 people have quit and at least one has been fired, all in the two weeks before Christmas. The company bills itself as friendly and happy and amazing and positive and so California, but the operations show a lack of regard for the employees that work there. It's very difficult to place emphasis on ""work life balance"" when you get home and have to worry about the fact that if you do keep your job, you'll be losing upwards of 25% of your pay in a month. 

I really wanted to be here for a long time, be happy, and I really felt as though this was a place I could stay and grow and be successful. That has not been the case. It's not my intention to bash or slander an employer, but I hope that at least I am able to explain to any future employees what has happened here."
860,Houzz,Not a Career Development Role,2017-12-21,1.0,Moc,"The only real benefit I have from my position are the amazing friends and people I got to work with. If you're looking for friends, Houzz is a great place to be, just not for your career.","I'm not even sure where to begin with this review, so I'll just start from the beginning. 

I was hired as a Marketplace Operations Coordinator, of which I was told a brand new role/program for those looking to gain skills across a multitude of departments which will eventually lead to a career path and opportunity for growth within my chosen field. As my time there developed, there were several things within this role that fell short. First, the role was a complete hoax. It was an idea that started to trick potential employees into joining a customer service support team - nothing I would have taken the time to apply for in the first place. The idea wasn't fully fleshed out and upon being hired, there was no real training process and managers within the customer service department had no idea about new hires. Once I had already accepted the position, I was told I was to start in customer service. I asked how long I would be placed there, as this wasn't something I wanted to invest my time or career path in and was told 3 weeks. 3 weeks then turned into 3 months, which then turned into 6 months, and later 9 months. Every time I approached management about this, the conversation turned into ""soon"" and then eventually a restriction in internal movement as they had soon hired upwards of 30 new employees all told the same lies. Everyone was seeking answers and told the same thing before they realized the program they (management) created had backfired as you can't keep qualified individuals in a role they never chose to be in. At 9 months I looked into other employment opportunities and continuously applied to internal roles. I eventually received a new internal position, and opted to stay. Honestly, internal movement is sadly based on personal relationships with your managers. The favoritism that other reviews hone in on is very true to the management style at Houzz. 

Other issues with the company aside from poor management are the shaky infrastructure holding up the company. Houzz grew entirely too fast, without thinking of ways to efficiently structure their employees, systems and processes. Any input from employees are entirely disregarded, only to be brought up years later. The culture creates a high sense of micromanagement, with no empowerment of lower level employees. Even upper management, aside from a few, are completely incapable of making smart decisions on behalf of their department and company. They are great at hiring driven individuals, but don't use their strengths, and in fact, undermine the very qualities their hired for. I've seen plenty of individuals leave the company due to the lack of challenge and apathy towards suggested means of improvement. If you are looking for a position that actually teaches you any real, valuable skills to carry on in your career path Houzz is not an option for you. Many of the positions are comprised of tedious, menial tasks that provide no real means for growth. 

Pay is decent, but promotions are sparse and few between. Vacation is a joke. Any upward mobility in benefits are nonexistent.

As I left the company started to implement some changes, but they are surface level and are band-aids covering a larger issue at hand."
861,Houzz,Account Manager Review,2017-12-20,4.0,Account Manaher,"Catered breakfast Mondays, catered lunch Fridays, quarterly team building events (bowling, top golf, etc), endless contests and other incentives, fun start-up office vibe & environment. They hire genuinely nice people to contribute to a great work environment - everyone is friends here! 

Increased number of paid holidays, added 2 personal days to our benefits package.

Sends out company wide culture surveys to see what the people want - and they are quick to make positive, impactful changes.

Adi (the CEO) visits our offices and is usually part of company wide meetings. She is really involved and had a genuinely caring heart for every employee.

They are making cuts in certain departments/areas - but they are doing it to stay proactive with keeping the business healthy. I respect the company more for making sure they can continue with growth in the right areas. There are a LOT of other companies that will make cuts and say ""sorry, you have no options and you only have a week.""","Growing pains - training materials need to be developed, an employee handbook would be nice. Clear policies & procedures should be implemented. However, they know all of this and are working on it! They are a start-up environment, just well past the start-up phase. I think the rapid growth slowed down some of these focuses, but they are circling back and making big changes in 2018."

The opportunity to work at a company with multiple revenue streams - local advertising and ecommerce. Fast growth and never the same day twice. Asking for employee feedback and making changes based on what will benefit the most people. Great maternity benefits, health benefits better than my spouse's ""big company"" benefits, best company party to date this year. Lots of change as the company hits new inflection points for growth and aligns structure to accommodate, but they are being done to align the business correctly for more growth and take advantage of the huge opportunities we are going after in 2018.","Still a young company so not much in place in terms of training, reviews and career path clarity."

That being said, the company just got rid of most of their recruiters so who knows what kind of people will be hired next.

Lots of food in the fridge, very social environment, catered breakfast and lunch once a week.","If you are looking for any intellectual stimulation or professional growth this is not the job for you. There are absolutely no exciting positions and mostly all moves are lateral. Out of the 2 years I worked for the company, I have never had a friend excited about their position. 

If you are looking for a good sales role to build up your resume - this is not it. The sales are extremely transactional and I can say first hand other employers are not impressed by it.

Extremely low pay - that is clear from all the reviews.

It is saddening how bad the work environment has become but I don’t see any fixing it at this point. 

Since I have left the roof seems to be caving in. No job is safe as departments are “dissolved” constantly. The pay structure is always changing to the point where you can lose a percentage of your salary at any moment.  Goals are not obtainable, out of the 28 people on my team 3 of us had a sales average in line with our sales goal."

Slide that no one uses","The company is restructuring in every department. People's roles are being eliminated and compensation is being adjusted (in a negative way). The company grew very fast. Houzz was not worried about budgets for several years and now they are trying to hit the rest button and run the business more efficiently - which is fancy talk for downsizing. They definitely pay a 3rd party or encourage management level employees to write positive reviews that will show up at the top (we also tell customers to do the same thing when they get a negative review). You can no longer make a lot of money at Houzz - even top performers have taken drastic pay cuts. I'm sure there will be a mass exodus of people in the next several weeks. 

I have only been here for about a year so I feel bad for the people who have been around from the beginning - some have taken such a massive pay cut, they are driving at night for a ride share company who will remain nameless to keep with Glassdoor policies. 

Oh, and they no longer have humus in the kitchen and christmas music has been playing since November 1st. They also used to play rap music, which I find very offensive."
869,Houzz,Can't get any worse,2017-12-15,1.0,Account Executive,"Incredible co-workers. Have made some lifelong friends.

Free breakfast on Mondays, free lunch on Friday

Stocked kitchen

....I would GLADLY give away all of these for higher pay and job security","This is going to be long....sorry...

Pay: $18.03 per hour($37,500 annually)- overtime is NOT allowed. During the interview process it was communicated multiple times that the average Account Executive would make $70k-$80k with some top performers even getting as high as six figures. Very shortly after being hired it was clear that the average pay was more along the lines of $45k-$55k with top performers in the $55k-$65k range. Any additional office competitions can win you a $5-$100 gift card that usually takes a few months to receive. I know many AEs that have still not received the gift card from the very first competition with their training class.

Communication: can simply be stated as over promising and under delivering, or just lying. For example, a ""policy change"" in November changed performance plan dates and immediately put roughly 60-70% of the office on a plan. As of todays date, December 15th, I would imagine that nearly 90% of the Phoenix office is currently on a performance plan to soon be pushed out the door. With the recent drop off of qualified leads for the AEs to call, there had been promises that there were brighter days ahead for Nov and Dec with the ""Winter Wonderland"" promotions. The only promotions that are offered are a 2nd month free for professionals or a 20% discount for multiple packages(something we could technically already offer). I understand trying to motivate a sales team but over promising on changes that don't happen made the situation even worse.

Leads: the leads are currently the biggest struggle for the AE position. We are calling home professionals that have been called a countless number of times over the past 4 years. Many people hang up or yell at you as soon as you say that you are from Houzz. Finding qualified leads is a major issue for Houzz right now and a big reason that the sales department is shrinking so rapidly. 

IPO: Houzz is gearing up to go public so there are a ton of changes, all at the expense of their employees.  Just this week, they notified the Account Managers that they will essentially be dissolving their department. Besides very top performers(so like 5 people) all Account Managers will either need to interview for Account Executive(while they are pushing AEs out the door?), move to the marketplace department, or take 1 months severance pay. They are also changing sales goals in 2018 to increase(WHY?) the amount of sales that a rep will need to make per month to not be put on a performance plan. Even top performers are currently struggling to not be put on a plan and NO ONE is making good money. Also, once you get put on a plan, even if you get enough sales to get off of one, if you ever find yourself having a slower month, you will immediately be put on a final plan. It is clear that they want to cut employees at this time, which is understandable, but the way that they are going about it is incredibly shady and shows that they don't care about their employees."
870,Houzz,Do not make HOUZZ your HOME! Start up Company that puts EMPLOYEES last!,2017-12-15,1.0,Account Executive,"Free food.
Free Breakfast 
Thats it","Where do I begin.  I started working at Houzz this summer, and during the interview I made a point to ask VERY specific questions about the STABILITY of the company (since it is a Start Up), I asked about the growth, and career advancements. I was SOLD that within 6 months there would be promotions, within 6 months if this role was not a good fit, HOUZZ believes in allowing you to transfer into another role, because they want to make sure you FIND a good FIT within the company. For a Sales role, there were no SET GOALS, which was weird to me because how do you not have Sales Goals for your reps? They SOLD everyone on making your own goals, no pressure from management, and it was about effort and enjoying being here. ALL LIES. In November is when the PRESSURE came down, right before Thanksgiving, a holiday about being THANKFUL. The current Regional Sales Manager and your direct manager sat everyone down 1 on 1 and had PIP Plans in Place (Performance Improvement Plans). This caught EVERYONE by surprise. Even the reps who were selling like crazy were placed on this PIP plan. The plan that was put in place was every rep had to make 4 sales before December 4th. Keep in mind we had the Thanksgiving holiday so If you took off time to be with FAMILY you were behind on meeting that number. On Dec 4th if you did not hit the 4 sales, you were placed on a final PIP and needed to make 4 sales before December 29th, if not your role would be eliminated. They gave everyone 1 month!!! This all Happened in November, and it happened to sales group of over 50+ reps. So far since that has happened, we have had close to 10 people quit, and GOOD reps too because they did not appreciate the pressure from management 1 month before the  end of the year and also since they were actually making SALES!!!  Now lets talk about the PAY… not only did they create this Performance Improvement Plan for EVERYONE (even the top reps), they sat all of us down in December 4th and told us that our pay would be changing on January 3rd 2018, Lower base going from 46,500 annually to 32,000… that is a huge difference, and that 32,000 base can even go lower to around 28,000 or around 13.50 a hour if you don’t hit your goal of 4 sales in January. So as you can see you will be in this position SCARED And STRESSED every single month if you fall below that goal and they will put you on a PIP plan even if you have 3 sales instead of 4, and lower your base on top of that. Oh and they cap your commission, and when I was hired it was uncapped commission.  The managers are very untrained and do not deal with REAL emotions from employees when they are impacting our Lively hood. Please do your research, ask a lot of questions and do not let a PRETTY office and FREE food place you somewhere you will be MISERABLE and FIGHTING every month to keep your job."

Many managers are unprofessional, and are not supportive. Houzz seems to promote the best sales people to management roles, and the best salespeople aren't always the best managers. Many people feel undervalued, because there are constant restructures within departments and compensation plans. 

I have seen all of these trends throughout several different departments with this company. The company is growing and changing, and I understand that employees sometimes have to make sacrifices for that, but this place is full of empty promises, and employees are not very valued."

Bait & switch! I was hired in the summer of 2017 with a base pay of $46,500. I was told that there is room for growth & no micro management. This is all a lie. You are micro managed. There isn’t any room for growth unless you’re performing. Which AGAIN, as I stated above, in order to preform you need QUALIFIED leads! Shortly after this, somewhere around November, the company announced that our base pay would be lowered to $36k starting in January. You get a 3 month ramp up period ,but after that, if you’re not meeting a sales goal of 4 sales a month (which AGAIN can only be obtained with QUALIFIED leads) you’re put on a performance plan. If you do not hit or exceed 4 sales within your 1 month performance plan you are then put on a final performance plan. You now have another month to get 4 sales OR you are more than likely fired. Also, keep in mind over 80% of the sales team was put on this performance plan."

Clean Office.","I know,  using a Clueless quote for the title seems a bit trivial, but that is honestly the best way I can describe the environment at Houzz at this point in the game. I have been here for a couple of years and have gotten used to going with the flow and riding the changes wave. Whether that is related to the comp plan, new seating situation/team shift, or how Winter Wonderland is structured.  I absolutely understand that in order to stay relevant as a business, we have to change.  I get that, we all get that... However, there are so many fundamental problems and I don't see a feasible solution. Firstly, let me start by saying how wonderful and inspiring the CEO is. She has worked so hard and has so much passion for Houzz and her vision of it being the best home design ever.  Unfortunately, a few people in upper management with their lack of experience and little respect for the worker-bees are compromising this great product. I would prefer not to have to repeat all the same complaints listed in some of the other reviews as I'm sure most get the point when they look at Glassdoor. We are grotesquely underpaid. I would understand a low salary if we were in truly performance based commission roles. Let's face it, it's not performance based anymore. Our concerns are not being addressed by the same said people people in upper management which is causing some of the lowest morale I have ever seen in a workplace. It's clear that Houzz does not care if good employees leave and little is being done to retain those of us still here."

The company also has many of the usual “tech” perks like free food, company events, etc.","Culture: The culture is based on senior management constantly sending out emails saying how fortunate we all are to work at Houzz. This has created an environment where those in junior positions aren’t able to provide feedback about ways the company can improve. 

Compensation: pay close attention to your compensation plan. It changes on a consistent basis. The base pay is also very low.

Management: a good manager is someone who can lead by example and wants to develop the skill sets of their subordinates. Unfortunately Houzz typically only promotes those who have high sales numbers, not people who are able to manage others. The managers at Houzz are also typically people who say “yes” to senior management. Anyone can say yes. A good manager is someone who can actually think on their own and tries to protect their teams. 

Structure: doesn’t exist. Sure, they can say they’re a startup, but they have been around long enough that they should have more consistent policies in place. Policies seem to change because it’s convenient, not because it’s the right thing to do."

The people are stylish? Oh and I guess it’s fun to wear yoga pants on Wednesday. But none of this is worth the lengthy list of cons...","I don’t even know where to begin. There are three types of employees at Houzz: 
1) The “OGs” who have been with Houzz since (almost) day 1. Most are fully vested (or close) and patiently waiting until Houzz IPO’s to get their payday.

2) Fresh out of college newbies with no experience who are excited to work somewhere that feels like the sorority they just left. They do not yet realize the truth behind Houzz and what has been going on, and management relies on them to post glowing Glassdoor reviews. Give it a year and they will finally understand the evil beast that is Houzz

3) Everybody else whose been here about 1.5-3 years, nearly all of which are more qualified than the current “director of sales” to lead a business (who essentially acts as doe-eyed figure head, whose primary job it is to blow smoke up our you-know-what’s).  Group one and three is faced with the nearly impossible task of trying to sell a product to professionals who either aren’t a fit or have asked Houzz to stop calling at least 3 times in 6 months.

Morale is extremely low because the standards required of reps are nearly impossible to reach. A major reorganization was just rolled out where, across departments (sales, recruiting, client services), people are either being demoted into the entry level job they started at years ago or are at risk of losing employment all together. In fact, yesterday an entire team was unceremoniously laid off a couple weeks short of Christmas. Surprise!

Management and ownership seems not to have batted an eye even when demoting and putting reps on PIPs who quite literally helped build this company from day 1. As someone who is not an “OG”, this is truly the most shocking and upsetting development of them all. These employees have brought in millions of dollars of revenue and were trailblazers of new initiatives and departments... only to be treated like garbage.

Recent company meetings consist of management passing down bad news behind a smokescreen of positivity and hoping the sales force is too dumb to figure it out. 

Anyone who has been here 2 years or longer can tell you that the pay has gone down consistently (and drastically) over time. Most bonuses are gone, and the ones that remain are, again, nearly impossible to attain. 

If you want to work for a company that values its employees, I would highly recommend against choosing Houzz. On the other hand, if you are happy to be openly treated as expendable, have your salary and commission changed overnight (and frequently), and told to sit down and be quiet, then this is the place for you!"

Management is fake and unless you play along with their overly positive attitudes you are essentially blacklisted.

I had several interviews within the company to get ""promoted"" to pro plus, but was turned down because I was not a good fit at the time.

I had meetings with my managers to get me out of account coordinator because they knew how unhappy I was in the role. I was so unhappy that I would find myself crying after shifts and figuring out a way out of this job. Management in this role at the time was not very supportive and picked favorites. I was very burnt out and if I didn't hit the goal, then I would stay in this role longer. After 6 months in that miserable role, I finally got a way out to customer service (pre sales). Out of one miserable role into yeah you said it, another miserable role. Terrible hours and had to be there at 5am to take calls. Another miserable few months doing that and I barely had a social life. Now, I'm in a role that has more flexibility but it is harder for others to get out of roles they hate. Also, if you get a ""promotion"" don't think you are going to get a higher salary because sometimes it's lower than the role you got promoted out of. Very disappointed in the way that works. The CEO had a meeting a while back on ways to improve the company because we all took a survey. Not all of it was addressed and I'm upset about that. Yeah we get a few more PTO days, but only if you have been with the company for a certain number of years. There is no sick days and only paid time off that you have to work for.... lastly, team leads are better than actual management because they are actually there to help."
884,Houzz,Account Executive,2017-11-26,3.0,Account Executive,"Excellent medical benefits, free food, bonus opportunities.","Low entry level pay, questionable leads."
885,Houzz,"Sit down, be humble.",2017-11-22,2.0,,"1) Birthday Parties
2) Free Food Friday
3) Co-workers - I’ve made friends with some of the best people I’ve ever had the pleasure of being around.","When I started at Houzz there were promises about growth and potential which is not the case. Turnover is high, morale is low, management is under-qualified (aside from a few Pro+ managers and Marketplace managers i.e. Risk and Logistics). The majority of the managers I personally worked with were defensive, horrible listeners and not present when you needed them. I think they were too afraid of their own bosses to stand up for their team.

Raises are given begrudgingly. You will get one in most cases if:

1) If you have an external opportunity on the table. 
2) After a ton of turnover occurs 
3) If you’re a brown noser who plays the game and becomes a favorite of senior management regardless if the people you manage have positive things to say about you or not

My training in every role was rushed and in one case my manager didn’t understand my role and used my notes to train the next hires for our team. I did the majority of the training and helped the team get running but they wouldn’t promote me to a lead even though she verbally admitted I was already doing the work of the lead. 

It’s nice HR listened to employee complaints and started requiring additional training for management but you could waste less money and effort by promoting people who are actually qualified to begin with.

When my team told that same manager several times that the metrics being used to track our progress weren’t being calculated accurately she didn’t address it and just kept saying she’d look into it. The lack of concern and the run around given to us was stressful as our bonuses were tied to numbers that weren’t even accurate. 

One of the biggest disappointments came after a co-worker created a non-profit project that got shelved. After some time passed the CEO spoke about the program in a meeting taking credit for the idea and even the ideas that my co-worker pitched but were never launched. Too many other people had quit by that point to remember my friend started this but several of us remembered this and were upset at the lack of integrity.

I have at least six co-workers who wanted to leave this toxic environment so badly they quit without having other jobs lined up. That should speak volumes. 

Houzz is like the U.S. government and the employees are like women and minority groups. When employees speak up about changing and helping the company run better and providing better opportunities (like pay and career paths) Houzz is more concerned with money and saving face than actually addressing their issues of poor management, favoritism, arrogance and poor integrity. We were told to be grateful for what we already had instead of them taking ownership with humility of their missteps, oversight or pure dishonesty. 

Why actually fix the issue if you can keep your yes men happy and bribe people to write positive Glassdoor reviews? These identical ""Houzz is the best place to work"" reviews aren't fooling anyone. Why listen to these “bad apples” who need to just be quiet, fall in line and be thankful they work at Houzz? Why give your employees salaries that make sense for living in the OC when you can distract them by installing a slide and giving them free food all the time?"
886,Houzz,Discouraging Work Environment if you value more than just having coworkers who become your friends,2017-11-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"-people tend to form meaningful friendships
-having a stocked kitchen, coffee options, catered meals, and a cheery/nicely decorated office is nice at first
-not a strict environment, you won't be reprimanded for making mistakes, occasionally underperforming if you're stressed or going through a lot, pretty tough to get fired
-there are some awesome team leads, many of them work harder and are more knowledgeable than the managers
-supportive and understanding HR team
-though it largely depends on your manager, most PTO requests are approved, and they do let you take a lot","-managers are promoted from within and their training is a facade - more tedtalks and book reviews about positive leadership etc than meaningful training
-no sick time - just PTO
-managers rarely give detailed, concrete answer - expect grey area and getting the runaround from management for months on end
-personality matters, if you don't fit the stereotype and somehow ended up employed here good luck getting promotions
-don't know of anyone making more than 50k in a team lead role or lower, even people that have been here since the beginning
-no genuine opportunities for career advancement. just lateral moves. they'll also expect you to be okay taking a pay cut if you move to a new role and they'll spin it as a good thing. they're not going to be loyal to you and look out for you just because you stay there for years. 
-the terms ""making data based decisions"" and ""due to business need"" are almost ALWAYS the answer to why they cannot alter a procedure/structure when it's difficult for you, and why they'll put off making decisions. oh but they'll come up with a great idea for something they want to do and impose it within an hour for these same reasons
-not a genuinely professional or impressive environment. many people have not worked for other companies and only know houzz culture/standards. it will seem odd if you are coming from a different industry, especially one that is more professional"

893,Houzz,My Experience at Houzz,2017-10-27,5.0,Account Executive,"Houzz has a ton of pro's. You can really tell when a company invests in their employees when it comes to how they invest in training them. The training I had at Houzz has been one of the best in my 7 years of sales. They really take the time to set you up for success. If you are dedicated and take the time to learn and review the material there is no reason you can not be successful at the job. There are some amazing mentors within the company and many people that you can always learn from.  Houzz is a passion driven company and they love passionate employees who come in and make the office and days better just by working hard, having a positive attitude, smiling and adding value by sharing knowledge and giving tips for what has worked for them, to others around them.  When you are passionate about sales and  love what you sell (but most importantly believe in it) the conversations are always successful.  Another pro at Houzz is the community.  Some of the best people I have met since I moved to Berlin have been my colleagues from Houzz. Everyone here is a team player and there really is no 'I' in team here. The managers and team leads really go out of their way to make sure they shadow calls and set us up for success.  I also find from my own personal experience that managers and team leads are really open to feedback and suggestions.   With managers and team leads you have 1:1 and set up individual goals at the end of every month for the next month so you are able to stay on track, hit your goals and go even above and beyond.  The managers here help you strategise how to do better and have given me very constructive feedback on how I can improve or approach professionals when I am having any difficulties. I have never had any problems asking for advice. Also a super big PLUS: there are constant incentives to work hard, different gift cards you can win, bonus structures set up to really help motivate you to hit above and beyond your suggested targets. On Fridays we have catered lunches where you are able to sit with everyone across all the departments and get to know each other and what everyone does at Houzz that is not on the same team as you and that is also really always fun and awesome. 

To address a few of the reviews below: 

1.  Houzz does not have unsupported growth. They are very clear what direction you will be going in if you are hitting your targets.  They do give you all tools, on-going training and mentors to set you up for success. 

2. Commissions are uncapped and very clear.  Minimum is 5 sales a month.  That it totally do-able if you have done sales before. When you believe in what you do, you are always successful. 

3. Teem meetings are a nice way to get everyone in the room and hear the targets that people have set up for themselves and catch up from over the weekend. It's a nice way to start the week and get some motivation, share success stories, share some difficulties, acknowledging people who have closed deals, and laughing all together.

4. It is quite normal that your sales manager would not be available every moment of the day. They are managing 40 other people within the office. That is why you have a team that you work with and team leads who are there for you when you need tips/ suggestions. Houzz does a great job to give you all the tools and resources to be set up for success within your role at the company.","Taxes in Germany are high is the only con but that is not Houzz's con.

It would be nice to be able to connect with the other teams who are in the London office but work in the same market as us to learn about any hurdles they are encountering and be able to just feel closer to them since we are selling into the same markets. We are a smaller office here in Berlin, I think connecting across all the countries could help everyone. Hearing different styles of approaching any objections is always refreshing and I think that we do not do that enough."
894,Houzz,Not at all what it seems....,2017-10-26,1.0,Account Manager,"Free breakfasts on Mondays 
Free lunches on Fridays 
Office wide events (birthday celebrations, baby showers, etc) 
Beautiful office in downtown San Diego with a look over the ballpark 
Great perks and decent benefits 
Fully stocked kitchen 
(All perks that a new grad would die for.....)","Paid Time Off (or lack there of). Updated to 17 days/year, based on your PERFORMANCE. Meaning if you are not performing, they will not let you use your earned PTO (illegal?) 
Lack of communication from managers 
Managers are picked based on how much they are liked in the office (game of favorites -- some are VERY unqualified, and others who deserve a promotion don't get one) 
Inability to move laterally (you CANNOT switch  departments from sales to customer service, vice versa) 
This role gets VERY boring; sales people get burnt out after reading the same script several times a day, every day for weeks and months, and selling clients who are NOT good fits because the remodeling industry is tapped on quality professionals. 
Employees are often treated like high-schoolers (dirty looks if you get up from your cubicle too often, scolded for talking to cube-mates during the day, etc) 
Work hours.... You MUST be in before 7am every day. Not flexible WHATSOEVER. 
There is no room for growth.... They have yet to create new positions to allow employees to advance in their role, and all of the management positions are filled so there is no upward movement. 
The markets are tapped so sales people are underperforming, thus there pay is severely suffering-- Top performers who would typically hit 8-10 sales are now hitting 4-5 sales and are being THREATENED to be put on performance plans, having their employment subject to how well they are doing. This is not fair and causes your employees to be disloyal."

The ladies who run the office do a good job with holiday themes/decorating, and making sure everybody is fed.","Leadership and management are questionable. They are not there because they are good leaders, but rather because they had a month or two with a lot of sales. News and changes are always sugar-coated, with management ignoring the negative implications as if they will simply go away if ignored. Sales are down. Way down."

When you ask a member of management for help or approach them with an issue they blow you off and won't help at all. No one really feels responsible for you – management always has some excuses! 

Communication

Every week a new rule is being implemented – communicated via mail, as management doesn’t feel comfortable to communicate face to face! This is not professional at all.

Attitude towards older colleagues

I did not see older workers.

What I dislike about the company

As a company of their size there should be more opportunities and higher pay. The training period is ridiculous. Instead of getting people fully trained, they just hope that you learn yourself. Every week some employees are leaving the company!"

Generally, all your coworkers are incredibly nice, happy people 
The office is nice","Upper and middle management are the masters of spin. They sell you on on the job over and over and over. Until one day you wake up and you've been spun so many times that you actually reckon with the reality that things have been bad for some time and the end is not in site. 

LEADS/SELLING NEW BUSINESS
I've held all 3 sales positions at the company (2 selling new business & one managing current clients/up-selling) and have seen an exponential shift in each one, typically for the worse.

I came on board right at the end of what seemed to be a great place to work (about 2 years ago).  So I know it was once great, but because of middle and upper manager turning a blind eye to the reality of the situation and over hiring, sales reps are quitting once a week. What was once warm (easy) calling, is now cold calling. The ""leads"" have become unsellable. The tops reps use to sell 15- 20 deals a month. The top reps now sell 6 on a good month. All of the bonuses are gone. Most sales reps are seeing at least 1/3 less salary this year compared to last and it's the simple fact that they have quadrupled (or more) the size of the sales team and everything is spread too thin. 

Common lunch conversations are that many of us are having a hard time paying bills because the pay has gotten so bad. The base is UNLIVABLE  for California. I can say with confidence that 75% of the reps are incredibly unhappy and suffocating from the lack of true leadership, lack of opportunity to sell enough accounts to pay bills, and lack of  strategic solutions for how these issues will be fixed. 

We've arrived at the point where some sales managers have publicly admitted that the leads are a joke. Everyone is being told to ""hang in there and stick with us"" yet we all have been doing that for a year since everything went astray (and no one in management listened).  They continue to try bandaid solutions and we watch them crumble month after month.

ROLL OUT OF CHANGES
Change is a great thing when rolled out efficiently. When there is a lack of communication, lack of resources for implementing these changes, and literally no answers for questions asked, change is detrimental....this is the majority of change I have experienced in my 2 years here. This has been the case with several compensation changes which were rolled out overnight, with no notice so employees could plan for the bills they have to pay."

The greatest quality about working for Houzz is their adaptability. They are constantly working to improve day to day procedures to make things more efficient. Most importantly, every time a suggestion is made it is strongly considered. Where else can you walk in to an Upper Management office, say you have an idea, and within weeks it is put in to action?

Everyone is encouraged to abide by this attitude, and so any issues get swept under the rug. Constructive feedback was often met with an incredibly apathetic attitude by management, even when we had solutions to problems in the job. 

The sales team were constantly given terrible leads, and although the contract describes the Account Executive role as warm calling, 90% of the time we were cold calling people. Our feedback on the terrible leads was met with ""make more calls"". I guess if you want to sit on the phone making 70 calls a day, reading off a script, then this job is for you.

It also came to light that new recruits were being deceptively misled in regards to  what to expect in terms of commissions and targets, so if you are interviewing, you do need to ask questions.

-Hours are early. SDR's, Account Executives, and Account Managers typically come in between 6-6:45AM (plus side is that you get off early enough to have a good work/life balance)

-You are on the phone for most of the day (this is a tech company all based online, so clients, vendors, etc. must be called to be contacted).

946,Houzz,A little dose of TRUTH,2017-05-07,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fully stocked kitchen 
Great friends and co-workers
Awesome office space 
Cross wide work events
Great health benefits","Unqualified leadership. Managers are selected based on how many times they say ""yes"" to everything through out their time at houzz. People who have been here longer are not given lead positions but rather people who are friends and close buddies of managers get opportunities handed to them. Through out my one year working here, I have seen a bunch of unqualified people get promoted. People I often see chit chatting in the kitchen or work lounges while the rest of their teams have piles and piles of never ending work to complete. 

Not all people are treated equally. 
Non sales roles have it very tough at houzz. They don't get promotions easily, the work load and the pressure to complete an intense amount of work leaves them feeling super unappreciated. Yet, they KNOW everything there is to know about houzz and the websites inner functioning. They deal with managers and leads and sales reps all day, being mistreated by some and still being reprimanded by their manager who just wants to cover his or her own butt. Their managers don't stand up for them either, making matters worse. Comp plans are changed constantly because certain people at the top don't feel *comfortable* giving the non sales reps 100% of their well deserved bonuses based on non tangible aspects of their job (even though their whole job cannot be easily measured with numbers). When questions are asked, managers are clueless, deflecting answers by giving basically non-answers. All of this while, you see the sales teams who make twice or three times as much as you go on incentive trips with the sales and account management teams that you had a part in helping them get as well. Instead of having a few members of these non sales roles be a part of these coveted incentive trips, you see your manager partake, even though they made ZERO contribution. This is very normal at houzz...you get rewarded for doing nothing (texting all day, instagramming and snap chatting is a must, but you're in trouble if you're constantly working. You must be crazy!) Even though they had zero to do with accomplishments of the sales teams. Again, unfair and completely biased mistreatment of support vs. sales roles in the offices. 

Culture of oppression. The culture of not asking questions, keeping your head down and smiling is an integral part of the misery that has been built up at houzz. Unlike my previous point, this happens across all roles and all teams. When new policies or projects are being rolled out and it is very apparent that NO thought or realistic expectations have been put forth, affected teams naturally get upset and feel unheard. Instead of standing up for their teams and communicating to upper management that these role changes and added responsibilities are just too much, managers act fake. Smiling and nodding yes to everything thrown to them because they are too afraid to actually give constructive criticism back to their own supervisor. 

Instead they aren't transparent about changes, and have their leads or other managers watch the reactions and spy on what the inner chatter of their teams are. They use this as a reason to set up unnecessary and painfully awkward meetings in which they accuse you of not being a ""team player"" and reminding you to be ""positive"" no matter how questionable things are. Basically throw out all reason and you shall be the perfect employee. You speak up and you will feel the burn. 

You will be falsely asked to give your true opinion and when you do, you are met with ""well it's important to be positive and to say yes to opportunities if you want to get ahead."" Meetings are also just a waste of time, full of empty promises and lies about the future of your role and your career growth. 

What these unqualified managers don't understand is that it's not that your teams are being resistant to new tasks, it's that they are reasonable human beings who are overwhelmed by the new responsibilities that come out of no where and very underwhelmed by the lack of care  and the poor pay that comes with all of it. Therefore, you see this happen to other people who speak up and as a result you get scared. You don't say anything to you manager even when she pretends that she wants you to be honest. And you get more and more fed up with true politics of this place when you see your manager and her friends talking in the kitchen and whispering for hours on end after a meeting you just had with them."

Typically everyone lunches together which is great for culture and relationships with colleagues.","- At the end of the day this is a pure tele sales job. There was a call centre vibe that I didn't like. You have to make 50 calls per day or at least 3 hours talk time. This may seem easy but when 80% of the people you're speaking to don't want to talk to you - it's frustrating.

- Cold calling! Say what you want but actually this role is about cold sales calls. Some are warmer than others but this is essentially the job.

- The role is very repetitive and dull. Strip away the lovely offices and apple products - your spending 8+ hours a day calling a list of people. 

- Office vibe. While some people live and breath the brand - many are very open and honest about their frustrations that the role is boring, the market is saturated and that there's not enough scope.

- There is a very limited window for scope and growth. As Account Executive, your progression would be to Team Lead which involves more responsibility to motivate yourself and a larger team for the same basic salary - I don't see the motivation for that?!"

Direction is unclear and changes often. The boots on the ground are often lost on why projects that have been pushed hard for months are suddenly abandoned or changed without acknowledgement. Important decisions that impact every day work for everyone else are bottle-necked at the very top and things don't get done for months and months at a time. Managers are rarely equipped to actually manage. Top sales performers are promoted to manage teams that they have zero experience. Information, skills and tasks are silo'd. Maybe one or two people only know vital, crucial pieces of the business and if they were to leave, I am fairly certain it would be a disaster.

954,Houzz,Run for the hills.,2017-04-13,1.0,Account Executive,You won't be the only person miserable here--you can be miserable with friends too!,"I’ll begin this long-delayed review with a quick history lesson. Remember the Gilded Age in the late 19th century? It was a time in history with tons of corruption, financial, and social problems being covered up with a gold mask of economic growth? Well, history is repeating itself. Houzz may be pretty on the outside and hiring like crazy, but it's nothing but a bunch of garbage covered in gold, and it will behoove you to read the rest of this review before sending in your application to work here.

On the outside, Houzz seems like a dream come true. I worked there for a couple years, and I remember thinking I struck gold when I was hired after seeing the fully stocked kitchen and beautiful office. We were told we had the opportunity to make well over 6 figures without a problem, and we had many more opportunities to build a career. But be warned, the management at Houzz is spewing nothing but trash out of the mouths on their pretty, deceptive faces.

The sad thing is, I think the company itself had (and perhaps still has) a lot of potential. This potential is being absolutely destroyed by the pathetic joke that is “management” at Houzz. None of these managers have any real experience at Houzz, but as long as you have slapped a smile on your face and become everyone’s yes-man, you’ll move up in the ranks quite a bit. The only thing I ever saw them doing was focusing on their social media, making this seem like the world’s best job. Oh, and how could I forget—they also add the dozens of fake 5-star reviews on Glassdoor which all seem quite similar, and will probably be sandwiching my truthful review very shortly. Those are direct orders from the person leading the OC office, but I’ll get into that disaster of a person in a moment. Don’t ever dare to ever complain about anything or question something in this office—you’ll pretty much be blacklisted and will ruin any chance (if you even care) of moving up. Moreover, the goals at Houzz are ridiculously unrealistic, and I could probably count on my fingers how many people actually meet those numbers. Management will probably fail to mention that to you while they’re hyping you up for a job here. If you do want to meet your numbers, you’ll probably need throw your sense of morality in the trash and sell your soul to the devil, since lying is the only way you can sell their advertising platform anymore.

The person in charge of this office is a monster. He has no concern for any of the employees here, and the only thing he’s good at is ordering employees to fill his personal fridge with diet cokes. He’s constantly changing the commission structure and frames it as if you’ll be making more money, but you’re actually getting screwed over. He’ll announce all these “favors” in an office-wide email, and don’t forget to thank him when he emails you all the wonderful things he’s doing for you! The management remembers who is explicitly thankful for his generosity using “reply all”, and if you don’t say thank you, you probably won’t ever get promoted. To add to it, I was at this office long enough to know he’s been in a couple lawsuits for harassing women in the office. And yes, he actually recruits his minions in management to write the excessive, fake, 5-star reviews you've likely read by now. I've witnessed it myself. 

Upon quitting, I learned from HR that the turnover rate at this office was pretty high (shocking, I know), but I'm probably not allowed to post that information here. Either way, I doubt it’s changed. You probably won’t be able to find out if that’s been updated though, since the whole HR team just quit. My advice, if it hasn’t been clear yet, is to run for the hills. You’re better off working literally anywhere else. 

And to finish this little history lesson, the Gilded Age ended with the rise of the Progressive Era, a movement where activists work to reform the corrupt policies and overthrow the businessmen and politicians that created the disaster. Let’s hope Houzz will have its own Progressive Era, and get rid of the clowns running this circus."
955,Houzz,Believe all the bad reviews,2017-04-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"-catered lunches on Fridays, catered breakfast on Mondays
-stocked kitchen
-younger demographic of employees, easy to make friends
-experience in a fast-paced work environment","You should probably take a screenshot of this review since it will either be deleted, or drowned out by 6 other fake reviews from upper management. This is based on my personal experience. It seems to be a theme throughout the company, but could vary based on your role and/or manager. The head of this office and his directors are a cancer to the company. They happened to be in the right place at the right time at the very beginning, and are under qualified to be in their positions. They spend most of their time indignant about their free lunch being late, micromanaging employees who do not even report to them, or getting heavily inebriated at company sponsored events. It’s a sorority Mean Girls environment - my manager has said terrible things about other people on my team in front of me too many times to count.

They will change your compensation plan without any notice, and multiple times per year. There is no structure whatsoever relating to positions and pay - someone in the exact same position as you with similar experience may be making much more than you dependent on whether or not the head of the office and his directors like you. The employees that get promoted into managerial roles go through no training whatsoever, even if they have never held a management position prior. Going to your manager with an issue is similar to talking to a brick wall. They have no boundaries, and will call you after hours, on the weekends, and expect you to handle the issue (no matter how minuscule) that instant. They claim it is a “start up environment” and the “nature of the job.” If you express discontentment or disagreement, you will be told you are “not a team player” or “you just don’t understand what the job is.”"
956,Houzz,Avoid working for Houzz!,2017-04-12,1.0,Marketplace Operations Coordinator,"Houzz is a horrible company to work for, a regrettable time in my life. Like many Glassdoor contributors have said, it’s a smoke screen. They try to appeal to millennials with company culture and perks like regular free food...possibly to hide the fact that they are a basic e-commerce company and a middleman for selling overpriced home goods? The vast majority of their employees are under the age of 35 and mostly women. It’s creepy and off putting that they lack diversity in hiring a broader range of ages (and so few men). They have terrible return policies and much of my job dealt with customers who were upset that their items arrived broken (or didn’t arrive at all).",DO NOT be fooled by the allure working in any of their roles that mention “marketplace” “operations” “service” or “commerce.” They disguise the job duties... you will be a call center worker dealing with a steady stream of irate customers.

Most teams that I've seen are very helpful to everyone asking for help.","You definitely need some creativity and outlook with how you'd like to branch off with your career in Houzz, either moving on internally or externally to another company. Nature of the work does get repetitive, especially having to talk to so many people in the day that you will get tired dealing with potentially mean/not-so-smart clients/customers. but it's the nature of the industry/business with a client-focused organization."

959,Houzz,An Actual Honest & Unbiased Review,2017-03-30,4.0,Account Manager,"If you haven't noticed already, Houzz offers a lot of great perks to their employees. Free food, social hours, incentive trips, and so much more. It's a great company to work for but you should note that these perks don't come without hard work. 

Many of the disgruntled employees are fresh out of college and shocked when they find out the job is more than free food and taking selfies down a slide. At the end of the day, this is a sales job. You are going to be turned down, you are going to get frustrated, and you are going to have bad days. That's life. But, as with any sales role, you are also going to have great days, weeks, and even months. 

If you are a hard worker then this company is great. Top performers receive a ton of great perks. They have incredible incentive trips and contests all year long which is great if you get to go.","The most frustrating part about Houzz comes down to the constantly changing commission plans. It can be extremely frustrating when every month your pay structure changes. 

The other reviews are also pretty spot on with management. While I will note that they do have some pretty great leaders in the office, a majority of the leaders lack experience and professionalism. It would be extremely helpful for management to go through some form of quarterly training and improve their leadership and decision-making skills."
960,Houzz,Customer Service Coordinator,2017-03-27,3.0,Customer Service Coordinator,"- Pay is decent for a just out of college position. 
- Everyone is friendly and helpful, especially when you're just starting. 
- Free breakfast on Mondays, free lunch on Fridays, and workout Wednesdays are nice little milestones for the week.
- Kitchen is fully stocked.
- Technology used is up to date and reliable, which I find is always a plus.","- The biggest con I encountered while working at Houzz was a clear lack of transparency. While I was being recruited, the recruiters and interviewers left out key information about the position and company and even told me things that I learned to be untrue very quickly after starting. For example, in this position, I was told that the job was not a call center job, calls were outbound only, work life balance was incredible, you could volunteer (they emphasized the word volunteer) to work on weekends and holidays as this is a customer service operation that doesn't stop. Once I started, it was finally revealed that you don't have much control over what shift you are assigned, you are assigned weekends and holidays and have to beg to have them covered or reassigned if you have something come up or want to take a vacation, and, of course, the office is 100% a call center where you are expected to be ready to take calls for 8 straight hours a day. This would all be a nonissue and a matter of opinion if it were not for the clear opposite things I was told during my long interview process. They put such an emphasis on company culture and how much they love their jobs, but it worries me that would be so dishonest from the get go to get people to accept offers and leads me to wonder what life down the road would be like if I wanted to stick it out longer.
- There is a lot of micromanagement in the Customer Service position - if you don't work well knowing that management tracks your number of calls, number of issues solved, and other data, this will give you anxiety. 
- Training does not prepare you for what you will handle in the day to day work of the role, but I think that's something most people are able to feel comfortable with quickly."
961,Houzz,"Be Wary, The Fake Glassdoor Reviews Are Scary, My Manager Was Very... Lazy",2017-03-24,1.0,Account Manager,"Do you watch the show Downton Abbey? It's like that. As an employee, you are the downstairs serving staff. You have the greatest of friends, the company gives you a bit of food, and a tiny cubicle to live in.

(Yes, you will LIVE in this cubicle. Before you apply, think about going into a tiny cubicle every day, staring at a computer screen, and talking on the phone for *2000 hours a year for a meager paycheck! Working here is solitary confinement, but with free chobani yogurt. If your eyes are ruined because of staring at a computer screen all day, you do have vision insurance. So, that is a pro. But, like, also a con.)
*52 weeks x 40 hours a week","Continuing with this analogy...
Your managers are royalty. They are not your friends. You are their servants. Bow your head and fall in line. If you question anything, they will simply hire another servant to replace you. Why do you think Houzz creates so many fake Glassdoor reviews? They have a huge recruiting team to trick future servants to apply. Believe it or not, Houzz Glassdoor reviews are more fake than the people who work here.

My ex-manager was the most incompetent, unintelligent, irrational, feebleminded person I have ever met. With absolutely zero experience, she was promoted to a managerial role because of her big smile and affable personality. *Ex-manager, if you’re reading this, affable means friendly and easy to talk to! I am giving you a compliment, yay!* Sorry everyone else, she’s a little a slow. Now back to the review…

After being in the role for a year, my ex-manager with no experience seemed like she still had zero experience. She asked my teammates and I for help with everything. She would ask other managers for help with the most simple tasks if she was too embarrassed to ask one of her servants. She knew nothing Jon Snow! Nothing! She had the memory and attention span of a goldfish, which is an insult to goldfish everywhere.

If you think I am exaggerating, please apply, get the job, and infiltrate this office to see for yourself. Houzz promotes people based on how likable they are. Luckily for my ex-manager, Houzz urgently needed someone who could blindly follow orders and she was in the right place at the right time. Like being born into royalty on the show Downton Abbey ya know?"
962,Houzz,Looks good from the outside....,2017-03-22,2.0,,"Relaxed environment, nice space - pros end there.","The direction of the business in Australia is so unclear, made even more foggy by management beating around the bush or promising things that won't happen. There's a strange dynamic surrounding importance/ranking of departments, with significant favoritism placed on the sales team. Management always seem to be playing a game of catch up - terrible time management and people management. Honestly, there are way too many dodgy things going on to cover in a brief overview. Steer clear."
963,Houzz,A Genuinely Honest Review of Houzz,2017-03-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at Houzz definitely has some upsides to it. The atmosphere and the people around you are what make working at Houzz somewhat enjoyable. The office is filled with exceptionally smart, young, and talented employees. The fully stocked kitchen as well as catered breakfast Monday’s and lunch Friday’s are always nice. It is a great first job right after college, but only for a few months.","It looks fantastic from the outside, but just wait until you get it in. Employees are promoted internally to management positions, which can be great in some cases, and disastrous in others. Just because an employee has been able to hit a quota does not mean they should be able to run a team. In some cases, managers are completely clueless about their position and only act as a support coach and cheerleader. The office is ran by two people who have complete control over everything. These two people have so much work on their plate that approval for anything can take multiple months. 

The word transparency does not exist at Houzz. Upper management is always working on something much different than the employees underneath them. Instead of keeping them informed, employees will find out about a big project by reading it in the news or hearing it through office gossip. 

Be prepared to have your compensation plan changed on a monthly basis. Upper management is always trying to find a way to increase your goals while decreasing your commission. 

Notice how all the five star reviews are almost identical? Am I the only one that thinks it’s a bit unsettling that management will post these reviews without actually addressing any concers in the office? I’m sure there will be another one following this, so just be prepared."

Unfortunately after the move and increased hiring of AE's the territories shrunk and my paycheck did as well.  Like many of us who fell for the dream it slowly turned to a nightmare.

971,Houzz,Houzz Australia is in Denial,2017-03-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people you work with are the greatest thing about Houzz, as it is a startup, you will find most of your colleagues are in their 20s and are typically amazing people.","Where do I start? Houzz Australia began as a place where you could join their staff and feel valued, heard and part of something that was growing and great. This has very quickly dissipated into a highly toxic environment where your only worth is based on how many cold calls you can make in a day.

Do not believe for a second, that you will be doing any type of ""marketing"" in this role. You will be required to make 100 calls a day, using the same script, day after day. There is little to no variety in your day at all. Management is completely incompetent and will send you emails every hour on the hour, showing the rest of the team, how many calls you have made, berating you if you have not done enough and effectively pitting the team against each other. 

This process could almost be deemed reasonable, if there were enough people to actually cold call. Management is in denial that the Australian market is anything like the US and will continue to tell you how many opportunities you have to make money, despite having to call people who have been already been spoken to multiple times and dealing with the rejection day after day. 

This is not even the worse part of the job, The complete and utter lack of management to take any responsibility in their role in creating this horrible environment is what will ultimately lead to Houzz's downfall. Their is absolutely no HR within the Australian office, so do not expect your opinions or concerns to be heard, they will fall on deaf ears or worse, be used against you to the point of bullying from management."
972,Houzz,Future Staff Should know the 'Truth' + Honest Feedback,2017-03-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Houzz is a good company and could be great, their platform is helpful and the technology developments are based on user needs. There is also really intelligent and kind people you can learn a lot from. The typical 'start-up' vibe exists with relaxed rules on dress code and bean bags for days, along with a kitchen stocked by their excellent office manager, with plenty of goodies to get you through the afternoon. The initial company retreat was a great bonding experience, the occasional dinners and company lunches and birthday cakes were a great touch too.","The typical start-up vibe only lasts so long and then the fundamental flaws in the business start popping up one after the other.  When offered my initial role I was promised a great mix of experience both in the office and at events with the chance to learn and grow as an individual and professional. Unfortunately, these were complete lies as I was expected to cold call (all-day every-day). There is very little differentiation in the role and it has NOTHING TO DO WITH MARKETING. I felt lied to and deliberately misled by the constant promises of future opportunities that never eventuated. 

The majority of issues at Houzz come from the inexperienced managers who are not only unqualified but have been promoted for being good in a basic role without having to show the ability to lead. These promotions were not based on experience or education and the culture at Houzz has suffered dramatically. The so called ‘flat organisational structure’ and ‘fair processes’ are also a lie, nepotism is rampant, and the already poor communication within and among teams is further convoluted by gossip being rewarded.

No natural leadership and the company not offering any legitimate training, means there are immature managers who create a lot of negative pressure, high school like drama and frustration throughout the company.  The biggest downfall is that when any concern is raised by staff the inexperienced managers are poorly equipped to respond and usually end up making matters worse by ignoring the issue or sweeping them under the rug. This has led to large number of staff feeling undervalued and personally insulted. 

There is no HR! No policy or staff member other than a referral option to the UK office. The MD is often wildly inappropriate and because of his position and the lack of any HR this has been a constant issue. Issues are referred to managers who have no understanding of the importance for staff anonymity which again results in staff feeling more frustrated and miserable.  The stated hiring standards of needing to be from a “top university” are a complete falsehood, there were a lot of hires based purely on pressure from the MD to fill positions. A “they’ll do” attitude was often apparent with many staff having no university education. 

A lot of great staff have left Houzz dubbing it a “toxic environment” with around 40% of the office leaving over the past 6 months, a few didn’t have another job. As others have mentioned this stat is a massive red flag for anyone considering Houzz. 

Final Advice: Houzz will not treat you like a valued employee and you can easily be paid more for doing far less in other companies. The toxic environment and reports from current staff that nothing has changed mean I would not recommend Houzz to anyone I cared about."
973,Houzz,Sales Development Representative (Account Coordinator),2017-02-26,5.0,Sales Development Representative (Account Coordinator),"Wow... where to start? First of all, the interview process was the best I've ever had. Training is extremely helpful and they REALLY make sure you know what to do in every situation possible. My manager is also extremely helpful, as is every one of my coworkers who seem genuinely happy to have me there with them. Management is transparent with information and make it clear that they're there to help you with ANYTHING and want you to grow and succeed. One of the best parts is that pretty much EVERYONE gets promoted within 6 months (with a pretty hefty raise!)! The sales goals are pretty doable without taking out the challenge of the role, keeps things exciting. Still in shock that you're FED for free every single day with breakfast catered every Monday and lunch catered every Friday (and I'm not talking Dominos pizza- I'm talking Tender Greens and other places that are actually GOOD for you and taste amazing!). Amazing benefits such as 401K and medical, AND MUCH MORE. Everyone is truly happy here, as far as I can tell from working here for 2 weeks and really trying to get to know people inside and outside of work at happy hours, etc. The job itself is not as monotonous as I feared and the day goes by quickly, especially since you arrive bright and early and leave by 2:30 or 3!","Again, while it's early for me, I still truly appreciate the way this company treats its employees and don't think that will change. While waking up at 4:30 every morning has been an adjustment, it's SO worth it to get off early in the day and NOT get home after dark. With any sales job, you will have to talk to some rude people and you will get hung up on, but the other wonderful conversations I have with some interesting people across the country make me forget the bad!"

2. There isn't a high bar when it comes to hiring. I did not feel that I was surrounded by smart people that I would learn from and could act as mentors for the rest of my career. Fun people? yes. Smart people? no. 

3. Regularly changing commission structure (typically resulting in you being paid less) without consultation.

4. Bizarre behaviour from some of the sales managers. Things like being nice and positive in person, but then going away and sending a 1,000 word email about people going to a doctors appointment without permission. It's much better to be honest and candid with your team! They also can come across as fake, pretending to be your friends but switching in a moment as all they care about is their number.

985,Houzz,Some Honest Feedback and Advice You Need to Read,2017-01-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Houzz is a great company in several ways. First, it’s an innovate product, and the features and technologies the company is building is definitely interesting. Secondly, there are also a lot of amazing, caring, talented, humble, and fun people at this company that you can create lasting relationships with. Lastly, Houzz provides a lot of “sexy” start-up perks such as fully stocked kitchens with fresh fruits, snacks, and drinks, fun and extravagant yearly company retreats, and nightly dinners and weekly Friday company lunches with birthday celebrations.","When I began working at Houzz, I thought I had hit the employment jackpot mostly because of the “pros” I listed above but also because when I started I felt like I joined a company with a culture that was one of a family and would help me learn and grow as an individual and professional. Unfortunately, those feelings didn’t last very long because soon I came to realize there were a lot of problems that made working here MISERABLE. The biggest problem I encountered at Houzz that contributed to a negative work environment was poor management. From my experience, 98% of the people who hold management positions at Houzz are not qualified to do so because they have no experience or training to be effective managers. Houzz has fallen victim to the fallacy that individuals who are strong in their field make good managers. Without the natural leadership and management skills or proper training, a manager may be able to manage and delegate projects, but he or she will not be able to do the people management portion of their job effectively. This issue has created a lot of tension and frustration across teams and throughout the company because whether you have an issue with the types of projects you are working on, a fellow coworker, or your personal development, the poor management here have no idea how to handle any of these situations appropriately making employees feel undervalued and misunderstood. 

Frequently, when issues are brought to management and HR, they are swept under the rug instead of addressed. Employees who voice their concerns are turned away with incessant excuses, so, naturally, these issues continue to get worse and again, employees are left to feel frustrated, hopeless, and undervalued. Houzz prides themselves on this flat structure, where everyone is on an equal playing field, and everyone has a voice in the company. Unfortunately, that’s a dream that they sell you, which isn’t true. Instead this “flat structure” has created an environment full of large egos and inefficiencies because decisions are funneled through a select few people. 

Finally, hiring standards have dropped significantly during my time at Houzz. There were many people that were hired because of pressure coming from upper management to get people in the door and fill positions, but this has created tensions within teams and again throughout the company. 
Due to these issues, there are several people that left Houzz in recent months without having another job lined up because of how toxic the environment was. To be honest, that in itself should be a VERY telling sign for those of you looking to join Houzz. 

My advice: If you have multiple offers or are thinking of applying here, don’t take the offer or apply. Go somewhere where you can be treated like a valued employee and get paid more. Every company is going to have its pros and cons, but I think the cons at Houzz outweigh the pros. If you were my friend, I would tell you not to work here and put yourself into such a toxic environment."

They have fully stocked refrigerator with healthy snacks for you to eat at any meal/snack. Houzz invest in their employees.  My dad is in insurance and he said we have hands down the best benefits he's ever seen. They have fantastic sales incentives, my first month I won 2 tickets to disneyland, a $150 giftcard, and tons of cash, ON TOP of my commission!","For those people that don't like the phones, this isn't for you. However, this is a awesome role in my opinion. I was in outside sales for 2 1/2 years pounding the pavement, being inside I enjoy a lot more. It is not a call center, you are building relationships with your clients and talking to them 3+ times to close a sell.

Some of my peers who were top sales performers are now leading teams. I love that Houzz promotes from within. Benefits are great. Medical, dental, vision are all covered 100%.

I am not writing this review out of malicious intent, but so often people are misguided by fake, sugarcoated reviews that are meant to overshadow legitimate insights.

While Houzz has some perks that would make many people in Silicon Valley jump at the chance to join, it unfortunately hasn’t scaled properly for its growth and is now paying the price. From an outside perspective, Houzz appears as a dream company to work for that is always positively portrayed in the news and praised by its users. But what most people don’t realize until a few months in with the company is the “democratic” leadership they promote is just a veil for what seems more like an autocratic environment. All decisions, including every single hiring decision, is funneled up to and approved by the CEO and President (a husband and wife duo). The pay is well below the average of most Bay Area startups, which can be a slap in the face when they’re always advertising how well the company is doing profit-wise, and the opportunity for growth is practically nonexistent. With a constantly growing office and very flat organizational structure, they’ve been unsuccessful in placing competent, experienced individuals in management type positions, which has caused a lot of tension, frustrations, and unhealthy work environments across many teams. The problem is then compounded by the fostered notion that passive-aggressive communication is the best way to handle employee complaints and struggles, rather than being upfront and transparent. Most leaders of departments just function as the puppets controlled by the wants and needs of the Founders, creating the inability to lead and make decisions on their own.

Another never-ending frustration is the constant accommodation that is only bestowed upon the engineering department. Everything from dinners to social events revolve around the schedule that engineers operate on, so unless you plan on hanging around the office until 6:30pm and beyond, you’ll unfortunately never get to experience these perks that automatically eliminates most people with children or who have a certain train to catch if they want to get home at a decent hour. This also applies to the “unlimited” PTO policy put in place, so I highly suggest asking questions about how a specific department treats that perk before taking on a position under that assumption.

Houzz’s inability to take critical feedback and make any changes at all to accommodate the evolving culture has caused them to quickly lose great talent across all departments of the organization. I so desperately wish the founders would open their eyes before they start losing any valuable team members they have left. A lot of people, including myself, have discussed what a poor outlook they have on the future of Houzz as a reputable and high-ranked employer and have begun researching better options. People just don’t deserve to waste their time and talent on an organization that doesn’t genuinely care about the employee experience."

1000,Houzz,Life at Houzz,2016-10-31,5.0,Account Coordinator,Love the atmosphere and the way that you are allowed to build your own work schedule as well as manage your own work,Job could be stressful and its repetitive.
1001,Houzz,The culture of Houzz is nothing but a smoke screen,2016-10-27,1.0,Account Manager,"Fully stocked kitchen and a modern, trendy office.","If you're looking for a job that makes you feel appreciated, useful, or that you are doing something of importance, this is not it. Almost every employee is a recent college graduate who is so new to the workforce that they don't recognize how underpaid or undervalued they are, and that is what the managerial team relies on. The job descriptions online are vague for a reason and that's because Houzz does everything they can to hide the fact that this office is a call center. You'll be told that all they want is for you to be happy here and that the culture of the company is their biggest focus but the truth is that your value directly relates to the number of sales you make and nothing more.

Everything is filtered through the top 3-4 people at Houzz who are too self-involved to ever recognize their employees are unhappy and are too inexperienced to ever make any sort of positive change. Most managers below them are inexperienced, have no formal managerial training, and have no real power in any decisions- even those directly related to their team members. The top 3-4 managers try their best to maintain the ""illusion"" of Houzz in that the culture is the most important part and everyone here is extremely happy but that only exemplifies the disconnect even further. 

Finally, their product is failing. It simply does not work like it use to but management is still insisting that impossible sales goals need to be met. When an employee is struggling, they are not encouraged and motivated in a positive way but rather are passive aggressively scolded and threatened and made to believe they are the sole problem. 

Sadly, this review will probably be buried immediately by suspiciously similar 5-star reviews within a few days. That just means the typical group of happy employees received their cue from management to go in and leave another positive review to bury the bad ones. 

To anyone looking to apply at Houzz, my advice to you is to listen to the negative reviews. They are the most accurate description of what the 500 employees of this company experience on a daily basis."
1002,Houzz,Intern Review,2016-10-25,5.0,,The internship position is flexible and fun.  It allows for shadowing other positions within the company.  I am always kept busy.,We spend half of the day working on tedious excel projects.

I have been working here for less than one year but it is honestly the best company I have ever worked for. It was a long process to get in but they are looking to hire the right people to continue with the amazing environment they have created. Good variety of work to keep me going and keep things interesting! Kitchen is always well stocked with unlimited coffee which helps too!",Guidance is not always consistent. As a young company they will consistently figure out ways to make things better part of which has resulted in inconsistent training and communication. The atmosphere is so positive that it doesn't bother me so much. Weekly training meetings do help a ton!
1015,Houzz,The Employee Ship is Sinking,2016-08-24,2.0,,"At face value, Houzz is a millennial's dream. Big, open office, catered lunches, team outings, reward systems, and all the bells and whistles of a Silicon Valley-esque startup. Underneath, however, is a rapidly growing sense of tension, dissatisfaction, and frustration. It's a rubber band just waiting to snap.

I'll start with the positives:
-Bright, fun team members
-Successful company
-A nice line on the resume","If you're looking for a job of substance, a challenge, an opportunity for professional growth, something fun that varies from day to day, or a career, you just won't find it here. I came in highly qualified and ready to put those qualifications to use. I realized the position was entry level, but I never expected to feel my job was better suited for a young college student's first internship. Most of the positions here are repetitive, goal/numbers-driven, mentally un-stimulating, micromanaged, and very, very unlikely to change anytime soon. If this was the only negative, I'd say take this job temporarily and then move on shortly, but unfortunately there's a lot more going on here. 

The pay is inexcusable. You cannot expect employees to feel valued or ""lucky"" (this word is used a lot here) when most of us can't afford to move of our parents' house (unless we have 2-3 roommates or a spouse who earns a lot more than we do – a common occurrence here). They'll offer you a job that pays 30-50% less than what similar companies pay. They'll tell you a 1% annual raise is ""standard,"" and a 1-5% raise for a lower-level promotion here is the norm. Needless to say, it's more than disheartening to hear senior management continually boast about the astronomical revenue of Houzz while our paychecks look like they do.

Benefits are decent but misleading. The ""unlimited"" vacation policy they pride themselves on is 15 days, including sick pay. Health insurance is fully paid, a nice plus. But alongside astoundingly low salary and tanking employee morale, this feels like a pretty small crumb of cheese. They'll tell you that they pay $1 million+ per year on food and that you should consider it part of your salary. I think I speak for hundreds of others when I say I'd have opted for livable wages in lieu of overpriced food.

Management is ultimately funneled through 1 or 2 people in an office of over 500. Mid- and lower-level management is, though usually emotionally supportive and kind, bogged down at best. Progress is slow to nonexistant. A company of this size needs real management training (there is none offered) so managers who are young and inexperienced are trained to manage rather than trained to funnel anything and everything through those high above them. It's essentially an illusion of multi-tiered management.

Lastly, it's baffling to know that when this review is read, it will be written off by senior management as the complaints of someone ungrateful (and promptly followed up with some eerily similar 5-star reviews). I've seen the reactions to criticisms about the company, and they are almost never taken seriously or respected by those with true authority. I wish I had the magic words to make it all click to them. All of the above is why turnover rates have exploded in this past year, especially in recent months. Valuable, capable, and dedicated employees are leaving by the boatload for careers that offer a challenge, growth, fair compensation, and a future. 

These aren't the selfish rantings of an entitled millennial; they're realities that are causing serious distress beneath the protein bar- and dollar sign-laden surface of the company. I've loved my team and some of my experiences here, and it's my sincere hope that things change here fast. If they don't, I can't foresee Houzz having a happy or loyal employee base anytime soon."
1016,Houzz,Company who cares,2016-08-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,They hire extremely well and make sure that you are given the tools to succeed.

1018,Houzz,Associate Buyer,2016-08-09,3.0,,Usually never a problem to leave on time. You can create your own hours if you like to get in early and leave early you can. Kitchen is fully stocked and there is always plenty of food so you dont have to go out to eat or pack a lunch.

Every day is different and I am constantly being motivated by my peers and by management to improve and succeed. 

The culture at Houzz is unlike that of any other company. Management makes it a point to foster a fun and exciting work environment so that people are motivated when they get in to the office. Working in a team environment not only makes me want to work harder, but it pushes me to be a better employee each and every day.

-On Wednesdays we are allowed to wear workout clothes to the office
-Your management team truly cares about you and your success-- if you ever have anything you would like to speak up about, they are always open ears and will be completely honest with you in their responses.
-There is SO MUCH room for growth with new positions always being created being that we are a rapidly growing start-up

I look forward to coming to work everyday because of everything this company provides and the culture they have created.","I do not see these as ""cons"", but more so as requirements of the job that some may not be fond of:

-Hours are early. Account Managers typically come in between 6-7AM (plus side is that you get off early enough to have a good work/life balance)
-You are on the phone for most of the day (this is a tech company all based online, so clients, vendors, etc. must be called to be contacted).

You have to be persistent and disciplined and its not for everyone. We make about 100 cold calls a day and talk to a lot of different people with different personalities.

Perks: Constant rewards, gift cards, team events and trips. My boyfriend now looks forward every week to the free meals, movies and gifts from Houzz!

I want to be very clear that I was NOT asked to write this review. I have worked in multiple different jobs after graduating college and Houzz is by FAR the best job I have ever had. I love working for such a well known brand. I love the product we are selling.

1043,Houzz,#Worstjobever!,2016-05-06,1.0,Account Executive,-The people you work with (minus upper management) are really wonderful.  I feel confident in saying I made lifelong friends here.,"I really don't know where to start.  First off, can we just all agree that the positive reviews on here sound completely unauthentic?  Isn't it a little convenient that after one negative review, 10 overly positive reviews pop up??  Hmm.  Maybe management should stop focusing on their Glassdoor reviews and the perception they have on social media and focus on real life.  Talk to any employee at Houzz after hours and the majority of them absolutely hate it there.  But on social media, they are still reppin' the #bestjobever hashtag.  Don't let it fool you. 
- Lead distribution is unfair.  There is some shady business going on at this company.
- Am I an adult or a toddler? Is this a respected company or a daycare? I wouldn't know since we were treated and watched like we were a bunch of children.  I was once yelled at by upper management to ""GO TO MY DESK AND EAT!"" When I finally took a break after being chained to my cubicle 5am-1pm and sat down in the lunchroom to eat my sandwich.  I couldn't even take 5 minutes away from my desk without someone in management telling me to go ""SELL SELL SELL!!""  Mind you I was one of the top performers at the time so I was doing just fine. 
- Bottom line is that the job itself is soul sucking.  You are locked in your cubicle for hours cold calling businesses that don't want to hear from you."

Fully stocked kitchen and free Friday lunches are nice too.,"Despite all the incredible reviews about how much people love their jobs, a change is definitely needed within the organization. It is widely known throughout the office that employees are asked to leave raving reviews on Glassdoor to offset the negative. You’ll probably notice that for every bad review almost immediately there are 4-5 raving reviews that sound nearly identical.

It’s nearly impossible to get an accurate response to a question from management, seeing that every decision has to go through one head manager. While things seem logical or obvious no changes will ever be made without the approval of one key person in charge who has no idea how some of the departments are actually ran. The Marketplace department is often referred to as a “startup within a startup” but the only real reason for that is management is so far removed from what actually happens that growth is unobtainable. Upper management is so focused on hitting unrealistic goals set from the CEO who spends nearly no time with the teams that they end up not just micromanaging, but putting their efforts towards growing a large site with no quality content. Selling products on Houzz is pitched as an incredible opportunity for a new online platform, when in reality the company puts zero focus on actually growing the business or sales; their only priority is to get as many products as possible so they are worth more…not actually building anything of value.

If you can deal with all of the micromanagement and secrecy within the company, you should probably know that you can’t expect consistent pay either. Many employees were “promoted” into the new Marketplace department being told there would be lots of room for growth and expansion, when in reality even management doesn’t know the path for many positions & you will receive a pay cut. Shortly after I moved into a position within MP and realized commission structures not just changed but were significantly less than what had ever been before. I reached out to management with confusion on how I could be given a promotion, yet not have the opportunity to even make as much as I did in an entry level position and I was told “are you here for the money, or the opportunity to work for a company like Houzz”….I’m here to make money, if I wanted great opportunities I would be traveling the world, not sitting in a lime green call center.  They also said things such as ""You were never supposed to make that much money in that role."" due to the teams ability to over exceed goals."

The culture at Houzz is one where you feel respected and rewarded for your hard work. Management truly wants the best for each individual and provides all the resources necessary for every employee to succeed. I especially appreciate that they invest in their employees and provide opportunities for growth and development. By far, this is the best company I have ever worked for!","I have not experienced any ""cons"" however, if you are not an early riser it could take a little while to get used to the early start time (due to bi-coastal clientele)."
1052,Houzz,Houzz is great!,2016-03-23,5.0,,"I worked at Houzz for almost a year and I loved it! The people are what make it such a great place to go to work to everyday. All my co-workers were friendly and helpful when it came to questions and training. My managers were positive and I was always  recognized for my work. 

Another great part of Houzz is the ability to move around within the company. They encourage you to try new positions if you are interested in it. They also love to promote within the company, making it possibly to become a manager if that is your goal. 

Overall, Houzz is a great place to work with many benefits. They take care of their employees and also provide them with awesome benefits and many perks. They promote a healthy lifestyle, and have the kitchen stocked with healthy snacks and catered lunch on Fridays. They also have alot of team bonding activities outside of the office. It is a great company to work for!","I never came across any major cons. Since it is a new company, and they are hiring a lot, you will move desks multiple times."

1054,Houzz,Unique international culture with ton of energy and buzz everyday,2016-03-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Houzz has grown so fast here in europe. we have grown out of 4 offices in the past years in london. and it has still kept that startup vibe and culture though as we’ve grown.
- great people - really feels like a family. no egos or politics. very flat orginasation.
- amazing managers - so accomplished and inspiring. always their for everyone, very caring and open. MD and VP is always around and very accessible. no hierarchy. even CEO makes regular trips to london and always approachable.
- super international with more than 10 languages spoken in the office everyday with so many country teams based in london. everyone is always happy to help each other and share best practises across countries.  
- big open office where everyone just sits at a desk with no meeting rooms. noisy but lots of energy and buzz all day long. fun startup atmosphere.
- always something to do. fun office events with international flavour - food from your home country, happy hours, birthday celebrations.
- lots of room for growth, launching pro plus and marketplace, its become a bit overwhelming with so many countries and businesses launching at the same time.","- work hard, play hard. often in the office to 7/8pm at night. if your on a euro team, you have to be in early because the pros are in an hour earlier. 
- pressure to hit goals. mngt is very numbers focused, but always their to help you out and very hands on. their is a roll up the sleeves attitude and they really do work beside you."
1055,Houzz,Account Coordinator,2016-03-14,5.0,Account Coordinator,"Houzz has the security of an established company, but the feel of a start-up, which I absolutely love. In this position I speak with home professionals throughout North America and help them build profiles on Houzz. I love talking to lots of different people everyday and hearing their stories, so I find this very enjoyable. The company culture is fun, fast paced, and full of growth potential, and my coworkers are bright, motivated and friendly...I love my job here!","At first I thought the hours would be hard, but after I adjusted to starting my day between 6-6:30am, I can't imagine going back!"
1056,Houzz,Account Coordinator,2016-03-13,3.0,Account Coordinator,"This company is amazing to work for is you're going into sales. If you aren't, don't bother. The office in Irvine has nothing to offer you if you don't do sales. Basically a glorified call center that makes 30K cold calls a day.","Non-sales roles are not acknowledged and Houzz does a few things that are illegal, such as not paying their employees for using their personal phones to make calls when the phone lines are down and to access their SF accounts on a daily basis."
1057,Houzz,Marketplace Logistics,2016-03-09,5.0,Marketplace Logistics,"I have been working at Houzz for almost a year and a half, and it is such an inspiring company to work for. The extensive opportunity for growth within the company is an excellent source of motivation. The work culture is one that I am so grateful for. My coworkers are intelligent and creative - I cherish the friendships I have made. I could not feel luckier or more thankful to be a part of the Houzz family.","While I do not believe the following is a con, it is worth noting. Flexibility is essential, as we are ever-evolving and continually growing."
1058,Houzz,Account Coordinator--San Diego,2016-03-08,5.0,Account Coordinator,"I am an Account Coordinator in San Diego, CA and I absolutely love my job at Houzz. It is not just a job, I feel that I have found my career at this company. I feel that it is super rewarding to sell something that I believe in and that can change people's lives. My day consists of calling at least 80-100 professionals a day, but my job is to introduce them to sign up for a business profile for no charge, that could potentially change their career and change their life. Also, the leads you are calling are given to you, which saves a lot of time during your day, which therefore, increases your productivity. There is nothing more rewarding than explaining the benefits of Houzz and helping professionals create a profile on our website that will only benefit their business. I am also very proud to say that I have surpassed my goal last month and that it is very possible to do every month with enough drive and persistence. Also, the company culture is absolutely amazing. The people that I work with are people that I can call my friends and I enjoy going to work every day. My managers are always very nice, organized and helpful. In addition, my managers have meetings with us one on one to help us grow and improve.","The hours are a little bit different. You are arriving at work very early in the morning, but you are leaving work in the early afternoon. Leaving in the afternoon is very nice for any doctor appointments or other errands that you want to get done before dinner."
1059,Houzz,Houzz about that for a great Job!,2016-03-07,5.0,,"There is nothing more satisfying for a driven and ambitious individual than to be rewarded with responsibility, opportunity and the trust of those who you work for. I have watched Houzz reward so many who display courage, drive and passion in their work with new opportunities, responsibilities and trust. I have been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to experience the exciting, vibrant world of Houzz from within. Opportunities to grow, learn, develop and challenge oneself abound.","I believe you will experience highs and also not so high moments in your work life. This will be the case in every single job you undertake or organisation you work in. The difference at Houzz is that the highs utterly dominate and where challenges arise you are able to overcome those alongside and with the support of highly intelligent, intellectual, caring and brilliant people. I take huge satisfaction from working in an environment where the people and management are fundamentally drawn to grow and improve the organisation for the better of those they aim to serve as well as those within."
1060,Houzz,Software Engineer,2016-03-07,5.0,Software Engineer,"Houzz is an amazing place to work.  I've been here almost 3 years and couldn't be any happier with how it's grown.  Given my own experiences and friends of mine, I've seen/heard of many ways high growth startups can grow poorly.  Here's some of the things Houzz has been doing right.

- Keep the hiring bar high and focus on culture.  We love our peers and don't add folks to the team that we think can maintain that vibe.
- Empower everyone to own their part of the product and drive it.  Avoid bureaucracy that slows work and doesn't allow every tea member feel like they own the product
- Be self-aware about the changing / evolving nature of a growing startup.  
- Hire amazing people seasoned with years of experience from the tech giants around us

That covers the way we work, then there's the product itself.  Having done a fair amount of remodeling myself I have experienced lots of pain and prior to joining Houzz, found it to be an invaluable tool.  It's great knowing that a product you are working on has already been useful and useful in a process that is highly commercial.  I'm looking forward to helping make the product work even better for our users and myself.","As with any growing startup there's always some small amount of chaos, but this chaos and fast pace is part of when helps us move the product fast and have fun testing lots of ideas."

1062,Houzz,Senior Account Manager,2016-03-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I am grateful for the amazing opportunities provided by Houzz. The company allows you to work in an environment that is not micro managed. If you work hard and do your job, your success is has no limits. What kind of company, rewards you with gift cards, trips, etc for just doing your job? This company does. I am blessed to have the opportunity to work with fantastic people and clients. This is not a regular sales job. I work in a beautiful office, I have the potential to make great money, past two years, I have more than exceeded what I made in any previous job. My clients enjoy hearing from me as the calls I make are warm calls.  I love coming to work. I love my job. I love houzz. People have your back, your best interest at heart and actually care about you as a person.  We have amazing management and CEO. I am blessed.","No cons, this is a great company!"

1064,Houzz,Absolutely Love My Job!,2016-03-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I could not imagine an environment more conducive to success. Once you become an employee at Houzz, you are part of a family. Management genuinely cares, and co-workers are always supportive of one another! 

and then of course.. the perks..

we're completely spoiled!

I rarely bring a lunch/ go grab lunch, because I don't need to! The fully-stocked kitchen and coffee bar have everything you could ever want. 

There are always contests and rewards too- just for doing your job.

Employees at Houzz work HARD, but it doesn't over feel like you're over-worked. The focus on work-life balance is great, and I always go home not feeling bogged down by my job.","If you're someone who fears or dislikes change this may be a tough environment for you. That being said- all of the changes happening are GOOD. Houzz growing rapidly, and thus must change to accommodate. Not much of a cons list, because there really aren't any."

1069,Houzz,Best company I've ever worked at,2016-02-28,5.0,Finance,"I’ve been at Houzz almost 4 years and it has been the best company I’ve ever worked at.  I am super proud of what we provide to our communities and it shows.  If I wear a Houzz T-shirt out, I get constantly stopped and people just have to comment how much they love Houzz.  That great feeling I get while talking to folks outside of the company – this same passion is also very much alive inside the company.  Everybody is treated the same, nobody is more “special” or more important – neither our CEO nor any other employee.  Very few people leave the company, and those who do soon realize they should have stayed.  I love Houzz and the people that work here.",I really cannot think of any Cons - you are really in control of your experience as part of this unbelievable company.
1070,Houzz,AMPD,2016-02-26,5.0,AMPD,"I moved here from Michigan after experiencing the coldest winter ever to start in San Diego on June 15, in  the heart of summer. So I knew things were all ready looking up,  but what I didn't know was how much this opportunity would change my life for the better.

There is an unlimited amount of pro's to this job.
1) Getting to build your own schedule around your clients needs.

2) Starting a routine that truly improved my quality of life. I now am in the office between 6-630 every single day and leave around 2:30-3 everyday. This is astronomically different then getting home at 6 every evening with traditional 9-5's. I have so much of my day that I now take advantage of that I didn't before. Sure, I am sleeping in my onesie by 10-1pm on most weeknights but the amount of fun activities I do during the week due to this schedule I.E. Go to the beach, happy hour, working out, and more has truly increased my quality of life.

3) THEY PROMOTE FROM WITHIN. This company truly wants each and every one of their own to grow. They invest in us just as much as we invest in them. I have been here for 7 months and have seen people that were in my position move to higher positions all over the company.

4) Unlimited amount of resources to succeed. If you need help there are managers, team leads, mentors or other colleagues standing in line, raising their hand to hop on a call and help you. This isn’t a “struggle in silence” kind  of company. My leaders and peers have attributed so much to my success based off of their ability to serve as a resource when or if I need it.

5) Amazing culture and company morale. I have met some of my greatest friends in San Diego at Houzz. Everyone is incredibly driven, motivated, helpful, stylish, beautiful inside and out and most important, genuine. Again, I have been here 7 months and have heard of no ' arguments ' amongst colleagues. The culture here is unlike anything I have ever experienced. I’ve been in sororities, I played multiple sports in high school, I was in the band, and I joined several clubs in college and high school and this is truly the greatest team I have ever been apart of. Its a team that goes beyond my colleagues that share my same position. I truly feel as if the leadership and management at this company are very much apart of the team. I’v never been given the feeling that someone with a higher ranking was exhibiting a “power trip” because thats just not how the culture is here. We are all here to succeed and everyone wants to help everyone do that. Bottom line.

6) Management. I know i’ve all ready touched on this but it truly deserves more mention than one. The management here was once just like us. They understand what we do day in and day out. They provide feedback that is not only helpful but RELATABLE. 

7) Eat your heart out. What company feeds you? I don’t know about you but I came from the midwest where we occasionally got donuts in the morning and Pizza for lunch.. and that was RARE. This place is fully stocked with healthy, natural energy releasing snacks and foods to help us get through the day. You won’t find a single thing that isn’t good for your soul here in our kitchen. On top of that, they make Monday’s a little easier with catered breakfast and Friday’s even better with catered lunch. I can’t remember the last time I “went out to lunch” because even when I bring my own lunch I sit with my peers overlooking all of downtown San Diego. It truly gives me time to unwind for 30-60 minutes before getting back to the grind.

8)GRIND. This brings me to my next PRO. And yes this is a PRO. This job is a GRIND. Honestly, what did you think you were getting yourself into when you were hired to sell advertising on the nations leading home remodeling and design platform?  This job is a self fulfilling, self motivating grind. However, if you stick to the process that you are taught this job will be both financially and emotionally beneficial to your life. Everyday is different here. That’s what makes it more exciting. As long as you stick to what your taught and give 110% everyday, the results WILL come. There are PEAKS and VALLEYS with this position. I would like to know the job that is a consistent PEAK. Anyone? There isn’t one. You have to work hard to play hard. 
	But the great thing about Houzz is, it’s easy to stand behind. You are selling a program that works. You are a selling on behalf of a platform that is well known in the industry. You aren’t selling medical supplies to monkeys. This is a company that has a great culture, full of motivation and determination. Our CEO literally comes down from HQ quarterly to keep us in the loop with whats happening. OUR CEO! Which by the way, is our FOUNDER! Can you say..BUSY? Yet she makes time every quarter to visit her SALES office? We are one branch out of many in the company. I feel lucky to be given the opportunity to listen to her passion and hear how she balances it all. I don’t know how many people at Facebook see Zuckerberg on a quarterly basis but  I am pretty impressed by this.

9)Lastly, I need to touch on what we do day to day. If you expect to just show up, do the bare minimum and skate by, then this is not the job for you. What we do here, is call some of the top professionals in the home improvement  industry to teach them how they can use Houzz  to grow their business and reach a high end user base that they can’t reach with word of mouth. Do I get hung up on? Sometimes. Do I go days where all I am doing is prospecting? Yes. (Not sure how anyone would make a sale with out prospecting… so I’m unsure why others would label this as a con, I definitely wouldn’t) but there ARE times when I have an incredible conversation with someone that LOVES Houzz and had no idea they can use it to gain business form their local high end home owners. And those are the calls that keep me going. At the end of the day you are educating and partnering with some of the more elite professionals in the industry and helping them get projects using a very powerful platform. Its nearly impossible to have anything negative to say about what I do for a living.","I will try to use the 20 word minimum that is requested for this section. The only con would be if you don't enjoy waking up early, getting longer days out of your life and experiencing more that life has to offer by being able to get off earlier. If you are a sleep until 10 kind of person it may take some getting used to. But I PROMISE it's worth it! Seize the day."
1071,Houzz,I'm so lucky!,2016-02-25,5.0,Customer Service Team Lead,"I have worked at Houzz for a little over a year now and could not be happier! I currently work in their Marketplace and am surrounded by such creative, friendly, and overall outstanding individuals. The culture at Houzz is something that I truly cherish and am so thankful to be a part of. I hope everyone has the opportunity to love their job as much as I do and be apart of a family like Houzz.","Houzz is continuously growing and constantly changing, which some people may not prefer, however, I do feel that this is something that contributes to the success of the company and in addition, should be something people look for in a company."

1075,Houzz,Houzz Marketplace,2016-02-17,5.0,Customer Service Coordinator,"I have truly enjoyed working here! I feel incredibly lucky to work with such intelligent, creative and driven individuals. The environment is incredibly fast-paced, and we face new challenges within Customer Service each day. Although we take a lot of calls throughout the day, we use a sophisticated ticketing system that helps us easily manage the workload. Not only is the job itself rewarding, but there are a lot of perks to go with, including great health care, fully stocked kitchens, and the latest in office technology! If you enjoy meeting, bonding and sharing work experiences with a growing, thriving and diverse company, then you will fit in perfectly! The company rewards its employees with: monthly birthday parties, catered lunch every Friday, extravagant Holiday parties, etc. Houzz is the most positive and accommodating work force I have ever been a part of!","There aren’t necessarily any cons at Houzz, but dependent on the person there is one aspect that could be unfavorable for some. There is a lot of movement throughout the company, and as a start up things change frequently.  If you are a person who likes a concrete routine and monotony, this may not be the right opportunity for you."
1076,Houzz,Great work environment!,2016-02-17,5.0,Marketplace,"When I first applied here I didn't believe the hype. I work on the Marketplace side and work closely with sellers to help upload products as well as improve their performance. After working here for a little over a year now, I realized that it is definitely the culture that makes it a great place to work.  What I love most about working here is the support I get from my manager and the friendships I have developed with the people on my team. There is so much opportunity for growth, and I love that they promote from within.  We also do fun things like surprise baby showers, or celebrate birthdays! We also have lunch team building events to get to know each other better.","It really depends on your perspective, if you like having a normal daily routine where you are doing the same thing everyday then the Houzz Marketplace is not a fit for you. You have to be adaptable to change, and be prepared to learn new things."
1077,Houzz,MP Department,2016-02-15,3.0,,"Houzz has a great work environment. You are surrounded by friendly and intelligent young professionals who work hard and support each other. All the employees at Houzz are very personable and you definitely end up building great friendships! There is a fully stocked kitchen, and there are catered lunches on Fridays.","Despite all the raving reviews Houzz's organization definitely needs to change. There is a huge lack of communication between managers and employees and often times it takes a few weeks to receive an accurate response to a question. On top of that there is a lot of micro-managing which creates a lack of trust between managers and employees. 

Every decision is funneled through to one major decision maker so although the company is growing rapidly, there is no real change and your career is stagnant. There is no long term growth within the company and all the positions including ""promotions"" are equivalent to entry level positions. Houzz also creates a facade where it seems as if everything is going great, but it is discouraged to address certain issues and your concerns are usually met with rebuttal. The base pay structure is very low and the commission structure is also very inconsistent. When you reach out regarding specific details about your paycheck, the inquiries often go ignored."
1078,Houzz,This Is How Sales Should Be!,2016-02-14,5.0,Account Manager Professional Development,"I love working at Houzz. I don't consider myself a ""veteran"", but at the same time I'm not brand new, and I've loved every second of it. I've had inside and outside sales jobs and I've never been part of a sales office that is so positive where everyone gets along and encourages each other. 

Yes, you make a good amount of calls, but it's an inside sales job so it's to be expected, but you are not cold calling. The people you talk to already use Houzz and are typically excited to hear from you. This is something I've never experienced. I was skeptical during the interview process, thinking they were sugarcoating the day-to-day, but it's exactly how it was described. This is a fun sales job with lots of growth opportunity. I've been there just under a year and I'm amazed at the growth I've seen. I'm not necessarily a top performer, but I think I'm doing decently well, and have been recognized for my success both individually and in meetings. They don't just recognize top performers, they acknowledge everyone for their own individual achievements. I've never felt appreciated as an ""individual contributor"" like this before and it truly makes the natural ups and downs of a sales job that much easier to get through. Everyone has your back, it's great! 

From the sales management all the way to the CEO, they are great. The managers give you all the support you need to be successful. As long as you are open to coaching, you'll do great. The managers you work with were once in the Account Manager Professional Development (AMPD) position, so they can speak directly from experience when giving coaching or doing trainings. The CEO is great, she even comes to the office every now and then to meet with us one on one and while she is running a huge international company, she remembers your name and really makes you feel like you are part of something really big and exciting, rather than just a number. It's clear that she cares about her employees' overall wellbeing and not just about hitting sales goals. 

Overall, I love this company. My previous jobs don't even compare, this is not a job, working for Houzz is a career. Yes, there are normal ups and downs that come with sales, but it's sales, and you can make a lot of money (6 figures) and you get constant training and coaching to help you get there without any sense of micro-management. I would highly recommend working at Houzz for anyone that wants to be part of a fun company, with a positive and motivating company culture, where there is clearly a future for each and every employee.","This is tough, but I would say maybe having to get up early. Most people are on the phone by 6:30 in the morning. Not necessarily a con by any means, just something you have to adjust to if you're not a morning person."

The company culture, fully stocked kitchen, fun outings and prizes are just a few pros but my coworkers are the best part.

I look forward to growing with this company because only good things are to come!",You have to be a morning person! We do get in really early but you also have to be self motivating.

For a sales office, this is the most positive work environment I've ever seen. Everyone motivates and encourages each other to be successful, and while you are working your own accounts, there is a strong sense of community and team camaraderie. Houzz is growing and knowing that there is growth opportunity and a career path makes it an exciting company to be a part of. 

You make a lot of calls, but it's not cold calling, people actually want to talk to you. Seeing how Houzz has had such an amazing impact on people's lives only makes it easier to pick up the phone and call people. The earning potential is endless and you really are in control of what you want to make, which is a lot. 

When I started there was a small team, now there are multiple positions and many more people. I can't wait to see where we will be a year from now! I would highly recommend this job to anyone that wants to be in sales, but is looking for a fun, positive, and exciting work environment.","I can't really think of any.

1086,Houzz,It was my first job out of college!!,2015-12-14,5.0,Account Manager,"-Growth! After JUST 3 months of being an AC - I earned a promotion that allowed me a nearly 15k pay raise into a sales role. 
-Culture: There is no other place I've worked (I've had a few positions in various different companies during my undergrad years) where I've loved my co-workers, met such fellow hard-workers, breakfast on Monday's, lunch on Friday's, fully-stocked kitchen, etc. etc. etc. The list goes on! I just earned a huge gift card to Southwest to take me on a trip to Seattle! Unbelievable.
-Pay - I've never felt underpaid. In my mid-twenties and I'm well paid and gift cards, bonuses, incentives are extra on top of commission and base- it's sales so, of course, it fluctuates, but performance means extra money which is great.","-Sales is sales - looking at the bigger picture is key.

1088,Houzz,Brilliant Business - Poor Culture,2015-12-04,2.0,AMPD,"- Houzz Employees – Nothing but great things to say!  You’re surrounded by talented, respectful, smart, and fun people.

- The Product – It works!  It’s very rewarding selling a product to a business and seeing that business grow.

- Kitchen – It’s in every review..it’s free and fully stocked.  But, all the free food in the world won’t make up for the Con’s of working for this company.

- Benefits - Excellent!  Better than any previous employer.","- Culture – Yes, we still celebrate birthdays and baby's monthly.  We still have a Holiday party and company picnic.  But sadly, the culture and environment have changed for the worse. 

- PTO – 15 days, which is decent.  The downsides - #1 Taking more than 1-2 days off in a week  will actually hurt you because of the way accounts are distributed.  #2 - Expect to use PTO if you leave an hour early to pick up children from school, have a doctor appointment, etc.  #3 Of course you get Holiday's off, but they also encourage you to work through them.

- Compensation – Making good money isn’t sustainable.  You won’t make enough to live comfortably in Orange County…. unless you have roommates or live with parents.  If you’re 20-something, this is a great 1st or 2nd job.  If you have sales experience and are looking for career growth/high earning potential, I wouldn’t recommend this.

- Incentives -  In the past, there were a few per year.  Now they happen multiple times per week.  You'd think it was motivating, but I'd rather have a better compensation plan, or higher base.

- Upper Management - Poor communication from upper management (which is really only 1 person in the Irvine office) and lacks leadership qualities.  There has been a tremendous amount of growth (which was expected) and it seems like management makes quick/rash decisions, which negatively impacts the culture.  When I started with Houzz, I thought it would be a long-term career.  I’m now seriously considering leaving."

- You are essentially an intern on a team, but legally you are an independent contractor which can sometimes be confusing when it comes to NDAs."
1093,Houzz,Marketing Researcher,2015-11-07,4.0,Marketing Research,"Well-known Silicon Valley company. 
Experience.",Meeting the minimum of 20hrs/week of work while a student is difficult
1094,Houzz,"Excellent Culture, Some Downsides",2015-10-21,4.0,Anonymous,"There are so many wonderful things about working at Houzz. To begin with, the Irvine office itself is fantastic. The aesthetic is great and the environment is relaxed, bright, and cheerful. There is a massive kitchen stocked with fresh produce, vegetables, eggs, drinks, and every healthy snack you can think of. You don't ever need to bring breakfast or lunch if you don't want to--making food in the kitchen every day is very doable and delicious. There is also a catered lunch every Friday and catered breakfast every Monday. 

The people are another big positive of working here. Everyone is friendly, intelligent, enthusiastic about the company, and easy to get to know. For someone in his/her mid-twenties, it's ideal. There are hordes of young, fun, like-minded people that make coming in to work every day so much more exciting. 

The managers are also young (for the most part), which means they're usually very approachable, down to earth, and adaptable. Most people in the company embrace change, which is refreshing and also necessary as there are frequent changes and restructuring going on at all times. 

I like how Houzz places a big emphasis on direct communication and face-to-face interaction with your colleagues and managers. Managers schedule regular one-on-one sessions with everyone to go over your workload, iron out any issues, chat about life, and talk generally about how everything is going. 

Beyond all this, there are also regular social events, free fitness classes every month, and quarterly meetings with the CEOs, who are super down to earth and eager to meet everyone who works for them.","The pay for employees in the marketplace division of the company, particularly the Product Coordinator team, is minimal in comparison with the absurdly high cost of living in Orange County. The pay is especially tough on younger people and recent grads, who may still be dealing with student loans and may not yet have the additional support of a two-person income. Plus, there are no annual reviews or annual raises, so you don't have any guarantees or very much to look forward to in the way of pay. It's all very vague and up in the air, much like the very confusing and ambiguous vacation policy.

As someone who works on the Product Coordinator team, it's disheartening to know that we are one of the only teams that doesn't receive quarterly bonuses. It seems like Houzz places much more value on the sales teams, offering them regular incentives, gift cards, and opportunities to earn extra cash. On the one hand, it makes sense since Marketplace is relatively new in comparison to the sales side of things, but there also won't continue to be a marketplace team in the future if we don't feel valued and cared for as employees. 

And though most people praise Houzz for its growth opportunities, there aren't as many as it seems. There are opportunities to change roles and Houzz managers are very understanding if you're not satisfied in your position, but the growth opportunities are mainly horizontal, not vertical."

You are able to see ins and outs of what makes a tech company thrive.","The work you do is paid through a cap or quota. No matter how many extra hours spent working, they will only pay for the number of leads found. Lead generation in an exhausted area is very difficult. Leads are also pre-approved, so the number of leads found don't necessarily equate to your pay."

Because they have a in-depth hiring process, everyone that works here is so hard working, social and friendly.","If you don't like change, stay away.  Houzz is a start up and people move up quickly.  I've had 5 managers in the 15 months I've worked here.  

As part of the sales team, we have east coast clients so early mornings are a must to be able to reach them.  Most people are in by 7-7:30 at the latest."

1100,Houzz,Beyond Blessed To Call Houzz My Home,2015-09-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"To start, I love everything about Houzz.  I have worked at this company for over a year and I cannot image working anywhere else, ever again.  I am a young professional and I have found the company where I hope to retire.  How many people can say that?  I have never felt so valued as an employee, as I leave work everyday knowing that I have made a difference.  One of my favorite aspects of working at Houzz is the company culture.  I have never been surrounded by so many bright, driven, kind-hearted, and inspirational co-workers and managers, who I can all genuinely call my friends.  Don't believe me?  As an office we celebrate birthdays, baby showers, and holidays.  Breakfast and lunch are catered and we have fully-stocked kitchens to ensure that we can all share meals together.  Social events, happy hours, and community service are also fun activities hosted by Houzz.  If you haven't gotten the picture yet, this company cares.  Houzz cares so much that if you are not happy with your current position or are looking for a change, managers will gladly help you find a new position that might better suit your skill set.  To those who are deserving and excel, promotions generally follow.  Health benefits, 401K, salary, and commission/bonuses are all competitive. I am constantly telling friends, family, and new people I meet along the way to apply to work at Houzz. This company has changed my life and I could not be more grateful to be a part of this ever growing and exciting company!","There are changes happening constantly, as with any successful start-up company, so being flexible and rolling with the punches is necessary but not always ideal.  When these shifts occur and weigh me down, it takes no time  for me to reflect on previous jobs to realize that a bad day at Houzz does not compare to bad day somewhere else.  These ""bad days"" are far and few in-between, you are surrounded by your best friends, and they are generally followed by a fantastic day. No job is perfect, but working at Houzz is pretty close!"
1101,Houzz,A great opportunity,2015-09-24,5.0,Account Manager,"In short: company culture, room for career advancement, competitive salary, willing to hire out of college. 
Houzz is an incredible company to work for, especially for young professionals getting started in their careers. People straight out of college have opportunities to move into positions they are otherwise not qualified for. Unfortunately, sometimes it's easy to get jaded (because we do all work VERY hard) but in the end of the day they provide us with an amazing office, down to earth and approachable managers, and competitive compensation and benefits. I have also never met so many motivated, bright and hard working people in one place before. I can truly say some of my best friends are my co-workers because we share similar values and work ethic (and they're awesome in general).",(Some) recent hires seem to think Houzz is an extension of their sorority career and forget that it is a place of work and that even the most entry-level position needs to be taken seriously. Also--as to be expected of a rapidly growing start up--you need to learn to be very flexible as goals and expectations can change quickly.
1102,Houzz,So Lucky to Work Here!!,2015-09-24,5.0,Associate Buyer,"Working at Houzz has been a wonderful experience. I've worked at the company for over a year now and have been allowed so many opportunities. The company is fast paced and ever changing as we grow which cultivates a learning experience that would be hard to find anywhere else. Houzz is a hub for talented, hardworking people. The management team always tries to do the right thing and provide great support for their teams; they care about their employees happiness and success. They focus on our strengths rather than our weaknesses and it is not uncommon  to see job or department changes at the employee's request. Some other reviews from Houzz employees seem a bit ungrateful, in my opinion, and I'd like to address them. As with any company, there are bound to be employees who complain about things that are not productive (such as a lack of bread in the kitchen), however, I believe these employees to be ones who have little or no prior experience working in a corporate setting. I would encourage them to try and find a similar work environment elsewhere and would be surprised if they could. We are lucky to have coffee and should be grateful for any extra ""perks"".","As with any start-up company, there are bound to be growing pains. But we always figure them out!"
1103,Houzz,"Account Manager, Client Services",2015-09-23,5.0,"Account Manager, Client Services","If you're considering working here, think no more and apply! A start-up company on the rise who doesn't think twice about putting their employees first. I have never felt more valued by any other company the way I do by Houzz. There is nowhere to move but up and management supports promotions to ensure you're reaching your highest potential. The CEO makes quarterly visits to say ""hi"", present future updates, and gather feedback from her employees!  

Just a few examples in which Houzz shows their true appreciation for you as an employee: catered breakfast to kick those stereotypical Monday blues, catered lunch on Fridays to congratulate a week well done, a STOCKED kitchen with countless espresso and Kuerig machines, unlimited vacation time, PAID benefits... That's just to name a few! 

I love my job and it's so mind blowing knowing it's only going to get better!","Being a start-up company, there's going to be ups an downs, but their vision is clear. They only strive to better the platform and inner workings of the company.

That being said, you need to be ready to roll with the punches and be open to change. At Houzz, change is GOOD. 

If you're a hard-working, driven, adaptive individual with an open mind, you'll see the benefits in their growth as a company."
1104,Houzz,Best Company that I've worked for,2015-09-23,5.0,,"Great culture, flat structure, great employees. It feels like everyone is striving towards the common goal (as opposed to departmentalized organizations)",Fast growth pace - It's getting harder to remember everyones' names :)
1105,Houzz,Culture Seems to Be Getting Worse,2015-09-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The organization is still pretty flat, so it's actually possible to talk to your manager's manager or even the CEO when she's around, which is excellent. They try to stay approachable, and the only time they're closed off in an office is when they're in a meeting.

They're working to add a slide to the Irvine office. I saw in a magazine that it said it's already done, but I assure you that it is not finished yet.

Free food in the kitchen, especially Friday lunches. There is breakfast provided on Mondays too, but with the exception of the fruit, it's usually worse than the food you can make yourself.

Frequent 'promotions' - but many of these turn out to be very small promotions, and depending on how you do in the new position, you may actually get paid LESS, not more.","The base pay is pretty low for most positions. You have the potential to make a decent salary with the commission, but the targets have been getting harder and harder to hit. When commission is 20-30% of your total income, it makes it really difficult to plan for large purchases, such as a car, home, or otherwise. Not hitting your commission targets one month isn't a huge deal according to management (it's not going to get you fired or something), but it can have serious impacts for employees. (Overtime pay isn't as good with this structure either)

The kitchen is frequently understocked. I'm not sure what causes this, but it's something that needs more resources thrown at it. When I'm looking for something as simple as bread, but it's out in the kitchen and then you take the stairs to check the other kitchen and it's still out, it's a huge waste of time.

Benefits are so-so. Healthcare plan is decent, and there is life insurance and such, but retirement planning through the company is almost not worth it. There are options of a 401k and a Roth 401K, but there is NO MATCHING. Considering how young the workforce is, you're better off with your own Roth-IRA. Stock options are available after 1 year with the company, but no information is provided regarding them until you reach that point, and lord knows if or when we're going public.

The company seems to be filling up, making promotions scarcer or less-impressive. They seem to be placing people at the top of the pyramid and just filling in the bottom. Once you're at a certain level, you stagnate or only move horizontally (but at least you move!)"

Many employees are still waiting for simple things like HR paperwork. It was shocking to learn my own manager did not fully understand the leave policies.

Monotonous: It seems that much of the work has been over-delegated. I could not find many opportunities to contribute aside from my day-to-day 8-hour desk sessions. 

Lack of training: I was told that my lack of experience in certain areas would be OK, but was never offered any training to compensate. Likewise, it seemed like certain managers lacked management experience and training.

No work from home: If this is important to you, know that Houzz does not currently allow WFH.

Low pay: If you are looking for competitive pay, you may not find it here. I am not sure about other departments but many in my department were paid what one might consider a non-living wage for the area."

The hiring bar has been kept very high, and the team here is strongest I've worked with over my 10+ year career in the Valley.  It's an amazing time to be part of a product that is simultaneously growing into commerce and expanding to dozens of countries over the next year.","Palo Alto is a beautiful town, but it is expensive.

When people hear that I work at Houzz they are very excited. We develop a product that people truly love. It can't get better than that. I learn a lot both professionally and personally from the smart people that I work with.  I told my friends that they should join- some did and they are truly happy.",We are growing fast so people need to get used to the scale.

1122,Houzz,conflicted feelings,2015-06-07,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"awesome people, fun environment, cool events","It almost feels like all the perks are in an effort to keep everyone complacent with mediocrity. I worked hard to get a degree only to get paid barely above what I made in college.
It's a company of mostly recent grads and women, and we're paid bare minimum for this day and age. It's sad to see that no one cares to voice this.
They are missing out on a lot of potential talented people who are scared off by the low salary and they risk losing lots of current great employees when they finally realize we should be getting paid accordingly."
1123,Houzz,Best company to work for in Silicon Valley,2015-06-05,5.0,Marketing,"It's great to work for a company that is changing people's lives for the better. I joined the company b/c I was a heavy user of Houzz and it helped me with my remodeling project. It's been the best place I've worked because of the people, product, and culture. The people are very smart and friendly, the product has tremendous impact on the industry, and the culture is great. We just came back from a lavish two day company retreat in San Diego.  Highly recommend to anyone looking to make an impact in this world!",You have to work hard (not really a con).
1124,Houzz,Some big things to be fixed,2015-06-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I do actually enjoy coming to work every day. The people who work here are great and like-minded. It's a fun company culture, but there are some serious things that need to be addressed. The perks are cool like lunches and stocked kitchen.","The pay is awful-especially for living in OC. It is difficult to be undervalued by a company that claims to care so much. If I didn't live with my parents there's no way I could afford to live on what they pay. They hire mostly recent grads who are all in the same boat so no one seems to care/complain.
The unlimited time off policy is not true, it's frustrating that they throw this term around. It's actually 15 days and that's including sick time. No incentive for to earn more days each year like most other companies offer."
1125,Houzz,"Great company, but President and CEO need to let go",2015-06-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great, friendly people.  Great atmosphere as they try to have that family feel.  Great office.  Great idea from homeowners and professionals to get their work seen and hopefully get business from it.","The employees are not empowered at all.  I understand that it's the founders-husband/wife-President/CEO's idea and company that they built from scratch, putting everything on the line for it.  But in my time there (45 to 120 employees), when they were hiring experts for expanding, they did not empower those experts:  management and individual contributors (ICs).  Ideas and strategies were shot down for the way they wanted to do it.  Many times their ways were not the right ways.

It might have changed in the last 1.5 years, but they hired experts, but didn't listen to them.  That discouraged management and ICs to the point of people not wanting to bring up new ideas and just doing what they wanted to do.  I fully understand that it's their baby, but the President and CEO need to trust and empower the people they hire so they can grow and scale the company, which in turn creates happy and challenged employees.

They also were not transparent to the point of getting in the way of business.  It was almost like being in politics:  you get to hear only what they think you should hear.  The startup trend is to be transparent about the business to their employees, which shows trust in your employees.  They were actually the opposite with not sharing much information at all, leaving employees with question about the company direction.  And with their management style, people were scared to ask questions.  Not a good combination for success."

1127,Houzz,Account Manager,2015-05-30,1.0,Account Manager,"Fully stocked kitchen, Mac computers, and catered lunch on Fridays.","Management is actively ""encouraging"" employees to write 5 star reviews.  I have never encountered a company that is as superficial as this one. If you want a job that devalues your work and have managers that do not listen to ideas then this is the place for you. Compensation plans have constantly changed from good to bad to worse. There is little to no incentive to maintain high proformance when your paycheck never changes but your workload increases four-fold. Moral is constantly low as you are not encouraged to have work friends or socialize with anyone in the office. Although the Instagram profile shows everyone very close these are rare events. ""Breaks"" (10 minutes to eat lunch) are at your desk. I was told that this job would come with unlimited time off (as long as you complete work) however asking for a day off is like pulling teeth. If you take a sick day or time off for vacation you will be expected to make up that work. They ""encourage"" you to work nights and weekends. Management expects workers to be in the office 6/6:30 and meetings are typically scheduled 4pm and can run up till 6.  There is no opportunity for upward mobility unless you play their game."
1128,Houzz,"Pinch Me, This Company is the Best.",2015-05-11,5.0,Account Manager,"The people I work with are the best of the best - all extremely motivated, inspiring to be around, incredibly driven, and ridiculously kind. I couldn't have dreamed up a better group of people. The perks of the kitchen, food, awesome opportunities for growth and advancement at a young company are wonderful, but people can never be replaced.","Working with the best people makes it a much greater challenge to constantly be number one. If I had to pick a con, that would be the only one. Which is actually quite motivating... so it's really a Pro. In which case, there are no cons."
1129,Houzz,AMAZING fast-growing tech company to work for,2015-05-09,5.0,Account Manager,"Coming to work each morning is pleasurable because of the great people and incredible senior management and CEO who run this rapid growing company. The product/company already has revolutionized the industry and on the path for continued growth and success. Management actually cares about your success and personal goals by giving you ALL of the tools to succeed here, which was not the case at my previous company. They keep us highly motivated to work hard and hit our goals by regularly conducting fun contests and incentives (trips, cash, gift cards, etc).

Houzz does a great job of balancing the fast-paced sales environment with amazing company perks to keep the enthusiasm and startup culture alive and thriving. From lunches on Fridays to Workout Wednesdays and birthday celebrations, you can tell Houzz does a lot to keep it's employees happy and culture in tact. All of the people here are smart, positive, friendly and highly self-motivated. Plus, amazing medical benefits!

You're given all the tools you need to grow in the company and grow personally.  The management does seem to really care about your position within the company and where you fit best.  They do everything they can to give you the opportunities you need. I've always been able to approach anyone from top to bottom with any concern.  If you have an issue or something you would like to work on there isn't a single person there that won't do everything they can to help.,"For me there aren't any cons working with Houzz.  Houzz does an outstanding job of finding ambitious over-achievers that are always looking to improve which really does push you and does help you grow.  It's possible to make the argument that makes things extra competitive, which to some might seem like a con, but if you want to be pushed to grow Houzz is the best possible place to be."
1132,Houzz,AMAZING company & best job I've ever had!,2015-05-08,5.0,Account Manager,"There aren't enough great things I can say about Houzz! I love it!! The people are amazing and have become my close friends. Everyone here is self-motivated, encouraging, positive, and friendly. The office is beautiful and well kept and the product we sell is innovative and it works. Working for Houzz has been my best work experience and I feel so honored to be an employee of Houzz. I look forward to coming into work because I truly feel valued as an employee. 

Also, the company is growing so quickly that there are plenty growth opportunities. Houzz wants to hear where you want to grow within the company and will help you achieve your career goals. I feel so supported constantly. 

Not to mention, the salary and potential earnings are realistic. This is the first job where I am making the kind of money I want to make and I am given so many tools to help my financial goals. We are very well taken care of here at Houzz with catered lunches, sponsored trips and great benefits. 

I highly recommend working for Houzz. You won't be disappointed!",I can't really think of any cons in working for Houzz. It is a start up so there are changes that happen occasionally but it just makes for further opportunity!

1135,Houzz,Wouldn't Think About Going Anywhere Else!,2015-05-08,5.0,Customer Service Coordinator,"Working for Houzz has been a really amazing experience. It's such a large company, but still technically a start-up so there is a lot of room for employees to be promoted pretty quickly based on their work ethic. The people who work here are genuinely nice, and the work environment is very open and friendly. When they first bring you in for an interview they do their best to make sure that any position they're considering you for would be something you would enjoy doing and be successful at. Management is always willing to listen to any ideas or concerns and make sure that you feel fully supported. They are really great at recognizing good work and making sure that you feel valued.
Every month we have a Houzz birthday party to celebrate all employee birthdays in that month and share their favorite desserts. We also have baby showers, recognition events, holiday parties, etc. The company takes care to contribute to several charitable organizations as well, and they include their employees in invitations to donate time, goods, and money to local non-profit groups. Houzz takes care of their employees the way that a small family-owned business might, despite their much larger size, and they truly care about our well-being. They are really as altruistic as they seem, and it's very nice to come in to a workplace where you know that your main goal is to make sure that you're helping others and making people happy. It's a great place to be every day!","I don't know that I would consider these cons, but definitely some things to consider: 
They encourage very early mornings (which makes sense since we work with customers, sellers and pros from all over the nation), although they do not require that you come in early. 
Because we grow so fast, there are a lot of changes to get used to in systems and processes as updates are made to the website, or as new features are launched--although, frankly, I like that part. :) 
Also due to the quick growth, your work volume will fluctuate by degrees as time passes and new hires are trained. Some months you'll have a very even workload and be able to get ahead, and some months the volume of tasks will significantly increase, and you'll have a hard time finding the time to get it all done. They really mean it when they say that jobs for Houzz are fast-paced, and if that's something you thrive on I would highly recommend going forward with whatever stage you're at in the application process."
1136,Houzz,By FAR the best job I,2015-05-08,5.0,Account Executive,"Compensation: this job has changed my life, I no longer have to worry about money.  I've read reviews here that complain about the leads and the number of calls.  Invest in yourself, learn how to actually close and you would likely feel different.

Sales Contests: there is almost always a contest, trip, gift card give away etc going on to kick your motivation into overdrive.

The People: I've met some of the best people here at Houzz.  The leadership & recruiting team spends a lot of time investing in our culture and finding individuals who fit our mold.   You will meet some of your new best friends when you come onboard.

The Office: most offices in Orange County are outdated, with furniture from 20-30 years ago and old school computers & technology.  You get the best of everything @Houzz.  Full stacked kitchen, catered food from some of the best spots in town: Lemonade, Chipotle.  If you forgot your lunch, there's everything you could imagine in our fridges and drawers.","Early Risers: Early in, early out.  I personally love getting off work by 3-3:15.  Yes it definitely was challenging getting use to waking up early, but I prefer it now and you become so much more productive in your own life."

The people who work here are amazing. Houzz definitely hires like-minded individuals who are super driven and self-motivated. It's so nice to work in a place where everyone is so positive and loves what they do! I can honestly say that I feel valued when I come to work, and love that I get to interact with professionals all day who love the website. 

What's also great about Houzz is that the company is fast growing. There are tons of opportunities to grow within the company. I love that upper management is invested in their team's professional development, and really works to help you grow in your career. I've never had a job where managers have cared so much about my career goals. 

Some other perks include a competitive salary, tons of contests where you can earn gift cards for meeting goals, catered lunches/breakfasts, and even the opportunity to go on company sponsored trips! Houzz also offers great benefits, including medical, dental, vision etc.

The offices are beautiful (as you would expect from the #1 platform for home remodel and design), the technology is cutting edge.  Lunch is catered on Fridays, breakfast brought in on Mondays. There is no dress code and on Wednesdays we wear workout clothes.  The perks are amazing and there are often unexpected incentives (trips, cash bonuses, gift cards, etc.).  The healthcare benefits alone are saving my family enough to cover my car payment (and I drive a very nice car).  The hours are flexible and ultimately it's a great environment to come into every day.  The company is growing exponentially and I believe there is great growth potential (including stock options).  It's a very exciting place to work and I'm proud to be a part of the team.","Like most sales environments, there is a tremendous amount of pressure and everything is tracked-  number of sales, amount of sales, number of calls, number of appointments, etc.  There is an unlimited vacation policy, but I feel guilty taking time off because it affects my sales average.  It can feel competitive, though it is largely healthy competition and for the most part management and colleagues are  very supportive.  Another drawback- commissions and bonuses are subject to being reversed at any time for things that are largely out of our control (i.e. a credit card decline or a professional who is unhappy with the program by no fault of our own). Additionally,  20% of earnings each paycheck are withheld to cover these potential ""charge backs""  (and subsequently paid out quarterly).  If you are not a morning person, this is not a job for you! Average arrival time is between 6:30 and 7:00 a.m., but typically you're out early enough to enjoy the day."

1144,Houzz,"An Account Coordinator To An Account Executive, & Growing.",2015-05-07,5.0,Account Executive,"1. My Coworkers: I work with some of the most amazing people and absolutely adore my colleagues. They are a huge reason why I love my job (but not the only reason). Although our positions can have a competitive nature, everyone in the office wants to help you succeed and will stop everything they are doing if you have a question or need assistance.

2. The Office: The office is huge and the pods and rooms are decorated like the inside of a home. We have a giant kitchen fully stocked with healthy food to keep you going through the day. Tons of coffee. Catered breakfast every Monday morning (because we all know how tough a Monday can be), and catered lunch every Friday (because... TGIF). We have a few company wide events a year and have fun activities planned monthly that anyone is welcome to participate in.

3. Room for Advancement: This company is growing quickly! I began my career at Houzz in an entry level role as an Account Coordinator. In that role, I was able to learn everything I needed to know about the company and how to work with professionals who are a part of our platform. In less than a year I was promoted to an Account Manager, a role that I did not have the experience or skills for when I first applied to the company. Houzz equipped me the skills I needed for both roles through extremely useful training classes. I have felt very confident going into each position and have felt very successful thus far. 

4. The Day to Day: My current role is a challenge, which is why I enjoy it. I am able to strategically plan each of my days as I see fit to accomplish my monthly goals. I primarily work with other professionals over the phone helping them with their businesses and building relationships with them. I also take (probably too many) coffee and snack breaks, and rarely work over 8 hours a day. I come into the office around 6:30 and leave around 3. *Keep in mind: This is still a job and you have to work.

5. Management: I have never worked in an office where the managers care so much about your success and about each person individually. As an Account Coordinator, I had a meeting with my manager after only being with the company for a month because she wanted to help me with my career path. She told me what I needed to do to get to the next level, I did it, and was promoted. In my current position as an Account Executive, I have one on ones with my direct manager every week to make sure I am on pace, to give any suggestions or advice to get there, and to be a listening ear to anything I may want to discuss. 


Overall, this company has changed my life. I didn't come from much and I now finally consider myself to be a successful, independent individual. I feel extremely confident in what I do and plan on being here for many years to come, all with the drive to continue advancing. I am so grateful to work with Houzz and I highly encourage you to check this company out for yourself.","I am a morning person, but the 6:30AM start time was definitely hard to adjust to.

Kitchen and unlimited food is a huge perk.

Expect to sit in your cubicle and ""keep dialing"" leads that are ""warm"" although most people ignore your calls and you are forced to call them over and over to hit your call quota. The leads you get are recycled and not great. You feel limited on your potential to make money. You begin to feel like an annoying telemarketer.  The sales presentation gets very repetitive and you will constantly be micro managed and critiqued.  If you are used to being an independent sales rep, this is not the position for you.  If you don't mind cubicle life, dialing numbers all day to people who have already been contacted by a previous rep and never responded, and being micro-managed, than you might like it."

Pay and benefits could use some clarification and help.  I was told that all of our dials would be warm calls, but in fact it is cold calling (be prepared to be yelled at).  Your sales success is greatly dependent on the territories that are assigned to you especially since you are unable to prospect outside of your batch.

Free lunch on Fridays and they celebrate your birthday with a special surprise :-) and everyone is SUPER nice.",Palo Alto rents aren't cheap. It perhaps won't suit someone who wants heaps and heaps of structure and being told what to do if that's what you are looking for. It's a can do let's make it happen attitude.
