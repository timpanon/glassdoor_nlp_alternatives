7,Hurb,Very unpleasant place to work,2016-03-09,1.0,Software Engineer,The salary was kinda competitive in some areas. But money is not the most important thing. So there are no pros.,"None of the promises made in the offer moment were delivered during the year I worked there. The office was always a mess, the bathrooms were very stinky and dirty. Most of the chairs were broken and workstations were bad quality and not productive.

The management in general was terrible. Too many managers that just not manage anything. The product development was a mess, with a lot of rush during the process and losing a lot of quality in general. Also the management was more interested in showing of than evolve the product and the company."

The infrastructure of the office isn't good. Does not have an innovative atmosphere - even the curtains are always closed, blocking the sunlight!"
