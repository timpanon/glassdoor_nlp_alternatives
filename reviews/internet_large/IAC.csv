0,IAC,Terrible Management and Culture,2022-04-04,1.0,Corporate Finance,The pay is on the higher end of market price. Good 401k.,"Senior management calls IAC a family which is a way to manipulate the staff to put work ahead of everything else. Long hours, late nights and lots of work on the weekends. 

Most of senior management has been in place for over a decade. As a result, there are outdated systems resulting in lots of work for the staff. 

Senior management has a short temper, and will take it out on the staff. We routinely hear senior management cursing out direct reports in their office. 

Lots of layoffs. People disappear without an explanation. Management is manipulative. Do not share information about your life with them. They will use it against you.

Management shoots down ideas brought up in meetings discouraging innovation and brain storming. It’s their way or the highway. 

Management leaves staff out of meetings. This approach makes it hard to get visibility and promotion opportunities.

Everyone acts like robots. There is no camaraderie in the office."

At all levels, the staff are encouraged to grow the business and are given the freedom and responsibility to dare to try.  It is difficult at any company to obtain a work/life balance that is enjoyable to all, but with perks such as unlimited PTO, ping pong, complimentary food and snacks, IAC Applications provides an environment to get work accomplished while having fun.  The company is always finding an occasion to have a party as well, and just recently we had a Kid’s Day that allowed our children to see what we do, play games and even to learn some coding.","Sure, like all companies there are issues.  The same issues that plague all major companies, but I think the company has been trying to decrease many of those issues with increased communication, clearer business goals and an overall increase in people and product quality.  Also, every company is driven by P&L to a point, it’s what keeps us a company.  Companies measure a division or products profitability because it’s just good management.  But that is not the primary basis upon which, in my opinion, anyone is held accountable for their decisions, or we would never enact current strategies that look beyond P&L interests."

The co-CEOs, I believe, want to foster a culture of accountability but it devolves into a culture of blame. Meetings with them would be held with the intention of public shaming instead of group problem solving. Poisonous culture where individuals don't feel protected. Only those individuals willing to take undeserved credit and blame others for mistakes thrive. 

Recently, a new CFO has been installed that fit that mode. The CFO is a perfect example of senior management style at IACA. Poor management skills, blames other for his deficiencies, engages in activities that generates limited values, and very low EQ.

The hiring managers painted the picture that the company is doing great and wanted to expand because they have a lot features and ideas to build. However, after joining and leaving my other full time job, the higher management decided reduce expenses by cutting on resources.  So I was laid off along with about 30 others. 

Even the lay off process was unprofessional and disrespectful, and shows that they only care about much they can keep in there pocket.  Everyone was called into one meeting and given a 5 minute speech informing us that it would be our last day of employment.    

Using cutting technologies was great. However, there was disconnect on the actual requirements and some of the developers worked as solo cowboy coders, so it was hard to make code reusability."

Also, no real growth opportunities across IAC companies. (It's not particularly easy for a mid-level employee to transition from one IAC company to another. You have to apply as if you were an outside candidate, at which point you might as well apply to a sexier, faster-growing outside company.)

- Pay is ok
- Good amt of paid time off.
- Happy hours, events + outings
- Birthday cake + office parties
- Easy to get by with little effort.
- A lot of fun, good natured colleagues.","- Innovation not encouraged, frequently shunned. Status quo all the way.
- Same business model for 10 years (not so good when you're an Internet co). 
- Hiring, rewards, and promotions deeply mired in cronyism, nepotism; merit, skill, talent not valued.
- Big ego management lacking in substance; lots of unstable people in high-level positions.
- Recent grads with huge sense of entitlement bestowed authority over those with proven expertise.
- High attrition rate. Little effort to retain talent; HR focus diverted to hiring the cheap and compliant.
- What was once an entrepreneurial environment is now a very typical MBA-run corporation.
- Attempts at trendy office space failed (satellite office)."

They do have good vacation and benefits.","For experienced people, you'd better look elsewhere if you want market rate.  Back end developers are understaffed for this reason, and they just laid off senior front end people, in an effort to replace them with cheaper people (not kidding, layoff was in July and they have ads up everywhere for the same jobs right now).  The White Plains office has a highly unfortunate 9-hour work day that should be abolished.  So it's 9 - 6 (with an hour lunch)."

Mostly forward-looking Internet company involved in nearly all interesting areas: dating, search, shopping, exclusive content, transactions, lead gen.","The top management is following a roadmap not shared with the street-level workers.  As a result, seismic shifts occur involving shedding of companies, moving of divisions or large pockets of employees disappearing without much notice. To say the least, this can be very de-motivating."
