1,Ibotta,Great place to learn and grow!,2022-03-29,5.0,Human Resources,"Ibotta is hands down the best place I have ever worked. Surrounded by impressively talented, smart individuals with complex problems to solve and a sense of community. Managers are supportive of career growth and development, and there are many opportunities for internal advancement. Hard work pays off, and performance is paramount over tenure. I love it here.","Ibotta is fast paced and priorities can change quickly, so people who struggle with adaptability may not do well here."
2,Ibotta,Great culture,2022-03-21,4.0,Account Coordinator,Great culture & benefits. Awesome team members,"Not much room for professional development. They seem to prioritize external hiring. They lose a lot of good talent due to this, often times leaving for competitors."

* deadlines aren't common - it takes as long as it takes","* competitive - leaders encourage engineers to compare themselves to their teammates
* disrespectful and dishonest leaders are promoted
* benefits don't measure up to the rest of the industry
* everybody works a ton, well over 40 hrs a week

9,Ibotta,"Good company, Growing",2022-02-25,5.0,Senior Platform Engineer,"Executives are very open about company status, progress, etc. They both speak and act to produce a company that values diversity, respects employees and users. A good company culture at the top works its way through everything.

Employees are very collaborative and friendly.

Work from home, hybrid, or in office options for pretty much every job, with financial support for setting up or improving your home office. Or helping pay for your commute.",Mostly remote work force makes casual collaboration & interaction harder.

16,Ibotta,It's fine for a stepping stone,2022-02-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Absolutely amazing people to work with.
- Willing to take a chance/give people an opportunity even if they aren't 100% qualified.
- If you're in the right position, easy enough to change departments.
- There are opportunities to expand your skill set and new things on the job.
- A lot of trust with little micro-management. They really trust you to be an adult and get your job done.","- Pay is way below industry standard
- If you're in operations, there's virtually zero career mobility without changing departments
- Upper middle management is a total mine-field and it's impossible to create any meaningful change.
- Leadership focuses on the next shiny object, rather than fixing what already exists.
- A surprisingly janky setup for a company their size. It's like it's scotch-taped and glues together.
- Senior level leadership (CEO, CTO, etc) are very disingenuous about their goals and what they're aiming for. The talk about putting people first but at no point actually showed that they meant it.
- CEO is very self righteous and definitely has a high opinion of himself (it's a coupon company. it's not that serious).
- The company constantly preaches diversity, but when you control for full-time staff all diversity pretty much disappears."
17,Ibotta,A COMPANY THAT CARES!!!,2022-02-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I am so grateful to be a part of the Ibotta, Inc. team! We are all working towards a common goal of making every purchase rewarding and each of our contributions is an integral part of fulfilling that mission.

18,Ibotta,"Thats going to be a no from me, Clark.",2022-02-01,1.0,Product Manager,"They will market ""growth"" and ""upside"". While there are opportunities for growth it will cost you dearly from a mental health perspective","Where to begin? Poor leadership, no product vision, terrible politics. 

Bryan is one of the worst leaders in the Denver technology scene. He is a narcissist and burns anyone who crosses his path. He preaches diversity but fails to recognize the hypocrisy of his rise to the top. He lets a ""bro culture"" run rampant and loves to drop F bombs during company meetings. Bryan has a bad case of ""shiny object syndrome"" and the company is constantly changing priorities. The leadership team is unable to scale the organization to create meaningful growth and build strong teams. 
The ""leaders"" in the organization continue to be led by promises dangled in front of them that will never materialize. Because of this Ibotta continues to retain poor leaders and will never be able to scale the organization to create meaningful change. Bryan also has no care for the greater organization and is only focused on bettering his personal brand. 

Honestly, it is not worth it. The growth opportunities might sound great, but it is not worth the drain on your mental health. Find an organization that has a vision. Find an organization that cares about its employees. Find an organization that holds leaders accountable."

34,Ibotta,Worst culture Iv been apart of,2021-10-25,1.0,Director of Product Management,"*IC’s are kind, flexible, and working their tails off
*Decent pay
*Remote work","*Terrible leadership - changes direction with every random thought then expect hundreds of people move on a moments notice. In my first day orientation 3/10 people had managerial/team changes and were not made aware of it until they showed up to orientation. Routinely asked to “fill the gaps” by doing additional full time jobs or moving people from other teams until they hire backfills, which can take up to a year. The expectation is that you spread yourself thin and then are blamed when failure inevitably occurs. 

*no desire to invest in the future - constantly going for “quick win” and “low hanging fruit” despite a deep need to add structural integrity 

*leadership is not transparent and does not empower employees to act in company’s best interest. Obfuscates failures rather than learning from them and internally markets “progress” while actually building very little value. 

*Culture where “teamwork” means not disagreeing. If you value intellectual integrity and actually solving problems it will be like living with cognitive dissonance everyday. Your genuine questions in effort to solve the problem, will be met with gaslighting of the actual issue and the expectation that you “buy in” to the collective delusion. 

*Zero leadership strategy or alignment - constantly chasing prospects, random short term features/campaigns, squabbling for team charters, has no concept of focus or prioritization, genuine lack of understanding on what it takes to create effective teams or build competitive customer centric products. 

*Low NPS scores for ICs and managers and high turnover but touts it’s “amazing culture”. Just one of many examples how how they are not a “data driven” company."
35,Ibotta,"Fast paced, great culture",2021-10-22,5.0,Decision Scientist,"Lots of ability to learn, take on responsibility and do high impact work. Revolving door means opportunity for upward trajectory. Aspirational growth story for the business. Respect for work life balance. Flexible for remote work.",Pay is at least 50k less than what I would make at other tech companies for the same work. Attrition is high because comp is low. Engineering is understaffed
36,Ibotta,Amazing company to work for,2021-10-22,5.0,Care Agent,I just started working here but so far this is the best management I’ve ever had. They consistently try to help you if you’re not understanding materials and will work around your life because they understand that you have a life outside of work. The people are super friendly and make it easy to come to them for help.,The only con is that the position is part time but they say you can move up into a full time position after working there for a while.
37,Ibotta,Bad management.,2021-10-20,1.0,Care Agent,You can work from home.,"Horrible management, no benefits, horrible pay."
38,Ibotta,WORST JOB I EVER HAD,2021-10-10,1.0,Account Coordinator,The only pro about this company is that they hire great people and cover your medical insurance,"Everyone in this company is extremely undervalued, overworked, and underpaid. My role specifically had people working 12-13 hour days just to stay afloat at an entry level job… They just pile more and more work on top of what you already have, schedule multiple zoom meetings throughout the day so you can’t get anything done, and expect you to be willing to take on more. When asked about raises for doing the work of 3 people we got shut down and were told we only get raises when you get a promotion. 

There is absolutely NO WORK LIFE BALANCE in this company. My mental health suffered and when I confronted my boss or HR about all the issues, nothing would get done. It’s extremely sad that they do not value employees happiness at all. I didn’t know what else to do besides leave. 

I had other jobs that paid WAY more and had 1/4 of the work I did here. I was at this company for less than a year and the team I started with was completely different than the team when I left since everyone quits! I even had 3 different bosses in less than one year.. even upper management was quitting left and right.. if that’s not a red flag I don’t know what is. 

Save yourself the time and apply elsewhere I found the same entry level job at other tech companies in Denver being paid way more for less work. If you want to value your own worth and sanity stay far far away from this mess of a company."
39,Ibotta,It's been great!,2021-10-06,5.0,Senior Manager,"I agree with other reviews that Ibotta is incredibly fast paced. It can be quite intimidating as a newcomer trying to learn the ins and outs of the business while simultaneously being considered a subject matter expert in whatever department you’ve joined. It’s imperative to be as organized as possible. It certainly helps to have a great manager and a great team in place upon joining, which I definitely did (and do).

What I appreciate about this company the most is the transparency. The weekly standup meetings with Bryan (CEO) and the bi-weekly product meetings keep all employees abreast of how the company is performing, what new app and web features are being launched, etc. You are never in the dark about what’s going on, good or bad.

Ibotta is definitely family friendly. Every Zoom meeting we see someone’s baby or toddler make an appearance and it’s never a problem. Employees also share their families/kids in our Slack channel, so that’s nice. 

In relation to that, Ibotta is a very “we don’t care how you get your work done” environment. I know this differs for the agents who are directly interacting with customers, but for the core team, we are encouraged to do whatever we need to do in our personal lives. Doctor appointments, picking up kids, leaving early, etc. No one cares about that stuff as long as your work gets done.

Can’t speak for everyone, but the pay seems to be generous. The benefits and perks are wonderful, even beyond the standard medical/dental/vision offerings.","The fast pace could be considered a con, but if you're good at your job, it'll become easier.

We live on Zoom. So many meetings makes it hard to actually get your work done."
40,Ibotta,Great company to work remote,2021-09-25,5.0,Remote Customer Service Representative,Great to have a family and still bringing home income.,Not a lot of flexibility in hours
41,Ibotta,Excellent management focused on helping you succeed.,2021-09-22,5.0,Customer Service Representative (CSR),"I had never worked remote before. Training was good. My 1st manager was very focused on helping me achieve my goals and was available to me when she could be; most of the time. We had weekly team meetings that were positive and the crew was just awesome. It was an everyone helps everyone environment and I thrived in it.
My second manager-diff team was also good. Very understanding and helpful. Super knowledgeable and happy to help you.
I could not have asked for a better place to work. Yes you had metrics to meet and they were attainable and fair. No calls, just emailed correspondence with clients helping to resolve their requests and solving any problems they were having till it required higher assistance. I give Ibotta 5 stars and would not have left if I could have stayed in Colorado. Good training, decent pay, excellent and helpful management and HR staff, solid company to work for.","No medical benes, needs more locations to cover the state better for company wide events."
42,Ibotta,"Mentorship/Mentees, great opportunities to learn and grow",2021-09-21,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Positive culture, flexible employer regarding remote work. Teams with good management will have great experiences.",Remote engineers may not be getting the support they need for onboarding.
43,Ibotta,Terrible Place to Work,2021-09-20,1.0,Account Coordinator,The people that work at Ibotta are awesome and the benefits are great.,"Ibotta is a terrible place to work if you're an entry-level or junior-level employee. They do not value young employees. You must be constantly available, nights, weekends, and vacations included. The team that you support will make or break this issue. Some salespeople are more relaxed than others, but management does not prioritize or advocate for your mental health. I would not recommend working at Ibotta to someone who doesn't feel comfortable standing up for themselves. You will need to do this on almost a daily basis. 

Ibotta is a revolving door for young talent. They know there will be more new grads and therefore aren't willing to put in the effort to make people happy. They lie to you in initial communications and interviews about what the AC role entails. They are not upfront about your workload, deadlines, or processes. Even when your plate is full, you do not have the option to say no to more work. You must do whatever is necessary to get everything done; this typically means working a minimum of 10-12 hours per day. Work life balance does not exist at Ibotta. 

They underpay considerably compared to similar positions and for the amount of work you have to take on. It is very hard to get paid what you deserve. Team members are quitting all the time, so you have to take over their work. Sometimes one person will be forced to take on the work of three employees, with no additional compensation. It is also your responsibility to train their replacements without any guidance from management."
44,Ibotta,Great culture and benefits,2021-09-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Apart from getting excited about day-to-day work and challenges, Ibotta has great work culture and benefits. I recently joined the company and had a newborn. Without any limitation, I was offered paternity leave. Offers a great work-life balance which actually motivates you to do better at your job.","Af of now, I dont see any downsided working for Ibotta"

Most of the supervisors are awesome and upper management is great.","You have to work 1 weekend shift. Taking time off can be a hassle. Some of the supervisors will micromanage/ belittle people. Moving to a full time position is extremely difficult because of the competition, but they do promote from within, so patience is key."
47,Ibotta,Ibotta is dedicated to serving employees and open to ideas.,2021-08-26,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Benefits are strikingly good, HR is extremely helpful in ramping up, and management overall is open to feedback from staff in both how the app works, how the business runs, and how they can improve. I can't stress enough how much they encourage engagement within the staff as well as giving staff opportunities for leadership.","There are moments of pushback from those that built the app when taking feedback--as the business continues to hire employees from competitors, it's worthwhile to stay open to new ideas based on other businesses' success."
48,Ibotta,Great Company to work for,2021-08-12,5.0,Care Agent,"Remote, great hours, no phone calls, all email/computer based, supervisors are great!",Can not work more than 14 shifts out of state

It's also great to work on a product that provides real cash to millions of Americans, some of whom struggle financially.",There's a lack of product/company vision. We do too many things at once leading to half-baked experiences and incredibly complex dependencies. It feels like every team is going in their own direction since they've given up on getting help from other departments and teams.

People only stay for job security. Easy to feel like a cog in the wheel. Ibotta touts that it ""makes every purchase rewarding"" but in reality, it tricks people into buying things they wouldn't normally buy and spending more money than they probably would without the app. Yes, it does save you money on everyday purchases SOMETIMES, but they don't help half as much as they think they do.

84,Ibotta,It’s actually unreal how bad it is to work here.,2021-03-04,1.0,Care Agent,"It’s remote, I guess, if you never leave CO, even for one day.","Pay is absolute garbage. I make minimum wage. I have worked here for four years. I just sat in a meeting where they’re outright saying they give competitive wage and “look at what other companies in Denver are doing”. That’s delusional, and it’s a lie. Minimum wage is not a competitive wage. 
There are no benefits, and this is by design. They keep all Care Agents part time to avoid giving them anything. 
You are not respected in any way, shape, or form. We literally had a Care-wide meeting where a high-ranking member of management outright told all of us it was easy and cheap to replace us because they have a full time trainer who is “being paid either way”. He had no shame or hesitation about saying this. He said it very matter-of-factly.
They force you to use a “virtual desktop” on your own computer that works very, very poorly. They don’t care if you have concerns about installing this on your own computer, and they’ve been extremely weird and shady about answering how much this will monitor employees.
Policies change at the drop of a hat, and no one can clarify why or the details of the new policy. You are expected to deal with this and shut up about it or quit - after all, they are paying the trainer to train your replacement either way, so why would they care? You’d better be ready to bend to whatever new policies get dropped on you that completely change your way of working and work-life balance on a dime. Reminder: this is a part-time job.
They laid off the entire QA team at the start of the pandemic, so nobody is doing their job correctly and nobody cares about it. This generates more tickets.
Hope you don’t like your supervisor too much - you’ll get pulled off their team and matched with a new sup who doesn’t even work the same days as you.
Everyone in upper management is rude, mean, careless, or passive-aggressive. On top of that, they can’t even do their jobs well, so there’s not even a flimsy excuse for their behavior."

Poor hiring decisions from managers. 

Nothing gets done because The CEO will have us start a large project and then something shiny would catch his eye and it was off to a new project. 

No real guidance on how to lead a team of agents. Every supervisor set their own rules for expectations. Leading to toxic teams of favorites and slackers getting by because their supervisor wouldn’t do anything. 

WFM has a new policy each week.  Leading a team is nearly impossible because we didn’t have the information prior to agents receiving it.

- short shifts for part timers if you want them
- as mentioned in other reviews, this is a stepping stone job. seems like the only real benefit is the experience for your resume.","it really seems like they have removed any and all “benefit” that made me want to work for this company. i am a newer employee and here are some of the things i am already seeing that are red flags:

- they don’t allow you to work outside of colorado
- they implement new policies and job requirements at the drop of a hat and expect you to just be okay with it. they tell you they’re happy to answer questions, but you will get passive aggressive responses when you do ask.
- constantly piling more onto your plate as a care agent.
- they time how long you spend on tickets.
- you have to use a couple different programs just to keep track of your clock in/out, breaks & lunches. it’s absolutely unnecessary and if one of their programs doesn’t work right for you, you get the blame for it rather than them try to figure out WHY it’s not working for you.
- the app is so buggy that people are having to write in constantly about the same issues, which can lead to them getting frustrated and taking it out on the care agents. this happens at every job, but it should be noted that it’s not any different just because it’s email.
- the steps to resolve customer complaints are not always clear

on paper, this company seems great to work for. but once you’re in, you’ll realize how many issues there are.
management is very dismissive when issues are brought up & almost offended you would question them. it’s never “how can we resolve this?”"

No experience needed to become leadership. 
Vacation time available but if you take it, you’ll never catch up. 
Great insurance, if you have time to use it. It’s good for single coverage but not for family coverage because it gets expensive fast.","Cons: 
You are responsible if your ISP has an outage even though you’re trapped at home in a pandemic. 
You’re expected to handle about 3 people’s worth of work because they’re chronically understaffed due to high turnover that started since layoffs in April 2020. 
Coaching leaves a lot to be desired. 
HR is not helpful when dealing with delicate coaching situations, so they just prefer to have you fire people because it’s “easier” to replace them. 
Cutthroat coworkers who will do or say anything to get even a chance at a leg up or promotion. 
Wages are not competitive and if you bring it up, you’ll be told that your benefits make up for that. You will then make it on the short list next time they decide to “clean house”. 
You will be expected to provide the best coaching and assistance to your staff but if you need help, you will be ignored by your manager for days on end because they prefer to communicate via Slack. Then you’ll get blamed for making the executive decisions they trained you to make. The company structure is engineered in such a way that no matter what good you do or how hard you work, you will never be appreciated or treated like a human."

It is a job.","IBOTTA values acronym: 

Integrity- There is none. No accountability from the management. Leadership encourages a dysfunctional atmosphere that is nothing less than toxic. 

Boldness- Don't. You will be scolded. Your opinions are not wanted and do not matter.

Outhustle- They time you. You are expected to do a lot of work in a very short time. If you do your work well, you will be scolded for taking too long. Yet, the expectations of what you need to handle, continue to increase.

Transparency- It is a ""do as I say, not as I do"" leadership style.

Teamwork- Shut up and do it. They don't care if you have concerns.

A good idea can come from anywhere- They want your ideas! So they can use them. And not give you any recognition.

If you end up working here, full or part-time, just keep your head down and say as little as possible. When you do speak, be sure to use many agreeable words and emojis.

If you questioned changes, you were met with indifference and a reminder to be “adaptable!”. This meant you were doing multiple jobs not listed in your job description + your coworkers job + whatever they came up with as their new strategy that week . 

They would often cite that they payed “at market” but you can see accurate pay reflected around a Denver. 

If you don’t have a personality like you came from the Ivy League, you’ll never be in any meaningful role. Management and leadership were often unprofessional, rude, and vindictive towards people they didn’t like personally. Leadership made a lot of short sighted management hires, which were probably friends of friends, which tanked the culture. A lot of people left because of the lack of security. 

They hit a 1B valuation after a large investment and employees saw no benefits. No changes in pay , no changes in benefits, no changes in office space. Several monetary incentives that benefited only the C-Suite. Their largest investor is now a subsidiary of Koch Industries so that should tell you where their values lie.

Micromanagement like you’ve never seen before. The answer to every issue of culture is more speeches from the CEO. This is a low integrity leadership team unwilling or unable to tell the truth.

Every full tome employee has equity.","The company is strategically not profitable (money goes to the marketing spend to drive downloads and usage of the app), which puts a big strain on compensation.

Productivity tools that constantly glitch or are inaccurate. This means employees are responsible for not only the work they do, but spoon-feeding their distrustful, paranoid, managers every detail of every anomaly reported by their flawed tech.

Don't do anything except act like a brainwashed zombie, because if you recommend improvements then every detail of your work is scrutinized to the point of creating a hostile work environment. This of course is totally justified by...yup...their terrible technology.

Downtown location","Ibotta hides behind words like “ambitious” and “fast-paced” to justify an extremely toxic behind-the-scenes culture. These include sudden firings, miserable employees, lack of processes and resources, operational errors, low pay, mediocre benefits, and petty management, to name a few. 

The company demands complete loyalty (you’re either their biggest cheerleader, or else you’re against them), but doesn’t concern itself with the details of why someone would be loyal to their employer or enjoy working there: culture, compensation, growth/learning opportunities, etc.  Ironically, these areas are ones where Ibotta falls far short of the line. If you bring up any discontents, challenges, or negative feedback, it suddenly becomes your fault that you “can’t keep up with the ambitious culture.”

Managers are given zero training and are compensated on their performance as an individual contributor. This created a culture of managing up: managers incentivized to prove their worth to their own managers often neglected their own direct reports. The culture breeds pettiness and resulted in a lack of manager professionalism."

They talk about the 'Ibotta Voice' but really what they mean is that every response should be canned prompting customer complaints that we're 'bots' with our responses. If serving the customer means I have to be a brainless drone, why not just have an AI platform respond to all emails?
Hours are not flexible, you are definitely required to commit to a set schedule including a full day on either Saturday or Sunday (good bye personal life).
They claim to have a helpful, team-work mentality but this is definitely not true. Team leads and super users are too busy moving on to the next question than to provide any explanation. ""Just do what I tell you to..."" That doesn't help anyone advance their skill set. QA evaluators are also unresponsive to questions and give canned responses when errors are found. No wonder all our customers think we're bots!

At worst, it is manipulative, entitled, and abusive... not to mention, they just accepted a huge wad of cash from the Koch Brothers?!?! And my goodness, the CEO... among plenty of alarming moments, I witnessed him loudly and publicly belittling a manager in the office (yes, open floor plan means we can hear your bullying in action. Might want to rethink that!)

I have also never worked somewhere that infantilizes its employees the way that Ibotta does. There is ZERO trust. They also pay under market level salaries, and have cut maternity leave, commuter benefits, PTO, and almost all “perks” to minimal levels, so not even sure what incentives are left that this point. Managers and directors are either inexperienced or unqualified to manage, and their reports are left feeling completely unguided and overburdened. There is a widespread feeling of deceitful lip service and false promises at Ibotta — they just  sort of use the right rhetoric and then tell a completely different story with their actions."

It felt like the company was using their startup culture of ""Bagel Friday"" and team happy hours to not compensate employees to even market value of their position. 

- Management was unorganized and poorly executed.  People were in management positions due to tenure as apposed to qualifications, causing lots of stress between management and mid-level employees. 

- The startup culture, post extensive company growth. At the beginning, the fun and energetic culture was inspiring to work for.

- Pay varies widely from person to person even within the same job title. Compensation structures aren't clear and leadership saying they'll work on this has resulted in nothing. 
- Definitely lack of diversity. Senior leadership is all white, mostly men, and out of touch with employees. 
- The CEO dictates many decisions, including critical product decisions, in closed-door meetings that undermines the work of employees. Everyone is trying to work towards supporting an ever changing product that changes at the whim of the CEO. Directors and Managers are afraid to challenge Bryan for fear of being fired or they find him intimidating so they just avoid him. 
- It seems like many are out of touch with the people who use the app. They ignore user research in favor or making things ""shiny and nice"" for investors.

- The fast-paced environment allowed/forced me to learn new things at a rapid pace (which isn't always a pro)","- Both pay and the process (if you can call it that) around promotions and raises are terrible. Raises only happen when you seem like a real flight risk.
- Management is pretty clueless across the board. Most of the people with power and influence made their way into those positions because they joined the company very early on and stayed around long enough to ride the coattails of company growth up the ladder. Almost everyone in management has never held their current position before, so they have no idea how to perform the duties of their role and there is no sense that they're working on improving.
- Turnover is abysmal. The senior leadership team tries to spin this as normal turnover for a high growth company, but in reality, most people are leaving for the reasons listed above and/or they are fired with little notice because they don’t drink the Ibotta kool-aid.
- To drive the turnover problem point home, there has been a shocking level of instability on the senior leadership team. Over the past year, the CFO, the CPO (chief people officer), and the CMO have all left the company (seemingly because they were fired, but it was unclear). 
- “Transparency” is a core value at Ibotta, but this is generally displayed through vanity metrics about how well the company is doing. Any question directed at the senior leadership team around the issues listed above is met with aggression and condescension."
196,Ibotta,Building Something Great!,2018-12-15,5.0,Director,"Most transparent management and leadership team I've ever experienced.  Company has all hands 'standup' every Tuesday where each department lead reports out on the key priorities for the week.  Leadership also hosts a quarterly Town Hall where they walk us through the latest results, new priorities, and celebrates recent accomplishments.  Then management takes open forum questions where employees are encouraged to ask leadership about what's on our minds.  Lastly, I love the quality of my teammates.  Ibotta holds a high bar in recruiting and it really shows once you get here.  I'm inspired to work hard and contribute because when I look around my colleagues are doing the same.","Ibotta expects the best, meaning we are building the best marketing platform for our clients, the best work environment for our employees, and the best returns for our shareholders.  Delivering on these goals is really hard, so for some folks its a change of pace."
197,Ibotta,Winning Culture for the Right Employees,2018-12-14,5.0,Account Executive,"Company culture incredibly ambitious, as largely set by leadership.  I didn't fully appreciate this while working there, but now that I'm back in a more 'normal' business culture, I realize how great it was to be in an environment where employees are encouraged to think big, share ideas, and collaborate in an innovative and open office environment.","Ambitious cultures are not for everyone.  As an example, I've seen other comments regarding turnover, but here's the thing...during my time at Ibotta did people leave the company?  Yes.  Were several of them asked to leave?  Yes.  But at least in my humble opinion, that's because Ibotta values a certain type of ambitious employee that is excited to embrace a growth mindset.  While those transitions can be tough, it's better than the alternative, which I'm living in now where nobody makes tough choices and allows politics and tenure carry the day."
198,Ibotta,Best Company In Denver,2018-12-13,5.0,,"Ibotta was the best company I've worked for thus far in my career.  Extremely driven team overall.  Product is best in industry.  Relationships with CPG and Retailers are fantastic, given Ibotta's ad products are better than other options.  

Management team extremely committed to learning & development.  Company spends ton of money on coaches and leadership programs despite not yet being profitable.","It's very fast paced and the managers ask a lot of their employees.

This is recognized externally as ibotta just won #1 fastest growing company in Colorado (all the others were building firms unsurprisingly!).  As a result, the lived experience is one that is fast-paced and opportunity-driven, continuously looking for the next step forward both in how to deliver value and how to run an ever-growing company more effectively. So if you are flexible, love problem-solving, and willing to roll your sleeves up, this is a great place to be.","If you aren't, you're probably going to struggle."

No management skills. Everyone is promoted based on their time with the company - not on actual skills or qualifications.

Great opportunities to move up.","Lack of diversity in the work place and compensation is below market value. 

Certain teams have completely lost sight of what brings value to Ibotta and that is our users. Everyones main goal on a daily basis should be how to provide a great experience for everyone who uses Ibotta, yet, there are only a few select teams that make this a priority."

Great place to network if you’re interested in the Denver tech / start up community.","Management can be misleading and unethical. Negotiate as best as you can, what was offered was less than market. They are awful at recognizing and maintainting talent. Some days you’ll question the trajectory of the business and whether or not the product will ever be what management wants it to be."
205,Ibotta,Don't Waste Your Time - Toxic,2018-11-14,1.0,Account Executive,"I thoroughly enjoyed working with my piers, as they were eager, ambitious and incredibly smart. This app does provide value for some of its users.","This company is a complete mess. Directors / VP's / C Suite are all delusional about what is important and have lost sight of who the users are and what they actually value. 

I am honestly surprised that Ibotta's board has not removed Bryan Leach. 

Bryan has a serious problem with ""shiny object syndrome"". He lacks the ability to fully develop  and dedicate the resources to see any project to completion. Newness wears off, leaving a half built products, and then all resources are ripped away from that initiative and re-allocated to the next big thing. This results in poor user experience and is detrimental to the value of Ibotta.

As for  Directors and VP's, they are in fear of upsetting Bryan and will cave to any and every wish from above. This culture has permeated every level of the organization. No one has the ability to make a decision to move something forward without a blessing from BL. Simply put... Unscalable & Unacceptable 

Attrition at Ibotta is out of control. It is a mix of smart people seeing the writing on the walls and running, and those that are not doing exactly what BL says and being fired with no warning.
 
As for culture at Ibotta, you will hear the common tech company buzz words floating around the office . 

Transparency. Out-hustle. A Good Idea Can Come From Anywhere. 

The only purpose these words serve is noise. Ibottan's are incredibly good at preaching, where they fall shamefully short is practicing."
206,Ibotta,"Great Company, Low Compensation",2018-11-12,4.0,Client Partnerships,The people at Ibotta are great as is the product! I really enjoy coming to work every day and feel strongly that SLT is guiding the company in the right direction.,"Needs much more competitive compensation packages. While the other benefits and perks are nice, at the end of the day Ibotta's salaries are far lower than other growing tech companies in Denver/Boulder."
207,Ibotta,Do Not Recommend,2018-10-23,1.0,Client Success Associate,No pros to share at this time.,"Unfortunately I wish I had more positive things to share from my time at Ibotta. As a CSA, our team was treated with little to no respect from leadership and other members of the Client Success team, resulting in extremely low morale and a high turnover for this role. Coming from a company with a strong culture and team atmosphere, this was admittedly quite a shock to me.  This is an associate data entry role with no clear career trajectory towards account management, and Ibotta management needs to set better expectations when bringing on new employees.  Deadlines for content creation are extremely unreasonable, and the work does not commensurate with the low pay offered for this role. I would highly deter anyone from taking this role unless things have drastically changed within the last year in this department."
208,Ibotta,Aspires for greatness. Won't get there.,2018-10-14,1.0,Manager,"Good coworkers, a nice location, reasonable benefits.","Leadership is a case study of monoculture. Many of the leaders thriving at Ibotta are friends with the founding team: Personal friends with CEO or CTO, worked together at Photobucket, or an early employee at Ibotta.  Unfortunately, the time for new, impactful people has largely closed. There was a purge of high-level folks that didn't fit the mold (CMO, CFO, CPO).  The Product team churns people.  It speaks volumes to how the company believes it will grow, by following the model that helped it grow from a small startup to a medium sized company.  

There is a lot of aspiration to be great. It hasn't translated and I don't think it will.  For example. One of the IBOTTA values is 'A good idea can come from anywhere'.  Behind closed doors, management does not even consider ideas originating from ""other"" teams. Transparency is another value.  My manager once informed me that someone complained about my team's output but wouldn't say who nor what aspect of our output was at issue.  Lastly, there is a desire to have all managers be good coaches. No one knows how to do that.  We are not honest with ourselves about where we can improve.

Other challenges include an arrogance from some that believe everything the company does is right and great. Few people understand shoppers and many people do not have empathy for them. Worse, some look down on the shoppers. I'm not confident Ibotta will overcome these given how many of the talented people I've seen leave."

- Variety of schedules to choose from","We were given a huge hour cut with the ""option to pick up a fourth day"" which is just a nice way to say ""we could just lay you off instead."" They are making us grab a day week by week ""if available.""

They also pick and choose who could get raises in a tiering system and when they sent out a list of raises, previously let go employees were in the roster, taking up spots for the highest tier of raises. When we questioned our assignment, they sent everyone the same copy and pasted response. It feels as if they are encouraging people to jump ship."

The extreme high growth and rush to become a profitable company has come at a cost for the employees, especially the CSAs. The Client Success Associate role is an entry level position that used to be stepping stone to other roles in the company, primarily the Manager role. They are now treated as outputs with little to none growth opportunity, or strength training. The culture has shift dramatically in this role, and actions and feedback are given by management without consideration or diligent thought. There has been higher turnover in this role of recent because of the issues listed mainly due to poor management and unmanageable work loads and expectations."

Engineering leadership gives us the purview to use whatever technology is appropriate to solve the problems we face (within reason). We aren't chasing the new shiny but definitely harnessing everything available to build out highly reliable, high speed systems.

The overall leadership is top notch as well. They understand our market position and opportunities and attack them with surgical precision. All new features are A/B tested so we don't have that ""I have a hunch this is a good idea"" aspect that many companies have.",Current office is getting pretty packed.

258,Ibotta,Best Job I've Had,2017-07-07,5.0,Partnerships,"There's a reason (or a few) Ibotta was selected as one of Time INC's ""Best Places to Work 2017"" :
- Ibotta is growing extremely fast. It's exciting company to join, where you're able to take ownership of your role and really make it what you want it to be. You'll have a true part in building a really awesome product. Despite the fast growth, management does a good job making sure that all teams are on the same page and are working towards the same goal.  
- Best management team that I've ever seen. They are transparent, approachable, fun, and have laser focus on the future of the company. They do a great job motivating employees and make everyone feel that they are part of a singular team. Bryan (CEO) is the best! He makes sure that everyone knows that they are appreciated and knows every single employee by name. He even goes as far to have small group lunches to hear about your experiences and ideas for the company - because he's genuinely interested in what his employees have to say.  Bryan likes to say that ""an idea can come form anywhere"" and many of the ideas brought up in these lunches come to fruition. 
- Everyone in the office is extremely focused and happy to do their jobs. I've never been in such a motivating work environment. While you're expected to bring your A-game, you WANT to bring your A-game because you can actually see how your work is effecting the bottom line of the company. 
- LOTS of recognition for a job well done.  Managers are regularly calling out individuals at company stand ups to announce noteworthy work. 
-A lot of notoriety in the industry, which continues to grow each day. There's definitely no shortage of work because every brand/retailer wants to be on the app now.
-Tons of opportunity for professional growth. 
-Being surrounded by extremely intelligent people all day. People at Ibotta come from very diverse professional backgrounds, which makes it a gold mine to learn about all sorts of things. 
- Working for a company that helps improve the lives of everyday Americans. There's a wall in the office dedicated to the many stories submitted by Ibotta users telling us how the money they've earned on the app has helped them and their families. How cool is that?! 
-Commuter stipend & 100% covered medical insurance",More of a suggestion than a con - having alternating summer Fridays would be nice!
259,Ibotta,Top Notch Analytics Team,2017-06-30,5.0,Senior Analyst,"Team members are encouraged to take the initiative and own projects. Managers are there to collaborate and help with career development, but not micro-manage.

The technology team offers paths for those who want to manage, and those who want to grow technically as individual contributors. It's great to have options for moving up, that don't all lead to people management. 

The team puts in a lot of effort to keep our tech stack on the bleeding edge. It gives everyone the opportunity to constantly learn new skills. 

Ibotta is an exciting place to be, with rapid growth, and a strong vision. You get the satisfaction of watching your work move the needle here.  

Truly the best team I've ever worked on.","If compensation is your primary focus when choosing a career, then you will do better elsewhere. If you care more about a fulfilling job with exciting opportunities around every corner, then this is as good as it gets."

261,Ibotta,The Most Exciting Software Engineering Opportunities In Denver,2017-06-23,5.0,Platform Engineer,"It seems like most of the employee reviews on here are from the CS department. Engineering is a totally different story from what you read there, in my experience.

Here's what I love about working at Ibotta:

- The most intelligent coworkers I've ever worked with. Seriously brilliant.

- Work & life balance is embraced by managers. There's never been an expectation to work outside the 9-to-5 hours. That said, I sometimes do stay later than 5, but it's because I'm excited about what I'm working on.

- We're on AWS and embrace that, using things like DynamoDB full-on in production. Again, a great learning opportunity.

- A massive scale (millions of users) which makes design challenges and tradeoffs more fun. There are things one simply cannot learn without the impetus of scale. Ibotta has those opportunities.

- Everyone has one-on-one time with their manager each week. It makes such a difference in keeping communication, goals and struggles in sync.

- Strong product managers, which means that I go to fewer meetings and can focus on coding.

-We're on call for one full week every few months. We may be paged and need to address something at any hour. We're not expected to work on features while on call though. Newbies aren't put on call until they feel ready either. This sense of responsibility presented lots of learning opportunities and ownership for me.

- A yearly personal conference - including the ticket, travel to a conference and then a lunch-and-learn, where engineers share what they learned at the conference.

- The Ibotta values are lived out in our company culture. Specifically impressive is the commitment to transparency and trusting that a good idea can come from anyone.

- A strong sense of direction, from the top down","- The company is growing very quickly, which means things shift quickly."
262,Ibotta,Dream Job,2017-06-22,5.0,Engineer,"1. Interesting problems to solve both because of complexity and scale.
2. Very bright, hardworking co-workers.
3. Company leadership can articulate a strong vision for where we are going and it is really exciting.
4. The work environment is fantastic - the office is beautiful, the equipment is first rate, they often bring in food.","I have been here for just over three months at this point, and no cons come to mind."
263,Ibotta,Technology Team is the Best!,2017-06-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I've been an engineer for many years with various companies including start-ups.  Ibotta is hands down the best culture.  If you want to learn new things; if you appreciate being challenged; if you thrive in an environment with positive energy and a fast pace; if you enjoy collaborating with other talented people within engineering and across the company - look no further.  Ibotta has it all.,"Ibotta is a high growth company and with that comes some growing pains.  Ibotta does a pretty good job at trying to alleviate some of the struggles that come with growing quickly, but there is always room to improve.  Fast pace + fast growth can expose difficulties keeping everyone informed and on the same page."
264,Ibotta,You are nothing but another cog in an un-oiled machine.,2017-06-14,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work from home.
CEO is a very friendly, charismatic and passionate individual.","Hard work is met with 0 reward. Occasional bonuses are offered , but they are generally unobtainable. Updates to the app mean we are met with an overwhelming amount of cases from customers writing in about their issues. When you overachieve and complete the bonus by exceeding the amount of cases asked to completed, you may walk away with 0 reward afterward. It gives you very little incentive to try again. There is no guarantee that your work will actually be acknowledged outside of a pat on the back and a false hope that you may receive  the bonus based off the dice rolled by an uncontrollable force.

You are constantly nit picked by stats that never seem to add up. If you solve a large amount of cases you are still met with errors across the board, our app has hundreds of rebates with millions of people using it and not all of them are computer savvy. Most of the time you find your self explaining things that should already be clearly stated within the app. Your stats are based off of a system that is unclear, and it is hard to know how they are calculated. You must solve cases under an amount of time that seems unreasonable, especially when it comes to creating and reviewing very long submissions. Many of those cases require that you take more than the time allotted to each case. Also, there are stats known as productivity that never seems to make sense, you can spend your whole day in cases, answering more then the expected amount, only to be told that your number of cases done does not matter but rather what the productivity formula is saying. Being productive seems more important that having a satisfied user. 

Attendance, as expected with every job, you are to of course clock in on time and on the days you are scheduled. However, life happens and at times you are unable to perform. When these situations occur you are met with a very cold shoulder that leaves you feeling like you truly did something wrong.  Even with a perfect record of 0 call ins and no tardiness your first encounter with a life situation is met with ""do you have a note"". Mind you this company does not provide healthcare for part-time employees, so many people are not going to be able to go to a doctor and be riddled with a ton of bills over something that can simply be remedied with rest. I have worked many jobs where you build a strong working relationship amongst your peers and coworkers and when you have a strong work ethic and even stronger attendance, you are usually met with concern from your coworkers especially when you suddenly don't show up or call in very late stating you have had something happen to you. Here, you will only receive a write up with no warning.

There is no morale within my department. When I first started, we were all assigned a team and worked together within that team, It was very fast paced and things seemed to move effortlessly. Now, with new changes, the job has become incredibly lifeless, you clock in, you say hello, you don't speak unless you need to request a task not within your permissions. There is not a sense of connection or camaraderie."
265,Ibotta,Ibotta is an amazing place to work!,2017-06-14,5.0,CSR-1,"Work from Home
Easy Easy Easy
Fun, team orientated environment, great culture, laid back and so fun! 
401K","Hard to get a full time position due to the fact it is a startup. 
No benefits or paid time off"
266,Ibotta,"Great culture, fun people, and above-average pay",2017-06-12,5.0,,"Quickly growing company with lots of dedicated staff. Miles ahead of most other startups their age, in both product quality and company management. The customer support department has lots of employees, but most don't want anything more than the starting part-time job, so those who are dedicated and show that through their performance can take advantage of the advancement opportunities.

It's not ""easy"" to move up, but if you're looking for easy then you're not really motivated. In my experience, in most companies, let alone a startups, promotions usually only come to those who have exceeded the company's performance standards, and usually for over a year. That is not exclusive to Ibotta.","Every company, young or old, will have issues from time to time, especially for a user-facing company like this. All issues that do come up might not be cleared up right away, but it's a tech company, and most of the people on the CS team have no idea what all really goes into the tech side of some of these seemingly ""simple"" issues."
267,Ibotta,Great for the robotic and complacent type.,2017-06-10,3.0,Customer Service Representative,"Work from home. 
Good for mom's I guess since 99% of the remote CSR's are female/mothers. 
The company seems cool. Some overtime, they throw parties if you are into that. 
Startup CULTure.","No forward movement or pay raises. Ever. 

Review/Audit metrics are completely ridiculous.:

- 90% of users are not very intelligent and couldn't compose a complete sentence, let alone understand the complexities of  the app. CSR's are expected to be able to explain everything to an irate user in ONE response. 

-Complex cases take time to solve correctly, especially with a long thread of replies. Still expected to solve within three and a half minutes. 

-Customer satisfaction is only a small part of your audit. Other redundant metrics make up the rest, so even if you are helping customers and they are happy (Isn't that what customer service is?) ,you will fail your audits. 

There is no feeling of satisfaction with this job. The cases are endless. The  bugs in the app are endless. They release updates without proper testing, all the time. You will never complete anything and there is no extrinsic reward to this position. ""Smash your goal."" and then just keep going because you are stuck in purgatory where it never stops until you clock out. 

They promise things they won't deliver. They poop on their more intelligent employees by making them stay at this position and endlessly/robotically answer emails, promising to inform other departments of your skills/interests, but they won't ever actually do that. They only care about themselves. You are ONE out of 100's of CSR's, you are worthless. If you are an ambitious person and easily bored by this mundane position, you will never move past it because you will not do well on your audits. 

You must drink the kool aid here to be happy. Start up CULTure. If you are complacent and happy with feeling like a robot and using pre-written responses all the time, this is a great job. Intelligent/creative/ambitious types, move on. 

Some of the supervisors should not be supervisors. Seriously. 

Other employees feel this same way, so it is not just me, but the surveys are attached to our email addresses half the time, so no one says what they truly want to say. 

The company doesn't make requirements blatantly known for rebates/bonuses so customers continually write in about the same thing, over and over again. If you like answering the same question 100's of times a week, then this is a great job for you. 

They often advertise new positions that have no pay raise or more hours. Why would I even for a second want to take on more responsibility for no reward? This is like a company asking a graphic designer to do their logo for free ""because it is good exposure."""

While I've just recently joined, I've been extremely impressed throughout the recruitment and onboarding process.  During my interview process, I met more than 10 company employees, and was asked to do a case exercise related to my field of work.  While challenging, I am glad Ibotta invests the time to do these formal case interviews, as well as cross-functional interviews which helped me to better understand the types of colleagues I would be working with.  Additionally, for a high growth company, the onboarding process has been quite smooth and I hear the company is investing heavily in leadershiop and management training in 2016.  Very excited to be a part of it!","None that I can tell as of yet -- the company is definitely extremely ambitious, so it strikes me as a work-hard play-hard mentality, but that's what I wanted."

I was given positive feedback in a  face to face meeting & then heard the complete opposite was said about me in a meeting between the leads.  I am all for constructive criticism.  If there are areas I need to improve in, let me know!  And don't bring your personal dislike of me into the situation.  I was also led to believe that full time status was easily attainable.  It was not.  On more than one occasion, I was told conflicting things from different leads.  All in all, I was very happy with my choice to leave Ibotta.
