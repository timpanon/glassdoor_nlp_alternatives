At this hour after a night of hard work at my new job (about 8 hours after normal office hours), I sit here to think.. why was I able to endure this hard grind.. (with no OT or direct benefits to me right now)

How fast and how high you climb is totally on how much you wanna hustle (not just hard work, but smart work too)
There's ample opportunity for you to spread your wings, behest how hard you willing to flap them...
You learn a lot of things at your first job, no matter where you start. But you get this insane ability to grind inculcated in you and no matter where you go.. you are bound to succeed..

156,Iksula,Negative and honest review,2019-07-12,1.0,Senior Team Lead,There is nothing I have to say for pros.,"I joined Iksula in the month of May 2019. The management had no clue that I was going to join and gave me tasks which were irrelevant to the position I was hired for. In 10 days they told the team that the process will shut down and that we will have to look for another job. 
They hired me in spite of  knowing that the process will be shutting down.
I relocated for the job, they did not even pay the relocation charges.
The management was least concerned about this issue. In fact the management was not in office for 1 week after they disclosed that we lost the client.
The recruiting HR  had no clue if the hiring was still required. The management did not ask the HR to stop the recruitment.  Some of my colleagues were hired 3-4 months back. I've never seen an organization so mismanaged. 
The office and the washroom stinks and the pantry area is unhygienic."

I never wanted to leave the job at Iksula, because I loved and lived my work there. However, I strongly believe I was forced to do so, by not giving me the due of my hardwork in terms of recognition and respect, snatching away my credibility right under my nose just to promote the manager's favourite - Yes this happened with me! Being vocal about the same never mattered and those harsh memories still make my doubt my dedication - it's been over a year that I left the organisation! That phase was the most irritating phase of my life, nonetheless, I am at a better and a happier place today."
159,Iksula,Gave me a promising start !,2019-06-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"1) Stellar qualitative and quantitaive work will be recognized. Perfect fusion of the both will be awarded.
2) Capable people are present at the very top of the each branch hiearchy.
3) Flexible work hours if the deskspace availability allows it
4) Wrok-from home is alowed in case of personal emergency, difficult monsoon travel etc.
5) Quarterly awards are held after every 3 months, rewarding good work in that particualr quarter.
6) Revamped workspace is looking better than before.
7) Samarjeet Singh would greet every relatively known face with a warm smile, something you'd seldom expect from a CEO. Don't know if it should be listed out as one of the Pros, but it kinda helps the new recruits find their footing into the company without worrying about strict management faces (even when they do exist)
8) There's no fixed time alloted for lunch, tea and bio breaks. Employees can choose when to schedule theirs as per their needs.","1) Quarterly awards are based on the quarterly reports maintaned by the managers. The reports don't necessarily reflect the correct contribution of each individual or team. A few managers are doing poor job of maintaining the same, resulting in relatively more worthy candidates left unawarded. Furthermore, there seems to be lack of communication among the managers, a few of them failing to send these reports on time while others are done with the same, which is causing for wrong impression of overall productivity data. A dedicated person needs to be appointed who'd manage these reports across all the teams.
2) Payscales haven't caught up with current time. Appraisals, although not that bad, aren't on-par with today's standards. 
3) Difficult-to-replace voids have been popped up due to a number of experienced, efficient, and intelligent people leaving the company in recent times. Processes are getting difficult to manage. And hiring of ill-suited candidates for the process just for the sake of meeting the requirement is further adding to the chaos.
4) Lack of better canteen and washroom facilities. And due to the very infrastructure of residental building the company is based in, the resolution will never be in sight unless the company shifts to an industrial complex.
5) There's day-to-day struggle of finding your desk space on time. Morning shift and afternoon shift people would share a common desk space so even though one comes on time, there's a chance he might get to start working right away due to the desk space being occupied by a person coming in the morning shift who isnt done with their work.
5) There's no general shift available for non managerial employees. They would be asked to either choose or alloted morning or afternoon shifts, which for some commuters, turn out to be two extremes. Again, since it is a problem rooted in the infrastructure nature, managing these problems will only going to give temporary relief which wont last long.
5) This is not a con per se, but just an observation. Rcently, stricter management policies have been put into effect like time tracker and installation of fingerprint-based entry. Although, they are not new to the corporate set-up ans something that every other company follows, its seemingly restrictive nature is taking a toll on employees' psyches. Now everyone wants to meet the time tracker bare minimum by just keeping the keyboard or mouse active. This has been unlike the previous Iksula environment in which people were focused on work and non-working activities as well. Some fun games were organized by team leads a few years back in socity compound and these activities have now become extinct.
6) Although upper managemet tier is well defined with good personalities leading their branch, middle management group seems to be confused or ill equipped when it comes to finding effective resolutions of the problems raised by their team members.
7) Parking space issue doesn't get solved quickly for most non-managerial employees.
8) No inter or intra team-based events/activities are organized anymore that would alow each meember present within and across the teams to gel well with each other."

Be it HR policies, Office infrastructure, Performance appraisals, development work, any office policy, all are below industry standard. The moment you try to question any of the above things, you will find that all above is on paper.

The key thing here is budget. They will cite ""growth"" and ""growing company"" as the reason for not doing anything  which basically means that they dont have budget to actually do it.

The HR staff, in particular, is very poor at explaining anything about anything, be it Form16 or PF or anything you ask, they are clueless. They will always either point you to different people or give wrong information, I was given wrong information which I found out after a year.

I know what the iksula HR staff will say once they read this, that this should have been brought up in so called Kitkat sessions, and it was certainly brought up many times. In reality this sessions are not regular, sometimes dont happen for months, and even when they do, the feedback you share never turns into any action item. Just the usual, we are growing company so we have to adjust excuse.


To summarize,
- Poor HR staff and policies.
- Poor management and leadership, projects are taken without any consideration for timelines and cost, forcing developers to work more than they should. This happens on all projects.
- The infrastructure, office space, workstations, toilets are very poor, with broken instruments, and cardboard boxes jammed into every space you can find."

I was initially a quick job hopper, but Iksula managed to keep me hooked. Like all relationships, we had out ups and down, however, we got through it together, helping each other out. The appraisals here are the best I've come across and good performance won't go unnoticed. Regular language training (for writers & editors), easily accessible and (mostly) friendly managers, and a free espressos whenever you need them, were just some of the perk this company offered. During my climb from writing to editing, I have learnt proper methods of producing, enhancing, and organizing data, handling production of content, managing team members, training, and so much more; and all this, just because I asked for a chance and was given one. Great people to work with.","You meet a lot of different ppl here and when I say different I meant it.

207,Iksula,A good deal for freshers,2016-09-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. Flexible work hours
2. Good chances that you will meet like minded colleagues. Mostly young people who are trying to find a footing in their careers
3. Can offer a great learning experience if you are open to work beyond your responsibilities
4. Department Heads and Team Leads were very welcoming of your queries, concerns and requests","1. Felt under appreciated from senior mgmt at times. May kill motivation unless you voice your opinion
2. Freshers have a bad reputation of eloping whenever possible. Iksula has a strict bond in place that keeps freshers in check. There are no ways to bypass the bond even if you have a legitimate reason to not honour it
3. Frequent tunnel vision due to dearth of clients (hope this has been fixed by now)"

215,Iksula,Iksula don't care for his employees and become cheap in giving appraisal to his employees.,2016-05-06,1.0,Quality Analysis,"no canteen,no bonus,no medical benefit(its on paper only ) and very low salary, no travel allowance and delayed appraisal cycle.They have become so cheap they don't create ""iksula"" gmail id so that they will waste 100 rs a month for each employee. ""They organise game  of cricket or give party at the time of diwali so that they can divert the people from asking for bonus or any other refreshment but didn't bother for good lifestyle of his employees.They only say you should come and speak to your team lead or HR for allowance or other important work  but at the end they say ""kisiko nahi milta hai"" this is the rule of the company neither they approach to us or generate a mail for the same.They just reply with good answers to our reviews,so that they can make others to believe how much they are kind to their employees.I want to ask ""What do iksula give(benefit) apart from low salary to employee?","Getting only Rs 8000 for all my hard work for 10 months  and rating given is 3 during appraisal and for three rating you are giving 10% hike i.e 8000+800=8800.and you hire people from kalyan ,panvel,virar etc.Do you have any idea how much travelling expenses we pay?I calculated mine ""metro pas ""675,local pass =150,auto fare =600,sometimes you leave late from office so we have to go by bus (month calculation) it add up to = Rs 1500 approx.8800-1500=7300(balance).As there is no  reasonable canteen,we are having snacks for which we have  to pay almost Rs 50  a  day.this adds to another 1500 i.e i am left with 5800 rs.In this I have to pay my electricity bill(approx 1000 rs),mobile bill(300 approx) and internet bill(500) now I am only left with ""4000"".. You need to think what you are providing to an employee independently so that he can atleast he can live in mumbai instead of surviving and  whose salary is already low you are giving only 10 % hike only.(need to think deeply).Come to first  floor  and fourth floor,look at the people you have been appraised so far their hard work.and please generate a mail for travel allowance for their  employees.

Game plan of the Company : 1)Increased the no of openings before appraisal cycle(40) with no space in our office.
 
2)Giving a hike of 10% to employees who is in iksula for more than 2 years.(so that they can replace with new joinee and pay them less for the same work instead paying more to the ex employee for the same work.

3)employee get frustrated and leave the office.

Note:They give a better hike to team lead and other few seniors so that their should able to train new joinees."

217,Iksula,good compamy,2016-04-16,3.0,Human Resources Manager,its a very nice company with good opportunity. there is no heirarchy which is the best thing about this company. people are friendly and understanding. Open work culture. salary on time,There is lack of policies for employees. No celebration on women's day. there is no training given to new joinees. no process training.
218,Iksula,Was a good opportunity for freshers but degraded over time,2016-03-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Was a great opportunity for freshers 
- Team used to be great but is not doing very well now
- Opportunity to take up different tasks/roles","- Very low salary
- No work life balance
- Frequent changes in the senior management"
219,Iksula,Abysmal for experienced professionals;Heavenly for workaholics(Maybe or maybe not),2016-02-21,2.0,,"1) Good for freshers that have a zest to propel
2) Friendly environment cause everyone is young and most of them are freshers
3) Plethora of learning for freshers 
4) Growing company and there has been a surge in terms of new client acquisitions","1) Work life balance Non existent
2) Experienced people plummeting
3) Intense Micro Management(You eventually end up being a coordinator)
4) Developers and Analysts end up staying in the office till 12pm or even worse-2 or 4 am
5) No incentives for working overtime, not even a drop
6) You will be asked to leave the organization if you leave from office at 7pm 
7) Agree the increments are decent i.e 20-30%, but that's there is many IT conglomerates, the kind of work freshers do at Iksula deserve an increment of min 50%-100% cause I haven't really seen any one handle domestic, UK and US clients as a routine task
8) Senior management(Except for MD) is naive cause for most of them this has been their first or second job and they really haven't got a good exposure"
220,Iksula,A great place to learn & grow,2016-02-20,5.0,E-commerce Executive,New joiners will learn a lot of things when they join an process. Very helpful people over there. A combination of fun & work.,Did not find any cons.
221,Iksula,"Fast paced company, stay active to keep growing",2016-02-15,4.0,,"Fast paced, great learning and growth experience",Working hours a little higher than others due to the fast pace
222,Iksula,Excellent Young and Dynamic Organization,2016-02-15,5.0,Marketing Manager,Working with a young organization is always a pro as you get to learn alot with more responsibility in your given role. The CEO closely works with all the teams and is open for discussions on improvement and to move ahead. Facilitates growth for open minded people,None that I can think off
223,Iksula,The most demotivating place ever,2016-02-05,1.0,Content Writer,"It is very sad to say, after having spent a year here, I can't find anything good to talk about it.","Here goes the list:
1. Employees don't get paid their worth. The appraisals leave everyone unhappy and demotivated
2. I've seen people getting promoted because they have good relations with their managers. Whether they have skills or no, is not checked. Some team leads have no idea how to manage a team.
3. People are made to work like machines, sometimes also on weekends with no compensation. People have also waited throughout the night and not gotten appreciated for that.
4. Resignations are not accepted quickly. In fact sometimes they are not accepted at all. So in the end you have to leave without a relieving letter because you have already decided the joining with new company. 
5. The managers aren't approachable. Their places keep changing so you have to constantly ping them or call them(if you are lucky enough to have their number)
6. Seating arrangements- There are a lot of people working(Yes, Iksula is expanding like crazy). But there is not enough space for people to sit. 
7. No canteen. We get free coffee and tea but it is very unhygienic
8. The washrooms are almost never cleaned and you are forced to wait in a line to go. The flush doesn't work. Raising tickets or talking to the admin doesn't work.
9. The HR is always seen hanging out in the pantry and it gets louder more often than not, which gives a really bad impression to people who have come for an interview(The tiny pantry is right behind the reception). Also the HR people are not as approachable as they should be. 
10. Infrastructure- The office is located in different floors of different wings, so it is really difficult for people to work as a team. 
11. There is a lot of miscommunication between the managers and team leads (sometimes amongst the managers) as to who is handling what. 
12. They have strict work timings and your salary is deducted if your manager doesn't approve regularization. 
13. There are no fixed policies.(At least what we are made aware of)
14. There is no way to talk to HR for grievances. No grievance policy, which considering the amount of problems people face, is very necessary here.
15. People are given false promises before joining. I was told the appraisals is 25% at least. Also the kind of job you will be doing. People get hired as editors and made to work as writers. 
16. Notice period is too much- 2 months."
