For some who are good in show-off, glib talk, they will get eye popping salaries, others will get salary even less than what recruitment agencies pay to their employees. They are willing to pay agencies huge fees for offers but wont even pay a fraction to the internal recruiters.

Leads/Managers don't work, they only attend meetings and delegate all the work to team members and only claim and take credit for offers made. They spend most of their time in drinking coffee and chatting. There is absolutely no career planning, they only want to squeeze the maximum work out of you.  There is total chaos and confusion and complete lack of systems and process. Hiring managers are desperate to escalate things and show recruiters in poor light.   

They are desperate to show off and put more focus on branding and marketing rather than their products. 

They treat recruiters like machines, don't give them a semblance of respect. 

Interns are cheap labour for them. They can be used to do all kinds of sundry work without incurring significant expense. They will not bother to give them good projects to work on for their internships. Be sure to waste your internship duration if you are joining as an HR intern."
330,InMobi,Downfall of a great company,2018-04-05,2.0,Tech Lead,Flexible timing. Food. Work Life Balance.,"1 . Very unethical company and especially the top management. Earlier they had promised that those who will stay in Inmobi from 2014 to 2016, you will get a car but they didn't give. The CEO gave some stupid reason and told the company will give the money in next 2 years divided equally in 8 installments. But there is a catch that if you leave in between, you wont get the money. So essentially they converted 3 years retention bonus to 5 years retention bonus.

2. No Transparency: Since last 2 years they are delaying the appraisals from January to April. We don't get any official communication or reason for delay whatsoever. 

3. Good people are leaving since there is no clarity of work and people are not believing the company's idea any more.

4. Our beloved CEO has found a mantra to make the company profitable which is A-B, where A is revenue and B is running cost. Instead of increasing A, they are only focused on decreasing B, and in order to do so they are letting good people go.

5. Arrogant and undeserving middle management: At Inmobi, they is a great parity issue. You can find engineering managers with overall 7 years or less experience. Anyone can become EM, architect easily."

351,InMobi,Valuable but generally awful experience.,2017-11-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Compensation was competitive.

- Perks (free lunch, 401k match, gym reimbursement) are pretty good (although standard for a well-funded startup in SF/Valley).

- Depending on the team, a lot of latitude to shape your role and take on responsibilities if no one else is already doing something. Lots of gaps to slide into.

- Some of the people are really, really great.

- Opportunity to travel to India.

- You'll learn a lot about how NOT to do things. Best practices by negative demonstration. 

- If you survive, you'll learn how to solve problems and get stuff done. An interviewer once commented, ""Oh, you're from InMobi. You must be really good at putting out fires and dealing with problems."" Yep.","- Awful, awful culture in the US office. Working here was a pretty eye-opening experience in how not to hire and how not to manage people.

- The time zone difference between SF and HQ in Bangalore is a beast, either 12.5 or 13.5 hours depending on time of year. Unless you're willing to stay up in the middle of the night, you have a couple hours in the evening and maybe a couple in the morning (if Indian co-workers are willing to work late-night on their end).

- Communication is broadly poor. Non-exec personnel rarely travel from Bangalore to SF (even less in the other direction) and educational sessions on new developments happen at 3 AM PST, opening up a ever-widening knowledge gaps. Major product changes are pushed out without consulting teams relying on the product, servers are deprecated without sufficient notice to stakeholders, etc.

- Execution is weak with lack of accountability. Across the board, output is sloppy. When (not if) things go wrong, folks are often more concerned with passing the blame than fixing the problem.

- Speaking of fixing problems, it doesn't happen. The culture is broadly reactive rather than proactive. Teams run into the same problems over and over again, and no one ever takes a step back to assess and address underlying issues. They attack the symptoms furiously but ignore the root cause. And they don't even attack the symptoms that well. Consistent but non-catastrophic problems hampering productivity are ignored. Catastrophic problems get duct-taped back together rather than actually fixed, complicating future releases. 

- US teams do not have nearly enough autonomy. Far too often something breaks and only Bangalore has either the ability or authority to fix it. Simple tasks on new products might take special back-end access that only one engineer in Bangalore has. If you need to fire it while that person's asleep... tough.

- There's a bias towards throwing more man-hours at repetitive tasks and pain points, rather than implementing effective automation or improving tools. Smart people devote too much time on mundane tasks because workflow isn't streamlined, damaging morale, engagement, and retention.

- Headcount is bloated, with too many incompetent middle managers. Significant personnel redundancies in some areas and not nearly enough resources in others. Far too many people have the attitude of ""not my problem"", and a shocking number will deny a problem even exists (apparently ""cannot replicate issue"" means the issue doesn't exist). You'll constantly have to hunt down the person who can solve your issue and then bombard that person with a stream of follow-up emails to get them to do their job.

- On the flipside, people at times get overzealous and try to tackle issues outside their competency. Numerous times folks escalated minor problems they didn't understand, portraying minor hiccups as p0 issues, actively making those problems more difficult to manage, and making it harder to get resources for future problems.

- There's an institutional resistance to change. I've spoken with folks who worked at InMobi before my time and they were staggeringly consistent in their complaints.

- You end up with a perfect storm that manages to be both chaotic and bureaucratic. Avoidable fire drills are common. Minor requests turn into multi-day ordeals, because small confusion holds up progress, folks lack the initiative and/or authority to make calls, and you have small daily windows for India to get status updates. Major requests turn into insane rabbit holes with emails ever growing list of people added to email threads, constant passing of the buck, and countless hounding follow-up emails. Startup chaos is fine if teams are empowered to take initiative and attack issues as they arise; bloated corporate bureaucracy is manageable if it provides clarity, standardizes processes, and lessens stress. Fostering a chaotic environment while maintaining structural barriers to getting things done is really the worst possible outcome.

- People are treated as fungible. Layoffs and the like are not handled well. The talented colleagues I liked and respected generally churned out pretty quick, let go, or had one foot out of the door. The ones who stay are stuck because of their visa situation or grossly overpaid and riding things out.

- Fundamentally, the work's not that meaningful. This reflects on the broader adtech industry more than InMobi specifically-- the number of people who've told me they need to get out of adtech is staggering. But even if you're working in a BS industry, it's nice to win and feel like your employer gives a crap about you."

- Ample learning opportunities for entry/mid level engineers, especially in the platform teams.

Particularly in the last year or so, most of the moonshot projects have been dropped in favor of maintaining *only* the existing systems. Although this builds a positive balance sheet, risk aversion and lack of innovation would affect the prospects in the long run

- A repercussion of above point is utter lack of growth opportunities beyond ""tech lead"" level. This has led to a flurry of top notch tech guys (Sr and Principal Architects) to leave within last year, further adding to the lack of direction

- Infra Engg/Ops teams are full of incompetent people. With absolute lack of understanding of the business and lack of will to learn *anything*, they drag the whole Engg fleet into mismanaged, poorly planned and poorly executed data center migrations, with the same set of mistakes repeated each time. Most of these people having self-righteous attitude never show any sense of ownership and never own up to their mistakes. Timelines for several projects and stability of several systems get hampered due to poorly run Infra Engg team, with no one to look up to

High attrition – More than 100 employees have quit the company in the last 8 months due to the highly political, toxic work environment

Clueless leadership – Leadership team is incapable of fixing the many problems and taking the company to the next level; raising money from investors is one thing, building a world-class company is another

Juvenile and abusive managers – Employees with fancy degrees from IIT/ IIM/ Ivy Leagues and ex-consultants are made managers without assessing their people management skills

Poor business ethic and integrity – Company indulges in unethical practices like propagation of incorrect information and fabrication of reviews on Glassdoor :

1. Company strategically leaks misleading information about revenues, profitability, and investor interest in public to paint it in a flattering light

2. Company encourages fabrication of reviews on Glassdoor. Thanks to fake posts the rating on Glassdoor has increased from 2.7 in Aug-2014 to 3.5 in 2015…..nothing much has changed in the last 6 months or so……company continues to meander, attrition continues unabated….

Lack of well-defined roles and career path – Company is clueless about the way forward and changes its strategy every 5-6 weeks leading to frequent changes in roles; hiring is done on the spur of the moment without any thought about career path for the candidate

Toxic work environment – Highly political work environment; difficult to survive without boot-licking; unbiased/ objective opinion on culture, products, strategy is discouraged

Unfair intern policy – Company recruits interns at cheap wages promising them conversion and better salary after 3 months, HR then repeatedly extends the internship period under flimsy reason till the frustrated intern quits …"

People management very important along with merit.
Mid level management needs to improve."
514,InMobi,To describe this company with one word: Inept,2014-10-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Ability to learn a lot about the industry 

Catered lunches

frequent office parties

Employees are great people, with a few key mentors still around

The InMobi Ad Network has tremendous global scale","The company actively engages in fabricating Glassdoor reviews (its embarrassingly obvious), which is extremely unethical. Many people were lied to about roles and responsibilities to get them in the door. The shortest tenured employee left in 2 weeks.

They do not care about the employees, consistently downplaying real problems in the company and overblowing small “victories” that seem to exemplify InMobi as being a “winner” 
Favoritism is rampant, with people who add 0 value (sometimes detract value) staying on board simply because they praise the company shamelessly. The company went from being staffed at over 100+ to teetering barely over 20 in less than 2 years. After the IT manager quit they sent someone from India HQ to fill in temporarily. He came thinking he was there for 2 weeks and they forced him to stay there for over a quarter. This company does not care for its employees' well being. 

The company is only 5-6 years old and is already rife with political problem. Middle managers are completely out of touch and brown nose to the execs when they visit from their ivory tower. Consistently throw workers below them under the bus to save their own skin.

The company launches too many products, claiming them as game changers while patting themselves on the back and celebrating their “genius,” all the while never doing Q&A. Most of them have one fatal flaw that renders them obsolete or useless. The product is swept under the rug and never spoken of again. See App Publish, Mediation, LTVP, Custom FSI Frames, App Galleries, and these are just the external products. 

Culture is set around the mantra “the beatings will continue until morale improves.”  At one point they were making employees stay back until a certain time, in some misguided attempt to keep employees at the office longer, cultivating a culture through “quantity time” instead of Quality. Its some kind of twisted fantasy land. 

The compensation is absurdly low for anyone below middle management. Promised compensation changes are consistently pushed back another quarter, with backhanded/greedy tactics being employed to nickel and dime each and every employee. Either by adding pay raises in the form of “bonuses” (which should be considered insulting) or stalling til next quarter. InMobi fails to realize that when they pay low salaries, all the talented workers will leave for better jobs, and they will eventually get workers who deserve that low pay. The result of this practice has left them dependent on a few key competent workers supporting an entire network, once these people leave they will be replaced with rookies to the company and industry.

They have shifted a lot of the responsibility of operational work to India, which may make sense from a budget standpoint but partners and clients don't like the idea of 8:00 AM/PM calls to accommodate the time difference."

Really good party/event management team. Meals 3 times + snacks 1 time per day.","Recently InMobi has gone bad for engineers.

- Company overall does not seem to care about employees as individuals, they are mostly deemed replaceable, which is a large part of the high turnover.

They will take your drive and smash it into the ground. There is no appreciation of talent, which is why a majority has left. There has been at least 3 major re-organizations.

(And they have started adding random positive reviews.. Its a scam on the part of inmobi to game with glassdoor)."
569,InMobi,It was exciting,2014-02-05,3.0,Account Manager,"Went through the most challenging and highest growth period of the company history, met a lot of passionate, smart, and dedicated people from all over the world","Product team was too slow to build products that customers want, communication with India headquarter and product team was difficult"

571,InMobi,Perhaps the most ideal,2014-01-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"Awesome talent pool. 
Good work.
Though the engineering strength is around 400 (not sure though), pace work is quite like a start up. 
Freedom to choose kind of work and the work hours.","These days show off has become bit too much.

573,InMobi,Inmobi a goldmine of learning,2014-01-22,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I know it may look like a fairy tale, But yes this is what I can write about Inmobi after working there for 3 years.
1. Best people in the industry
2. Kick ass engineering team
3. Motivation that is driving the company at such a pace.
4. Open and transparent culture.
5. Perks(Awesome free food and lots of goodies through out the year)
6. Parties
7. Great place for learning.
8. Freedom for innovation and implementing your own ideas.
9. Name a technology, We work on it.
10. Flexible timings and great ownership of work is given right to an entry level engineer.
11. Salaries are one of the best in market.","1. You find it hard to leave.

574,InMobi,Had Potential But Squandered It,2014-01-17,2.0,,"Once there was true passion and drive amongst the employees. Very lenient organization in some ways. You will be well paid and can work as much as you want to. Free food, well located offices, opportunity to see the world on the company dime.","The long and short of it is that the leadership team ""tries"" to lead by trial and error. The founders/ management team are seriously out of their depth. Any talent/ voice of reason that was there has left or is on their way out. Accountability does not exist for the ""inner circle"". There are a bunch of people in the senior team/ management who have never delivered but continue to thrive. 

Even the folks that they have brought in to lead HR and other functions recently are an absolute joke (as echoed in other reviews as well). Performance management is a farce. Its not surprising that a company of this size is so political with so many people trying to protect their turf/ image. 

There are some people at the top who are absolute geniuses at making others' work look like their own and the number of ""yes men"" the founders have surrounded themselves with is discomforting (but quite obvious). The people who get slaughtered are those who voice their dissent and the poor engineers who are made to run around while the leadership team tries to figure out the next big idea. Failed efforts are conveniently forgotten never to be talked about again without any analysis of why they failed. Overall extremely political and CYA environment."
575,InMobi,Definite no no,2014-01-13,1.0,Software Engineer,"Hardly anything good can be said about the work place. 
- Decent salaries
- Free food
- Nice looking office","This place is riddled with a plethora of problems. Most of them are seemingly unfixable.
- Heavily politicized work place. 
- Upper management seems to have no clue what they've gotten themselves into. They seem unable to understand what the company's goal is in the short term and long term. Barring making money of course.
- Middle management is most keen on saving their own jobs. Nothing good can be said about them.
- Product management is unsatisfactory. More good product managers are leaving or have already left. Lots of layers (mostly useless) in product management. People prefer hacky solutions over clean, scaleable ones. 
- Architects and senior engineers are below par technically. They are good at using flowery language and articulating their bizarre ideas. 
- HR policies are arbitrary, if any.
- Heavy disparities in salary. All one needs is to create a perception. If you're perceived to be useful, the company would give you twice your market worth (maybe more)."

Smart people who are approachable even the CEO
Trying hard to retain there employees and spread a good word around","HR is for name ..with a lot of attitude on the face like they are angel of god (Guys donot get flattered they are not tht good looking but they think they are)
No career growth discussions ever
No feedback for personal growth though you will get the feedback on tasks if you are not doing good
Sometimes your own manager seems unreachable and is never on his desk 
People attitude is a big problem some of them think that they are born to do some great thing in the world so they will not do small tasks.Even some of the freshers are like that leave alone the experienced guys."

Somebody else will take credits for hard work done by you and you cannot resist this for long period no matter how hard you bounce back, eventually you will start loosing your passion and you feel like you are done

Office is has a convenient location by Caltrain
You will learn everything NOT to do when running a business","- Lots of bad talent.  Used to have great talent but everyone that is good has left or is on their way out

-No culture.  The office is dead and no one is happy to be there.  They think by having forced happy hours that everyone dreads going to is having culture.  

-Bad management.  You are treated like a moron.  Leadership always lectures everyone about how to do their jobs even though they have no idea about the market they are in.  If you voice your honest opinion, you are looked upon negatively.  If you suck up to them, drink the kool-aid, and believe that that terrible excuse as a company is already the next Google, then you will be praised.

-Company is in a disarray - simple things do not work while the founders all preach about the big next thing...they can’t even get basics correct

-Highly political office - if you aren’t in the FOTW team, you are a nobody there.  They play favorites often and promote incompetent people.

-People get thrown under the bus all of the time.  InMobi leaders often put all of the blame on their employees to save their own skin.  They also take all of the credit.

-Career development...does not exist

-Idea stealing organization - if you have a great idea, you can’t do anything without someone from the India office to approve...then they take all of the credit

-Look at other reviews, most people are unhappy.  The unhappiness is starting to affect those in the India HQ.  Those who are happy cite that they “ I joined InMobi because I believed in the vision of a Indian global technology firm being number one in the world. “  - this quote is from another review on Glassdoor.  They do not understand that those not in India do not care about making a successful Indian company.  

-They have no respect for you or your time.  You frequently get pulled into calls with India (11.5 hour time zone difference).  Your call start at either 7 AM or 11 PM.  That is ok, it is part of the job.  What is not ok is when they cancel the meeting without telling you.  So you either wake up early, or stay up late for nothing.

637,InMobi,Zero concern for people. Not a nice place to work.,2012-06-11,1.0,In A Business-related Non-technical Role,"- Lot of freedom. 
- Great startup like environment.
- The mobile internet space is growing fast - and opportunities are exploding.
- Lots of opportunity for growth.","InMobi is sold to new hires as 'Google's biggest competitor - and soon to be the new Google' . Starting from this initial promise, many things about the company completely lack in integrity. 

- Completely agree with the other reviewers about the staggering amount of politics prevalent here. So much runs on who you know rather than how you work.
- Zero concern for employees. No HR practices. No thought for career progression. No transparency in career decisions.
- At the top and middle management levels there is no concern or empathy for people. There is obsessive focus on revenue/numbers/targets - and none on people. There is zero transparency or openness.
- No salary parity.
- No work life balance. You're pushed to work very late hours. But rewards dont match up.

Among many employees, there is complete distrust and disrespect for middle and top management. There's acknowledgment that you cant trust middle and top management to care for people or careers.

The amount of attrition that has happened in the last few months is not surprising at all."
