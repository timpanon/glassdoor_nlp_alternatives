2,InVision,Nice people,2022-03-30,3.0,Principal Designer,"Remote, interesting space to work",Had a rough few years with tough competition
3,InVision,"Outclassed by competitors, and burning into the ground",2022-03-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,- Decent salary compared to market rate,"- Management and leadership have no idea what goes on or what people are doing
- Product is being outclassed in every way by competitors
- Constant pivot in product strategy causing confusion and uncertainty throughout the business
- Still supporting old, archaic products that aren't even updated anymore
- Lack of transparency"
4,InVision,Good company,2022-03-22,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,Every thing is good there,No cons as I know
5,InVision,Excellent Company Culture,2022-03-21,5.0,Senior BI Engineer,"Co-workers are really nice to work with, and everyone is allowed to make contribution in his/her own unique way. Very little micromanagement. ICs most often work independently and are empowered by management. Pleasant company culture.","Company has been going through many changes due to market competition, which means everyone should be agile in adapting changes. And since everyone is remote, everyone should be a self starter when it comes to work and planning."
6,InVision,Good leadership,2022-03-18,3.0,Account Executive,Great people to work with,Business direction changes a lot
7,InVision,"Amazing company to work for, excited every day",2022-03-17,5.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"I've been here for a little over 6 months and don't regret my choice... InVision has an awesome and open company culture with the first company principle being humility. I continually find everyone from ICs to senior leadership open to ideas, willing to collaborate across all levels, and happy to say when they don't know something or need more information.

To get the bullet list of Pros, here you go:

* Humble company culture
* Deeply collaborative
* I'm a cis-gendered white guy, but am part of multiple ERGs and from my perspective, the company is very inclusive and supportive of everyone
* Love the people I'm working with
* Monthly all-hands meetings to keep the entire company informed of our progress
* Involved and caring leadership team
* Focus on career development","* We're moving so fast, that it's sometimes difficult to keep up with everything going on across the organization.
* Working for a fully remote company has challenges, but they're the same cons (schedule coordination, occasional feeling of disconnection) that you'd have with any fully remote company"
8,InVision,All the opprotunity to make a difference,2022-03-09,5.0,Manager,"-Best humans I've worked with in a long time

11,InVision,"Passionate people in a collaborative, welcoming space!",2022-03-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Benefits are amazing!! The people at THE best I've ever worked with! The leadership at InVision is pretty incredible. I've gained so much trust in my team, leaders and the product pretty quickly. I'm grateful to be working remotely, and with a supportive, inclusive group of people who all strive to come to work as themselves. I LOVE that!!!!!!",Maybe that just some teams are understaffed.
12,InVision,Great company,2022-02-22,5.0,BDM Manager,Love this company can’t think of anything bad to say,Remote working can sometimes be a struggle
13,InVision,More focused and momentous than ever,2022-02-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Solid strategic footing after some soul searching
- Incredible focus and momentum
- Product is fun to work with and work on; it truly makes day-to-day remote collaboration more enjoyable and effective
- Amazing people - some of the smartest, kindest, and collaborative
- Fast-paced, iterative startup mentality that may be somewhat unique for a late stage startup
- Remote from conception - this company has it down","Not a con, but because it operates like a true startup, you’ll need to expect unique challenges that come with it. For example, Data Analytics team is smaller than some other places, you need to prioritize ruthlessly."
14,InVision,One of the best companies I have worked at,2022-02-14,5.0,Senior Director,some of the best people and culture,change in strategy often for a late stage startup
15,InVision,Good Organisation,2022-02-11,4.0,Software Engineer,"Friendly, diversified team.

– Team support 
– Great benefits 
– Working from home
– Flexibility, team drive to move into the same direction & pivot if needed to produce great work
– Work-life-balance
– Exciting times pivoting from just working on a design software to serve a broader audience with Freehand/cross-collab
– Working with the most talented designers from different backgrounds, high-performer attitude","– (Not really a con, but tip) Working from home requires self-starter attitude & great communication skills"
17,InVision,"Great people, terrible management",2022-02-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,-Great people (IC and lower level management),"-Frequent re-orgs and strategy pivots will give you whiplash
-Executive leadership is led by their own feelings rather than the data in front of them
-Below average compensation"
18,InVision,To the MOON!,2022-02-08,5.0,Sales Leader,Freehand is on fire! Come join us as we travel to the moon!,"Still don't have everything on the rocket ship polished, but we are getting there!"
19,InVision,Great people,2022-02-04,4.0,Staff Software Engineer,Absolutely great people to work with.,Leadership feels a bit poor on execution.
20,InVision,Amazing Culture!,2022-02-03,5.0,Staff Accountant,"This company is amazing. Everyone is so welcoming and energized to give their best for the company. In my department, everyone is extremely nice and helpful with one another. I have never been trained this amazing at any of my prior jobs. The culture and benefits here show that the company really cares about its employees.",I honestly do not see any cons at the moment.
21,InVision,Long Haul,2022-02-02,5.0,Team Leader,"I joined InVision as one of the earliest hires. Tasked with building and scaling the foundations of the company. As the company grew I continuously had the opportunity to pivot within the company focusing on growing teams and solving issues. In short, following my passion. A couple of my managers over the years, especially Clark the CEO, were consistently supportive in my personal & professional growth.",The biggest con I felt was the company never developed a reward and engagement program aimed at employees who stayed with the company for the long haul (4+ years). Following the lead of other companies who implemented programs like Sabbaticals & additional stock option grants once all previous shares had been vested.
22,InVision,"Amazing Culture, Solid Leadership",2022-02-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Company truly seems to care about the people. The work is interesting and collaborative.,Various product shifts and restructuring create the need to constantly shift and reprioritize.
23,InVision,A wonderful team  making cool stuff,2022-02-01,5.0,Product Manager,"- amazing people (seriously, the team is the best! Happy to call many current and former InVisioners friends, even though I am no longer at the company)
- remote-first company
- cool products
- great benefits
- they care about your growth and well-being
- you'll learn a lot
- trail-blazer in the design community
- brand recognition
- strong diversity - I felt welcome and comfortable to be me","- there's been a revolving door - though management is working on that
- crowded market
- lot of meetings"
24,InVision,"Great team, right market, inclusive for real",2022-02-01,5.0,Customer Team,"* I so appreciate my colleagues. They’re not just smart and driven — they’re truly supportive of one another. There are skills I have now that I didn’t a year ago because I’m always learning from them. And this crazy last year of COVID would have much less manageable without them. 
* Building on the “collaboration” side of the value prop and technology has been such a good move. The change in our platform over the last 4-5 months has been stunning. And we’re getting great feedback from the market on it. It’s exciting to be in such a needed, relevant space and have long-time customers so invested with us. 
* I feel supported in a way that isn’t just about my work or my team’s work—but about me being me at work. It’s the first time I’ve felt this way in my many, many years working in tech. There’s formal structure in place to support this (ERGs, diversity panels). But 1:1 interactions are this way, too.","* we’ve had to manage many staff changes through this transition. It’s opened up a lot of new opportunities for people to grow, but it’s also hard work to get everyone resettled. 
* the lack of IRL events due to COVID has been really tough on some team members. I get it, and it’s definitely the responsible thing to do. But for those who have been most isolated during the pandemic, it’s stressful."
25,InVision,"Fast pace, great team",2022-02-01,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The talent and culture at InVision is the best I’ve experienced in my career. The bar is high, the pace is fast, but in a few short years, I have learnt decades worth not just about sales & customer success, but business operations, go to market, product etc via cross functional collaboration and the start up culture of the company. On a personal level, the company has always been remote so there were no growing pains associated with the pandemic & you are trusted (not micromanaged) to do your work while still living your life. When I need to deal with a sick child, or lockdown measures, etc or in general as it relates to work/life balance and ensuring I take time off- I am always encouraged to do so. The company also takes D&I initiatives seriously & invest in resources to raise awareness on relevant issues & to ensure a safe workplace for all.","No matter how long we’ve been around, we truly operate like a start up: the pace is fast, environment is chaotic, and things that may have been true yesterday, may not be true tomorrow. The environment requires you to be resilient, figure things out- with sometimes limited resources- and be willing to contribute outside of your said job description. This isn’t the place for you if you need a lot of guidance and structure to do your best work. Be prepared for challenging but exciting work as the business shifts to a new platform & product experience."
26,InVision,Amazing Remote Company + Amazing Career Growth,2022-02-01,5.0,Senior Marketing Manager,"Truly amazing remote company, that has a rockstar team. It's great when you work in a company where everyone around you is striving to do their best work, and have management that supports that culture. Working at InVision has taught me an immense amount, and I really got to spread my wings when it came to implementing creative ideas and initiatives across my area within marketing.

If you're reading glassdoor and considering working at InVision, think no more. I worked there for 5 years and it was one of the best experiences of my career.","None, really amazing place to work"
27,InVision,Gaining speed,2022-02-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-I'm a bit more than a year into my tenure and excited to see the step-change recent momentum, clarity and energy around the product strategy
- A good 'flat org' vibe, hitting a lot of the right marks for inclusivity and a sense of 'best idea wins'
- Remote-native company that is a well-oiled machine on certain processes, policies and norms that other companies are still muddling through
- I feel deep personal connections to my colleagues and to the company's success, and this loyalty is not unique to me, it seems to be authentic and widespread; this is maybe more surprising given the fully remote operating model","- As well-oiled a machine as this can be as a remote company, I do miss in-person connection opportunities with colleagues and hope that in the not too distant future they will reintroduce ""IRL"" (In Real Life) events"
28,InVision,Best 3 years,2022-01-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I was not looking to make a move but a prior co-worker approached me to join and it was the best decision ever. I love my co-workers, being full time remote allows me the flexibility to pick my kids up from school every day and take them to ski school in the winter. My coworkers are smart, organized, driven and understanding of the world we work from.","Having limited ability to meet in person challenges everyone to get to know each other over zoom. Some limited face to face time is valuable, but hasn't been as possible the last couple of years with covid and I have missed that ability to meet up in person a couple times a year."
29,InVision,5-STARS! (Really?),2022-01-27,3.0,Production Coordinator,Decent clients and full-time talent. Some cool perks and mentors.,"The past couple of years have hit them hard, like many in the industry."
30,InVision,Surrounding yourself with the right people,2022-01-26,5.0,Strategic Account Executive,"I’ve always acknowledged that you need exceptional people who are better than you to help you get better. This has been a career changing experience overall as I acknowledge the lessons I learned in such a short span of time are ones that others take decades to experience in their career in terms of growth. 
This is a place to own initiatives and leave your mark - your career trajectory and financial wins will ultimately be what you make of it and the opportunities we’re certainly made available at InVision. 
The new product direction with Freehand has taken the opportunity for this company to an entire new level especially with the non-stop product innovation on a monthly basis. The integrations with exciting new partners make this an extremely ubiquitous tool across all businesses.",Cons were shared directly with leadership and have already been acted upon to improve things for the reps.
31,InVision,"Wonderful culture, great sales leadership and exciting product opportunity!",2022-01-26,5.0,Strat AE,I have worked at Invision for 3 years that really have shaped my career and enabled me for further success! It was a great place with a positive working culture and enthusiastic energy across all levels. From a sales perspective it gave me the chance to work with some exciting big brands and logos and helped me learn and further develop my skillset while being supported by management.,"Product strategy has changed too frequently over the years but the recent direction and vision has really solidified efforts across product, engineering and GTM so excited about the times ahead"
32,InVision,Business with great talent and potential,2022-01-25,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"* Great group of individuals - both smart and good humans
* Freehand is an amazing product and lead by strong product leaders
* Engineering team that is deeply technical and product minded - great people to learn from
* Results and outcome oriented culture","* Lot of strategic shifts and investment not aligning with the priority lead to slower progress
* Attrition due to strategic shifts"
33,InVision,An amazing company steering out of growing pains and back into growth mode,2022-01-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great product!: Love working on a product that we actually love using and are passionate about
- Great remote work approach: Distributed from the get go and real awareness and honest efforts to connect people together
- Clear communication and transparency: The all hands are some of the most transparent and frankly emotionally nuanced sessions. Always leave proud to be an employee
- Willing to make tough decisions and have the tough conversations: The team has had to make some hard prioritization decisions and they've been very clear on the decisions even if it has upset employees. I really appreciate that approach vs trying to make everyone happy and not making much impact.
- Fun people: This team works hard but doesnt take themselves too seriously.","- This is still a startup that requires everyone to get their hands dirty and there have been hires of people who work better at scale (processes already exist, used to large spans and layers). There seems to be a lot of tension between the 2 ways of working
- Pockets of negativity - there are pockets of employees who are surprisingly negative that tends to bring the rest of the team down. As a company, there is a great culture of radical candor, but the pockets of negativity feels more of a 'state the problem and offer no solution' variety that kills company morale."
34,InVision,Enjoyed working at InVision,2022-01-25,4.0,Finance Director,"Great culture . InVision cares about employee well-being and diversity. It is a collaborative team environment, and peers and leadership act with integrity and respect. The founder cares deeply about the People, and has a true open door policy. Benefits are competitive","Its a small company, that did not have a bonus program during my tenure. I took a pay cut to work there"
35,InVision,Work with the best people in a fantastic product category,2022-01-25,5.0,G&A,"The people are great. They are smart, a pleasure to work with, and have a passion for building a cool product/company.

The collaboration product space is really exciting. The world of work is changing. Partly because of Covid, but now more because we are making smarter collaboration tools that allow us to create smart templates and flows. 

InVision is the OG of distributed companies - its part of our DNA, and I think that we do it pretty well.","We have evolved our strategic direction to focus on the broader collaboration space (as opposed to a more limited focus on prototyping collaboration). This created some turbulence as we worked through the alignment, but you can feel the energy/momentum building.

Its still a fully remote/distributed company - so you have to be ready for that. People are getting more and more used to this style, and this is one of the best places for it, but its something each person has to consider whether that will work for them."
36,InVision,"Collaborative, hands-on leadership, unique vision for the Future of Work",2022-01-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The most empathetic, thoughtful, and accountable leaders I've ever worked with, truly transformative vision on one of the most critical business challenges, we live our collaborative values and all contribute to the development of our products and user experiences",We have a truly unique perspective on new patterns in collaboration and need to promote it more!
37,InVision,Career Defining Journey at InVision,2022-01-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Strong leadership team that is reacting to an industry that is changing in very exciting ways. 

Over the past 4 years, I've had opportunities to step up and get involved with a wide variety of important projects that I don't think I would have been able to at any other company. In each of these projects I've been able to work with and learn with some of the best leaders in tech at all levels in the company.

The company has been remote since inception so it has a head start on fostering a strong culture of belonging and a productive environment.

The Freehand product is excellent - I use it every day. It's exciting to see new features frequently roll out which are intuitive to use and don't clutter what I think is the cleanest digital whiteboard product out there.",The company is in growth stage in a competitive market which requires fast pace and growth mindset to make the most out of the career opportunity

45,InVision,"Strong foundation, enhanced focus",2022-01-13,5.0,Customer Team,"Worked at InVision for a number of years in a few different roles. The team continues to be the strength of the company, with incredibly talented folks across departments. InVision has also done a great job of delivering value to the community beyond just the software, and the strength of the brand has enabled them to build long standing customer relationships. 

Product evolution. Started as purely a prototyping tool, and has evolved to a digital collaboration platform. The product can continue to evolve, but they've hit their stride.

Team. Incredibly high bar on talent across functions. 

Market opportunity. Broader collaboration focus has them extremely well positioned - especially with the shift to remote","Historically there were a lot of competing priorities that impacted product velocity, they've definitely honed their focus."

48,InVision,"Support, Growth, Community, Transparency",2022-01-11,4.0,Executive Assistant,"After nearly half a decade of personal and professional growth within InVision, I can say with confidence that the support and opportunities for growth my managers have given me, both within an existing role and in preparation for new internal roles, has been exemplary. The willingness of managers and co-workers to stop and teach, as well as to step back and trust that I'll get the job done is unmatched in my 25-year career. I am lucky enough to work across all departments, and everyone with whom I've worked strives to LIFT others alongside them, rather than hoard knowledge/opportunities for their own benefit. The way InVisioners solicit, welcome, process and apply feedback is unmatched. Candor with Compassion is one of our principals and it means I can always count on my co-workers to help me evolve my skills, and I can feel comfortable providing honest, constructive feedback without fear of anger/hurt. The community at InVision is authentic, welcoming and encouraging. The transparency from the C-level down is admirable ... monthly company scorecards are shared company -wide and include both wins AND challenges across all business units.","As with any company, the number of daily meetings cuts into the time to focus on actual work ... there are ongoing attempts to set up no-meeting days to curb this trend ... looking forward to seeing if we can all maintain these boundaries, as everyone from C-level down will benefit from opportunity to turn off distractions and focus on forward momentum within our individual projects."

1. The company is fully remote -- this not only means that everyone works remotely all the time, this also means that they really know how to work remotely well. When the pandemic hit, a lot of companies shifted their software engineering operations to working remotely. Most of those companies had huge growing pains doing so -- not so with InVision.
2. The company is very focused on maintaining a positive, inclusive, and effective culture. The employees are encouraged and empowered in numerous ways to contribute to and maintain a positive work environment.
3. The compensation package is very competitive.
4. The engineering culture, technology, and talent is world class. There's a ton of smart people to learn from.

The few people who are promoted are usually the ones who suck up to the right people, not those who are really working hard and contributing most to the company. This means there are lots of inexperienced, incompetent managers and directors who have no idea of how to lead a team and get stuff done. 

There are frequent layoffs and voluntary departures of talented people, but when a person leaves, no one bats an eye. This all results in a very low employee morale, but the company doesn’t do anything to retain talent, develop talent or improve employee happiness."

82,InVision,Poor leadership and toxic work environment,2021-04-16,2.0,Customer Success Manager,A lot of really genuine and smart people work here. The company does a great job hiring on the individual contributor level.,"For a company that prides itself on culture, it needs to take a long look in the mirror. If you're not ""in"" with management, you will feel like you're sitting at the loser table in the cafeteria in high school. Very cliquey, which is pretty bad when you're a remote company and people already feel isolated. 

I've heard that a lot has changed since I left, both good and bad, however the company is still struggling hard with market share and is slow to roll-out new features and fix issues. Customers are frustrated and it falls back onto the customer facing teams, who get little support from a leadership team that only cares about revenue and not the well-being of their employees. 

When I made the decision to leave, I didn't hear from a single senior manager or HR to wish me luck or hear more about why I was unhappy there. Was just told where to return my laptop and that's it. I've heard from other former employees that they were treated the same."
83,InVision,Trending in the right direction!,2021-04-11,5.0,Director of Engineering,"InVision is a startup experiencing some growing pains. As a new engineering leader who have been here for the past 4 months, there are 2 signals that give me absolute confidence that InVision is trending in the right direction.

1. Experience leadership, especially the product and engineering leaders
2. Company-wide alignment on the go-forward strategy

InVision hired new CPO and CTO last year. Since they came onboard, things are starting to come together, especially with the different product and engineering leaders they hired in recent months. These are leaders with the right experience, who possess the knowhow to turn things around and know what world class product organizations look like. I feel fortunate to work along side these leaders. 

There's no lack of challenging problems to solve, especially deep technical problems. While there's much yet to be done, it also offers tremendous growth opportunities to those looking to face these challenges head-on and to leave their mark when the job is done! It is a great time to come onboard and be part of the change for growth before it takes off.

InVision is competing in a space that's getting crowded by the day. It is a non-trivial feat for InVision to develop a strategic true north, a strategy that is category-defining. This is what excites me. The entire company is aligned on this strategy and it will be an exciting time over the next 12 - 18 months. This strategy enables InVision to have a clear focus and to ruthlessly prioritize all the work we have as a company. I can't ask for more. The work is cut out, the challenge is in execution.

There are other pros working at InVision, including a fully remote work environment! I love the fact that we can be authentic at work. It is totally acceptable to see some uninvited guests showing up in zoom meetings with co-workers (often their children and/or pets). This culture of authenticity carries through with our leaders. They are transparent about where we come up short and what we need to do to improve further.","Covid has made it more challenging forInVision to build really cohesive teams. The lack of in-person get together means it takes more time and efforts to build trust with each other. This is not unique to InVision. I'm looking forward to the day when I can meet my team and my product/engineering leadership team in person! 

There are other challenges working at InVision, including technical debt, and a lack of clear path for those looking for career growth. These are not insurmountable and there are clear efforts and commitment from engineering leadership to improve in these areas. I'm confident positive changes are on the horizon!"
84,InVision,"Great people, great culture",2021-04-05,4.0,Product Marketing,"Fabulous company culture. A pioneer in remote work, InVision has all of the resources and support needed to live your best remote life. InVision has made a true effort to support diversity and inclusion initiatives and has taken active steps to make improvements.

The design-driven culture is so refreshing, this is a place where individuals are empowered to share ideas and insights and a ""how might we"" approach to problem-solving. InVision has truly some of the most talented (yet friendly!) product managers, marketers, and functional leaders I've ever worked with. This is also a place where internal promotion and career growth opportunities abound.","Some have complained in the past about InVision frequently changing the roadmap and strategy, however, we have new product leadership and it feels like we're headed in the right direction."
85,InVision,It's great because it's trying to be better,2021-04-05,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"The team provides a lot of autonomy to everyone and to do that it puts a lot of trust and ownership with individuals. It doesn't supplement being remote with more meetings which means you're really doing the same amount of touch points as co-located companies but you're able to work where you want/need to be and allow your work to be more adaptable to life instead of the other way around.

On the tech side, the team is top-notch, they are working on foundational and challenging problems that are performance-critical and immersive - not just reflecting a database in a UI.

The culture is amazing to me and that's not by accident, the team puts a lot of effort into working on it - not just traditional teams either like HR. Engineering, Product, Design, CFT, etc. they all heavily review how they are doing and where can they improve and over the time i've been here (3.5 years at time of writing), I've seen transformative work happen thanks to this culture of iteration.","These aren't cons in the since of InVision is broken because of these things but rather this is the list of things that aren't where they should be yet.

- We need to keep hiring from more diverse backgrounds and demographics
- We've experienced a lot of leadership change and that ripples within team culture, so continuing on the track of executing and getting a cadence/momentum will be great.
- The team has had to deal with absolutely massive migration efforts in the past few years, this was not something that would happen again but it's left sentiment that teams might not be shipping great work externally because of that - this had a big hit on our culture. (note, happily that's actually behind us now and the future is pedal to the metal and all externally visible!)"

92,InVision,A Failing Company That Went Complacent,2021-02-16,1.0,Engineer,"The chief pro right now is that the company is experiencing staggering employee attrition so they are hiring into pretty much all levels and positions. If you're coming in to the company you will have lots of negotiating leverage for salary and benefits because they need you, badly. Other pros:

- Great medical benefits with very low costs for families

- Huge number of days off and unlimited PTO if you're on a team that can enjoy that. With so much attrition there are several teams that are having to work extra or cover more after hours on call than usual.","I worked at Invision for several years, and I saw the company go from leader in the industry to merely being content chasing behind its competitors. There are a lot of things that went wrong but the chief complaints I have are:

- Virtually impossible to get promoted. I recommend if you're thinking about joining you shoot for the stars in terms of salary because once you're in you probably won't ever get anything else.

- The Executive Leadership Team is completely disconnected from reality. This is both in terms to the state of the market, company strategy, and how to treat their employees like people. There are too many examples to put in this form, but the company regularly lays off teams when they shift strategies and then there's a mad scramble to hire replacements. Why not just move the talented people to new teams and lay off the low performers? This is obvious for you and me but the ELT regularly throws the baby out with the bath water.

- People are disposable. The company has somewhere in the neighborhood of 400ish open positions at the time of me writing this. Those are not new positions because of growth, those are positions that are open because people have left. And instead of trying to figure out why people are leaving, the company has instead instituted a policy of suppressing departure notifications so ELT doesn't look so bad. 

- The company is litigious against their own employees. If you go to a new job, even if it's not a competitor - the company might sue you. Just because. I'm not joking, this has happened. 

- The company strategy changes every few months and this matches the constant revolving door of designers and product managers. While great things are being built by teams at Invision, expect those to be ignored so that management who are there for a short time can get their own personal win in before they leave. It's become very common for middle or upper management hires to adopt a pet project that they rush through so they can leverage its success in their next job. 

If you're coming into the company you should know that morale is at an all time low, turn over is super high, and the current product strategy (which will likely do a 180 a few times) shows a complete surrender to the competition. Invision isn't trying to innovate anymore, they're just trying to keep their head above water. New hires will have to manager their managers significantly, make their own wins, and always keep an eye open for getting let go depending on the arbitrary whims of executive leadership."

Working at a product design company built on the premise of helping companies ship faster, while taking YEARS to release disjointed updates along with an ongoing mess of a pricing model that hinders collaboration is just painful. Constant reshuffling and changing KPIs that feel chaotic and rushed or like more of the same. Leaders seem great but disconnect is obvious. Lip service, frequent layoffs across the org and lots of people jumping ship. Competitors continue to eat away at revenue for multiple reasons and customer trust has been eroded. My advice is to see if this company actually starts turning around before joining. Everyone knows it’s make or break it time. I really want to see them pull themselves out of this. Until then, it boils down to pushing a Sketch plus InVision workflow that isn’t up to snuff for today’s design teams, therefore developers won’t benefit.

The worst part is that we always get to a point where we start to develop organizational cohesiveness and momentum, and then a leader thinks that's a perfect time for a reorg and all the momentum dies and people quit.

2. This company does not like email. Slack is the preferred method to communicate but I don't believe it's ideal as you get lost in one long message thread, or among multiple channels and can't reference past communications easily
3. I feel like the C level folks are lacking in their ability to take this company to the next level. I'm sure that is their intent, just not sure if their strengths are suited for this
4. By far the biggest con for me was that the role eventually devolved into IT support, addressing 'tickets'/requests from a slack channel, reconciling reports, pulling reports, and trying to figure out logic put together by folks that were long gone.

Autonomy has been removed.

Friction between departments was palpable, and the company has failed time and time again to take any ownership of that, or address the people in leadership creating those issues that will ultimately cripple this place.

- We have lost a ton of trust with once loyal customers who don't believe we can execute on a product vision, if they can even understand what our product vision is.
- There have been several rounds of large layoffs, including of top performers across Engineering, Product, and the Customer team. There is no rhyme or reason behind this, other than shaving $$ off the top line in order to survive another half of a year churning business.
- The product and pricing model are backwards. We charge like an Enterprise product, but don't have several of the table stakes SaaS Enterprise features so real, sophisticated buyers refuse to engage at our price point.

Good benefits, but only if you're based in the US. Some really amazing people.","Leadership keeps changing way too quickly, there were 5 reorgs in the past year within marketing alone, each removing talented, long time employees left and right with no proper explanation. Many people were laid off from one day to another without any notice and were given less than 24hrs to ""pack up and leave"" with no time to say good bye. They fire someone and then make them a fall person for everything that went wrong so that they don't have to admit it's their  fault - happened in product, sales, marketing, engineering... you name it.

Strategy changes  every quarter, decisions are made last minute and then you have to scramble to deliver only to be told that it's no longer a priority a few weeks/months later. People who are new don't care about anything that's been done before them and make uninformed decisions with no regard to what seasoned team members say. They solve it by getting rid of them.

The company does not value their employees and you won't be given any opportunities to grow. It's been mentioned here a couple of times - unless you're a friend of someone in leadership, or you suck up to the right people, you're not getting promoted or even recognised for your hard work. Your boss might, but not you.

The company offers a home office set-up allowance when you first start so that you can be comfortable in your new space. The benefits offered by InVision are fantastic.","Being a remote company, the engagement between team members just not the same as if you were working in the office. The company tries to encourage employees to have personal connections, but few actually want to spend the time needed to accomplish this as you must work at it as opposed to the relationships forming naturally by scheduling times to chat. The company also has a set of core values that are preached by the leadership, but few truly live up to, using them to justify what they're doing instead of actually living them. Being that the traditional relationships are hard to form when it comes to coaching the leadership focuses on what's wrong but does not work with employees to improve. Instead, they say what should be fixed and expect the employees to just naturally improve."

- Remote work (this can be a double edged sword for some and it's important to note that at the size and scale and importance we're at now we don't have the open flexibility to have all 800 of us ""digital nomading"" around the globe). That said, there is a level of freedom and flexibility afforded that it's hard to obtain in an office ""show-up"" 9-6 environment.
- On-boarding into the remote company was so surprisingly well thought through that it was the best start i've had at a new company
- Fresh Macbook when you join ;)","- You don't get a stocked fridge at the office (unless you've done grocery shopping)
- You don't get to see your AWESOME colleagues in person as much as you'd like
- Work/Life separation can be hard for some personalities, with the office in the spare room only 15 ft away at all times it can take discipline to shut down, and can sometime feel guilt for not working when the US is still online. The company doesn't encourage this, just the nature of remote to be considered.

The people InVision hires are one of a kind.  Humble, smart, and creative.

I can't describe the amount of great relationships I built at this company, and the tech stack is fun -- albeit implemented poorly. Great transparency-- Clark has a positive aura around him, and you can see why InVision has become the company it has under his direction. You won't necessarily feel ""jailed"" to work on the same thing you always do-- the openness and acceptance of work across the platform is relieving from a typical corporate atmosphere. Some of the benefits are great-- InVision uses Bonusly and Pex, and it creates a great way to recognize fellow colleagues.","The product has essentially stalled over the past 3 years. Poor technical leadership and recent partnership with Atlassian hasn't helped reboot the company to be the leader it once was. Numerous products continue to cause growth to slow substantially, as well as a (seemingly) high attrition rate. Product and design are constantly at odds, while some people are extremely overworked, some aren't worked at all. I feel their personnel growth over the past 2 years has caused management issues that they are still struggling to figure out. Culture issues out the wazoo make it constantly feel like they're pouring effort and time on the wrong thing, as they constantly cram ""people"" issues down our throats instead of tackling the issues with their own products instead. They're fighting an internal war, and are slowly figuring things out, but there are plenty of management that are going to cause friction until they're finally seen for who they are. They do shake things up a bit,  and aren't afraid to move managers, or fire entire teams that aren't doing well, but that's probably more an issue with senior management falling down onto teams.
Don't refer people to this company, it's a waste of time. Their internal recruiters play a terrible game and are incredibly rude, even when you're an employee. I've referred half a dozen people with more years of experience than half the people I worked with, and many of them weren't even given a phone screen. Contacting the recruiter/hiring manager never gave any insight outside of fake responses."

This creates a great culture of trust, freedom and accountability. We value human connexions much more and whenever we have a chance to meet our colleagues and clients, we make the most out of it.
It requires for the company to be a lot more efficient and communication to be a key part of everyday - you can't see what is happening, so you have to ask and respond.
Really enjoy this condition and probably wouldn't be able to go back to an office job.","It requires a lot more from you - the day doesn't end when you leave the office, the office is your house. So often times you'll work long hours and the work/life balance can be a bit blurred.

Really it all makes me sad. What an example of hubris that will be studied for ages

You know those movies and TV series about quintessential screwed up startups? I feel like they'll make one about a company similar to InVision. Took way too much investment, made engineers (the people who actually make the thing you want to buy) third caste, hired based on background (university and former company) that even the CEO can't live up to personally, slighted the original employees, threw money at marketing as if that will make up for the problems, and talked about snacks - snacks! - for 20 minutes of every company meeting"

Remote working is a great perk. Nice perks like Bonus.ly (giving bonuses to colleagues) and really great SWAG and good brand name in the Design space.","When I joined the talent team it was really great- collaborative, with a good goal and strong team working and good managers in place.

However, once we had new leaders join the team everything went downhill and it became a highly toxic environment. Imagine how bad it was that you could even feel this toxicity in an ENTIRELY remote company...

Collaboration was not encouraged, certain members of the team were not given opportunity to progress or expand their roles - instead being asked to work like robots and constantly micromanaged. It became an environment of distrust, and of backstabbing and two-faced answers from leadership. A 'new leader integration' workshop had been organised and clearly this individual did not want to hear any constructive feedback. Ultimately, in this team it became that you could only have your job if you said "" Yes Sir"" to everything regardless of boundaries or if you disagreed. Lots of overworked colleagues (expected to work weekends) who were punished for even taking a week off to recharge. Terrible management and very sad to see an HR and Talent team be so terrible.

Complete lack of transparency and lack of accountability & respect of people on the team.

Right before Christmas a bunch of people were let go and the excuse was that it would ""give them more time to find new jobs' but it was probably so that their shares would not vest and also due to lack of respect for employees. I feel sorry for those who are still stuck in the team due to financial obligations."

If you can put aside the stress and chaos, there's a good amount of work-life balance.","Leadership is just unbelievably bad. There is no strategy coming down from the top. The marketing department has so many different activities going at any given time that all of it comes out a little half baked. From a work standpoint, goals aren't clear, campaign performance isn't clear, what success looks like isn't clear. From a career standpoint, there is no career path, no clear idea of how to get promoted (or sometimes even noticed by upper management). Middle managers aren't given the training they need to actually be managers and support teams, which results in turnover and demoralized employees."

Let me start off by saying that a remote environment doesn't work. At least not at this scale. Employees are just not as invested in the products, management can get away with murder, etc... 

Our customers don't care about Studio, the product that we've been working on for the last 3-4 years. They hate it, it's slow, and there's no way they are going to convert. But why don't we talk about this? Because we all work remotely and no one really cares.

Management: Management will let go of teams when something goes wrong instead of putting some of the blame on themselves. Toxic environment. If you have a bad manager, your life will be miserable. You're working remote, on an island, and no one will hear your cries for help.

Pay: Not only are you paid under market value, don't expect to get a decent pay raise for doing good work, only enough to offset inflation. There are no bonuses or 401k matching, etc... 

Product: We overpromise and under deliver. Product is falling behind, but hey, we make really pretty videos.

Remote work: Seems like the dream right? But everyone is more worried about appearances vs actually getting stuff done.  I've definitely seen people punished for doing great work but because their work is less visible, they end up getting bad reviews by their peers."

There has been a lot of change in the past 6 months - and really in the entire 2.5 years I was there - which is fairly common for a company growing so fast (it tripled in size during my tenure).  This can create some growing pains but I honestly believe the leadership and team they have in place now - particularly in the departments named above, that I was closest to - are the strongest I saw in all my time at the company.

The future is extremely bright for InVision and I look forward to now supporting them as a shareholder.

As for the Finance team itself, it's one of the strongest I've ever worked with - largely due to the leadership of the VP of Finance building an amazing team, almost from scratch.","Although I personally see it as a pro - since I loved it - the learning curve for getting used to a fully remote organization can be tricky.

We all understand the benefits and the necessity in being proactive in our communications with one another; we feel more… connected.  From the moment I had my first interview, to on-boarding, to my first day, to today I continue to be impressed by the attention to detail and design centricity that has cultivated a level of engagement, productivity and community I wouldn’t have thought possible in a 100% distributed workforce.

From personal growth to professional career growth and opportunity, the option is always there to expand one’s horizons.  In the time I’ve been here, I’ve seen promotions, and lateral moves, as well as significant career shifts.

Global Perks:  I love that InVision’s perks are offered to employees globally and we can all benefit from the same sweeteners that enrich our day to day. The “people team” comes up with great ideas to benefit employees and their health and wellbeing.

Communication: From all levels of the company, open communication is a very regular occurrence.  At our all hands meetings the content is candid and genuine. I love that Clark and David talk about ‘snacks’ when we’re on the line with one another to kick of the calls, it’s fun.  We don’t have an ‘office’ to eat together, why not share what we like to eat from the comfort of our own homes? It’s light-hearted and informative at the same time! 

Leaders: Leadership cares. Boom! I said it.  I have not met one leader at the company that I wouldn’t feel completely comfortable reaching out to. The door is always open. 

I’m proud to call myself an InVisioner and look forward to being with the company for years to come. Best company ever!",I guess remote culture will not be for everyone but InVision does it better than anyone I've ever seen.

165,InVision,"Incredible place to work! Great culture, wonderful teammates, room for advancement—I love it here!",2019-04-09,5.0,Senior Manager of Design Community Partnerships,"The team is absolutely phenomenal. I'm working with some of the most talented people in the world (literally, since we can hire the best talent on earth as a fully distributed company). I've been with the company for nearly 4 years, and seeing us grow from 50 employees when I interviewed to 800+ employees worldwide in that short period of time has been nothing short of breathtaking. We have maintained an exceptional company culture, even through this rapid growth. Having been in the startup industry for over a decade, I can testify that maintaining a positive work culture during periods of rapid growth is next to impossible, but InVision has pulled it off.  Employee happiness is a top down focus, starting with our CEO. We also have a culture where any employee, regardless of title, is encouraged to identify areas we can improve and bring them to the attention of the appropriate team member, including our CEO. Compensation rates are excellent, and audited to ensure that employees of all genders and races are being compensated equally. (Huge deal, since this is NOT common practice in this industry.) We also have an excellent full benefits package, and tons of fun perks. One of my very favorite perks is being able to work remotely from anywhere in the world that there is a wifi connection! Being part of a company that is blazing the trail in fully remote workplaces has been such an awesome experience. I truly love working here!","There is always room for growth, regardless of how fantastic a workplace is. I'd say one area for improvement would be defining clear cut career ladder paths. Having grown this rapidly, it was a bit impossible to define them up to this point, but going forward I think it will be important."

167,InVision,I Feel Like I'm Part of Something Special!,2019-02-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"As a 100% virtual company, InVision is creating the model for a way of working that will be much more the norm in the future. And, while the virtual working model is part of what makes InVision special, it is only part of the whole picture.

Like any high-growth, successful start-up we work hard but it really feels like any person who is giving it their best effort is leaving a serious mark on the company and can say that they are contributing to InVision's success. The work is sometimes messy, but in all the best ways. That's going to appeal to the right people (like me!), and not to others (which is totally fine too!).  If you're looking for a workplace where you can check your brain at the door and follow a process some person built for you in 2005, this is not it! If the idea of a work environment so stagnate that anyone would even consider following a process built that long ago makes you cringe, you should check InVision out. We are a work in progress and that is a huge pro! I know I will learn here and grow here.","Like many start-ups, there are growing pains. Sometimes those things can be a minor irritant, but at least I feel like I can tell someone about it and they will want to make it better and help make sure I'm okay. I have also seen active improvements being made to employee raised issues in the year that I've been here. Our perks and benefits keep getting improved (and they're as good as most great tech employers already), the people that my team is hiring seem to be better and better every day. 

There are some people around that are clearly holdovers from the early days, but I think they'll soon work their way out if they can't hang going forward. I had heard about some prior concerns of limited communication from the top and that seems to be being actively addressed. Our last two company all-hands meetings were the best and most informative yet. I'm not sure what prompted the change here, but it really feels like leadership is talking to me in those meetings versus talking at me."
168,InVision,the worst place hands down,2019-01-16,1.0,Recruiter,"once this was a exciting place to work, with fast growth. We had a good team of supportive people and we got the job done. Our team hired nearly 1000 people for Invision in a couple years.","As of this summer leadership changed on recruiting and it became a lying, backstabbing horrible place to work. new leaders have irrelevant and poor experience and treated the team like factory workers (who, shouldn't even be treated that way). the environment we once had was lost. additionally, the new leadership fired a third of the team the week of Christmas. Most of the team has now quit and found better, higher paying jobs and aren't treated like animals. I feel sorry for the people still there."
169,InVision,"Worked with great people, some C-level micromanaging",2019-01-05,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I worked with interesting, knowledgeable, kind people, and a couple of fantastic managers. All of the engineers are senior-level, so I had access to a lot of expertise. The company structure is divided into teams with a manager, a product manager, and about six engineers who work closely together. Interactions between teams are mostly mediated by API boundaries between micro services which allowed a lot of autonomy for each team. It made for a very nice environment to work in. My relationship with product management was easily the best I have had at any company!

Working remote was very helpful during a time when I was moving a lot. Regular ""on-site"" meetups let co-workers meet in person, which helps to offset the downsides of working with people who I would otherwise only see as moving computer screen images. And the meetups are super fun!

The technology is interesting, consisting of lots of Dockerized micro services. I had a lot of latitude in design decisions in the services I implemented. Employees are encouraged to learn new things and share in group presentations.","Due to some reorganization in 2017 I was shuffled between three teams with three different managers in the space of eight months. My first manager was fantastic. But later I had a manager who did not have much experience working with engineers. That coincided with a time when there was pressure from upper management to get some work down on a short timeline. IMO one of a manager's most important jobs is managing upstream expectations so that their engineers are not overburdened, and I felt I was not getting that help from my new manager. My departure was partly motivated by personal schedule issues; but this experience was also a factor.

The CTO is very hands-on, which has upsides and downsides. In some cases engineering teams were told to adopt certain technologies or practices. For example I thought I would be writing Node.js code, and I was working with a team with a lot of Node experience; but the company was in the process of switching all new development over to Go. I know there is value in consistency of technology, but the language change was disappointing to me.

On the other hand the CTO spends a lot of time talking to engineers; and I appreciate the time he took to respond to my concerns personally.

When I left there was a legacy codebase written in Coldfusion that was a pain to work with. But the company was in the process of moving away from the legacy monolith to micro services as quickly as possible."
170,InVision,"If you're considering the People team, RUN!",2018-12-24,1.0,Recruiter,At one point this seemed like a TEAM. People worked with respect towards each other and there was team support.,"I can't speak on the overall company enough but that isn't my point with this review. It is meant to be a red flag and warning to those considering working here on the People team. A team that once enjoyed working has all but disappeared. After leaders in the People/Recruiting joined everything changed. Lies, backstabbing, mistruths, and working against their team. More than half the team left with their dignity. Those who stayed had a harsh wake up call. The week before Christmas 1/3 the team was let go. Cleary a decision like this is known beforehand and there wasn't the respect or decency to wait until the New Year. These leaders are without question the worst I've ever seen. But look at their backgrounds.  I can't urge people enough to run away from interviewing here or working here in general. It's a shame higher leaders (CEO, COO) were ok with this plan and shows overall value they have on people. 
This has been a toxic environment the last 6 months (monitoring your every move and how often you're actually online) but firing people the week before xmas? Shame on you InVision!"
171,InVision,"There are better places to be an engineer, avoid InVision",2018-12-23,1.0,Lead Software Engineer,"Fully distributed and remote culture
Free coffee
Nice laptops
Some really good people","The culture is toxic. Upper management has no idea how they are going to do all the things coming down. Constantly being berated for the mistakes of the upper management. Teams would constantly be at odds with each other.
Communication is terrible. My priorities were changing weekly (no joke!) because someone decides that x is more important and needs to be done now and is communicating to the relevant stakeholders at the last possible minute.
Career mobility is stagnant. I kept asking what was my promotion plan and nobody gave me a straight answer. I feel like my career regressed here. What's worse is that all the people who were senior to me were hired during the time I was at InVision and almost nobody was promoted.
Micromanaged to the nth degree. I was given technical designs to implement with obvious flaws in them and when I would try to propose a better solution I was constantly shut down.
The pay is below market rate, but the emphasis is on hiring top engineers so we seldom got great engineers. If they were great, they were working in a remote area where the pay was higher than the local market, but for most major metros the pay was not close to market rate.
The work itself was not challenging. At one point it was, but toward the end it was mostly fighting with other teams in the organization and less actual technical achievement. Half the time engineers were told that they would have a staff or principal engineer be assigned to the project to get it back on track and they would perform just as good as anyone else would in that position.

InVision prides itself on being a design company, but doesn't care about the engineering behind it and thus it is always neglected."

176,InVision,You can make a difference,2018-12-01,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Brilliant team, located all over Europe. Everyone is ambitious yet helpful, and the culture is great. 
Whilst it’s a fully remote company, you have access to wework in London and Amsterdam where there are a high number of employees which provides a nice balance to working from home.
The SVP International setup the business in the US and is now doing the same in Europe. Great to have that experience and everyone on the team loves working for him. 
Fully remote is great but requires high level of motivation. This is fast growing business and the demands are high so you have to be proactive in building relationships remotely to get stuff done. 
The company is still very early stage, particularly in international where many people are less than a year in tenure, so there’s plenty to build/establish in terms of processes which means you can have a real impact on the business still. 
Customers love the product but we’re making exciting investments in this area that will enable us to provide even more value going forward. 
Whilst the sales team is still relatively new, management have established some really strong sales methodology and the training gets better all of the time. We do regular in person training events and meet-ups called IRL (in real life) which has been amazing for building relationships and getting to know your colleagues.","Not for people that don’t enjoy working hard and building a business. Lots to do at InVision and you’re always required to go beyond your job description to get things done. I like this, but it’s not for everyone. 
Remote isn’t for everyone. There’s always a lot to do, and the expectations are very high. If you think fully remote means easy ride, you’re very mistaken.
The business made a couple of poor early sales hires as it grew quickly, but the mgmt team seem to be owning and correcting that."

Often times it feels like information does not trickle down and leadership seems to purposely side step important issues and challenges. Working here feels like surviving an abusive relationship. I was here almost two years and watched early promises fizzle along with a culture that is quickly eroding in the name of scaling and growth. Really bad leadership is being let in the door. I watched the trust and autonomy that was prized in this culture vanish almost overnight, replaced with a very top down approach. By the end it felt like working for any old generic Inc.  They get you in the door with big promises but fail to follow through. It's like surviving an abusive relationship, I kept thinking things would get better, but they never did. I now only regret not leaving earlier.  
The worst part of this company is the lack of work life balance. They talk about it all the time. Senior leadership will preach defining your boundaries and shutting work off after hours, as they send you long emails and requests at every hour in the middle of the night. So much hypocrisy here. It's very difficult to take real time off, because the pain of what you'll return to isn't worth the short break. I worked so many weekends, 1 out of every two Sundays, and so many late night hours here, yet never felt caught up. This place has a work life balance crisis."
178,InVision,a terrible employer,2018-11-27,1.0,Sales,Honestly can't really think of anything good to say about this company.,Micromanagement dressed up as remote working. Woeful leadership. Terrible culture. Avoid at all costs.
179,InVision,Best job I've ever had,2018-11-24,5.0,Software Engineer,"#1 for most people is probably the flexibility of working remotely. After living and working in the SF bay area for two years, I was grateful for an opportunity to leave and still work with an A-class software company. 

#2 is that it's 100% remote, not just partially. A 100% remote company has lots of advantages over a partially remote one. 100% remote makes everyone feel like they're equally as informed as everyone else.

Others:
- The product is loved by customers. It's kinda nice being able to tell people you work at InVision at social events and getting a positive response.
- The business is growing, moral is high
- Clear promotion/advancement criteria and processes. This was developed and implemented over the course of my time at the company.

For engineers:
- Engineering best practices are well, practiced. The company's tech stack isn't fossilized and tech debt is kept at pretty reasonable levels. In my two years there I saw the few codebases/services that were just really bad (spaghetti code, no tests, etc) completely replaced with clean, well documented, tested, properly monitored & alerted services.","Only for some people:
- The company tries to stick to US hours. I started with the company in the US and moved to Taiwan, so I ended up working all night long and sleeping half the day. This obviously doesn't apply if you're anywhere in the Americas."

I continue to LOVE that there is no guilt to ""show your face in HQ"" as there is NO physical office.  I've also been pleasantly surprised with how easy it is to really get to know my coworkers on a deeper level as their cats, dogs, babies and significant others often make guest appearances during video calls.

In this hyper-growth environment I will learn more in a year than I would have in 5 years at my previous company.  The focus on diversity and inclusion is genuine and refreshing.

Working together is success""",2018-03-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall, InVision has been a fantastic place to work for the last four months. Does it feel like eight months? Yes. However, I have never felt more supported in my life. The first couple of days/months are always stressful but having leadership around you that genuinely tries to set you up for success is an incredible feeling and does not happen everywhere. 

InVision has an excellent benefits package- including a “flexible” PTO policy, 1/2-day Fridays year-round (if you managed your time efficiently), monthly gym reimbursement, continuing education support, phone reimbursement, 401K (No match at this time) and super competitive health care plans. Plus, InVision has a 100% distributed workforce, and they try to give us every resource possible to make sure we can properly work from ""anywhere”- Yup, anywhere. Everyone receives a $500 stipend to help create your home office, and a $100 InVision Café Card that gets filled up monthly. These all work great for me, as I am traveling around in my RV. “No Internet access? …Better stop by S-Bucks, and get some work done..” ..It's almost too easy. 

Diversity seems to be a focus of InVision and is quite prominent already. This diverse talent brings fresh ideas, perspectives and views to our culture, and products. Plus, different approaches are the recipe for creating better products, and experiences for our customers. You're encouraged to be as authentic as possible, measured by the work you put in, which in turn, pushes you to be the best version of yourself and introduces new challenges..

I’m a firm believer that working remotely is not for everyone. You need to be diligent, hardworking, proactive with a strong sense of time management. There is an initial adjustment period and learning to balance home life and work life all in the same environment can be challenging. Our CEO, Clark wants employees to work wherever they want, and he believes giving people that freedom can increase employee happiness and foster communication that’s better than that of many co-located companies. This also enables us to tap into talent from all across the globe, rather than being limited by geographic locations- we can bring on the best and the brightest regardless of where you live! 

As you can see, our CEO, Clark is a true visionary, a kind, authentic person. I have heard rumors that some people don’t think he’s real… ha, He is. :) I had a great chat with him, and he was super down to earth, and was genuinely interested in what made me join InVision, and what makes us better than the competition... That doesn’t happen everywhere you go either.","If you want to call it a Con- InVision is a startup. Or rather, an “established startup”, but a startup nonetheless.  Not everything is polished, and sometimes even has a “Wild Wild West” feel to it..  but for me, I love the ambiguity! It's a fantastic opportunity to prove yourself and grow with the company… And we are growing immensely! The determination and enthusiasm from everyone are reflective of the culture they have established.  It doesn’t matter what team, or department you are on, everyone has the same passion and eagerness to get keep the company moving forward in the right direction and staying competitive."

My job provides healthy challenges where I can utilize my skills and also learn. The engineering management style ensures that everyone feels empowered to do what they are good at doing. We have the best tools at our disposal. Communication is extremely important for us being that we are fully distributed, and it is done very well by everyone. We have a culture of kindness, which is quite rare these days. Our products are also fun to work with and utilize.","I don't have any cons. We are very busy, but I don't really see that as a con."

201,InVision,First impressions - 2months in,2018-03-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I’m relatively new to InVision and my opinions are based on this initial experience. So far…
This is the most talented group of people I’ve ever worked with. Thoughtful, smart, and there is a culture of humility and empathy that fits really well with who I am and my work style. Not only is an a-hole culture frowned upon, it’s systemically removed. 
I’ve been with three companies as they went public, but the growth trajectory here is unlike anything I’ve ever been a part of. The excitement and energy is palpable. It really pushes you to be the best version of yourself and introduces new challenges constantly.
The CEO is just what you want - inspiring, humble, frugal, laser focused on a vision, and willing to roll up his sleeves and help on the minutia when needed.
Good diversity mix and a real effort to keep improving it. Part of the value of the InVision platform is that it helps bring diverse ideas into the design process. And diverse ideas are the recipe for better digital products. So the focus on diversity in hiring reflects this value.
All remote work - Yes, you can really work from an airbnb from a different country every month. Or you can move away from the crazy Bay Area and have a work/life balance. It’s not just lip service. No one on my team that reports to me lives in the same state (or is even in the same region of the US), and it works incredibly well. I have a family and it’s a total game changer.","Remote work is amazing for the right person. But if you have trouble self motivating, this would be a difficult place to work.
Even at over 500 people, the company is in startup fast-growth mode, so chaos can creep in and your job will constantly evolve as new people are hired. That said, process and stability get better every day."

204,InVision,"It Really Is ""All That and a Bag of Chips""",2018-03-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at InVision has been a life-changer for me.

First and foremost, the community of InVision people is outstanding. I felt genuinely welcomed from the first minute I signed on, and continue to feel surrounded by smart, hard-working, and honest people. 

The culture here is definitely unique, and not in a bad way. You're encouraged to be your authentic self, measured by the work you put in, and have opportunities to challenge yourself and grow.

InVision is truly design-centric and a visionary in the industry. Things move fast. ""Work hard, play hard"" isn't just another cliche here, it's the mode of operation.

Working remotely is new for me. I had some initial reservations, but it has been great so far! There was an adjustment period -- learning to balance home life and work life all in the same environment -- but all for the better. It affords me more time to spend in the ways I want, without having to sacrifice or compromise.","As a previous reviewer stated, ""YO! It's a startup.""

Not everything is well-defined or super polished, and for me, that's absolutely okay! It's a fantastic opportunity to influence and grow with the company. You're not just along for the ride...you're there to help navigate."
205,InVision,Never been more proud to work for a company,2018-03-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Communication is a must due to fully remote workforce so everyone makes an extra effort to communicate. 
- We treat our employees great and in the US we have recently upgraded our benefits plans to be more family friendly. 
- I find it is easier for me (not everyone) to stay focused while working from home.  My quick breaks of throwing in a load of laundry or running the dishwasher between meetings also helps me in my work/life balance! 
- High & good growth brings lots of room for internal promotions/transfers!",- Sometimes it is hard (especially in the winter) to feel like you can get outside of your house and see some sunlight.  The Cafe Card (coffee card) and gym membership helps though.

207,InVision,"Fast growth, big challenges, great reward",2018-02-19,5.0,Account Executive,"I've been with InVision since we were ~200 employees, and have seen us more than double in 2 years. We've managed to scale in a way that's smart,  we've continued to hold a high standard for hiring and build features and products that our customers need.  We've recently brought on incredible new leaders who have made immediate impacts. Being part of a company whose clients are such huge champions is an amazing experience, and the things we do for the design community (events, workshops, etc.) are truly unique.

As we've grown, we've seen much more cross-departmental events (e.g. company-wide all hands) which is great.","Not everyone loves the work from home environment and you do need to make an effort to be visible to those you don't interact with daily. That being said, the opportunities to get involved are endless. I would also love to see more diversity (gender and racial) in leadership. With so much growth, you have to be comfortable with change."

209,InVision,Simply put: InVision is awesome,2018-02-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"InVision has been an amazing place to be: intelligent & kind colleagues, great benefits & an amazing product that's really going places.  I was a bit shocked to see the handful of negative reviews, and wanted to provide my own insight to these responses.

Not so good leadership? - I find InVision to have dedicated and caring leaders. The different people in management that I've reached out to were very willing to open their schedules for 1x1 calls (that remote life) to try and get to know you. There's a lot of transparency in terms of their goals, what they want from the team and how they want to help us succeed. I personally have been amazed by how much they invest in us (training, 1x1s, etc.), and they really stress how they want to help us flourish as professionals.

Not so good culture? - This one really shocked me; I find it pretty clear that InVision strives really hard to foster a great work culture that people could enjoy. We're constantly reminded that we're not just working for ""a tech product"" per say, but we're working to elevate and empower the greater design community. The team is always trying to find ways to help us with benefits - free coffee cards, health & wellness reimbursements, etc. - and since we're remote, they're always agreeable to having team-bonding meetups that are expensed as well. Another review wrote ""bro"" culture - which is strange, since I've definitely met a lot of coworkers who are  the most un-fratty people I have met (I personally consider my interests and demeanor more on the geek spectrum, haha)

Communication/Remote life - this is something that I understand could be difficult for those who don't enjoy working remotely. With that being said, however, you've got to give InVision some credit; we're one of the first companies to really push for a 100% distributed team, and being the first advocates of this work-model, we're going to have some challenges. They're trying really hard to bring communication top-notch; I know we're also trying to cross-collaborate more with other divisions of the company. A major aspect of this also has to do with your self-motivation -- don't be afraid to reach out to ppl via Slack, most people are happy to reply. 

Anyways, an overall lengthy review but I wanted to provide my personal insight/rebuttal on some of the negative comments here. Every company (especially smaller ones like InVision) struggle with growth pains, and we're rapidly scaling. But we are trying to foster a positive culture, there are great leaders here that I respect , and we got one of the best products in the market -- so we going places!","I do agree with others in that I wish we had more diversity (particularly racial) across the org. As a minority in the group, it would be great if we could truly embrace a diverse workforce. It would be great to see more women/racial minorities in leadership as well."
210,InVision,Remote working FTW!,2018-01-22,5.0,Software Engineering Manager,"Highly motivated intelligent folks to work with.
Also enjoy the benefits (and meeting the challenges) of all remote work.
Growing fast but are scaling well (so far)",Takes dedication and buy-in to work remotely as a team.
211,InVision,I feel truly blessed!,2017-12-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been with InVision for over 6 months now. Each day reinforces my appreciation and admiration for my peers and this company I am so proud to work for. In my entire career, I have not experiences working with so many people who ""show up"" every day, who lead by example, and are truly dedicated to a common goal. While we are experiencing rapid growth and are not exempt from the growing pains that come with this, the manner in which issues are resolved is professional and efficient.

My top list of amazing things that I appreciate:
1. The dedication that is so evident from every single person of this rapidly growing company.
2. The effective, professional and kind style of communication that the teams maintain, even in our remote work environment.
3. Amazing leadership team that is truly invested in their teams.","One area that I consider a con is cross functional socialization which likely has more to do with the remote nature of our work environments. However, the company does make efforts to improve this for us with frequent off-sites and introduction apps that have been integrated into Slack."
212,InVision,"Definitely a ""Best Place to Work""",2017-12-07,5.0,Recruiter,"Where to begin? When I started, I wondered if InVision could live up to  the hype because everything just sounded too good to be true.  Having been here now for a few months I can say with confidence that expectations have been exceeded! The people within the company are super smart, collaborative, and humble. Management shows an active and genuine interest in growing each individual to their fullest potential. I am trusted to do my job but my direct manager consistently is there to support me and help if I need it. Since I started about four months ago, I have already met my team in person and been involved with committees and projects outside the scope of my day to day role.

InVision is also very generous by investing in things that aren't necessary, but make a huge impact. In addition to the investment the company makes to an internal appreciation program where employees can dole out micro-bonuses to each other, they are also matching donations in our annual charitable giving program. Also, the entire company from around the world is getting together in a few months to meet in person.

It's also exciting to be a part of the growth! Not to mention an awesome product that is creating a huge buzz in the design world. It's easy for a company to drop the ball in some respect while in hyper-growth mode but it's really impressive that InVision puts such active  and consistent efforts into the product, clients, and employees at once.","As expected with the remote nature of the company, clear and open communication can be challenging. It can be frustrating when information or changes that affect my day-to-day job gets communicated to some people involved but not to all. The latest Employee Engagement survey was overwhelmingly positive but this was one aspect that was addressed and the company is actively working to fix."
213,InVision,GREAT for where we’re at,2017-12-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Currently buzzing with the anticipation of new releases and opportunities, InvisionApp gives employees a sense of excitement to be a part. This is especially important, since remote work can be seen as isolating in some ways. The flexibility offered by a remote position is nice for many, but rest assured, teams still collaborate and kick butt like nobody’s business.","Given the adolcent state we are in, some things get done in the blink of an eye, and some things need to be reworked and recommunicated several times. Although not always time efficient, working out kinks within the organization and practices (for the better) seems appropriate, and worth it."
214,InVision,Terrible Leadership,2017-11-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I cant think of one pro.,"InVision was by far the worst place that I've ever worked. Toxic management,  and terrible culture. So thankful to not be employed by this company. They act like they have everything together, but the entire company is falling apart. Don't be fooled by their enchanting ""work from home"" set up. It's not worth it."
215,InVision,"Amazing company, culture, and product!",2017-11-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everyone at this company is extremely warm and friendly. The company is fully remote (including executives), which is awesome because you can work from home or from cafes.","If you're someone who needs to be motivated by face time with your coworkers, this might not be the best fit for you."
216,InVision,Toxic leadership organization-wide,2017-10-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some of the team members are awesome to work with. In some roles, you'll have the opportunity to learn a decent amount. And the company's clout looks good on a resume. The fanboys are rabid.","Leadership is horrible across the board, and it trickles down into everything. No clear roadmap, dictatorial style from the top down (the CEO just does what he wants and forces everyone to do what he wants, no room for disagreement, ever, even if it means ruining people's lives by making them work insane hours, weekends, and overtime for no reason other than a random whim), and any disagreement is seen as being negative.

Salaries are all over the place. No consistency or adherence to market rate. 

Total bro culture. If you're not 'in' with the cool kids, you're screwed. They hire their (unqualified) friends behind the scenes without anyone else a chance. Being 'in' means being a puppet who doesn't ever make waves or is ambitious. 

Zero professional growth. If you have your own thoughtful ideas about how to do thing,  unless leadership agrees, which they probably won't, forget it. Want to move up? Get good reviews, work hard, do good work... and be rewarded with sub-market rate pay and no career path or opps to advance, but you'll get lots and lots of promises about possibilities that never materialize.

For InVision, all that matters is the bottom line. They present themselves as being collaborative, friendly, family-like -- it's a facade. At the end of the day, top level leadership just barks orders and you either do it or you're ostracized. 

Like other reviews say, pay attention to the negative reviews here. You'll see a trend about leadership. They padded this account with positive reviews by requesting reviews from newer-ish employees, but if you have ambitions to grow and want to be respected, look elsewhere."
217,InVision,The sausage making is ugly,2017-10-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company has a remarkable brand and loads of potential, but it is a mess inside. It is an open-ended question whether it can deliver solid product and achieve the market dominance the company aspires to.  Many feel that the answer is no.","Leadership is terrible. They sew chaos with constant, ill-considered shifts in strategy and roadmap. There is constant churn and frustration. Lack of transparency and communication is the norm. Very little has shipped in last 2 years. There are a few critical reviews here, PAY ATTENTION to them. 

Troubling lack of diversity on product team."
218,InVision,I will never have work life balance like this in my life again!,2017-09-28,5.0,Sales,"I started with InVision earlier this year, and when I did, I was sceptical, working from home as an extrovert was hard, onboarding was very stretched to get me started. The accounts were a little scattered, and people that I joined with were trying to find their feet as Europe was a new venture, move forward seven months, and I must say, what a fantastic company to work! 

The company has managed to hire some of the best talented, humble and smartest people I have ever worked with. Everyone is innovating new ways to work and develop the business, and the hiring process makes sure that everyone that comes in, is the right fit for them and InVision.

I have the luxury to work at home, in a Starbucks, in the London WeWork, anywhere I feel comfortable, any place I feel comfortable. As a father, I can see my children grow up as I do not have the travel time to an office to battle with because of the work from home culture!

The perks are fantastic too, which include but are not limited to:
Free Starbucks EVERY DAY
Free Books from Amazon (convenient)
Linkedin Learning (excellent for learning new skills)
Shares in the company (I feel like I own a bit of it too)
Unlimited holidays (yes that is correct)
Gym Membership

The product is fantastic, I would in a customer facing role, and I have never sold a product where EVERYONE likes it.

I would highly recommend the company as it is going places.","As we grow out EMEA, there are natural growing pains, but nothing a startup in a new space doesn't go through.

My advice if you are thinking of working for InVision is, if you are someone who can't work from home, or have a hard time dealing without human interaction, InVision is not for you. Although the company never forces you, you will find yourself working long hours, but this is because you will find yourself exploring new avenues and projects as there are opportunities to progress and be involved with the companies growth is everywhere."

APPLY.  NOW. You'll hear a lot in our reviews about how remote life is the best life. And it is. The freedom and trust I have to do my job while being a present parent and literally work from wherever I want is pretty unbelievable and a real game changer. But its not the best thing about INV. For me, its the rocket ship ride we are on and the impact we are making on the careers of the community we serve. I'm pushed. I'm fulfilled. I'm empowered. I'm engaged. I'm surrounded by incredibly smart, passionate, all around good people who I learn from every day. Most of all - I'm having loads of FUN.","Yo - its a START UP. And a hyper-growth one at that.  So that comes with some kinks that we are massaging out as we grow and evolve. Things like benefits packages - be sure to sit down with someone who knows this stuff before you make a selection (especially if you have a family). Be ready to be resourceful and seek out the information you need -this is not going to be spoon fed to you. Working remote can put you in a silo - if you let it. But you have to take accountability for getting what you need.  This is not a place for the faint of heart who are more comfortable with things staying the same and a ""that's not how we do things"" attitude rather than taking risks and pushing and evolving at warp speed.

BUT, its not as easy to pull people in a room like in a physical office.

You're always inspired by the work others do and are consistently pushed (positively) to do your best work. Everyone at InVision works hard but they play hard too. People care about one another and the company does too. The best thing... is it's only getting better!","I honestly don't know of any down-sides here. If you're able to work in a remote company, be a self-starter, adapt to change (in a growing start-up), you'll do great!

228,InVision,"Inspiring, motivating, challenging and fulfilling",2017-05-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Let's get something out of the way right quick - it's extraordinarily difficult to find a company that makes a product you're genuinely excited about and inspired by. InVision is one of those rare companies.

We're building software that will power – *is* powering – the future of product design. This is not a drill. I come to work every day feeling like my work will help influence how digital experiences are built for the rest of eternity. That's pretty huge.

But that's not all of it. This place cares about work-life balance. By now the company is famous for being entirely distributed, allowing anyone to work from home or from one of our many WeWork spaces throughout the country. I sincerely hope this never changes, because it's a game-changer. I don't know how I would go back to working in an office. 

Aside from that, the team is all amazing. This is obviously a good thing, but it can be intimidating when you're working alongside some of the best talent in the world. It also makes it more rewarding when you do stand out. And in general, so long as you're working hard and giving it your best, you'll be recognized and rewarded. 

All in all, this company is by far the best place I've ever worked. Words fail to express how big a deal it is to be able to travel and work from anywhere, to not have to rush out the door in the morning or slog back home late at night. And above all, the ability to work on a product that is so remarkable and that has so much potential to change the world is something that is so exceedingly rare that I feel grateful every day to work here.","There are challenges with remote work. Things can be miscommunicated more easily, and there are transparency issues, and I have some awesome colleagues who I wish I could hang out with after work and grab a drink. Alas, it is what it is. The company every day is innovating to solve the challenges associated with remote work, but ultimately those challenges pale in comparison to all the many benefits remote work offers – most of which is that there is a serious results-driven culture here. It's not for slackers. Management doesn't care about micro-managing because it's assumed everyone here is a performer who will get the job done. So if producing results is a challenge for you, this could be a con. For those who are serious about doing good work, it's great."

I've been able to shift and grow here in a way that you don't find at many other jobs. It's fantastic.","Although we're outgrowing the ""startup"" size and definition, we still operate like a startup in a lot of ways. This can really not jive with people who want to just make a decision and stick with it. If you can't go with the flow and aren't willing to be flexible, this is probably not the environment for you. (i.e. you've been working at a thousands-strong company and love the way that operates) Also, you might not like working from home if you need more face to face interaction during the day, but I'm also surprised by the depth of the relationships I've formed with people I've never met in real life—just talking over Slack and video chat."

Amazingly positive workplace culture. Everyone is incredibly friendly, helpful and ready to pitch in. (True story: when one employee’s house burned town, the team raised tens of thousands of dollars in a matter of hours to help the employee’s family). 

Remote workplace brings unparalleled flexibility. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to adapt to remote-work and connect with colleagues. Until I worked for InVision, I never realized how great it is to have NO commute.","Rapid growth breeds some growing pains that are common in many startups. Communication could be better across departments, new employee on-boarding can be challenging, and information and projects are distributed across many tools. Luckily, internal initiatives are being discussed to address these areas already."
233,InVision,So Glad To Be Here,2017-05-11,5.0,Manager,"If you are a self-starting, self-directed worker, the all-remote, work-anywhere structure is a dream come true. Work where you are. It's refreshing to be at a company that is really trying to experiment with the future of the workplace in a meaningful and systematic way. 

The product is incredible, and aggressive/visionary product development is ongoing. No resting on laurels here!

Employees are welcoming, friendly, and apolitical. Everyone is trying to get things done.","If you struggle with being remote, it probably won't be your cup of tea.  As a rapidly growing software startup, all of the normal stresses and strains are present. Things move fast, and you work hard. Systems are being built in earnest across the company. Nothing atypical for a rocket-ship startup, but, again, not everyone's jam."
234,InVision,Gotta drink the Kool-aid,2017-05-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Entirely remote
- Good pay
- Industry-loved product
- Decent tech stack","No attempt at company culture.
- No company meetups. During my time there, they kept promising team meetups, which we kept asking for. The only meetings that happened were for for management who seemed to meet up on a monthly basis.
- No cross team/department collaboration.
- As an entirely remote team, i was extremely isolating. A lot of the reviews say that ""you should be good with remote work"" when what they really mean is ""you're never going to meet your co-workers"". Now, this isn't a problem for management, as they mostly work in the same city, and have monthly meetups for those who don't.
- If someone leaves the company, they might as well have never been there. Several of my past co-worker's and leader's last days were met with silence. No well-wishes or farewells were given from the ""leaders"". Those leaving simply logged their last hours and left. 

Management lives in their own world
- As a front-line employee, you rarely speak with management. At most they speak at you. They have ""town halls"", but I'd hardly call that open communication. At best, it's management waving their hands about how great they are. They'd promise things and never deliver, go off in a corner and plan the next quarter without any feedback from the team, then get frustrated if you didn't go along with their plans. 

Can't trust anyone
- While there are lots of good folks at InVision, many will turn on you if you speak up. It's tough to know who you can trust, as you never get to meet these people in real life. Chances are if it's upper management, you can't trust them.
- A little over a year ago, management decided to lay off about a dozen people from the engineering team. Senior leadership never talked about it, except in an internal memo that called it ""raising the bar"". There were many good engineers let go, and a majority of the folks were women. For two weeks you'd show up at work wondering who would disappear from Slack during lunch. The only way we know they were done was when the org chart finally stabilized. Again, management never addressed this, and at the same time many layers of upper management were being added to the organization.

Few Career Opportunities
- When I joined InVision, I was hopeful that the quickly growing company would provide me with some great career opportunities, so long as I put in some hard work and delivered good results. After being passed from manager to manager, and seeing all my previous leaders being replaced with outsiders, I realized it wasn't going to happen.
- No bonuses, raises or promotions were ever discussed. Rewards were only given out through political maneuvering. Since it's an entirely remote company, if you aren't in the 'in-crowd' you're not going anywhere with your career.

Finally, I'm afraid to leave this review because I fear they may retaliate. Again, don't trust this company."
235,InVision,Horrible Culture,2017-05-10,1.0,Software Engineer,"Committed to remote work. There are no offices, the entire company is remote and global.
Lots of opportunity to work with smart people from all over the world.

Work-life balance can be good, or it can be horrible depending whether or not you are working on something that has the CEOs attention.","CEO is a sociopath and much of the executive staff are sycophants. Occasionally  there are good managers and executives that cycle through, but they never last more than 6mo or so. The CEO runs this company, no dissent is allowed. Priorities change on a daily basis. There is no respect for any kind of project management or prioritization. I have seen co-workers stressed out because the CEO has called them late in the evening to verbally dress them down because they were not still up working on a project. This company is driven by working each employee to the breaking point without regard to work-life balance. Many excellent engineers and managers have been hired, praised publicly as the greatest hire ever made, only to be demeaned  and humiliated by the CEO or executive management 6mo later after the company got what it wanted out of them."
236,InVision,Excellent Company for Remote Workers,2017-05-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"InVision's strongest assets are its amazing product and a strong online tech culture.  The product is loved by every customer and we put a lot of work into it so its great to hear that feedback.  Since you work remotely daily (in your pajamas) workers are generally very happy and willing to assist others.   If you have kids or are too far to commute to a major city or possibly in the middle of a state/country this is an ideal opportunity to work for a top tech startup.  Strong leadership across the board, they have brought in very strong leaders in most departments to drive things forward in a number of ways as we continue to grow and scale.   You can work anywhere with an internet connection - so it is quite common for employees to travel the globe while still working their normal hours.  Since there is no commute this can greatly affect your work-life balance - but double edge sword since your coworkers can be in any time zone.  If you have an InVision community in your city you will have happy hours and events in your city, but participation is up to you since you are remote you must make the effort.  Unlimited startbucks card! Great benefits!","The onboarding is awful, you are left on your own to find resources which can be stored in many different places.  They are making strides in the HR department to correct this but it's far off.  Too many cooks in the kitchen for processes, once in a while someone owns a process or program, but for the most part it's all over the place and takes way longer to find the answer you are looking for - whereas in an office scenario you can literally just walk to a department and ask a question to a team.  If you are coming from top tier companies (especially tech) in major cities you will struggle with the work scenario as the WeWork offices do not really suffice and your friends/co-workers are essentially slack emojis so there is a strong sink or swim for those who cannot grasp the culture."
237,InVision,The best team I've ever worked with,2017-05-01,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"An excellent place to build amazing product with the best team imaginable. The entire product team (design, product, engineering) is incredibly talented.",Shifting priorities and the growing team can sometimes make it challenging to be remote.
238,InVision,"Hot company, great product. Rare opportunity.",2017-04-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The company is growing quickly and is in a really hot space. Great product, people, and customers! The love for our brand is unparalleled. The work we produce is top-notch and the potential to be $100 million+ business is on the horizon.
- Wonderful CEO, very humble and down to earth, yet has high expectations of others. I only wish we saw/heard from him more.
- Working from home has its pros and cons. It allows for lots of flexibility and it's great for those with children, but makes working and collaborating across teams quite difficult.
- Opportunities to move into different teams and functions if you're looking for something new.
- Good health insurance and benefits.","- Definitely some growing pains, which is expected of a fast-growing company (means we're doing something right!).
- Few women at the executive level and none on the board. Seems that there is more appreciation/recognition/favoritism for male colleagues (in most cases, subconsciously) and women are pushed out.
- Working remotely can make you feel isolated. The leadership team seems to be against team-wide retreats and doesn't appear to value face-to-face interactions as much as they should.
- We appear to hire more from the outside, instead of investing more in the people we have already. I don't see many promotions outside of Product and Engineering unless we just don't know of them, which brings me to...
- Major communication issues. Very difficult to know what everyone is working on and what the long-term vision is. Lots of duplicating efforts across the org and people spinning their wheels. Information lives all over the place and is difficult to find."

Work from anywhere that has internet!

Decent salary, especially considering costs saved on commuting!

It's pretty great to read about us in such a positive light in the world.","Senior management gets involved in the details too late in the process. Show up during review stages or stay away.

Working from home isn't for everyone. Feedback is infrequent, especially when you don't work in the same space."

242,InVision,"Good company, great people",2016-12-07,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I don't think I've ever worked for a company of this size at this high of an operating level. The people working at InVision make this happen. The people are amazing.

Perfect work-life balance. I can work when and where I want. There are core hours or availability, but that doesn't have to be when work gets done.","It's remote only. So staying focused can be a challenge if you've never worked remotely before. Communications between teams can sometimes be strained, but this is an issue with every company."
243,InVision,Great Idea block by HORRIBLE Management,2016-12-05,3.0,Sales,"The PRO's are pretty obvious as they are listed on all job listings. You have a flexible schedule since you are remote (this could be a CON to some), company provides great work/life balance (1/2 day Fridays and PTO) along with a Starbucks card + Apple laptop to navigate your work day. For me, the world you work in (Design) is intriguing, creative and inspiring.","Now all the pros seem pretty dang good, which is why I left a great company to join the InVision sales team. At the time the team was new and when on-boarding you could tell there was a lack of leadership which can create a handful of issues in itself since you are remote. Management is weak. To me the definition of leadership is to be a good team leader. To have the ability to navigate a group of people to success given their strengths- THIS DOES NOT EXIST. Most people on the sales team are not entry level, however they are not set up to be successful. There is 0 formal training, product information is self exploration and the expectations are not realistic. They create a unhealthy competitive atmosphere, backed by fear instilled leadership.   
The expectations of your role change, daily/weekly, which is expected in a start up however the tools to be successful are not provided.  
Poor comp plans
Poor support teams (BDR) 
Recruitment is borderline embarrassing when you hear the conversations that are had with potential candidates"
244,InVision,Such a great company to work for!,2016-11-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"InVision is an exciting company that is laser focused on creating the coolest design products out there!  As a result we're on a rocket ship toward new ideas.  I know that sounds dumb, but it's how it feels -- zooming ahead with new ideas to make the world of design better for everyone. Amazing and dedicated people to work with, who enjoy the challenges of our expanding vision.

Being fully remote can cause feelings of isolation but InVision people are wonderful about reaching out to meet each other, on a daily basis through slack channels, and in person when they travel.  I enjoy watching new people's reactions when the whole company reaches out to welcome them or wish them happy birthday, or support them when hardships arise.  When someone is coming to your area of the world they will reach out to try to connect -- and since we all get free beverages at Starbucks, it's easy to say ""let's meet for coffee"".

This company seems less compartmentalized than any I have encountered.  I find no matter the level, people are happy to connect with each other and there is an openness I haven't experienced elsewhere.

Benefits are good and being able to work from anywhere is terrific.  There is one engineer who is going to travel the world for a year while still being employed full time.  How cool is that?!

There is a level of trust that is remarkable.  Trust that you will do what needs to get done and that you will not abuse the privileges offered.  And most of all there is a sense that if you want to expand your experience and learn something new, you are encouraged to go for it.

InVision is GREAT!","Being fully distributed can lead to feeling a bit isolated but management is very aware of this and seem to sincerely want to do what is needed to offset this.  The CTO has started bringing the engineering teams together periodically with great results. 

Onboarding could be better but management is aware of this and seem to be working on smoothing things out."

My heart is ripped out and any hopes this company will thrive is slowly diminishing. In October, the Director of Engineering left after 4 months of employment.

251,InVision,InVision is an amazing place to work,2016-11-02,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"One of the biggest pros working at InVision is that you always get opportunities to make an impact on the organization outside of your daily responsibilities. You need to work hard to get them but should you be willing to they are yours for the taking. You are also surrounded by so many smart amazing people that are always willing to provide assistance. The Company is on a rocket-ship trajectory right now so the entire team is working extra hard and rallying around our goals in order to continue to hit them. Management is always checking in and open to hearing the teams ideas. In fact, the people that are hired are sometimes specifically chosen for the unique ways that they can make an impact. Working remote is also amazing as you are trusted and have freedom to work how and when you want for the most part. Work hard and you will be rewarded.","It is sometimes easy to get isolated working remotely so you need to be disciplined and make sure that does not happen. You have to learn to ""toot your own horn"" a little bit but It is worth it. Honestly its not that big of a con."

No project is too big or ambitious. Resources are supplied to get great ideas off of the ground. The flexibility of working remotely is a huge bonus. Opportunities for growth are given to those that show ambition and deliver results. I can't recommend working here enough.","Onboarding could be standardized and use some improvement. The company is constantly growing (which is positive), but it inevitably leads to constantly evolving processes/structure which can be difficult to keep up with at times."

At first I was a bit hesitant about working remote (also excited), but now couldn't imagine differently. As a distributed team, the company wants to make sure that the sales team has the training and recourses to be successful and consistent across the board. There is great communication across departments and teams. Everyone is approachable, ready to help or just there to talk :)
In addition, working remote means no more hours spent on communing, no distractions, more flexibility and productivity in the comfort of your home. What could beat that? Oh, unlimited Starbucks ;)
What else is awesome? The people! We have a Director of Employee Happiness. The product itself - product/ market fit, great continuous training, and much more :)",Pay is a little on the lower end but there is some flexibility and definitely ability to move up.

Company covers a certain amount for health insurance and gives you a variety of options (compared to larger companies that only provide you with maybe 3 plan options). Health benefits and rates are comparable to rates of larger companies, and can even be free if you choose certain options. Everyone is approachable and humble, no matter their title. It may be because upper management encourages this type of mentality, which is awesome! We also have our own Director of Happiness who checks up on us on a regular basis, which further encourages employee morale:-)","With the entire company being remote and dispersed all throughout the country, it's more difficult to have company outings, happy hours, etc. With that being said, there are times we setup temporary offices and fly people out to have meetings when needed."

The team is made up of the most amazing and talented individuals worldwide and somehow everyone is extremely friendly and easy to work with. At previous jobs, especially creative, talent has come at the price of ego. But not at InVision. People are more willing to help here than anywhere I've been and their work is fantastic. It's also extremely easy to stay excited when your company makes such fantastic products for designers, who are a group of people I come from and care about. 

Having a remotely distributed team is brilliant for 2 reasons. The first being that we hire the most talented people around the entire globe. I think it's very optimistic for other companies to assume that folks will all be willing to uproot their lives and relocate just to come work for them. Secondly, we are extremely organized and lines of communication are always clear and deliberate. If a question has ever been answered, it's easy to find the answer. And even easier to find and ask the right person. You're never left in the dark.

Between the extremely competitive salary, working from the comfort of your own home (or anywhere else for that matter), getting unlimited drinks from Starbucks, top notch medical benefits, and a team that makes you feel like your contributions are truly meaningful...

It takes a lot for remote work to be successful not only for the employee but for the employer. Therefore, InVision went a different way... everyone is remote. That way, we all know how to do it. I'm learning things every day in technology and I am able to live in the remote mountains of Washington. They are going through some technology transformations (as all companies are), but they are being thoughtful and everyone on the staff is learning. Working at InVision will advance you as a technologist not only in your skill, but your culture and communication skills too. The best pro is feeling like everyone is a peer. I can reach out to anyone in the company on Slack and they will not patronize, but be extremely helpful! Because of that, I've done nothing but learn new things here. I chose InVision over offers at other big technology companies. You can smell the culture of this place when interacting in the interview process. You will see that it's different. What I discovered when I started is that even though there are over 200 employees, it sure does feel like family. A great place to work.","So far, I haven't dug into many cons of working here. I do believe it takes someone willing to be out there in remote work land. Someone who can engage with others and feel good about not sitting in a conference room, open office or stuffy cube."

The company also does a really good job of advocating for design as an industry. So in turn, people love the brand. Working remote has huge benefits. Rocket ship growth company.","New product releases slowed down a bit but that has already turned around in the right direction. Working from home isn't for everyone and you have to be self driven. Onboarding is a different experience when you are remote, and while there is definitely training in place  you need to be self motivated."
268,InVision,Awesome Employer and Amazing Team,2016-09-19,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,The company culture as InVision is unmatched.  Everyone is enthusiastic and portrays a positive attitude.  The company itself is very successful and continues to grow at an amazing rate.  I'm continually amazed by the positive customer feedback we receive on a daily basic.  Working remotely is a blessing.  I can't imagine ever working for another company.,Family health insurance is expensive.
269,InVision,xxxxx,2016-07-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Good Work culture. Management is open to new ideas.,Process changes often. There is no room for growth. Employees moving up the ladder is yet to happen.
270,InVision,Great Company,2016-07-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"InVision is an even more fantastic company to work for than I imagined when I first thought about working for them. The company is more like family, and you feel cared for as an employee. We get great pay, get rewarded for good work, our benefits are awesome, and have a phenomenal vacation policy. On top of that, this company is something to believe in. They not only believe in the product, they believe in creativity. They also put their employees at the top of the list. The belief is that if we, the employees, aren't happy, healthy, and well rested, that we will not perform at our best. Which is true! So the top tiers make sure that we want for not. I love this company. I can't imagine loving my job anywhere else as much as I do here. My manager is amazing, all the people I work with are amazing, the company is amazing.",I have not come across any so far!
271,InVision,Once in a lifetime opportunity!,2016-07-11,5.0,,InVision is an amazing company that gives their employees the power to exceed within their profession.,"The remote life isn't for everyone. However, if you can learn to drive yourself, the benefits are amazing!"
272,InVision,Exceeds Expectations,2016-05-03,5.0,Senior Full Stack Engineer,"Work-life balance permeates the culture
Colleagues are available and happy to support you
Fun, challenging, cutting edge atmosphere
So many things that I can't even describe, it's an amazing company to work for.",I honestly can't find any. Maybe career paths could be better documented but I honestly don't even care. That's how awesome this place is.
273,InVision,"Not Bad, All Things Considered",2016-05-01,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The people you work with are generally great, especially on the engineering manager and engineer levels. You get to work from home, get free starbucks, and lots of people love the product you work on every day.","- There's very little loyalty to the employees, and things are changing rapidly. They'll tell you every couple weeks how great you are and how important your contributions are, but won't hesitate to cut you loose if what you are doing isn't playing into their new strategy that gets re-calculated every 2 months or so. 

 - I hope you like your starting salary, because you're not getting a raise. I don't know of a single person who successfully negotiated a pay raise (just several that were either explicitly denied or strung along), even after years."
274,InVision,Working toward a brighter future comes with change. It is a start-up afterall.,2016-04-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people are amazing and the vision for engineering to get to the next level of scale is exciting! There has been some recent changes and a big reformation of engineering to move away from the dated technology and waterfall development. Losing people is never easy, but it just happens when start-ups are gaining awesome momentum like InVision. The ongoing shift to using modern software practices (Agile, full ownership teams, no siloed QA, no siloed OPs) is awesome and I know learning and refining these skills is going to make me (and the biz)competitive in the market. Oh! And deploys are so easy now! It's already a great place to be; due to the passion, vision and enthusiasm. I'm just saying that it is only going to just keep getting better!

Oh, they also offer unlimited pto (I haven't had any issue taking time off when I wanted it) and the unlimited Starbuck card is really a thing!","I won't lie there is a lot of work to do, but that indicates a bright future to me. Also, the remote thing can be tricky at times but you learn how to accomdate quickly."
275,InVision,Great until new CTO took over,2016-04-22,1.0,,"Great telecommute benefits, macbook pro, starbucks card, etc... Excellent people on the ground level, a few great managers, fun products and great work hours. Tons of holidays in September.","Turnover crazy, complete job insecurity, ridiculous new processes from inexperienced people. Unlimited vacation days but every request is a painful hassle. They only want you to take vacation days during holiday season and complain if you get close to 'industry standard days' . So much for unlimited. You are told by people with far less experience how to do your job... And usually it's wrong."
276,InVision,"Not female-friendly, suspicious practices",2016-04-21,3.0,Engineer,"The prototyping tool is great, and the OG crew did a lot to make the brand pretty recognized in the industry in the beginning, they're just not scaling well.","Overwhelmingly male engineering team, and recent layoffs involved almost all of the already few female engineers. This company also apparently disputed my unemployment claim, telling the rep that I was not laid off, but rather that I quit. We all received a severance package, so I wasn't planning to follow through with the unemployment claim, but now I am because of this shady shît."
277,InVision,Best job I've ever had,2016-04-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Amazing product. People sometimes applause when you demo it. I've heard clients say stuff like ""Oh my God"" and gasp. It's unreal. 

Team are really nice. Lots of flexibility. I feel empowered. Really nice to work with designers. Overall fantastic.",Lots of room to grow as the company matures but nothing that can't be easily fixed.
278,InVision,Come work at Invision,2016-04-15,5.0,,"Do you like playing Russian Roulette? Because your job security here at invision is just that, your job gets to be at the whim of a CTO who is like a friend you trust who says he is good to drive and then jumps in his manual car and drops the transmmission. Want to see Nepotism at it's finest? After the CTO was hired every VP under him is from the same previous company? I mean what are the odds? 

I couldn't imagine working at such awesome place where you get to witness the hunger games in real life. Want to lay off people? doing it all at once is too easy, lets lay off 2-3 people a day for a two week span. really gets the adrenaline pumping in the morning when you log in.

Oh and spring cleaning once a year is for suckers, expect a re-org and new manager every few months or weeks if that. Visions here change faster than pregnancy cravings.

The people here on ground level are amazing, managers are pretty good, directors not bad, everything above that I would probably trust mexican tap water before I would their decisions.",No cons at all that I can tell
279,InVision,An amazing place and time to work at!,2016-03-11,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The way the product is growing, motivated by the creative product team and the excellent engineers, makes this a great time and place to be part of something big!
Engineering-wise there are a lot of challenges to work on, and the teams are given a good amount of freedom on working on new technologies.
The benefits (and pay) are great, I have to highlight bonusly - reward your colleagues and get rewarded with money - and unlimited Amazon books (if related to your work field).
Also it feels great to work in a product that's being used by such amazing clients.","Working remotely has its differences from the office dynamics you take for granted.
We are moving very fast, which sometimes cause several issues in the product. It still feels a somewhat immature company in some areas, but people are eager to fix those issues."
280,InVision,Rapid growth startup with an INCREDIBLE team,2016-02-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are so many pros that I don't know where to start... 

1. The team is absolutely incredible. 

The caliber of the level of skill in this team is mind blowing. InVision hires the best talent in the world. (Literally, we have teammates all over the world.) If you make the cut, then you're phenomenal at what you do. 

2. The perks are crazy. 

We're given unlimited Starbucks cards, we have unlimited vacation (they trust you to use it wisely, and as a result, everyone does), we have a monthly gym membership stipend, we get a health care allowance to cover the cost of our benefits and there are a variety of options to choose from, we have a 401k program, some folks qualify for stock options, they provide you with MacBooks and anything else you need to do your job (monitors, mice, keyboards, stands etc.), we get discounts on phone plans, vacation packages and a variety of other awesome things. 

3. There is a fantastic company culture.

We have a Happiness Officer on staff (he's a certified life coach who is there to make sure that we feel happy and fulfilled in our roles, and he's amazing), we have better lines of communication than I've EVER experienced in an office environment (we use Slack, Hangouts and Zoom to connect throughout the day, so you wind up building work friendships just like you would in person), the senior staff is full of visionaries (they inspire us each day to reach new heights), the excitement about what we're accomplishing as a company is contagious throughout the organization, people are recognized for the work they do (we even have a peer recognition program through bonus.ly), the list goes on! 

I could probably go on for days talking about all of the reasons I love working for InVision!","The company is in a rapid growth stage, so if you're not a fan of exciting, mega fast paced startup environments, then the company may not be a great fit for you."
281,InVision,"To say it's the best company to work for is an understatement, SERIOUSLY!",2016-02-15,5.0,Customer Advocate,"Unlimited Starbucks card - You get a Starbucks card for beverages at Starbucks

Gym membership - Your gym memberships are paid for up to $50 per month

Medical/Dental/Etc - Fully paid for depending on plan you go with.

Vacation/Sick/Holiday - This is unlimited! Yes, you read that right, unlimited! The company trust each individual to be responsible and thus, I will say again, this IS UNLIMITED!

Discounts - Lots of discounts and perks available on cell phone bill, attorney fees, car rentals, Disney, Universal Studios etc

Bonus.ly - The ability to reward each other with real money each month for outstanding work, which we can then redeem for cool stuff.

Director of Employee Happiness - We have a Director Of Employee Happiness! I have worked for all sorts of companies including some Fortune 500 and I have never heard about a position that specifically addressed the needs of the employees. Someone you can talk to about anything without fear of being judged or ridiculed!

Books - Unlimited Amazon books as long as they are position-related. 

Pay - You won't be disappointed!

Work with amazing people - This sounds like a cliché but seriously, these people are awesome to work with! It is almost like everyone is truly a family!

An most of all, you get to work from home! It doesn't get better than this folks.","Before I got hired, I read these same reviews and the only con most people sated was that fact that you work from home. Now I am hired, I know why that's the only con. It is literally because there is nothing bad at this point to say. It is all great stuff!"
282,InVision,The best job I've ever had,2016-02-14,5.0,Front End Engineer,I love working with so many smart and talented people. I'm constantly challenged (in a good way) so it keeps things interesting and exciting. Everyone is so friendly and are always willing to help out whenever you get stuck or need to bounce some ideas off of them.

284,InVision,So happy to work at InVision.,2016-01-21,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Lots of great perks like free Starbucks drinks, free Amazon books related to your work, covered gym membership.
In Sales, you are monetarily compensated for your success but there's also a base salary - which I think is a great balance.
Your bosses don't hover over your shoulder. They trust you to get your work done and look for ways to help you do your job better.
The people are so friendly. Even though it's a remote company, you get the chance to meet them through online meetings. Everyone's willing to help you out if you ask - no matter how busy they are.
The company is still nailing down processes for different departments. In your role, you have a lot of authority to provide feedback and suggest process improvements. Everyone is important!",Haven't experienced any as of yet.

It's innovative in every way, from the way they evolve development and staffing to the way they analyze and approach everyday product problems.

The company as a whole are such a fantastic, creative, inspiring bunch that makes it exciting to work and contribute to this team every day.  Never seen a company roll out such awesome, high-end releases in such a short amount of time.  Super inspiring!

Atmosphere: I was a bit hesitant at first with the idea of a remote position since it sounded like it could result in being distanced from your team and there would be an extreme lack of communication and team/company spirit, but my experience could not have been more opposite!  I love the fact that I can be anywhere in the world, and still work and contribute. My team is extremely close and I believe we have excellent communication and are a very positive-spirited group, always willing to help each other and do the best for the company.","- Some gaps in communication across company teams

287,InVision,Visionary Company and Wonderful Place to Work!,2016-01-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Growing incredibly quickly and significantly ahead of the curve on multiple fronts from technical aspects to product vision to a culture of trust.  Strong senior leadership and long-term outlook.  Has the fastest moving team(s) I've ever seen after watching and/or being a part of several of the Valley's biggest successes and failures.  Incredibly humble and brilliant team members to work with,"Took a little bit of time to get used to remote aspect but got over any reservations pretty quickly :) Still quite early in company's lifecycle, so if you are not looking for a fast-paced atmosphere or biased towards execution, then it may be tougher to adjust"

The team is smart, innovative, high energy, and everyone genuinely advocates for the product and other teams. We may all work from home, but we get to know others through our chat program, and I love getting feedback in the form of peer bonuses! Also, who doesn't love the perks of professional development, Starbucks and a work Macbook? Leadership understands that your internet will go out, life happens, and they really do care if you need to take the day off, which is pivotal with a work from home position.

I get along great with my team and other teams, I feel I can reach out to our CEO or other leadership anytime, and I really look forward to growing with the InVision family!","Since InVision is still a startup, there will be growing pains, but I've not experienced many of these personally.
