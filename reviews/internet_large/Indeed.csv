The company will say over and over ""we will never pay like these other big tech companies"" while failing to realize that they are literally surrounded by every major tech company in Austin.

2. Leadership lacks product vision. Indeed is like Kodak milking sales of physical film in the 80s except they don't have a digital camera breakthrough product on the back burner. They have nothing."

- The HR department does not know the internal processes in the French market, which can be detrimental and impactful. They do not respect the confidentiality of their employees.

25,Indeed,Helps people get jobs but doesn't help their employees with their jobs,2022-03-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,In a few locations it offers better (slightly) than average compensation and work-life balance.,"Company lacks foresight. For a company that claims to be a data-driven company, it actually fails to avoid problems encountered by other tech companies even if the data is available on how to avoid it. 

It entered a hyper-growth stage with clearly no goals to back it up, which basically hired too many people without a lot of things to do to the point that it actually slowed down hiring during 2019 because it realized it's mistake but don't want to tell everyone about it.

Senior leadership aren't really honest about things, when asked legitimate concerns, it is redirected back to the person asking the concern as another question. This is attributed to the fact that the company hired too many people and basically didn't really completely check if the person they hired was a good fit for the company. Which led to new people basically changing the company's identity and culture and led to attrition to long time employees.

The company now has a culture of re-inventing the wheel and tries to emulate good tech companies but actually just emulates the bad things those tech companies does.

Indeed itself is oblivious to the norms of non-US locations. A lot of perks are given off to US offices but those same perks are never in non-US locations, so much for advertising in a company that thrives in equality.

In terms of equality too, some employees are not well compensated especially those who came from third-world countries. If you are not in a particular role, you don't really have a lot of value within the company which is evident in the compensation difference. A lot of ex-employees who moved to other companies with the same role experienced more compensation equality compared to Indeed.

Unlimited PTO is a lie, basically, you get it as long as you manager approves it. The worst thing about is it that, if you file for PTO, you really won't know if your manager has approved it as part of your unlimited PTO or your regular vacation leave.

Which brings me to the last point, Indeed has hired a lot of people on the leadership roles that aren't really what you call ""leaders"". These so-called leader never gives value to the people that they ""lead"" and are always thinking of themselves. These so-called leaders do not know how to effectively manage or lead people. The problem is too that, if Indeed does get people who know how to actually lead, they never try to retain them or support them properly. These so-called leaders have also abused some of the powers by indirectly harassing employees to make themselves voluntarily quit in order for Indeed to not pay for anything. These so-called leaders, never are very selfish and don't understand that they succeed when their people succeed, instead they make themselves succeed and force their subordinates to do things that are not even beneficial for them."

40,Indeed,There are greener pastures,2022-03-23,2.0,Senior Account Executive,"There are admittedly solid benefits in the form of decent pay, flexible time off, and good insurance coverage. Other than that I'm not so sure.","I imagine the rhetoric here will be more skeptical than that in most other reviews of Indeed. But it will serve well those who don't want to drown in koolaid where the only path to a promotion is obsequious habits toward management.

I'll start with the CEO. Chris Hyams is a frustrating leader. Indeed prides itself on diversity and inclusion. Weirdly, though, Hyams injects his political beliefs in an attempt to grovel to the small percentage of employees who demand an answer for every little thing that might enrage them. Our mission is to help people get jobs, not meddle in politics. But the CEO feels the need to be politically correct and gain some easy points through predictable virtue signaling. His answers in our company wide q&as are typically cursory, lacking the detail employees need to plan for the future. He's changed his rhetoric on being so inclusive for people who aren't vaccinated which will most likely lead to folks losing their job when many of the roles can sufficiently be done remotely. 

As far as the day to day goes...two main complaints. The first is simple...the work isn't intellectually stimulating. It's boring, repetitive, and your clients are provincial. The second is the technical issues. Indeed continues to remind its employees that change and adaptability is necessary to survive there. It's an excuse for our technical shortcomings that we have to endure and needlessly troubleshoot, often multiple times a day. 

The last is management and an obscured path to career development. Don't want to be loud and play politics? Good luck. Not to mention, they have some of the dumbest people in management roles that have no business being there. It comes down to not being able to evaluate prospective managers."

- Decent benefits

- Lots of ambiguity. If you are proactive, you can help shape things and remove some of the ambiguity.
- Lots of opportunities for different work. It really is what you make of it.","- Work is delivered via quarterly OKRs that are not well-defined. This means there might be lots of pivots and changes throughout the quarter. 
- There are duplicative efforts of the same work happening since work efforts are often silo'd. When you try to bring different silos together, it can be challenging.
- Lots of opinions in project work. While it is great to collaborate with others, it can be challenging when every opinion gets to chime in. At some point, decisions need to be made.
- Lots of ambiguity. This is a pro but can also be a con. Not everyone is capable of being proactive and removing ambiguity. 
- A person's level (i.e. Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 4, Level 5) is very important. This is the only time in my professional career that someone has referenced an internal job level multiple times. Maybe not a con for others, but I find this odd that someone would reference levels."

57,Indeed,You don't need Indeed.com to find one of the best employers in Singapore!,2022-03-16,5.0,Software Engineering Manager,"I felt valued from day 1. I was treated with respect by very senior leaders within the company and that my opinions mattered. There were ample opportunities for growth and plenty of support to do what's important.

The culture at Indeed is just wonderful. People were always helpful and not only is it encouraged - it is recognized and rewarded. Indeed does not practice ""stack ranking"" during performance evaluations which promotes a high level of collaboration between individuals. Evaluations and promotions are highly transparent, which meant that every individual knew what it takes for their own career progression.

The engineering teams in Singapore contribute to efforts that are crucial to Indeed's global machinery. What one does impacts all of Indeed worldwide - the teams here contribute to efforts across very different domains, ranging from payments and apply to our salary and educations product that are used by more than 250m active jobseekers worldwide. There are no lack of interesting, impactful problems to solve!

Compensation for engineering in Indeed is one of the best in the Singapore tech landscape. This is supplemented by excellent healthcare and other ""standard"" tech benefits like daily catered meals, well stocked pantry and flexible working hours. To prevent people from burning out, Indeed instituted monthly ""You days"" which are Indeed wide holidays for all employees. On top of that, all employees have unlimited paid-time-off and managers would actively encourage their teammates to utilize this benefit. It is very clear that leadership all the way from the top cares about a healthy work-life balance here in Indeed.

Indeed also embraces working remotely. While the offices have reopened, all employees have the flexibility to work from home or from the office. Indeed provides a small monthly stipend as a WFH allowance.

You won't regret joining Indeed!",The lack of brand prestige working for Indeed is about the only minus I can think of. Indeed is relatively unknown here and that limits Indeed's ability to hire well in this market.

Management is wonderful and understanding. All of these things make the very real cons of Indeed worth putting up with.","Indeed has grown so fast some of their back end systems are built for a smaller company vs. multi billion dollar enterprise. Billing systems are not built for enterprise clients and it causes a lot of problems. 

Sales quotas are blatantly unfair. I do not think this is done on purpose, but your team will have people asked to grow 15% each quarter, and others that will forecast growth but still average a negative quota across the whole year (for no reason like losing clients). It is difficult to watch your peers with consistently super low quotas make a ton more money than you on commission. Even if you grow your revenue more, they will make more money and be more likely to be promoted because Indeed values quota attainment percentages over revenue growth."

A lot of smoke and mirror promises as well as many things placed as distractions from the mediocre(at that) work culture. Unlimited PTO and office happy hours are dangled in your face but never accessible if you are underperforming. Resources for help and managers will push you to the wayside if you are in need of help and coaching as they would rather focus on getting more sales for their over performing team members to boost their manager bonus at the end of quarter. When requesting PTO you are often met with ""are you sure you should be taking time off when its xyz"" usually some sort of guilt statement in order to try and make you rescind your time off. Same goes for employee resource groups or on the clock employee resource meetings and conferences- managers will often ask ""how is it you have time for this but not time for more sales?""

225,Indeed,Interesting culture,2021-12-20,2.0,Director,Great innovative business model that resonates with the job seeker.,Constant change and no consistency. Very unbalanced workforce with minimal business experience amongst the representatives. Definitely a first job out of school culture.
226,Indeed,"Great place to work, been a great few years",2021-12-20,5.0,Sales Director,"They are constantly innovating and exploring better ways to help the Jobseeker, employers, and our people working here. Inclusivity is discussed every day and acted on. Doing what's best for the job seeker is always the #1 focus. It's fun being on the front lines of change. Yes, it can be messy! 

Senior leadership is always transparent, and there is an open-door policy, which is why I am surprised at some of the reviews here. There are some great opportunities to advance at any level if you work hard enough and do things that will get you noticed.

The people we work with are the biggest Pro. Best team of people in my long career that cares and want to work.","We need to grow our teams here in Arizona as we are smaller and have had people move into different roles within the company without backfilling.

Fix internal systems as it is hindering the performance of reps. It's a big issue that I know is being addressed, but some considerations would be nice."

228,Indeed,"Overall great, if a bit inconsistent",2021-12-17,4.0,QAE II,"* Many talented, intelligent people working to solve complex problems, usually at the benefit of the job seeker
* Pretty good in-office perks (snacks, food, game space, ping-pong, lounge, etc. -- though this also varies widely depending on office)
* Unbelievably flexible with PTO (barring Sales and CS, I think) which affords so much leeway in work/life balance
* I have faith leadership (SLT) actually cares about what is going on in the world and with its employees (frequent SLT updates, Q&As, email updates and policy alerts, etc.)
* Overall a pretty casual environment, and one I never feel uncomfortable in even when providing feedback
* Offers ample opportunities to move your career path how you see fit. There are no real barriers to changing roles internally, assuming you pass the interview(s), of course. Though, the process can be a bit sub-par, IMO.","* Your experience will vary greatly depending on which business unit you are a part of, which office you're in, what your team structure is (fully remote / hybrid / flex / in office, etc.), who your managers are, among other things
* Relatively old tech stack (slowly improving), with ample tech debt that rarely, if ever, gets a chance to be cleaned up/improved
* Absurdly siloed business units, leading to significant problems in communication and coordination, often leading to duplicate or erroneous work being done haphazardly by people with less context of the systems at play
* Salary tends to be on the lower end, especially without inclusion of the bonuses and RSUs
* We sometimes end up having the exact same discussions about particular features or problems because previous discussions were either not actioned, or not shared anywhere so the people with the knowledge are either gone, or are not involved in the new discussions. I am so sick of these redundant meetings.
* Management is completely lost -- I think a large part of this is due to more recent churn in managerial roles, but, overall, in my time here it seems management have a hard time making and sticking with decisions, which leads to chaos as teams scramble to reevaluate their priorities, for example. A recent survey showed that among the largest issues employees were dealing with is their stress level at work, which I wholly attribute to this disorganization with management and their lack of communication and solid direction. SLT I think does fine being 'hands-off' to let the business units make their decisions, but beyond that, top-down it seems like everyone is almost entirely lost, and that feeds into the IC roles. 
* It bugs me when we design things that force users into a particular flow to gather more data on them. The intent is to get more data for internal usage so we make better decisions, but the outcome is forcing people into fewer and fewer workflows, which I imagine many people don't enjoy. (Similar to Glassdoor's move to require you to login to view anything beyond a single page. This just adds frustration to what should be (and used to be) a very simple process!)"

As individual contributors, we were asked to create our own role and create our own processes. Communication is so silo'd in the company that it was impossible to function with the start up mentality they wanted us to have. You can't talk to another team, you have to open a JIRA ticket and wait for someone to be assigned to it. Internal resources and tools were scarce. We were regularly asked to do things that the directors or senior directors should have been handling. It's non unusual for Indeed products to turnover - they just shuffle employees around from product to product. Morale is incredibly low as a result.

•Very affordable medical insurance options
Lots of internal benefits (continued learning, free meals, free access to gym in-office, etc)","•Not always clear path of promotions/moving up
•Base pay is not within market standards"
328,Indeed,Not Great,2021-10-14,2.0,Client Success Specialist,"-Company treated staff great at the start of the pandemic. Good experience when you have a great manager

-Quarterly bonus

-Great new office in Dublin! Though a bit hard to reach","Cons

- The biggest con; the nepotism in the different departments, especially Sales and Client Success. If you have a great manager, you have a good experience if you 'click' with them. If you have a less than great manager, you'll have a less than good experience, to downright awful.

- Indeed uses two parallel systems to track anything from Finance, Sales, Support etc. This means that there is a lot of extra work to be done that isn't efficient and distracts from your job. The Tech Stack is cobbled together, not crafted from a singular perspective.

-KPIs are constantly changing, and the work itself is transforming into simple Call-center work.

-There had been a hiring freeze and this caused very limited chances to grow in the company. 

-Unlimited PTO isn't unlimited anymore. In Sale and CS it doesn't count for much unless you overreach your target significantly AND you're in good standing with your manager. Even then, it's only slightly more.

-Indeed is data-driven, but is it in a very superficial way. They don't look deeper into the numbers, and don't derive any real value from their numbers. i.e. Markets reaching their targets is a simple yes or no. No deeper analysis into how and why. 
Another example, Indeed wants to grow and get 'closer to the hire' because they've noticed the recruiting industry is much larger than what they have been aiming for. They didn't analyse their value to their clients, but simply decided to throw a product in to 'get closer to the hire' that hardly works.

-The pay and benefits at other Tech companies in Dublin are way better.

-This would, partially, explain why Indeed has a hard time attracting or keeping skilled personnel. There had been a hiring freeze for a year and a half, and the departments kept shrinking, while the work kept piling up. This is in particular for the UK and especially BeNeLux team

-The product itself isn't really great. A lot of extra tools they roll-out aren't fully developed. They could definitely take more time in thinking this through."

343,Indeed,"Tells a nice story, but over all doesn't see the people behind the numbers",2021-10-04,2.0,Senior Account Executive,"- Large focus on training and developing skills
- Unlimited PTO - at your manager's discretion.
- The first step in career progression is very attainable and ""mechanical"". Do the action, get the promotion. Every step after that is a different story.","- LOT'S of box-ticking excercises. Indeed use two parallel business systems, and integration between these two systems often means none of them work as intended. This makes the required boxticking exercises much harder, as the boxes ticked don't always show to be ticked to all stakeholders. Same with overarching analysis software.

- Very data driven decision-making, yet there is no interest in looking into numbers at more than face value. Is your market hitting your targets? Yes or no - that's all of it. 

- Struggling to attract and keep skilled personnel, meaning all departments are constantly short-staffed. 

- Very dependant on your director. Good experiences with a good manager, but very bad experiences with a mediocre manager. Terrible experiences with a bad manager. During my 2 years at Indeed, I had 6 different directors. Each time we'd go over the same problems and land in the same ""unacceptable"" work-arounds (this process would take around 6-8 weeks each time).

- Lot's of unskilled managers, and teams tend to look for ""culture fit"", not ""culture add"". In practice, this means that if you don't naturally do things the same way as your manager, regardless of your results, you will be considered problematic."

351,Indeed,Challenging yet wonderful experience in my career,2021-09-30,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"From day 1, I felt very welcomed and included at Indeed. Their culture of transparency and providing consistent support to their employees wellbeing has undoubtedly set me up for success in my career and to develop my personal growth.

While there is a lot of learning about the product and how to explain it in layman terms, Indeed provided a lot of training opportunities and coaching from experienced managers to help you achieve your goals.

If you work in Sales, it will be a challenging experience and it's important to be on top of your book of business. However, if you disqualify, manage your time and focus on the clients that want to talk to you and need your help, then you will reach your quota and open a lot of doors for your personal brand as well as expand your network.

I learned so much from Indeed, my managers, and peers that hone in on my soft skills so no doubt that it made me more resilient and adaptive to the current environment and more importantly work effectively as a team to reach our goals.

Other nice perks include unlimited PTO, work-home balance, work from home allowance and free swag.","Communication with other teams located in different offices across the globe can lead to delays in getting campaigns started and issues resolved which can be frustrating. 

Sometimes they ask you to create a ticket again after raising the incorrect one or if there is information missing, you need to start from the beginning in raising a case again. This sort of admin work is unnecessary and adds to an already heavy workload to AEs so if there is a little flexibility introduced to this then it would really drive results faster.

When you sell an annual subscription, you can only receive a quarter of the revenue added to your dash each quarter. If the account moves to Growth then the new rep gets the remaining revenue due despite the fact that you closed an annual deal."

Of course, CS also isn't ""set up"" to earn commission on the sales they help their Sales counterparts to make which is just wrong.

422,Indeed,Perfect career for recruiter,2021-08-09,5.0,Recruiter,Great mission driven company with lots of growth and ability to be a part of something great.,"Many systems changes and integrations, and processes changes all at once. If you can't keep up with fast paced ever-evolving environment then may not be the right now one for you."
423,Indeed,Lack of Growth Opportunities,2021-08-07,3.0,"Manager, Client Success","1. Great offices! Not as relevant during the pandemic but definitely worth mentioning.

2. I've met some great people at Indeed. Made plenty of friendships that I believe will last a long time.

3. The company mission is admirable. It was relatively easy to connect the dots as to how my job positively impacted others. 

4. Indeed has great brand recognition and the product practically sells itself.

5. Indeed did not have layoffs during the pandemic, and I am grateful for this.","1. Indeed Client Success is grossly underpaid. If you want to be paid what you're worth, Indeed Client Success is not the place to do it.

2. It's difficult to get promoted unless you're in the right place at the right time, and know the right people. Your career and pay growth is largely out of your control.

3. The best perks of working at Indeed are all tied to being in the office. Once the office perks were taken away, it was easier to see where Indeed was lacking, and many are quitting as the job market recovers and receiving significant pay increases elsewhere.

4. Semi-annual reviews in Client Success are extremely subjective. I would be scored in categories like Collaborate, Initiate, and Execute by a leader that didn't even understand the magnitude of the work that I was doing and was horrible at showing appreciation. There seems to be some unspoken rule amongst CS leaders that no matter what someone in CS does, they can never get a ""perfect score"" on their review. This is a practice that discourages employees from trying to go above and beyond.

5. It seems like every 2 years Indeed makes a drastic shift that completely changes the role of CS and Sales. Recently, there was a re-org where teams were broken up with little notice. From a CS rep's perspective, this means that you were most likely placed on a different team, with a different manager, with different sales partners, with different accounts, and no pay adjustment.

6. Indeed CS has a practice of putting people in ""Interim"" Manager or Team Lead roles and not paying people for the work that they are doing. For example, a Team Lead may work as an Interim Manager for several months without being paid like a Manager. In my opinion, this practice needs to stop.

7. For some reason Indeed has made it extremely difficult to transition from Inside Sales CS to Enterprise CS even though it's essentially the same job. For people that don't want to follow a leadership path, transitioning into Enterprise CS is pretty much the only way to see meaningful career growth within CS. So if you can't transition to Enterprise and you aren't interested in being a CS leader at Indeed, it's in your best interest to move on to a new company.

8. Indeed leadership has a way of guilt tripping you into thinking that there's no other company like Indeed, the grass isn't greener elsewhere, etc. That's completely false. There are so many awesome tech companies in New York, Austin, and the Bay Area that have the same or even better perks than Indeed and pay significantly better.

9. I appreciate that Indeed as a whole seems to value inclusivity and diversity, however, I wish that a senior leader would have taken the time to reach out and talk to me 1:1 about diversity and inclusion related topics, even if just for 15 minutes. That would have meant so much more to me than hearing about it at another All-Hands meeting or any other group setting. Personally, I don't want to hear a white man or woman telling me what needs to be done to improve diversity without them having listened to my input first."

This happens A LOT. You will always be covering for someone. SLT seems to have a clear vision but it's not being executed well. They are forcing products to roll out quickly that are half-baked and then act shocked when our Enterprise clients are angry the products do not work or break etc. CS and Sales are on the front lines of these conversations as all other teams at Indeed refuse to be client facing. You will never get a market standard salary. Indeed is low paying in comparison to the industry and you can expect very small raises and HUGE pay bands. Externals will be brought in at the top of a pay band doing half the work of people that started just a few years ago. So it's causing a lot of turnover.

579,Indeed,"Sub-standard quality of work, below avg team, but with great pay",2021-05-08,2.0,Senior Product Manager,"- People are generally friendly and good to talk to
- Pay is top of the market for Singapore. Since they have limited brand value in the market, they pay big bucks to compensate to buy out people from other companies.","- Lots of talk, but little real action: Since Indeed in Singapore hires a lot more “managers who talk fancy” rather than “actual doers”, there’s very little work that actually gets accomplished on a weekly basis. Most work gets caught up in holding patterns of useless debates/micro-alignment, and eventually teams celebrate tiny A/B tests at the end of 3 months as “massive impact”. The actual amount of work that gets each quarter is a joke, really!

- The office is pretty much a satellite engineering office for the most part: Strategy/goals gets “handed down from the top” from US bosses. Or even if the teams come up with bottom-up ideas — they need “permission from the top” to even try it out. The culture is very top-down for the most part.

- The management in the US doesn’t trust the teams in Singapore, hence prepare to be micro-managed a lot. Have a problem with micro-management? Sorry, you’re not “aligned” — don’t even try pushing back as micro-management (ex: getting your simple A/B experiments approved before testing) is the expected cultural norm here.

- Culture in Singapore reminds you a lot of working in a large bank: Lots of politics, people sweet-talking on the face while they complain behind your back, lots of talk around process yet very little work actually gets done, leaders who do a lot of theoretical pseudo-intellectual debates but with little practical implementation knowledge nor experience.

- Hiring processes are broken: The quality of the people varies a lot. You might find an occasional outlier rockstar but huge variations in quality of folks. From a Singapore standpoint, the overall avg engineering quality is definitely below market, and part of it can also be attributed to the quality of product-mandates held by Singapore teams — since the work is not very challenging, you don’t tend to attract the best engineers anyways! How many engineers would just want to move around a couple of buttons everyday?"

A lot of senior members of the leadership team have left in the last 9 months and the company has seemed to have lost its way. They are constantly putting new product tweaks in place that are hurting employers and aren't wanted by them. The engineering teams seem to think they know what the clients wants but sales and CS, on the front lines, are having to deal with angry employers and having to explain why they are getting a worse ROI month after month. The company also keeps investing in side projects that don't work and are spending too long on them and too much money.

Expect retaliation for constructive feedback and escalating toxic behavior. Did your engineers come to work at 3pm and miss standup for a month? Well, the eng manager will retaliate if you escalate to their manager. Did your designer just yell at the engineers? Well, don't escalate that to their manager or you'll get retaliated against for that too. 
Indeed hires children who care more about office perks and happy hours than showing up and doing their jobs.
Did you just deliver insane results? Well, keep that up for three review cycles and you'll get a 7% raise.

That started to fade away when it grew tremendously in 2016, 2017, 2018, etc. Indeed has a ""no jerks"" policy, but that didn't seem to be applied as much as the years went on. Top talent people from the West and East Coast were brought in for brainpower, but with that often came huge egos and underdeveloped emotional intelligence/social skills. Entitled ""geniuses"" started roaming around the office.

Pay was also quite low for my department. Some departments might of been different, but they claimed all of the cushy techy perks were justification for below average pay. This was in Austin when the housing/rent prices began skyrocketing as an influx of transplants kept rolling in. 

Management was pretty incompetent in my department. Lots of favoritism and college cliquey vibes that got unqualified people promoted if they were within that clique.

There was a lot of pressure to hang out at the office as much as possible. It was a good gig for recent grads, but a lot of people had their entire lives and identifies embedded in the Indeedian work culture. If you didn't want to partake in all of that, it was a bit to your disadvantage.

The recruiting blitz is strong and they strive for a 6 star experience if you make it to an interview. Salaries are toward the lower end from what I heard and what I learned as a hiring manager although manages are not allowed to know what their employees earn. They strive to make up for lower salaries in perks. (Not sure how that is going in these wfh days.) For a while, they were hiring like gangbusters with new employees getting a fresh Macbook Air. So you have a lot of young people without much structure running around looking busy but without much direction or results. The demographics and age range definitely slants younger and there is a lot 'coaching' asked of managers. There is also an emphasis in performance management with repeated feedback both up and down. However, this gives a disproportionate amount of leverage to lower level staff who in many ways have become entitled and coddled. And too many avenues for people to push back on their managers covertly. This creates a very superficial environment with happiness on the outside but a lot of back stabbing behind the scenes. It's unfortunate as the mission and progressiveness of the company are in the right place. The Indeed brand and marketplace standing are strong and the Japanese holding company who owns Indeed is throwing money at it like it's going out of style. (This must be a classic pump and dump strategy to sell this firm.)
I would avoid jobs in program management as they are frequently glorified admins. The Product side is generally strong.
Like any job, proceed at your own risk. In full disclosure, I'm an experienced middle manager with a strong CV who was there 15 months and couldn't get out fast enough."

A lot come from well known corporate tech companies and have a school teacher approach. Promotions are rare, demotions are common. Up to roughly 2 years ago company was booming, but big changes in Senior Management and hiring of extremely young inside sales reps, changed the dynamic completely. Massively relient on minimum wage type jobs for site, mid to Senior jobs do not perform well on site, at all. Warehouse workers, HC assistants etc are reason for volume of monthly visit numbers.

1102,Indeed,Indeed is like an abusive partner,2020-06-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Nothing; all this place has to recommend it is branding.,"Indeed's is a culture hostile to inclusion. It's also hostile to the concept of elevating people, and specifically women of color, and most specifically, Black women. As a NBWOC, not only was I constantly denied a promotion despite increasing responsibility, I saw the same done to other NBPOC but specifically to Black women, and to the worst degree. 

Any woman whose personality didn't fit a model of white femininity was bullied, shunned, or essentially demoted. This place destroyed my soul and made me think that every single manager I will ever have will be toxic and abusive. I had dealings with two abusive managers at Indeed, and a slew of ones who didn't care to grow my skills. Ironically, the two 'leaders' who foisted the most work onto my plate without a promotion saw me become one fo the most essential member of both teams, at which time they decided it was time to take most of my responsibilities away. This was presumably because I made them feel threatened in some way, judging by how their white friends were promoted over me. Of course, both of these managers were white.

In the early days of Seen by Indeed, it was called Indeed Prime, and run by people who retaliated against POC who dared to give the leaders of the product a presentation about why targeting diverse candidates and people of color specifically was a solid business strategy that was already being pursued by our main competitor, Hired. It was a no-brainer, but since we gave the presentation to fragile white people, the result was retaliation in the form of verbal or managerial sidelining. Our personalities were proclaimed to be aggressive. The white man I worked for on Indeed Prime actually told me that my co-workers had given him feedback that I was aggressive and needed to tone down my personality - straight out of the racist workplace playbook. This same manager also mocked the accents of offshore contractors in front of me, about which HR did nothing. That manager later moved to a job in the Recruiting department, and is probably still there, because Indeed protects abusive, racist people, and really loves protecting bad managers with multiple HR complaints against them.

That was just the beginning. In both of my roles there, I was given work far beyond the scope of my job description. Forget a raise, I had to FIGHT for a title change to one that described all the work I actually did. Neither time did I actually get a title change, either. I moved to a different department for the next two of my three years at this company, and came across the second abusive manager, a white woman, who proceeded to hire another white woman who was her friend, who then bullied a third white woman on my team. Bullying is intersectional.

By the end of my tenure at Indeed, I had gone to HR about three separate white people who had bullied me in various documented ways, and HR did nothing. They claimed to do an investigation, but no one was fired, or even reprimanded, or prevented from getting a different role at Indeed. I'm always going to carry resentment from my time there because of the abusive behavior that's tolerated. The last straw was the Director of Diversity and Inclusion leaving. Y'all know why that was."

- Limited communication from the US updates about the website, leaving us unaware of changes made to the website when we tried to communicate with clients
- What you always hear when you gave feedback to managers is ""You know we cant do anything about that"" because themselves also realise they have limited power to change anything
- You get promoted based on whether your senior manager like you or not, not by how long you've been worked for. I've seen employees who definitely deserve a promotion with great performance and can give constructive feedback working for 2 -3 years but still in the same position since they started"

-No work life balance.
In the interview, I was told there is awesome work life balance here, and almost no OT here which is totally not the truth. You are expected to work 10-12 hours a day. Though it's not enforced directly, it is implied by team lead and manager. They assigned you the overwhelmed work to do which is even out of your job scope, then told you that you can stop your work at 6pm. But the workload is definitely couldn't be finished before 6pm. Even you sacrifice yourself and work overtime every day, the work will never be completed. Because they keep assigning you the work more and more, and lastly give you the worst and false evaluation even though how hard you worked.

-Poor management.
Poorest management team, you couldn’t imagine a team can be leaded by these kinds of people: they are emotional, unprofessional, childish, lack of basic working knowledge. They couldn’t accept any different voice, and keep building “yes-man” around them. The leads keep making mistakes but all will become subordinate’s faults, that’s their way. 

-Office politics.
It’s so funny even there is office politics in such a small team, and 2 team leads in the same team. The power-hungry leads use their subordinates as a tool to fight for their promotion. So, subordinates must become victims.

-Border bullying culture
Harassment behavior from team leaders and managers. Even they have an ethical team or HR department who should take care of this kind of issue, and you reported to them you have mentally exhausted due to endless border bullying, but no one take care of this issue seriously, and no one will care you, anyway you’re replaceable. And the team leader even told you, if you couldn’t endure then quit here."

The fact that Indeed were one of the first to make the move to WFH for all employees during the early days of Covid19 speaks volumes. Making an effort to retain all current staff making sure that if a role becomes dormant IE. Talent attraction that can move to another part of the business. Open and honest Q&As with CEO and other SLTs where they are incredibly vulnerable and open and really show that they are also people with family and friends the same as us all.

This is an honest review and I can honestly say that I really love working at Indeed. I work in the UK Growth A department and I have to say that I go to work with a smile on my face every day. The team I am on is amazing and I have really grown in so many ways. There is a really healthy culture of inclusion here, everybody is respected and appreciated. Indeed knows how to look after their staff.

I have been so impressed with how they have handled this difficult time through COVID and the uncertainty that surrounds it all. Culture is first and foremost at this company. Yes you have to work hard but hard work is rewarded, the team spirit in Growth A is second to none.

There are many great inclusion groups at Indeed, from ""Women at Indeed"" to parents inclusion groups, LGBT and many more. We also have great benefits such as PTO, healthcare, dental care and much more.

Indeed has not only helped my career but it has been so supportive in my personal life, even offering support through difficult times and particularly my director has been so supportive.

“Management” is better in current White House administration than at Indeed.  People will only have your back if you came up with them in the ranks and even in the end I’ve seen a lot of underhanded moves just so someone could get a new title/a few reports under their belt.

To think I actually was excited the day I started as if I was joining something I could get behind/believe in/make a difference at.  It was at my first/last volunteering event that my eyes were wide open.  Indeed lures people I’m with their culture and their mission “to help people get jobs” yet at the end of the day that veil is very thin - you’re selling ad space.  

Back when I joined management actually tried to teach the art of selling.  Then they slowly converted all of the account managers into the beast they made us loathe - inside sales.  A year later we were all screwed - call center USA.  

Sales is an art and artist can’t be manufactured.  Consultative sales is born from relationship building.  You can’t build a relationship from logging minutes/dials and tracking busywork for the sake of tracking busywork.  What comes from that is false reality.  Your reps aren’t hitting quotas because they can’t hit something that’s arbitrary.  Your reps that are hitting are the few your managers want to keep around because they like them.  They’re their yes men/women - they’re not necessarily good sales reps.  You just need a few examples to say “see so&do did it, now why can’t all 200 of you?”

You had a model that worked graduating accounts that had matured in spend and size to account managers, then you went and put greed before everything else.  Now you’re reaping what you sowed.  

Maybe your banking that the younger the hire is the less questions they’ll ask.

Either way you allowed a few rotten eggs to soil the whole bunch.  

Perhaps when a rep says I’ve mastered my time in sales (aka I can see the forest for the trees) and I can better serve Indeed in a different capacity you actually give them a fair/equitable chance to apply within and change roles/departments?  You’ve already invested in them as an employee, oh wait! thats right because it’s still a popularity contest not a job application."

The obvious free food, unlimited PTO and top class benefits are all brilliant but what makes it for me is the progression and support that is available. I started in Indeed as an account executive and within 2 years I was promoted to Team Lead and I couldn't have done that without the support from my manager and senior director.

I have read reviews around females not being promoted but in my own experience and from what I see around me that is not true. The best person will get the job and I think that is the way it should be! Unfortunately, like many other sales organizations gender imbalance is an issue but this is not an issue management are taking lightly which I think is great. There is no overnight fix for this issue but I do think with the right procedures in place things will change over time.

The job itself is very hard and when this is the case of course attrition rate will be high, however if you are up for the challenge the opportunities are endless! 

The compensation in Indeed is fantastic so the hard work is worth it. I would suggest knowing what motivates before you start this job as if it's not success, progression or money you will find it hard to keep on going.","Sometimes I feel the job can be mis-sold by the recruitment team and people don't know what they are signing up for. The correct expectations should be set from the onset! 

I dont think enough is being done by the talent attraction team to attract a diverse workforce simple activities like going to more grad fairs can help this!"

However, those are of the past where now is a desolate floor where you could hear a pin drop.

The senior leadership in Scottsdale and upper-management in New York have made the job a predatory landscape in a matter of 2 months. Leaving to mass firings and senior reps, and top performers leaving in a heartbeat. The push to be a Fortune 500 has left most of the company's values to the wayside.

A new product emerged within the company and it was forced upon us, the account executives, to be the BDRs for the product with an inadequate compensation structure. It's being shoved down SMBs throats with costs that are inappropriate for businesses of that size and the reps being put on plans if the numbers are not obtained. Quotas are starting to become unattainable with zero insight on how they are created although it's been asked to expose this from the reps. There are TWO CRMs being used with duplication of the same records to be inputted taking up time. The hyper-growth of hiring QoQ is starting to reflect in reps books where worked through accounts appear more and more leading to dead-ends, but same quotas expected.

In the end, the sales leg has flipped a 180 in the wrong direction in a matter of a year with a grim outlook and the lost focus on consultative selling to an aggressive sale with inappropriate solutions for our clients. Indeed will lose its upper hand if nothing is done immediately."

The vast majority of the people are great. Stunning office and general perks.,"There are limited excellent managers. The majority of individuals in the acquisition business are either friends of or close ex-colleagues of the senior directors. They promote each other and a cult-like culture internally known as boys club.  There is a huge diversity and inclusion issues and this has been made aware to senior management however it is being shut down and made a non-issue.  There are consistent issues with women not being promoted and recognised specifically; however, this issue spreads across all diversity channels including race, age, LGBT and mothers, etc. It is talked about constantly but never raised as an issue pubicly to allow the image of excellence to be maintained. An easy search of directors in the acquisition business of Indeed on LinkedIn will prove this point (ALL MEN). The issues include but are not limited to sexual harassment, public scolding in Gap Analysis from Senior Directors due to poor performance which makes people feel like leaving the business due to the horrible nature of feedback, removal of progression based on not being part of the click that is deemed highest (Boys Club).  There is an average of one girl per team of ten. We are told we have a voice but this is non-existent."

In the last year, 9/10 directors that I started with have left. This is not taken into account the countless reps that have also left. They don’t want people that will ask questions or bring up valid points, they are only looking at “yes-men/women”. They talk about career growth and progression but passed up on promoting anyone from the whole office to the next team lead position. 70-80% of the office is on some sort of plan currently. They say they want everyone to be here but don’t offer any assistance or help for the reps on these plans.

We have now become glorified middle men/women for our staffing solution. The art of solution selling is no wanted.    With this solution there is no commission which used to be between $3,500-$4,000 a month. Currently we are struggling to reach $2,000. Senior leadership believes we are able to make this up hitting our unattainable quotes.  
With more management positions being filled from outside Indeed there are fewer managers than ever before who understand how to teach and lead their teams to success within the unique sales cycle. 
We spend more time doing admin work, working through two CRMS and forecasting unrealistic numbers than talking to actual clients. It takes over 2 hours everyday to fill out every google sheet, record every demo, send out 2 proposals (one of which has zero purpose only to make sure it logs in the system).  They care more about unfinished admin work than they do low dials and talk time.

Indeed is going downhill, and needs to rethink the way they run a sales floor and organization. They are not competitive in the market with pay, and now not even with culture. Don't be fooled by the game rooms, or fully stocked kitchens. At the end of the day that stuff doesn't matter, and what matters is how leadership is treating you.

- Competitive salary in Tokyo
- Good work-life balance (Unlimited PTO)","- Unorganized, outdated technologies (still using ant / still using Google Closure / Code quality is not evaluated)
- Intransparent management (prevalent favoritism / no clue in how to improve engineering quality from the top)
- Infamously intransparent HR's way of handling harassment cases
- Short-sighted evaluation system (they only value immediate business impact, not engineering excellence)

Some personal experience:
- I got a bad evaluation because of my ""too many comments"" in code reviews. I raised concerns to my manager before making the many comments but he ordered me to add many comments to persuade the author. I just followed my manager's order, but I got a minus evaluation. My acting manager could not point out which specific comments were bad. He told me the number of comments was the only problem. He also asked me to remove a sentence from my self-eval, which went like ""I thought it was OK to make many comments because I was told so by my manager.""
- When I sought help for HR for my acting manager's harassment because I was mentally exhausted, they told me that mental tolerance would differ from person to person so bringing in a doctor's diagnosis was meaningless.
- The tech lead on my team (the same person as the above mentioned ""my acting manager"") stole the credit of my work by creating something that completely overlapped what I was doing. When I pointed that out, he repeatedly ignored my comments. When I reported his disrespectful behavior to HR, HR concluded that he was just hesitant to take communication with me. He didn't get any punishment, but I was sent to a boredom room (another company) by Recruit, Indeed's parent company.
- I was supposed to get a good evaluation because of my high impact work, which I was told so by my manager; however, Recruit determined that the impact of my work was zero, while another colleague who had less contribution than me got a plus for the same work. As a result, I received the worst evaluation (which is called ""Below"").
- Recruit told me that I didn't have ""respect"" for others because I made too many comments in a code review and that I reported my former acting manager's ignorance."

- we are filling the ranks with tons of middle managers who need to justify their jobs and think they need to weigh in on every decision.  This slows things down.
- LTIPs take three years to pay out.  A promotion doesn’t pay market rate for three years.  You are better leaving the company than waiting for your LTIPS.

- Great mission, inclusiveness
- Amazing work life balance","I was very excited about this job because it promised exposure to a wide range of tech stacks and to explore different interests and areas. While I agree if you have very little experience, and this is your first job in industry or you want to try a whole array of different things: 

1. The pay is significantly lower than its competitors. You are doing the work of a front end, backend, and potentially data science work, yet being paid less than the min of either one of the three. There is no stock equity in the company and the LTIPS are not competitive compensation too.

2. Many people are leaving in great numbers because Indeed has grown too fast, there has been more cost cutting in benefits (like the quality of lunch), and simply, because there are better opportunities if you search elsewhere. Ask yourself this: why be called a 'technical business analyst', when you are literally doing the work of a software engineer or data scientist and can command significantly higher salaries and respect in the industry? Here is the unfortunate answer: Indeed calls you a 'technical business analyst' so they don't have to pay you a 'software engineer' or 'data scientist' salary, and often does not consider you to be the same level as one. 

3. Stemming from the previous point - because the hiring bar is lower for this role than SWE/Data Science, the quality of engineering is often times lower than that of a SWE/Data Scientist. Therefore, important impactful projects that have significant effect on the website, that people really care about, are not given to Technical Business Analysts, and rather, the projects you would take on are 99% of the time building internal tools, internal dashboards, etc. if you are lucky. If you are not lucky, at times you could be put on poorly defined projects that are uninteresting and laborious. 

4. There is not much career opportunities, you progress from Associate TBA, TBA,  Product Developer, Product Developer Manager.  If you want to do internal transfers to SWE, it is like interviewing all over again for a fresh SWE position and the transfer is not straightforward - again they consider your technical skills to often not be on par with SWEs/Data Scientists, and you will get crappier lower impact projects as a result

5. Raises are not very easy to get. In addition, the recruiters tell you due to your lowish base salary, to make up for it you will expect higher bonuses (~15%). You have to really work for the bonuses, and often times its more around 10-13% bonus. 

6. Some managers are great. Others are very inexperienced/incompetent."

Indeed's benefits include food - Breakfast and Lunches by an onsite catering firm.  I have seen the decline in the quality of offerings, but food is a huge motivator for some jobseekers.  I prefer to get paid and choose what and where I dine.

The PMO at Indeed is dead.  No movement since February of 2019.  No guidance or directives, no training or support.  The reality is that the ""Program"" side of Indeed wanted to downsize, and discovered that with the bad (unskilled project managers) the best and brightest also left Indeed.  There is a weird vacum of talent and project focus.  Programs are vague and Program Manages typically just monitor team work and jira tickets.

1303,Indeed,One word: Complacency.,2019-08-07,2.0,Search Quality Analyst,"* Indeed's branding is on point.

* The open PTO as well as the free food and booze are pretty great for a millennial just getting started in the professional workforce! They have over-hired over the last couple years so, especially in Search Quality, so take all the PTO you want!

* Lots of people of similar age means nothing compares to the social setting--you'll have no problem making friends with your coworkers and they're a really open atmosphere. 

* They also have a really heavy corporate emphasis on diversity, with countless affinity groups you're bound to feel included somewhere.","Some 'abridged' words of caution for anyone considering a job in Search Quality at Indeed Note that I cannot attest to any other department's experience.

*BEWARE for those who just want any job at Indeed:* Search Quality as a department is oft considered the 'awkward stepchild' of Indeed, something nobody will admit to in the hiring process. If you are looking for a shoe-in at a growing company and plan to eventually transfer departments, I pray you think again. There is no horizontal mobility unless you want to go to QA (for the same sub-organization) or coast until your next outside opportunity arises. Oftentimes other departments will ignore an internal applications simply based on their team of origin. Even then, it is up to the manager's discretion and not truly weighted on one's technical ability, subject matter expertise, or any equitable merit.

Some general takeaways from the experience: 

* Hiring process/Promotions: They both tended to be quite nepotistic. Friends will be promoted while hard workers simply keep doing just that--working hard.

* Personal career development: You will not have any opportunity to grow outside of the canned ""Analyst > Senior Analyst > Team Lead"" path. Total absence of guidelines for internal mobility around the Indeed corporate structure. Self-education is encouraged outside of work only and the internal learning seminars are nothing more than a bunch of engineers/devs showing off some cool things they made that will most likely never be introduced in the actual live site.

* Overall professionalism/job specs: There isn't any formal discipline that 'search quality' can fall under, so the backgrounds in this department range from Art History to Zoology. While that isn't in itself a con, barely anyone has any technical knowhow coming in, despite asking for ""Python skillz"" on all the job adverts. This leads to managers being overly selective in the hiring process, with hopes that someone will help. Meanwhile, analysts drone on day in and day out on highly repetitive tasks that would frankly be more suited for outsourcing.

* Social environment: While the majority of the coworkers you will get along with, a small fraction of hypersensitive employees will not let you forget that you are in the moral minority if you don't think like them. These individuals turn the workplace into an cautious, queasy environment where even the slightest annoyance could land you an HR complaint. Managers tend to sidestep the problem with fear of more HR complaints, this is a negative feedback loop. Seemingly weekly themed happy hours are cool though...

* Management style: Laissez faire management is a tech industry mantra it seems, it works GREAT when your team is inspired by what they do. In reality managers at Indeed have no real top-level direction and typically just take the first idea that gets bubbled up from below. 'Metrics' and 'statistics' are dirty, dirty words around these here parts.

* Last but not least--Salary: Well below average for the Austin area, as well as the tech industry in general. They'll try to doll it up like ""But we have open PTO! and food! and even kegs!""--these things do nothing to detract from the lack of direction and personal growth you will experience taking a job here. The bonus schemes are cryptic and pretty much just rely on how well your team lead likes you any given quarter.

All Indeed truly has going for them is branding."

Sales strategy is as simple as “let’s add headcount and try to sustain 100% YOY growth. No market analysis, no real strategy. Headcount and that’s it.
Zero transparency with regards to sales targets that are constantly changing. Pay structure is also constantly changing 
Some great managers, others who have advanced simply because of tenure and luck

Indeed presents itself to employees as extremely employee-friendly and devoted to good deeds.  There's lots of woke rhetoric about diversity and inclusion, too.

The free food at the Austin (Champions building) office is absolutely spectacular, like living in a Las Vegas buffet restaurant.  The building is full of lounges, sofas, rec rooms, etc.  They even have vending machines that dispense computer accessories for free.  The location is terrible, scenic but far from town with no parking for miles and absolutely unreachable by foot, bike, or public transportation.","bullying, hostile managers spoil the entire experience.  When I had a problem with a new manager, I found that no one in the entire management chain wanted to let me talk about it.  More than one became visibly angry when I tried to tell them  anything, or even ask questions.  This included Human Resources, whose manager seemed to only want to fight with me and shout me down.  Most people will probably never see their worst behavior but at Indeed, HR is not only not your friend--they're your enemy.

Indeed has policies on paper that protect employees against arbitrary treatment, but it's ignored in practice.  

Big talk about advancement when I was recruited was a mirage.  Indeed is currently hiring rapidly but seems to prefer to hire new people over the heads of existing employees.  Salaries are slightly below market.

In-house software:  Indeed's operations are dependent on many weird, idiosyncratic home-made software services that are poorly conceived and  barely documented.   You'll have to learn to deal with these under a management that's far from understanding."

Perks:
-Unlimited PTO 
-WFH depending on the department 
-The people (mostly) and culture are great
-Flexibility depending on department and manager
-Flexibility to do work on things outside your primary day-to-day
-Free snacks, breakfast, and weekly lunch
-Nice office space

Other Pros:
-Top in their space HR Tech/Recruitment Advertising
-A great brand to have on your resume","While those perks and pros are great there are many cons.

Cons:
-Guess what Indeed is nowhere near the only ones that have all the perks I mentioned above. These are standard perks across the Tech industry companies small or big in order for them to stay competitive

-Out of about 50 interviews, I have done(In the past few years)/speaking with others in tech/researching/ETC...... Typically the perks are the same or even better than what's offered at Indeed.

-OH but guess what Perks are the same or better but that's with more PAY as well. 
-Sales & CS workers here are churning faster than butter. Countless people are unhappy and looking for a new gig.

-They are growing (which is great) but to quickly at that. As a result, the quality of the people they hire is getting worse and worse. 

-Management is good and bad of course it depends on the person. However, overall when they promote people they make an extremely long process just as long as making an external hire and you have to compete with tons of your fellow co-workers. More often than not they pick the less qualified person because hey at least we're buds. 

-The CS department has become a joke. The pay is laughable compared to other companies even though as a business they make a ton of $$$$$$. I've seen companies that make way less and pay better. They are treated like dirt compared to people in other departments. All they give you is silly stuff that doesn't matter. A clap, words of encouragement, a pat on the back, these things don't pay my bills this is a major department in a major company, not an elementary school gym class. Not to mention they will basically hire anyone with a brain nowadays. 

-Indeeds rating is trending down........ I wonder why. They used to be above a 4-star rating but as you can see they are going downhill. For a company that preaches Employee branding, this is not a good sign. 

-Did I mention..... PAY their pay is less than competitive especially in the Client Success department. 

Advice to job seekers, if you choose Indeed do your 1 year like me and upgrade to a better company. While I'm sure there are way worse places to work this place is certainly not the best as they want you to believe. Don't drink the kool-aid."

I developed a huge amount as a person through the challenges of working here and this has been a massive pro in my life.","Lots of change, which is natural in a hyper growth business. In my time, they really fell down in transparency and communication. Management has been quite clicky over the last few years and at times no one has any idea what’s going on. Targets can change suddenly with no notice and there can be a ‘shut up and put up’ culture in the sales org. Give people space and time to adjust to prevent them losing motivation and feeling disheartened.
I’m confident that new people in management will drive change in this regard, as they operate differently and want to drive a learning and empowerment culture. 
Huge amount of micro management and a lot of very big egos. 
High pressure environment, it’s never enough (dependent on your manager but 60% of them do work like this)
Though they have accountably as one of their core values, managers accept little to no accountability for their failings in understanding their people or lack of transparency. This is one of the main reasons I chose to leave. I do believe this is one of the best sales team in Dublin but there seems to be a real lack of trust from management in the people they are hiring at times."

3) Unrealistic targets and goals  that are set quarter on quarter and on top of that management keeps changing the KRAs and KPIs, first 2 days it is number of calls , then next two days it is sign ups, if management is confused, how can the reps work
4) The managers are not very ethical and turn a blind eye on how you sell,  ( if you sell correctly, you cannot achieve your targets), they only think of short term quarter  targets and not long term business
5) The management  team severely lack management skills, they have no idea how to work in a mnc or know how to motivate and treat employees

If you want to be bullied and continually made to feel incompetent then apply now!

The Sydney office used to be a fantastic place to work. People were rewarded for hard work ethic and were driven to deliver outstanding results. 

Indeed globally decided to make a change and unfortunately it has come back to haunt them. Top performers have moved on as they could see the writing was on the wall. Originally i was reluctant to write a review however reading some reviews lately (which have been quite clearly been written by senior management - trust me I know) potential candidates need to know that this place is rotting at the core.  It starts at the top with a sales leader who is clueless, rude and arrogant (plus thinks it’s okay to swear at new hires) coupled with a HR team who are “yes” people and keep a blind eye to everything that is wrong with this organisation. 

Reading recent posts saying there is a buzz is in the office is laughable. The only buzz in the office is buzz kill and as mentioned is from the leaders above. This isn’t a good place to work nor will you see any sort of progression. If you want your sales career to stall and watch as Seek continually dominate the market then this place is definitely where you want to be. Senior Management, HR and Marketing are all rudderless and watching the world crumble around them and with attrition at an all time, they have no idea how to fix it (besides write positive posts on Glassdoor who are Owned by Indeed mind you).

If you really are that desperate for a job then be my guest otherwise stay well well clear of this incompetent organisation"

1. You work so hard to get in big deals across the line, only for the model itself to not allow you to reap the rewards.
2. Commission,  forget it - you work hard to walk away with peanuts
3. The culture of the office is in shambles, no music, no talking to each other,  if you are in the kitchen making tea for more than 2 minutes, you will get questioned
4.  Incentives are fun but not when you  land a big deal and your reward is to high-five your team mates
5.  No leadership from management
6.  Senior leaders that swear at reps and use vile language, don't get reprimanded
7. A lot of school yard bullying
8. HR want you to address thing with them.. they probably only want to do that so they can gage what head count they need for all the unhappy reps that are thinking of leaving.

The list goes on....  

One thing is for sure, you will make the business money, but in the end you won't get rewarded. If you feel like free food and health care is for you, then by all means, this job is for you. But if you want a career and make your mark, then consider looking elsewhere as you are just going to waste your time.

Those that have left are in more successful roles, doing what they love and killing it. You can build up resilience by working here.

The positive reviews on here are  not true at all.  I read them and the only people that talk that way are managers trying to salvage what is left of the place. A lot of the negative reviews are deleted as Glassdoor is a sister company of Indeed. The negative reviews were addressed by the senior leadership team and they said that they are not inacturate. Think about it, why would someone bother to write a negative review unless there was truth to it."

1382,Indeed,The negativity has gone with some bad apples... Indeed is back to business as usual,2019-04-03,5.0,Senior Account Manager,"Indeed has only been amazing since I've worked here.  I've been promoted a couple of times, I've taken home some very good commission and bonus, whilst also having unlimited paid leave, catered breakfast and lunch, beers on a Friday, and a higher than average super. We play sports, we get massages, we have trivia nights, we have offsites. There's a lot of benefits.

There's been a bit of negativity so it's worth addressing... We've gone through some changes in the past year, which essentially meant a new Sales Director came in, realised we were firing at 50%, and wanted to get us to work hard and make money. He did this because he is a Sales Director and wants the best for his staff and for the company, not because he is evil, or bad at his job. This resulted in a fair few people leaving who had been along for an easy ride, who suddenly didn't like being told they had to work. It's a Sales job ... it's hard work ...  that said, I make more money than most of my friends outside of Indeed who work in sales, who also work longer hours. It really isn't bad at all.

 Long-term, this is excellent news for us, as we now have teams of people that are enjoying their jobs, enjoying sales, and being nurtured by management to improve on a daily basis.  The team culture is good, the management is now good, and the job is good. We don't have any call stats or KPIs... as long as you're tracking to your number, you're left to your own devices.","It took a bit too long to get the bad apples to leave - which had a knock-on effect on the wider team. It took us a bit of time to get to where we want to, but we're there now.

Indeed Australia is an incredible place to work. Everyone is supportive and wants you to succeed.
I've worked at Indeed for 3 years and they have supported me every step of the way, on top of that I've also made friends for life. As of very recently, they have also offered to pay for my Permanent Residency, which as many will know is a very large sum of money.  There is no favouritism at Indeed, they also backdated this new benefit, and any employee who in the past year has got Permanent Residency will have their fees paid off. This has taken a huge amount of stress away from me, and let me carry on with my work and life.

Sales at Indeed is not easy but is sales ever 'easy'. Recently we have undergone a lot of change, new products, new management, and a lot of unhappy employees leaving the business.

Is this a bad thing, in short, no. People do not like change, and will always focus on the path of least resistance. Unhappy, and more often than not the lowest performing sales people leave the business. 

The good news is, this opens up opportunities, and invites a whole new positive outlook within the Indeed sales team.","At this moment in time, I can't actually think of many cons.

Being ambitious is healthy, however if reps (especially new reps) aren't given the necessary skills and knowledge from the top down in how to try and achieve these targets, everybody loses. This is evident in the quantitive sales performance vs targets for reps across the board. Asking for extra help actually shoots you in the foot because it will be used as ammunition later down the track. A lot of irony in the sense of being micromanaged about some aspects such as KPIs for it to later be abolished due to the realisation of its ineffectiveness.  Also, there was sometimes a feeling of inconsistent metrics that reps were judged upon - nothing was ever good enough!

MediBank","Indeed are losing valuable employees due to their upper managements poor decisions and lack of management skills. Indeed is a great place to work if you don't work within Sales, they set unrealistic targets and regardless of whether or not you are always giving your 110% best they diminish your confidence by saying your not good enough. I have never felt so depressed waking up for work in the morning and knowing I work at a company who doesn't give a crap about how much effort you put in as an individual. 

You have no sense of job security here unless you are smashing your unrealistic which even the best reps could not hit. The commissions are nothing put a few penny's here and there - I made much more at my previous job and I was on a much lower wage base. 

Forget the unlimited annual leave if you are in sales, managers recommend not taking a holiday for more then 2-3 weeks otherwise you will fall behind on making your unrealistic target and again diminish you. 

The way they approach you in your one to one meetings is disgusting, and when your approach HR about the situation they give you a bias opinion because they are friends with the manager and give you little to no advice about how to tell with the situation instead they make things worse and tell you that maybe your aren't good enough. So much for being a supportive company!

Management are so focused on unrealistic things that they forget to actually care about their employees, this is probably why they have a big turnover rate and need to hire fresh new graduates because they are loosing valuable employees.

Let's me just say working at Indeed was the worst decision I have made, the only thing I miss is the team and how great the culture was with them!"

1398,Indeed,So much potential... but....meh,2019-03-15,2.0,Sales,"Indeed is a lot of things. Coming out of college, it was a perfect place to start. Everything about Indeed attracts recent grads - “unlimited “ PTO, happy hours, lax dress codes and plenty of socializing. It has incredible training and they do invest a lot in their new employees. They have snacks at all times, Friday has beer at wrap up, etc. I wouldn’t change this being my first job for the world.","That being said, the real problem comes after 1 - 1.5 years of employment. The shininess of Indeed and all it’s perks goes away, and you see that it is a bandaid solution to keep their employees happy. Indeed has become a churn and burn type of place. Senior management has NO idea how bad the morale on the ground is. Most of the sales job (especially with a closed book in growth) is complete luck. I know amazing reps who had no chance of hitting due to their books and people who are new hires pacing to 150%. These discrepancies are very well known, but nothing is ever done about it. If your book is trash, youre just screwed.

Management is THE DEFINITION of micromanagement. Managers don’t care about how much you close, they care about the KPI’s they need to report up to their bosses. If you ask for help or say a problem, there is no solution other than to make more dials. That “unlimited” PTO is a wash for sales. You will be guilted any time you need to take time off, whether it is for sickness, vacation, or safety. Last snow storm, everyone got sent home BUT sales. Sales was pressured to stay by their directors, and it took all of us HOURS to get home and many got in car accidents.

My biggest issue in general is career pathing. There is NO clear career pathing and an absurd lack of opportunity to move up. You become a Senior Account Manager based on quota attainment, but then there is nothing - and forget about any forward movement if you aren’t a straight white male in the direct employer segment. In Stamford, there is not ONE female director or team lead in the DE-ACQ segment. In DE-growth, there is not ONE team lead that is not a straight white male. Out of 14 teams, there are TWO female directors who came from Account Management. This is 100% an old boys club so good luck moving up if you aren’t an aggressive man with a wolf of wall street attitude in which you want to work your team to the bone. 

Look, it’s not all bad. I met amazing people. My personal bosses were incredible people who respected me and coached me to become the sales person I am today. I made lifelong friends. The training was amazing! But in the long run, it is not worth the consistent stress and obvious favoritism. In the end, all you are as a sales person is a replaceable cog in a corporate machine. 

To all the Sales people working there - don't drink the koolaid. You WILL make more money outside of Indeed. It is NOT the best opportunity you have. And honestly, after the reorg, the money wasn't that good anyway unless you blew it out in ACQ."

It’s evident that unqualified staff have been placed in directorial roles.

Recently, majority of the sales people who added real value to the sales teams, have left. Majority of them taught me how to pitch and be successful in the role. I am aware that none of them wanted to leave, however because of the terrible pay(below market standards) and poor culture they had no choice. 

Feedback: HR ask us to provide feedback constantly, however when questioned about some of the recent resignations and poor conditions in which we are working, it is simple brushed off. In all my years of working in sales in Australia, they are by far the most inexperience/incompetent HR team, I have worked with.


Senior management expect the world from you, when no one is earning comms or a bonus. Everyone is trying as hard as they can but the targets/expectations are unrealistic for this market. Whats worst, is you have people who use to be proud to say they worked here, leaving the company with a very bad outlook of Indeed.

How does upper management except reps to hit targets that do not even mathematically even make sense to hit due to the current spenders, and new spenders coming in. We are being set up for failure.

However it is wrong to make the employees who are bringing in the revenue to feel as if they are not adequate enough, rather than being transparent and providing the proper resources to be successful. Being told to stay positive can only work for so long when people have bills to pay, families to take care of, and lifestyles to maintain that were maintainable prior to all of these negative changes. Management is told to tell us to stay positive i understand the directors are just as stressed and overwhelmed as we are but, when the head of Canadian Sales, tells us to stay positive, and work harder, with no resources behind anything and no promise for a better tomorrow it makes it seem impossible and like we have no other option but to leave and use our skills elsewhere. MAYBE 5% of reps will hit moving forwards both in growth and acquisition, we are not given the proper leads, nor resources to be able to generate the required revenue per rep. And are still expected to stay positive and work hard to attempt to finish and end a race...that is un finish-able and un win-able . Some of the BEST reps at indeed have left the company 10+ within the last 30 days. But lets stay positive right?

Health insurance, good super contributions.

Money was great in the first couple years.

There is one great director in the Sydney office, he was the first Dradis director there. He brought a lot of culture and atmosphere to the place, expanding the team from 6 to 20 people before the restructure. He somehow managed to give support to all 20 of us, which still amazes me. Best manager I’ve ever worked for, he supports his team and is always finding new ways to help them. Something you don’t find in most managers. He really goes above and beyond. If there is a reason people have chosen to stay, it is because of this director. 

There are other directors that are great and look out for their teams as well.

Free lunch on Wednesdays and breakfast every morning, free snacks in the kitchen as well (this has been quite helpful in saving money as most people experienced a 15k-70k decrease in earnings once the restructure happened). People are saving Wednesday lunch for dinner, and breakfasts items for lunch, as apparently they can’t afford to buy their own food on their salaries now.","Unlimited PTO- a myth, if you’re in the Sales sector of the business, you’re dreaming if you think this is happening for you.

For the past year, since the structure change, the sales side of the business, particularly growth, has been hit quite hard. Acquisition hasn’t been quite as bad, but many reps even on that side experience if they have done quite well one quarter, the next quarter their target is made to be unachievable. You have reps that are typically top performers that are at the bottom of the sales dashboard. 

If you are thinking about doing sales here, make sure you are going into acquisition and not growth (you’ve been warned). Acquisition still gets commission and bonus. Growth does not get commission, only bonus (and has to hit a higher threshold than acquisition to get a bonus). With unachievable targets, most growth reps are pretty much stuck on low base salaries at the moment. 

On top of the structure change that never made sense for the Australian market, there is an upper management team that has a poor attitude. Upper management finds it appropriate to swear at staff in front of a whole Monday morning meeting, which brings me to HR. 

HR seems to be biased, as they never asked upper management to apologize to the sales floor after that swearing incident- which would be considered bullying and intimidation (based on the bullying and harassment training they have staff complete yearly).

The mental health of employees is at risk at this place, since the change to the new structure, and new management in the last year, a lot of sales reps have spoken about the anxiety they are experiencing. These are people that have never had anxiety before working here. 

To top everything off, the culture is gone in most sales teams. A place that was once vibrant and a place that people loved to come to everyday, now resembles a silent ghost town. Apparently light music on the sales floor wasn’t a “winning culture”, but now with the silence on the floor, it is more of a “losing culture”."

- fun colleagues
- nice working space","- targets are way too high, doesn't matter what team you're in, you will be happy if you receive a bit of your bonus
- a lot of pressure from directors
- it's never enough
- people coming in on different basic salaries that are totally not fair towards employees working in Indeed for a longer time
- unlimited PTO? don't think about it, it's all in the hands of your director and sometimes totally not fair
- a lot of software bugs
- some teams really mess with clients and give them wrong advise to get the revenue, can't blame them since the targets are high, but unfortunately they get away with it"

1443,Indeed,Transparent Review,2019-01-17,3.0,Account Executive,"Working at Indeed is truly a great experience with a wealth of knowledge to be learned. 
Indeed is willing to invest the time into you in order to see you succeed.
Sales goals are attainable however in the growth org it's difficult to grow a book as large as Indeed believes you should.
Office snacks and drinks breakfast every day and lunch once a week.","Indeed is run as an organization that grew too fast and now management goes by ridiculous metrics to measure their staff instead of what really matters.
Ex. 
Person on a sales team can spend all day talking to clients about things other than closing business and selling and gets celebrated for the amount of time on the phone as opposed to the context of what was being discussed. Whereas someone else can close business in a short amount of time and it gets glossed over because it didn't take an hour and a half to close business.
- Indeed comes up with sales goals for its team without an understanding of what a book of business can actually do and you get yelled at for an account that stops spending although Indeed is non contractual and a 100K spender can choose not to spend the next day.
- Sales teams are measured by number of calls made in a day and anywhere from 60-80 calls are expected and then the same sales teams are asked to do a ton of other work.
- Indeed is lying to itself if it thinks this level of management is sustainable.
- It feels like Indeed's culture has shifted from a fun energetic and for lack of a better word real place to being a factory workforce with robots to drill out phone calls and pray to God their quota doesn't get blown out of the water."
1444,Indeed,Thorough Review of Sales at Indeed,2019-01-16,3.0,Account Executive,"I met some amazing people at Indeed who have truly become my best friends. The benefits are great, they do care about most of their employees. Although they’ve cut back since, the happy hours were generally fun. They keep doing office renovations which are a nice touch. The sales top gun trip was extremely well done at least when I went. I’ve heard they cut back on budget a little since but that’ll happen as a company grows. Fortune 1000 company now so the product is certainly working. Even though they took away commission for most sales roles, you can still earn pretty decent money for an early-in-career sale role. The product is good and is arguably the best in the talent acquisition space.","Nowadays in sales at Indeed you are just a number. The most metrics driven company I’ve ever been a part of or heard about. Depending on your department you’re either required to make 60 or 75 calls a day. Don’t worry though, everyone fakes calls in order to do this and the managers know. Most managers will micro-manage you and be on you about metrics like calls, demos, emails, notes, etc. The product is great like I said above but the talent acquisition space is very crowded and the barriers to  entry are extremely low. Competitors undercut Indeed all the time and for a lot of job postings, any source will work. Indeed’s model is cost per click, sounds great in theory but nobody knows how their flagship bid optimized product works so it’s tough to explain to clients who really want to know. Also, there are no contracts at Indeed so you can sell a huge deal and they can turn off the next day, happens all the time. Also clients will churn because the product works and they make all their hires which also sucks. Turnover was abundant mainly because Indeed hires some really suspect sales people in my opinion."

The pay is great and it has all of the benefits of a tech company (ie. tons of free food, big events with open bar and catering, very inclusive culture, flexible schedule, no dress code,  couches/ rocking chairs/ standing desk, gyms, work out classes, etc)
The health insurane is fantastic. My husband is a veteran and works for DOD and still uses our benefits. They cover things like fertility treatments- 3 rounds of IUI & 2 rounds of IVF

It is important to get to know the manager as much as possible during the interview and find out their style. Most managers are completely lax on work from home/ flexible schedules/ time off, etc. There are some that are a bit more micromanagers. Also, some products are managed extremely different than the bulk of indeed.

Clients needing help with their accounts either call, email or chat us and previously there were distinct teams to handle each type of these inquiries. Now, everyone is rotating and taking calls some days, chatting and sending emails other days. This change has made life at work more hectic, stressful and disorganized, however, this transition is brand new so many of us are still learning the new processes and procedures and management is probably still evaluating, re-evaluating, and working out the kinks as they go. I am still confident this is a great department, great team and very worthwhile job to have.

Product - great product overall, however a lot of bugs and little information about how it actually works so mostly you make up something to explain it to clients. 
Daily work - most boring and one dimensional sales: call, call and call more. Even if you know the client is not interested and you have nothing more to offer. If you do bad, it is your fault, never the book, lack of support etc.
Client management - we always say that we are consultants and not sales people, but accounts get reassigned so often that you can not build a trusting relationship with the client. 
Work with other departments - very bureaucratic, but people in the teams are actually nice and also struggle with their own problems like CS and finance, who have not enough people to cope with all the assignments. 
HR - never believes you or to scared to do anything. Manager who poison entire teams are kept in the company, which increase turnover rate.

I have seen people taking PTO every month and not getting any work done at all, but that is accepted as it's the employee's freedom to decide when and what to work on.

The managers say that it's an open and safe environment, but in reality there is no transparency and no freedom so say what you think. I was told not to point out problems unless I have a solution ready. That is the same as saying ""you can't ask questions unless you have the answer."" It does not feel like a safe environment when you get criticized for asking questions.

The evaluation system is not very fair, as it gets heavily influenced by the opinion of the managers. Even if the whole team gives you positive feedback, if you don't get along with one manager you will end up with a negative evaluation.

There is a problem with harassment as well. There have been sexual harassment incidents but the company failed to take any action to prevent this kind of problem from happening again. Overall it is not a safe environment to work in, especially if you are a woman."

Pay and bonuses are outstanding. Many great people working there.","I was subjected to the dreaded Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) after just 7 months at the company, then was let go a month later. Quarterly reviews are nice to gauge your standing, but I never realized how quickly you could be cut loose if you don't meet expectations in your first 2 quarters.

How did that happen so fast? Because my team was all about fast: speed was their primary focus; I was expected to code fast, and I simply wasn't fast enough. (Never mind the fact that I delivered almost zero bugs while I was there...) I never got an explanation as to WHY speed was so important, either. There were no deadlines, no imminent sales demos, nothing I could see that would demand such speed. As far as I could tell, it was all about being fast for fast's sake; in other words, bragging rights.

What was most upsetting was that I was a remote employee, and I had no direct management guidance or mentoring during my tenure. I was just expected to know how to do everything, and if I didn't know, learn quickly. I wasn't quick enough.

The atmosphere felt very unsafe. I didn't feel like I could fail, because the failures would simply be recorded and used against me in the next review. I didn't feel like I could ask for help because it would just highlight that I wasn't up to par with their standards. I was very much on my own, and for a remote employee, this is death; there is no chance for success.

I honestly question the monetary decision of investing so much money in hiring a software engineer only to let them go less than a year later, especially without any mentoring. Even after my managers realized I didn't know as much as they thought I did, they didn't see any reason to grow me into the role. When you make billions of dollars a year, I guess you can do that.

My advice to future Indeed software engineers: know your stuff before you sign on with Indeed. You won't last long if you think they'll help you ramp up."

I value these reviews greatly and want to give an inside look for anyone considering this role. Your jobs is to make 60 cold calls and be on the phone for 100 minutes every single day. Due to these forced metrics which I think are necessary it causes tons of bs and fake dialing for all reps. There is a lot of fluff and faking demos,props, calls and even money brought in. I think Indeed is a great employer who compensates fairly and gives out a ton of free food which is nice. Making 100k is very doable and most people on the growth side are at least at that level regardless of skill. A lot of this job seems to be luck as the people you are calling know how to use the platform and just have to sit back and hope they spend. 

I think its a good role to consider and I do not regret my time there.","There are about 50 people gunning for 1 manager opening and many people have been at company a long time. I would say maybe 1% of reps actually move into management.

Do not let the big brand name fool you. I know it's great working for a big name company but you need to be prepared for what the job entails.  They want an army of people. If that is not you do not work here you won't be happy because of the stress of trying to follow suit. You have an hour to hour schedule. You have task after task. They ""try"" to not micromanage but they will forever hover bc how they have designed their sales process to be inefficient. 

People walk around here looking stressed. People barely talk throughout the day because of all the issues in sales that burn them out.

1)CRM is archaic
2) Lead generation is archaic and completely unorganized  

The metrics are not designed to solely help you sell. They are designed to show productivity fake it until you make it productivity. It could be a lot more simple and effective. 

 Leadership does not fix issues that are ongoing, they are not willing accept people who inquire for improvements and are capable to question things to implement change.  Again, they want you to be robotic and if you can't do that you will not be happy. Indeed seems to be focused on culture, well not sales, they do not encourage culture in sales.  They do not care about budgeting for events they want you to hit your 70, 80 dials and do all the backend work in spite of how noticeable it is walking by someone and see their face burnt out. We should budget for sales to feel more connected to one another after all the hard work that only sales people understand."

Working at Indeed is like that. 

I joined Indeed, excited about the growth and what the culture appeared to be. Every relationship has that make-it-or-break-it point at 2 years. I should have seen it then when the promises of transparency and ""commitment"" to diversity and inclusion had yet to be realized, but I toughed it out because I loved Indeed and I wanted help it win. That was dumb. 

After spending more of my best years here, more promises have gone to the wind, and when asked about said promises, leadership acts like they don't know what we're talking about, gaslights us, or gives us Trump-like responses (combining random words in a sentence that, together, mean nothing at all). 

Moving internally is more streamlined than I've seen at most companies. This is coupled with pretty decent professional development and educational perks to make a successful transition. However, when people move from roles that are typically in a lower salary range to one in a higher salary range, their salaries are rarely adjusted. It seems like a ploy to get cheap labor. 

We're an HR company and we can't figure out how to do HR well. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Companies are looking to us for answers and we should be able to provide solutions, but HR has every excuse for not innovating internally. Instead, HR talks about ""matching"" other companies. We should be a thought leader in HR. Other companies should not be teaching us how to do this. Sad. 

I've been turning down advances from other companies, with the hope that Indeed would one day get its act together and show appreciation for me and all the other employees who are fighting for it. The perks, Open PTO, WFH, and professional development budget were nice, but other companies are offering me that and can actually communicate. They tell me what my salary range is, don't make excuses for not hiring qualified women and minorities into senior leadership, and actually let go of people who are incompetent and/or make others feel uncomfortable to the point that they don't want to show up to work (read: harassers, sexists, homophobes, racists, and the like). The fact that Indeed can't let go of people who are actually negatively impacting value is very strange to me.  Like, you're a business and you're losing money and productivity for these people. 

I've sort of enjoyed the time we've spent together. I've heard this from experts over and over again, but I didn't listen. I put my money on potential rather than steps toward action or even a real plan. Never again.

The management are rude, arrogant and unprofessional and all promotions are based on favouritism rather than actual merit. And if management don't like you, be prepared to work twice as hard as your colleagues for absolutely zero thanks and/or praise. So many talented people have left in the last few months due to feeling unappreciated and undervalued. The environment in my team is toxic right now and the team leaders couldn't care less about morale so long as we continue to perform and  hit the extremely high targets so that they look good. 

They expect you to make 100+ calls a day and are trying to literally wring every last drop of blood, sweat and tears out of their staff during the working day, until you are exhausted both mentally and physically.

When the issue of poor morale is acknowledged, we are simply told to get over it and if we don't like how it is then leave which shows an appalling disregard for the concerns and mental health of hardworking staff members! We are reminded that we are replaceable at every turn.

While I have a lot of constructive criticism below, my experience at Indeed was invaluable. I learned a lot about the industry, gained a majority of my professional experience, had a good amount of professional training that was offered by the company and made some wonderful lifelong  friendships. My feedback below is in hopes to help make Indeed stronger in areas that I would love to see them improve on for the sake of their current employees and the overall success of the company.","I joined Indeed several years ago when it was not a well known company. Understanding that as a company has significant growth, it's going to change, I am still saddened by the direction Indeed is headed. 

There are many reasons Indeed is a strong competitor in this industry; primarily being it's large share of traffic compared to it's competitors. I always loved sharing with my customers the many perks Indeed offers for free over it's competitors.  However, in the past year or two, I've seen Indeed take the wonderful perks and monetize them. In addition, it seems that Indeed is also starting to use some of the pricing models as our competitors. While I understand some of the reasoning behind it, I feel like there are drastic changes that are so far from what Indeed was as a company and what we always said set us apart from our competitors.

Indeed always had two core products, resume and job for many years. In the past few years, they've rolled out so many product to dominate the market. However, this fast progression is concerning when things are rolled out too early, leaving customers unhappy and your support teams having to be the face of the company in messy situations.

I would love to see Indeed hire more experienced talent to help build a stronger foundation. Most of the higher level employees are in their positions because of the length of time they've been with the company, having luck with being in the right place at the right time, or due to favoritism.  I think the company, especially the San Mateo office, can use a stronger foundation in hopes that this will help with retention. The turnover rate is extremely high which can be disheartening to a team when it's constantly losing team members. There seems to be a continuous cycle of team members leaving, causing the rest of the team to have a heavy workload while managers frantically try to hire quickly and train a new hire to help lessen the workload while their team is drowning. At some points in my career at Indeed, it became embarrassing to take on an account from someone who had left and introduce myself to a customer knowing they had probably gone through several CS members in a short period of time while we were back-filling the former rep's position.

I would also like to take the time to acknowledge the CS teams in San Mateo. While most are young - I would say that a majority of them work their butts off to do  the best with whatever situation they're put in.  My wonderful team members are what kept me at Indeed for as long as I did and was the sole reason that made it hard for me to leave. I would love to see the company make changes to their compensation. Especially for the Bay Area, Indeed is not competitive. We are constantly told that Indeed does market research and their compensation levels are competitive.  I just don't see how this can be true. While they once used to negotiate salaries, it seems that starting a couple years ago they moved to a model where if you are going for X role, you can only make up to $X.  One of the reasons I chose to leave was due to compensation.  After being promoted a few times, I knew that based on their new salary model, I was already making above what the promoted role would offer - therefore, I really couldn't make any more money at Indeed. I know this because I saw this happen to many of my tenured colleagues. I think this may have changed shortly after I left, but it's hard to see them lose top talent by not being flexible and taking into consideration your experience and how much it would cost to have to hire externally, train someone and get them up to speed. I don't see how that can be cost efficient, especially when you're losing top talent with a significant knowledge base that is truly priceless."

They basically work you to death till they spit you out to hire some other young person who doesn’t know what they are doing. Oh and unlimited PTO is a joke too. It is not. It is basically just an out so they don’t have to pay you PTO when you leave. And will only approve your PTO if you are a favorite, so unless you suck up, don’t count on it. THEY ARE CHEAP! Oh and here is a big secret. Don’t put your two weeks notice in until the day you want to leave. They ask you to leave that day, with 2 weeks pay, which is nice. But if you leave before the quarter is over you WILL NOT RECIEVE ANY OF YOUR BONUS!!!! Not one cent! I saw someone put in their notice be sent home that day, end of quarter was  1 week away and they did not pay bonus because they wouldn’t let him stay to complete the quarter!!

1567,Indeed,Great Company to Work For - But There's Work to Do!,2018-05-31,4.0,Sales,"All in all, Indeed has been an amazing place to work over the past few years! I've learned so much, and work with passionate colleagues who are now many of my close friends, all with a common goal of 'I Help People Get Jobs.' Sales is a busy job, but Indeed definitely incentivizes their AEs to work hard and go green. We have a happy and committed salesforce and support teams.

Pros:
- Open PTO 
- Great work/life balance; if you work til 5pm, you are done at 5pm (at least if you are a non-exempt employee)
- Successful, fast-growing company (grows consistently every quarter & year); job stability ties along with this.
- Parental Leave (16 Wks Primary Caregiver; 4 Wks Secondary)
- Great Product (Sponsored Jobs) that work, and clients love
- Breakfast in AM, Lunch on Wednesdays
- Gym at the office, and barre/yoga classes
- Good compensation; great health/dental benefits
- Fun, young, fast-paced work environment","As Indeed grows, the start-up culture and family feel is starting to dwindle slightly. We are becoming metrics obsessed, and Sales and Client Services always feel the pressure to hit numbers, rather than truly strategize and service our clients. In Sales, they micromanage the AEs, and gradually are removing flexibility (WFH is frowned upon, some Directors don't allow much PTO.) We're starting to lose sight of our mission, and risk losing top, tenured employees. It is also more challenging than advertised to move internally for promotions.

Also, it is very upsetting to read here that people (esp. women) of color feel marginalized. Indeed prioritizes inclusion, but there needs to be more men & women (of all backgrounds, ethnicities, sexual orientation) in the C-Suite and in Leadership to shift the male-driven environment and inspire women to thrive and succeed."

The employees are losing their benefits as the lunches offered to the Client Service teams are being taken away.

The leaders are genuine and open and the staff are smart and grounded. I've been very happy with the pay here, and the quarterly reviews are detailed and executed with care. The company is very focused on its mission to Help People Get Jobs and we do 100 different things to remain the leader in that. I believe we are succeeding. The company is growing quickly and has resources to spare on problems that are worth solving. You will hear some complaints about disorganization and growing pains and these have validity, but I believe they come as a by product of Indeed's huge success and rapid growth. The parent company Recruit appears to give Indeed the right amount of autonomy to do its job, while also giving us access to more resources, especially internationally. Indeed is a very global company and deeply engaged with trying to win in every market around the world. Some are going great, others are challenged. There's a wide variety of challenges to work on here and they all make sense in their own way and all add up to helping people get jobs. I really admire Indeed's commitment to do what's right for Job Seekers, even when that is in tension with Employers' needs. And I see that commitment being lived out daily. I really like working here and I hope I am able to stay for a long time.","The dev teams are strong and the leadership is strong but the middle layer of the company needs improved organization. There are sub-organizations within the company but mine does not appear to have a strong identity and a strong sub-mission that rolls up to the company mission. Quarterly rhythms can be behind or messy - too many spreadsheets and wiki pages for tracking goals and such. I think essentially that middle management is feeling the brunt of light-speed hiring growth. The company has absolutely ballooned in size - even employees sometimes ask in all hands whether we are hiring too fast. But, having been at other companies that are unable to hire or who have hiring freezes due to cash shortage, rapid growth is, I would say, a good kind of problem to have. It creates many opportunities for people with initiative and ambition to work independently, achieve great things, and climb based on their success."

My role was fairly flexible, I could work from home if needed.","I've been working at Indeed for almost four years now, and it's continually changing for the worst. 

There were some mistakes made early on with hiring and promotions, and that resulted in the CS department having a lot of people in Management roles who are fundamentally unqualified for the job. This is having a knock-on effect on everyone else in CS. 

Promotions are often given to people with the right connections rather than the most qualified candidate. There's then little support for new managers, other than some state-the-obvious trainings from HR. 

Indeed haven't kept salaries competitive. There's a lot of people who are unhappy with the salary they're getting, particularly given the increased cost of living in Dublin. Indeed's attitude seems to be 'take it or leave it'. Naturally, the good people are leaving Indeed and going to companies that'll pay them more. 

A lot of the perks are nonsense. Unlimited PTO sounds great, but you're not going to get much more than your contracted 25 days. The idea is that, so long as you're meeting or exceeding your targets, you can take additional time off so long as it won't negatively impact the team or the clients. There were times when my team had precious little work to do, with very few people off, and I still couldn't take additional time off. 

You get a performance-related bonus each quarter, but they keep changing how this is calculated, so I've been getting less and less each quarter despite having the same or better performance. 

The systems we use (custom crm, even the indeed website itself!) are full of bugs and get in the way of you going your job. They've been 'fixing it' since I started and they're only now getting close to using a proper CRM. 

Indeed create a great image on linkedin and other sites, but the reality is very different. If you're low on work experience, Indeed might be for you. Otherwise, take a look at the Best Places to Work and focus on the companies that are higher on the list!"

Be prepared to get your work reviewed every rung of the way up to the top of marketing only for it to get completely scrapped at the end, wasting months of time in middle management churn.

The reps are required to hit 60 dials and/or 150 minutes of talk time. This seems achievable however there a many obstacles that make this very difficult i.e customers emailing with account questions, conversations with client services, internal meetings, team meetings, account research for meaningful conversations, documenting in the CRM everything you have done, etc. 

What is the result? Most reps fill their numbers by making fake dials, sending generic emails, calling phone numbers that they know will never be answered.  Further this results in a sales process that is more laborious, transactional, and ineffective. Reps who have to endure through this soon get burned out, or are really good at gaming the system. 

Open PTO as mentioned in my ""Pro's"" is not really OPEN PTO. It is just a marketing gimmick used to attract candidates. Any PTO you would like to take off needs to get approved. If you are not pacing to hit your quota you will not get approved because you are behind, not doing well, etc. If you are performing well, pacing to hit quota you can still get denied PTO for various obtuse reasons.

- Free food, snacks (although not all offices have meals and honestly, the quality is lower than other tech companies)
- The work honestly isn't too hard, but that's because we're not doing anything with a grand vision","I've on a team that, like almost all of them, has been rapidly expanding over the past two years. We've hired nearly 90 people, including several managers. Out of all of those people, they've promoted exactly one person to management. The rest of the managers have been external hires. This has caused the current group of managers to be woefully unfamiliar with the skills needed for daily work and the culture of the company. This is a development team, and honestly, except for one or two people, I doubt anyone in management can actually code.

Which wouldn't be a problem if they were there to be guiding the strategic vision of the team, but they spend most of their time plotting against each other rather than actually articulating the direction. When they finally get their crap together enough to create a Powerpoint, they speak in vague tones about roadmaps and plans, but these never come to fruition. Meanwhile, our technical debt continues to grow and there's no clear process about how to fix it.

Indeed does not grow its people. They may move you through levels, but don't expect these levels to correspond with anything resembling more responsibility or participation in the strategic vision. The levels are arbitrary and meaningless. 

Also, if you do find yourself taking a job here, make sure you strongly negotiate your salary on the front end because raises are pitiful. I've received multiple promotions and have been here two years and total I've only received a one digit percentage raise. They consider Cost of Living adjustment level raises as equivalent to promotion raises. Meanwhile, I know there are people a level below me making 25% more than I am and I know there's people at my level making even less than I am. There's so much talk internally about pay bands but don't expect any transparency about what they are. That's because they're completely arbitrary and don't make any sense. This lack of clarity is a recipe for disaster regarding pay discrimination and I hope they get called out on this sometime. Also, don't hope to go to your manager to fix this because in the weirdest business decision I've ever seen, they don't actually know what you're paid. Your boss' boss doesn't know what you're paid. Only certain people, somewhere unknowably high in your hierarchy know what you make."

Working for Indeed was the biggest waste of time. There is NO opportunity for growth and MAJOR lack of communication throughout the company. They preach about being #1 and providing the best opportunity for job seekers and companies looking to fill positions but in reality they do not care one bit about helping others. They will take a business's money and without alerting the business they will take down their ads for absolutely no reason and not reimburse that paying business customer...they just hope that the business doesn't notice. 

Indeed only allows legitimate businesses to post ads through their site and will delete/remove a company from its site if they find out otherwise. Don't get me wrong, this is a great business model and idea theoretically but Indeed does not go about this in the right ways. They do not look into any business they take down in a professional manner and get annoyed if they have to deal with a confused, angry customer wanting answers. 

Long story short, DO NOT WORK HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY MORALS. They have hugely questionable ethics and no morals whatsoever."

The website still looks like it's out of 2006 and competitors are passing them by on a daily basis; Google is now in their space and has innovated more in the last 6 months than Indeed has in the last 10 years. I guess it's a little difficult to innovate when all you have is a copy-cat version of google but just aimed at job search. The company is also filled with 22-25 year olds. I would argue 85-90% of the company is under the age of 30.
1662,Indeed,Indeed does not care about black people.,2017-12-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Open PTO (dependent on department), flexible schedule (dependent on department), free snacks.","I have so many things to say about how Indeed treats their black employees and few of them are good. Let me start by saying, I have worked at Indeed for many years and I have yet to meet another black person who doesn’t feel similarly to the things I will say in this post. I will also say, there aren’t a lot of black employees at Indeed, so if you’re black and looking to join Indeed, don’t expect to see anyone that looks like you and don’t expect the company to listen to what you have to say. Because we are the smallest minority, Indeed disregards us in favor of more “popular” minorities. 

First and foremost, every single day, black employees have to pretend to be someone we’re not so we are easier to digest for the vast majority of white people that run the company. That means, we oftentimes have to water down our personalities so we don’t come off as “too much” for the white people we interact with. For example, if we push for our message to get across, we’re aggressive, not assertive. If we question a decision, we’re uncollaborative, not inquisitive. If we tell our manager we disagree with them, we’re uncontrollable, not providing feedback. 

We have to work three times as hard to be considered on the same level as white employees who don’t care about their job. We also have to be hyper-aware of our emotions and how we are being perceived because we are always one mistake away from being labeled an angry black wo/man or a ratchet hoodlum. It’s truly exhausting.

Second, I would guess 90% of managers at Indeed have never interacted with black people before and have developed their understanding of black people and black culture based on what they see on TV. In turn, they make assumptions about our interests and how they think they can relate to us. Most of which are grossly wrong. 

On top of that, managers are never taught to manage different types of people, so they manage how they want to manage, instead of how their employees want to be managed. Keep in mind, a majority of Indeed employees are referrals. Who do people refer? Their friends and network. Most Indeed employees are like-minded people with a frat-boy mentality who are incentivized to perform better with promises of happy hours where they can get “white-girl wasted.” Also, because most of Indeed’s employee base consists of these types of people, they’re more likely to become managers and work their way up the ranks. 

Imagine being a black person who didn’t grow up with a frat boy mentality. Imagine being managed by a person who only knows how to socialize and interact with those types of people. Black employees do our best to shift the way we work so we fit in, but at what point will Indeed say enough is enough and be okay with accepting us as is? Why are only black employees changing how they act to fit in? Shouldn’t managers be doing their best to cater their management style based on the preferences of the employee? The company really needs to invest more time and money into diversity management immediately.

Third, the company refuses to acknowledge current events that affect their black employee base, but are quick to act when a more digestible group, for example the LGBTQ community, is affected. I am writing to let Indeed know that your black employees were and are still scared from all the deaths that happen in our community, the protests against us, the vocal hatred of us simply because of the color of our skin. We wanted something from you, an email, a note, something. You didn’t even have to address the entire company in a message to us. You only had to talk to us, your black employees. 

It breaks my heart to say Indeed was and continues to be silent and pretends that what happens in the world of black people, doesn’t affect Indeed. Newsflash: if it affects your employees, it affects Indeed. 

Fourth, our company is scared of the word “diversity” and only wants to focus on the word “inclusion.” Fine, but how do you get to inclusion without there being a diverse employee base? I have seen with my own eyes new offices open up and immediately get filled with all white people. Those were opportunities to build diverse (excuse me, inclusive) offices from the ground up, but of course, Indeed failed to realize that. No matter how successful Indeed sees those offices, to me, they will always be a failure because they are not reflective of the diverse work force we’re supposedly trying to help get jobs. 

We spend a majority of our time at work. Do you know how frustrating it is to be surrounded by people who don’t look like you for 40 hours a week? Do you know how frustrating it is to worry that you can’t relate to anyone on your team because your tastes in music, TV, activities, are vastly different? Do you know how frustrating it is that jokes you sometimes make fall on deaf ears because they didn’t grow up black and can’t relate to or identify with what you’re saying? For white people, you don’t know how frustrating it is because you are the majority at Indeed. 

Fifth, and my final point, Senior leadership seems to only focus on women when they define any issue with inclusion. They have made it one of, if not their main, priority in attracting a more inclusive workforce to Indeed. While I am all for women’s rights, as a black person, it is incredibly disappointing to see the company prioritize one minority over another and pitch it as more important. Indeed has also never officially recognized blacks as a minority. In speeches, Senior leadership has mentioned a lack of women, initiatives with LGBTQ, but nothing about blacks. It’s like “black” is such a sensitive word and they’d rather dance around it than come out and say it. 

I will say, people love working for Indeed, and I truly want to be one of those people again. I used to be, but my pride in this company has dwindled so dramatically over the years as my voice, and the voice of other blacks within the company, are ignored. When Indeed asks if I would recommend a friend to work here, my answer is always a firm “no.” My friends are black and I would never suggest they join a company where they will feel isolated, unwanted, and easily replaced. 

To my fellow black Indeedians, I STAND WITH YOU AND I AM PROUD OF YOU. I know Indeed is scared of saying that so I wanted to make sure you heard it from someone who recognizes you for who you are - a strong, resilient people. 

To Indeed, I know change doesn't come overnight. However, actions speak louder than words, and your lack of action to make black employees feel included speaks volumes. 

To those reading this that are considering working at Indeed, there are a few managers who I wholeheartedly enjoy working with and interacting with. Unfortunately, the poor lack of action of Indeed as a whole outweighs the positive experiences I've had with those managers."

Good central location in the city. Nice office","Where to start. I wouldn't wish the treatment here on my worst enemy.

When I was first indoctrinated into Indeed I was super excited about the new job, as is everyone. This quickly wears off once you're sat at your assigned desk in the open office. The tech start up vibes are well and truly a thing of the past, and what's left is a phoney culture of ""helping people get jobs"", maximising profit by hook or by crook.

Which ever director you get sent to when you join the business will decide your fate. I can agree with the other reviewers here that if management don't like you, you are done. You will be bullied.

They all attempt to cloud the call centre atmosphere on the sales floor with fake banter, hitting the gong etc and then shove numbers down your throat. 

There is also a tradition of pushing people out of the company by sheer bullying tactics and  It is DISGUSTING to see. 

All Account Executives get given leads. These are employer accounts that have been created for free and who are posting jobs. Our job is to sell the premium package. Easy right?! You cannot prospect leads or search the CRM for accounts.

On the direct employer acquisition teams certain individuals will get better leads than others and some will receive nothing but fast food takeaways on Bournemouth beach. This is literally no joke. Sadly this is only one of the many issues with the lead generation. I'm sure it's company wide. Another seriously frustrating problem with the lead gen is that you will find that many of them you call are being worked by other AE's under different duplicated accounts  and confusion is stirred over who gets to keep what etc 

If you make comments about the lead gen, you will be dealt with. The business deny that any favouritism goes on and insist that we are being randomly assigned them but everyone knows there is something more sinister at play.

At the end of the day if your leads are bad then you will not do well or even hit target. This is how Indeed manage their staff if they want them out etc. The directors will also take spending accounts from individuals and give them to others if they think that the individual will not get more out of them. This may sound fair enough but when they cannot prospect their own leads and rely on incompetent lead generation, this leaves people short and hits them in the pockets.

Cowboys.

The product of PPC sponsored jobs/ featured employer that we are selling has to be one of the biggest scams I've ever seen online. It's all a completely overpriced gamble. If you want to be absolutely rinsed as a client, then sign up. The free service works just as well if you repost the ads once a week/month and there is no way to flag users that do this. Frustrating because 90% the main users do this and we are powerless to stop it. No body wants to use the sponsored jobs and very few clients get a decent return on their investments. 

There is no contract either so the clients that do spend money can stop at anytime. And they do eventually, they all do. 

To combat this your director will demand that you have a back up plan, obviously. But  inevitably the churn wheel just goes around and around. It's unsustainable 

The directors simply regurgitate orders from senior management (who haven't hit target all year) and make themselves look busy. They have no experience in management outside of Indeed.
Many of them are narcissistic and arrogant and will micromanage your every move. 

Micromanagement is a big big problem here. It gets to the point where you will literally be looking over your shoulder. Expect to make 60 calls and 120 minutes of talk time as a minimum KPI. This is achievable but unnecessary. You will be shocked to see that again some individuals, regardless of circumstance, will be able to skimp on these and others will be reprimanded for not hitting them everyday. 

Unlimited holidays is another giant lie they tell you to brew excitement at interview stage. This is just not true. I have taken less holidays here than any other job I've had. Reason is that you simply do not have the time and the targets are a stretch to say the least. Your dictator will not approve holidays if you are slightly behind or if in their humble opinion have not given enough notice.

Squeeze squeeze squeeze. 

I'm currently seeking other employment as I cannot bear to work here anymore.  Between the sickening  favouritism and the micromanagement, I think..... I'm sure I will be happier somewhere else and you will be too."

1694,Indeed,Welcome to high school,2017-10-04,3.0,Client Support Specialist,"- Great office location in central Dublin
- Unlimited PTO
- Good-looking office
- Snacks","Work: Indeed is lagging behind other tech companies with an outdated CRM and numerous outages and bugs that affect the user experience. The overworked Sales team rules this office and everyone else is just there to support them. They are great at patting themselves at the back for going double green, even though a lot of that revenue is generated from free credits to dissatisfied customers. Micromanagement is the way to do it there and all other teams bow to Sales' requirements as they are the ones who bring in the money.

Culture: If you are looking to start your career in a semi-professional environment and have an easy life, then Indeed is the place for you. This is a company where relationships determine how far you go in your career and that is valid for every department here. Managers play favorites all the time and you will never get a promotion unless you are somebody's bar buddy.  No one from the US is overseeing any part of hiring and promotions here, which results in having groups of friends who have been in the company for a while promote their other friends. I know of people who are running a referral side-business, basically using their connections with hiring managers to push their own people in and get referral bonuses. 

No one in Indeed will care about the job being done well more than about their own well-being. If managers and directors are comfortable in their roles, why would they disrupt anything or improve the way things are done? This results in them also hiring and promoting people with a submissive mentality who never challenge authority. The constant calls for providing ""honest"" and ""anonymous"" feedback are just a cover as I've had honest constructive feedback come back to haunt me and severely damage my chances at growing here. Once management doesn't like you, you are done.

Salary and benefits: Indeed pays below the average salaries of its competitors and they don't even provide free lunch every day (only on Wednesday but, if you are in Client Services, you also get lunch on Monday and Thursday ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )


If you are looking for a job that challenges you, gives you interesting projects to work on, managers who develop you, coach you, and care about you, or a professional working environment that you can take seriously, stay away from Indeed at the moment.

If you miss high-school and the rumours, back-stabbing, relationship-centric environment where sucking up to the right people is the only guarantee for success, you'll fit right in. Welcome to Indeed."

You can gain exposure to many different departments, secure financial support for continuing education/classes, attend conferences, and have the opportunity for lateral movement within the company if you so desire (can be difficult). Overall, Indeed supports its employees' careers, futures, and wants them to be content (*complacent). 

Senior product leadership is exceptional. The president is a well-liked, natural leader.","Indeed does not pay well in comparison to other tech employers in Austin or outside of it. Additionally, if you're not in Engineering or Product (who are also underpaid) you're a second or even third-class employee. It all depends on your degree of separation from the tech core. Everything will reflect this from your paycheck, to your desk size, its location/the general environment of your department, to how you're treated by other employees. 

Additionally, Indeed moves infuriatingly slow and is generally reluctant to take risks. Aggressive expansion seems to be the blindfold strategy with an inefficient segmentation of goals that are not aligned between departments."

If you are in an office there are great perks like gourmet food, lots of company fun and events, good culture. Great benefits. Bonus plans. Unlimited PTO. I enjoyed my time here and feel it was a great place to have on the resume.","Upward mobility for women is desperately lacking. They were just voted a great place to work for women. Why?  Because of a generous maternity policy, I would assume.  They didn't even mention women in their write-up about it which is exactly appropriate for the situation. The ranking is smoke and mirrors. There are no women in the C suite and the smartest VP's leave for the C suite elsewhere. There are lots of men who think they are really smart, and most of them are, but the smartest leaders are the ones who admit and act upon diverse solutions. 
There are women on the service teams and a few other departments who are promoted and very few ""friends of the family"" who they know they can control. Women in sales who have moved up recently had another layer placed over their head. They are now pretty much at the same level they were but with even less power because of the additional male-dominated team put above them. Talk about a rock and a hard place. 

Tech teams are untouchable even when a client has valid issues. This creates unbelievable expectations on the sales team to keep the client happy, with no power, while your quota and livelihood is tied to this insanity.

Everything operates in a shroud of mystery. They intentionally keep departments away from each other and their favorite word to a client need is ""no"". Be prepared for more NO than you have ever experienced before. It took me 4 months to figure out pricing because there is no pricing. It is ""what can you get out of your customers"" which is why I think this shroud exists and quite frankly, working.

Bonus plans are paid instead of commissions.  In the beginning, this seems cool, until you realize that for the amount of product you are selling, it is very subpar to industry standards, you can't help but realize you are being bilked.  Especially when there were bonus bumps after ample service but they seem to have been done away with that with recent management changes. Last note on bonus over the commission structures that most salespeople are accustom to. Commissions are protected by law, bonus payouts are not.  This means that as soon as you sell something on commission, you are owed that commission by law.  Bonus is never required to be paid out, they will use this to their advantage and not yours.

Base Pay: good when you 1st evaluate it.  Once you get in you realize they are paying less experienced, worse performers, more. My assessment is because they are male. You are ""forbidden to discuss pay rates"", though by law, you are allowed to and it is illegal for them to tell you that you can fire you for it.  Look it up! They can be heavily fined for this practice if someone decides to go after them.  Hello Lilly Ledbetter!

Unlimited PTO:  Again this looks great on the surface. Who wouldn't want that!?! It is actually a catch 22.  It is very enticing until you want to use it. When I put in for less PTO than I had taken the year before unlimited PTO change, I was chastised for abusing the policy. It all comes down to your manager.  Additionally, if you accrue PTO, when you leave, they have to pay that out to you.  They do not with an unlimited plan.

Goal setting: An unspoken mystery of how they produce your goal for the quarter.  Supposedly with ""algorithms"" and other voodoo magic. The rumor is the finance team does it- like they have any clue what your clients will be up to that quarter. Then it is handed to the sale managers where they have the liberty to adjust the number to each member of their team. (I'm not sure even they know how the initial numbers are produced. ) Soooo the top performers are almost always getting exceedingly high expectations because they work themselves to death to hit them and the not so top performers barely grow their territories. At the end of the quarter, both top, and not so top, are paid almost the same bonus with a few percentage point changes to make it less obvious... It's awesome... yeah right.  
Sales industry norms are that teams hit quota 65-75% of the time. Anything more is too easy, anything less, too hard. At Indeed, if you don't hit quota 100% of the time, you risk going ""on plan"". Another recent development since management change this past year. They use this form of punishment arbitrarily.  If they like you and you keep hitting 90-95% of your goal, your cool.  No worries.  If they don't like you and you hit 95-99%, you could be in trouble or made to feel unwanted. Which as salespeople know is usually the same end result. Recently, a manager really liked their employee but senior management decided it was their time to go.  He intruded on the relationship until the employee had no choice but to leave. Good times!

Work/life balance: If you let it, Indeed will work you to death. If you don't care as much and everyone really likes you, you can live it up fairly cush and just keep hanging. I worked so hard, and everyone really liked me, and I really liked them, but I just couldn't do another year of it. They pushed me until I broke, because I cared, exceeded my goals, and was the positive life of the party.  Unfortunately, as soon as you start to feel less taken care of by your employer than you are taking care of them, it's hard to get back from burnt."

The managers demand that you sell the highest end product for every situation, even if the company only needs 1 hire.

Most people will stay in the same job most of their stay at Indeed, or will be offered a symbolic senior promotion, which is actually not a new position, but will just bring in a little more money for the same job. I believe Indeed should provide proper opportunities for their staff to grow and no try to sell fake promotions to their staff as the greatest opportunities. 
Besides the aforementioned lack of opportunities, I have seen new positions being opened up, and subsequently withdrawn after an offer was made to internal employees. This is due to the fact that the senior management in the U.S. lacks proper communication skills. Most of the decisions of restructuring are made within the realm(s) of their office, without informing the affected departments. Subsequently, these departments still under the impression of business as usual create new positions or introduce other new guidelines. Even though the senior management is aware of this, they still do not communicate. This will inevitably result in people becoming disillusioned. 
Thirdly, I have witnessed on a number of occasions that major decisions are introduced by the senior management on a really short notice, e.g. 2-3 weeks before it has to be implemented. Usually the team leads do not know what is going to happen until the last minute. For instance a few months ago a structural change was announced in the sales department 3-4 weeks in advance, without providing any details. This causes a lot of confusion and frustration amongst the staff, resulting in unnecessary pressure and stress, since people do not know what is going to happen to their salary and bonus. Also the team leads were unable to answer their questions since they are left in the dark as well by the senior managers in the U.S. 

If you do not care about career growth, incompetent senior management, and if you are happy to do the same job for years, this is the place for you."

Many snacks, free food for breakfast and once a week for lunch. Wii U in the office, Mario Kart. 

Depending on where you are coming from, Indeed can be a great place to build your skill set. If you hone in on certain aspects of the role, you will become much more marketable in the Bay Area after working for Indeed. 

Convenient location right off of 101 and 92.","Favoritism is the biggest issue the San Mateo office has. Certain people get more support and resources then others. This is fine sometimes, but everyday it gets old quick. It really depletes from the culture, and when the wrong people are promoted, it looks like this favoritism is actually driving the direction of the company culture. 

Indeed says its a company interested in feedback from employees, but this is not actually the case. Expect gas lighting, and expect to be a ""yes man"" and nothing else. Not only will your feedback go unheard, it can often count against you later. General processes are also ill communicated between management and teams. 

There is almost no advancement within the San Mateo office because there are only two departments that sit there. While Indeed will tell you that it cares about your career and your advancement within the company, I have seen a very small percentage move up internally. I saw far more qualified people rejected for internal roles. 

Don't get too excited about Unlimited PTO, this is entirely up to your manager. 

In case if you didn't know San Mateo is also regarded as a satellite office. It has long outgrown the space that its in, and there seems to be no real effort to give more space to the employees there.  You can expect very little attention to this office from the organization overall , its a blip on their radar, which is sad because it used to be a top performing office.

Internal communication is horrible, you can expect 3-4 emails daily about product changes that were probably rolled out weeks ago without any communication to the teams that actually work with clients directly. Different departments have conflicting goals so it's hard to work cross-functionally.  Training varies greatly across departments as well.

There’s a lot of emphasis on “career development” in Client Services but unless you want to do a basic customer support role forever, you really aren’t going to learn much or develop any new skills because the product itself is so simple. The career pathing “programs” they have to offer are mostly just basic trainings that don’t have anything to do with being more strategic at your job, or personality quizzes that are a complete waste of time. They also tend to promote people into newly created positions that are essentially the same role just a different title and not much more pay -- speaking of pay, Indeed does not negotiate salaries and has a confusing bonus structure. In Client Services, bonuses are essentially determined by your manager and they can be as biased as they want. 
 
Indeed tries to present itself as an innovative company where everyone’s voice is important but this is definitely not the case in every office. Feedback is not encouraged and if anything you’re likely to be called out for voicing any kind of critical opinions, even though there are clearly many things that aren’t working. There’s also blatant favoritism among managers who regularly gossip openly about other employees. In general the culture is very petty and unprofessional and this doesn't seem like it will ever change - -they would rather let dissatisfied employees leave than try to change any of the internal issues. The sales department especially tends to hire employees straight out of college and the HR dept is barely developed so the work environment is very childish and inappropriate. This can be fun for a while but it definitely gets old. Ultimately I would not recommend anyone waste their time here."

1778,Indeed,Growth Opportunities Lacking & Poor Office Morale-- But There are Snacks!,2017-05-12,1.0,Client Support Specialist,"If you are the type of person to be distracted by perks such as snacks and monthly happy hours, Indeed is the place for you. 

When I first started, I had a genuine love for Indeed's mission and I believed that our company had its employees/clients/job seekers best interests at heart. For example, the work/life balance at Indeed is great, and there's healthcare coverage! The maternity leave here is awesome, and there are some outreach efforts to impact our surrounding community. There is also a portal dedicated to internal mobility-- but the reality of internal growth opportunities is less promising than presented.","If you're not in one of the main office branches, you can't expect any personal development or career openings for further growth. Additionally, you may have a Manager/Director who will tell you that your feedback is valuable, but will in turn negate any feedback you share; no matter how tactfully you’ve presented it. In some instances, feedback given has been used to negatively impact employees during quarterly reviews. This kind of gaslighting is disappointing, but it's what you can expect if you plan to work in the San Mateo office. 

Further, there is blatant favoritism amongst Managers/Directors, even to the point of promoting less experienced Indeed employees to senior positions. Given how political the office culture is, it's starting to resemble high school as opposed to a professional working environment. Managers will often be involved in conversations that are inappropriate for a workplace, and given the corporate structure, there is little that can be done without repercussion.

If you're interested in switching departments, or further developing from the role in which you begin, this is likely not the place for you. It seems to me that Indeed relies on its brand name to attract new talent and indoctrinate new hires into believing that Indeed values more than just its bottom line. In reality, when employees find that this is not the case and leave, this never-ending cycle continues to perpetuate. Many of our most senior employees (3-4 years) have already left Indeed for this reason-- including a CS Manager, who helped influenced the San Mateo office in a positive way.

- Snacks/ free meals/ happy hours.

- Various trainings available.

- The salary and some perks (e.g. work-from-home opportunities).","- Open-office environment (not suitable for introverts).

- Air conditioning system (always too strong).

- Never-ending office construction cycle.

- Bonus scheme in this department is not standardized. 
It is based on the 'I am the manager, and I will decide' model.

- Office management 
They have poor administrative skills (lots of issues, mess, etc.).

- HR 
You will never get any proper assistance from them. They support the management team, and just want to get you out of the door with the smallest amount of noise possible.

- Recruitment/ hiring process is inconsistent. 
Some people are hired externally, though the job gets never posted. 

- Call Center Atmosphere
The client services department moves towards a call center environment (phone call targets, etc.). 

- Unlimited PTO
This was an ephemeral pleasure.

- My team management was terrible. They:
1) fail to practice fundamental workplace ethics on a daily basis, 
2) take care of their personal targets/ interests only,
3) have a small-minded approach and like to micromanage, 
4) make spur-of-the moment decisions.
A great deal of their unprofessional behavior goes unchecked and unrecorded in any file.
Once I stopped blindly nodding 'yes' to every new idea they came up with (no matter how irrational it seemed to be), I experienced the most unprofessional, unethical, and mean-spirited behavior I have ever seen in my life. 
They (my direct manager and the director of the team) did everything to force me out of the company:
1) They started treating me as if I suddenly turned into a silly toddler.
They blamed me for all their little failings like the lack of respect and communication with the team, discussing some work-related topics with my colleagues (e.g. constantly changing targets, fatigue at work, etc.).
2) They limited my ability to use company perks like work from home and any spot in the company (e.g. in the meeting rooms)  for no reason.
3) They did not allow me to work on any project I proposed for no apparent reason.
4) They reduced my bonuses by 30% and 50% two quarters in a row, though all my targets were met.
5) As a result, they wanted to make me go through a 30-day personal development plan. 
At that moment, I decided to quit. I sent the 'goodbye' email to my colleagues. To express regret at my leaving, the director of this team sent an IT request to get my email removed from the system, so to hide the nature and consequences of their incompetent actions. 
I managed to resend this email to my colleagues."

1802,Indeed,The worst boss I have ever had ruined a potentially great job,2017-03-28,2.0,Job Cataloger/Search Quality Operations,"Benefits, catered lunches, nice building","I would have gladly traded every free lunch, every free snack, and every day of unlimited PTO for a genial, approachable team leader as opposed to the nongenial, wholly unsupportive, unapproachable, abrasive, snarky boss I had. This jerk could have written, produced, directed, and starred in Horrible Bosses 1 and 2 (and any other sequels). I understand she is no longer with the company. Good. I'm sure the office is more pleasant now. Too bad that she didn't leave before I got there.

I needed some ramping up to help me learn the processes that Indeed used for their job cataloguing efforts. I asked my boss to sit down and work with me for a little bit on this. She refused to do so, even after she expressed her displeasure that I wasn't up to speed with the processes, claiming that it, and I quote, ""isn't my job to teach."" Excuse me? Then how do you expect me to understand the processes? I wasn't asking her to teach me to use a computer, and this wasn't something I could just look up on the Internet. I was asking her to help me understand the processes so that I could be a more useful team member and do well at my job. And if it isn't your job to teach, it should be considered your job to help ensure that a team member is trained properly. And if that is too much to ask for, you shouldn't be in a supervisory role. It is mind boggling and beyond comprehension that this was refused. Even the worst boss I had prior to this jerk didn't refuse to help me get up to speed on what was needed to do my job well. This horrible excuse for a boss did teach me one thing though. She taught me what a truly toxic work situation was all about. I had never been in such a situation before; hopefully, I never will be again.

That said, I observed teams and team leaders around me, and they seemed to enjoy genial chemistry and were having fun. I wish I would have had one of those team leaders rather than the jerk of a boss I had. Any of them would have worked with me to help me get up to speed, and that would have made for a great job."

Managers send emails in all capital letters when the team doesn't hit goals. Recently completely changed the compensation structure.

Here is review of Indeed as a Company in Hyderabad office. You will always be working on your comfort zone. If you're a married guy and you want to work in a government type of firm go ahead but you want to learn and grow in your career then its a big NO.

Company has no risk appetite they want you to keep working on same thing over and over again. They will face same situation like yahoo who always thought they are genius and perfect on what they do, nobody can lead them & see today.

1826,Indeed,Austin Recruiting Team and Indeed as a whole,2017-01-20,5.0,Recruiter,"What it is like to work on recruiting team at Indeed Austin

First of all, Indeed is an amazing company to work for. I personally feel like my work matters and I am not just a number.  I feel I am a valuable employee pushing this company forward and contributing to its growth.

Team - Our team in Austin is very collaborative and everyone is here to help one another.  It is not a cut throat environment by any means. Yes, we have big goals, but I feel like my manager is realistic when reviewing my performance. If I have a certain number of hires to reach and I do not, we take a look at what challenges I was facing that quarter, whether it be with difficult reqs, candidate pipeline, or tracking down feedback.  It is not just black and white, I feel like the quality of my work is valued just as much as the quantity.

Systems - We recently moved to a new ATS which, as expected, caused a few hiccups.  There were massive amounts of candidate records and data that had to be transferred and scrubbed clean. The new ATS is quite different from what we were using before and it has taken some time for people to adjust.  The good news is that a lot of processes have been streamlined (i.e. offer approval, interview scheduling requests) which is a huge win for everyone.

Career progression - This has been a hot topic on everyone’s mind. The way I see it - ask yourself how often are you expecting to be promoted or how long have you actually been with the company to deserve a promotion?  Most people are still relatively new to the organization (except for a few), yet everyone wants to know when they will be promoted. To this I say - prove yourself, get your tenure in, and the opportunities will come your way.  Work hard, do excellent work and you will be recognized.  There is proof it happens as one of our Sourcers moved into a Sourcing Manager role and one of our recruiters is going to Dublin to manage a team there for a year.

All and all, I love Indeed and our recruiting team and there is no other company in Austin I’d rather work for.",We are still working on customizations of our new ATS and it sometimes slows down some of our work but we will figure it all out one way or another.

1855,Indeed,Would recommend to everyone,2016-11-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The biggest pro is Indeed's tendency to promote from within.

I was always treated as an adult not a cog in machine. I was given what I needed to accomplish my work and was never micromanaged. This was sometimes challenging as I was in a satellite office and not the HQ, but it was still a great perk. Talking of Perks, the SF office is competitive with the best our city has to offer--- and the Austin office outshines many of the places I have been in SF. The quality of everyone I worked with, from the top down was beyond compare. There are some very smart people in all the offices I visited. Finally, the commitment to Data Driven work, in all work areas is unparalleled with any other place I have been, including Wall Street Fortune 500s","Growing pains, growing pains, growing pains.

1870,Indeed,Learn & Burn,2016-10-19,2.0,Account Specialist,"- (Most of) the people
- The perks (snacks, food, sponsored intramural sports, happy hours, holiday parties, etc.)
- The feel of a ""fast paced tech environment""
- Good Training & Development (T&D) program 

Overall it was a good work experience learning the recruitment advertising industry.  Indeed and competitors have played a major role in shifting the old-school mentality of Human Resources and Corporate Recruiting.  It was exciting to be a part of it, and experience the beginning of their now massive corporate growth.  Indeed was fast paced and fun, with a young environment and tons of perks.  You're able to bond with your co-workers, both inside and outside of work, and forge great relationships.","- The Management Team
- Favoritism on Promotions / Politics
- Simplicity of product leads to feeling inept 

The product is (for the most part) a ""one trick pony"".  Once you have attained a certain Indeed skill-set and working knowledge, it leaves you wondering ""What's next?""  To add to that, the management team of Past, Present (overheard from co-workers I know are still at Indeed), and (likely) in the Future is very much your typical high school clique.  1:1's were filled with drama and gossip; management making false promises on growth and promotions or career trajectory; or taking ideas and using them to their own benefit.

At the time I was there, the company went through a major overhaul, and the entire Small Business (SMB) tier went through a re-brand, which I believe was necessary for the better of the business, but it lead to many peculiar and strange promotions.  This led many to believe there was strong favoritism among the masses.

That's not even mentioning how some of the management team behaved in social settings.  I witnessed management swipe serious employee injuries (influenced by corporate funded Happy Hours) under the rug.  I had seen senior leaders engage in altercations with bar patrons at the local bars (which by the way are flooded with Indeed people every night of the week) -- these two occasions among many others."

The perks are great. Between benefits and the company outings/happy hours, it's a great environment. 

Indeed is growing quickly and is very profitable.","- Every manager is homegrown from within which leads to a ""groupthink"" mentality. What worked 4 years ago when they were selling may not be the best strategy today but there is no outside influence to tell them that. 
- Incredible amount of micro management focused mainly on metrics rather than the content
- Indeed preaches its perks and forward thinking workplace yet it is an act of god to get permission to leave half an hour early one day even when hitting your numbers
- Awful homegrown CRM that is disorganized/always breaks and is not maintained. This leads to garbage lead generation and inefficient processes. Should've upgraded to salesforce long ago and now they are in too deep
- Focus on hiring more and more people rather than looking into how they can make their existing AEs more efficient. Investing in sales software to streamline the outreach would go a long way for existing AEs
- Successful AEs take a pay cut to move into an enterprise level role or a management role just so they can escape the inside sales environment.
- The system that manages the campaigns is designed in Indeed's favor and will manipulate the campaign in Indeed's favor, diminishing the value the client sees. This is done just so AEs and teams can hit their quotas."

That means you're going to work hard and be rewarded for it. Regular communication from senior leadership is helpful, with quarterly announcements and Q&A. We really are spoiled (in a good way) in the Austin office, and employees seem to be treated well with perks in other offices. 

You can't beat our mission, to help people get jobs. There is a plethora of Indeed t-shirts that you collect over time and I wear them often on the weekends. Almost every time I go out, I hear from at least one person who got a job using Indeed, which is a great feeling.","There's so much growth that it's hard to keep track of the new people, systems and processes. Many different internal systems and programs are confusing. That also means that communication is tougher and there's a lot of it from leadership, HR and facilities.

Expect to be constantly connected, they love taking advantage of younger employees who don't know any better both in terms of workable hours and pay.  Certain departments are disproportionately compensated but they've corrected this problem with new hires in the last few years creating a huge compensation gap between old & new.  Many older employees are stuck there knowing they can't move on without taking a pay cut.  Once the company was sold off to Recruit, everything went downhill.  Upper management loves to take credit for original founders' successes, rarely take into consideration their own employees.  If you like doing kegstands every thursday, this is the place for you!"

Directors do not grow the people on their team they just shove more metrics down their throats and think thats going to get the company where it needs to be.  Metrics do not close deals, smart selling does and this company does not understand that and simply treat sales like a glorified call center.  

We moved to a much better PTO system yet if you are in sales you are questioned for any and every day requested no matter if its two weeks in advance or two months.  I'm pretty sure that is illegal.  Where is HR?"

- Upward mobility

- Great bonus/Commission system","- Your director has a lot to do with your outlook on the company, can't exactly control that"
1947,Indeed,Churn Shop,2016-03-26,1.0,Account Executive,"Happy hours are a nice touch, casual clothing and the proximity to downtown Stamford is great. You really never meet with clients face to face so you can literally roll out of bed and walk into work.","As a sales person it is extremely hard to do your job without an appropriate lead generation system in place. Your measured on whether you can make 60 dials in a day, rather than the actual content of your work. Since Indeed works with no contracts; there are accounts that spent with me for months that I was never paid commissions on because the client decided not to pay their bill - so I got burnt despite closing and nurturing these deal(s) for several months. 

80% of the directors have egos the size of Texas and will remind you of this every-day/minute/second of the day while micromanaging everything you do. If you show up to work a minute late be prepared to be repremanded and scolded about it. I once tried to leave at 5:59 (one minute early) and my director coldly stared at me and said where are you going?

I replied; going home and he told me the day doesn't end till 6:00 and proceeded to tell the rest of my team that he just ""big timed"" me, while laughing. It is also customary for directors to call out specific teammates in front of the entire team; this is there way to ""motivate"" us. I also witnessed a director pulling up a former employees picture on LinkedIn and proceed to belittle and make fun of this person because of what he looked like; he also made sure to call the entire team over so they could laugh as well, even though most of them looked visible uncomfortable with the situation. 

There is ZERO HR presence whatsoever, you can get away with everything and anything. There are nasty rumors spread about people everyday. And a lot of the AE's will drink at the local bars during lunchtime and I'm not talking about one beer; but rather more like 3-shots of whiskey and 2-vodka seltzers, then proceed to go back to work without anyone questioning them. 

This may sound extreme, but it is very much the truth. The CRM is horrible and malfunctions at least 4-5 times a day, the phone systems are equally as horrible - when they would make us go on 1-hour company wide call blocks it would take 5-7 times calling a particular number in order for that call to go through because Indeed's current bandwidth cannot support so many calls at one time; thus really taking away from the call block. 

ZERO diversity in this company, if you are over 24-years old, your viewed as ""old"", I see women constantly getting sexually harassed as well and in front of their directors. Why do you think Indeed has such a large hiring initiative now? Because for as big as they are growing; they are still losing a lot of talented people who are leaving for better and more professional jobs since there is nothing in terms of career paths - they promote you to ""Senior"" AE, but your still performing the same job functions as you would as an AE."
1948,Indeed,Account Executive,2016-03-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free Snacks, health Insurance etc. Lots of people of similar age.",Call centre environment. Aggressive management. Very poor CRM system built in house. Different reps often work different accounts for the same company. Often times you could have 3 or more reps calling the same company! Office politics all the old reps have all the good leads.  Unlimited holidays but sales managers hesitates to give even one day off especially if you are behind your target. Used to be fun at the start but not anymore. Sales targets have increased a LOT which is putting a lot of pressure on reps and turning the managers into aggressive dictators.

1955,Indeed,Great Company,2016-03-03,5.0,Search Quality Analyst,"*Management*

-Recognizes and rewards hard work and dedication.

-Great culture and mentality comes from the top down.

-Employees are entrusted to get their work done without someone constantly looking over their shoulder. Micromanagement simply does not exist in my department. I think this comes from the practice of hiring people with good personal responsibility.

-Transparency. Employees are updated on the state of the company regularly.

-Personally, I feel like I've experienced tremendous professional growth in the time I've been here so far. This is a direct result of working with a great manager.

*Work Hard / Play Hard Mentality*

Lots of events in and out of the office. Voluntary all night Hack-A-thons with music and food where co-workers get together and think up / build anything they want. (Anything from new work tools/ improvements to filmed movie spoofs, hand made DDR arcades and drones. You name it! The pool of talent here is amazing.) People will zip by on scooters in the office. Competitive and fun pool and ping pong tournaments. Trivia happy hours. It's a great/fun atmosphere, you get the idea.

*Great Work/Life Balance*

-Unlimited PTO means you don't have to worry about running out of accrued time off when something comes up. Use it responsibly and you're golden. 

-The company encourages healthy lifestyles outside of work. Employees often get together for marathon runs / rugged maniac courses, etc.

-Flexible schedule

-Affinity groups for co-workers with common interests to get together outside of work.

*Close Knit and Diverse Community of Co-Workers*

You'll meet people from all over the world here and likely make more than a few friends across departments. This is especially true in the Search Quality department. Never have I worked with a more diverse and interesting group of people that work so well together. Really remarkable.

*Education / Training*

-Outside of normal coaching, classes and seminars are available on a variety of topics including effective communication techniques and building leadership skills.

-Tuition reimbursement program

-In response to a previous review: Training in the Search Quality department is not done in a class setting (at this time) but via hands on, one on one, sessions with leads / experienced co-workers. The team generally hires individuals who are able to quickly grasp new concepts and run with them, so there's not a lot of hand holding. If a new employee is having difficulty, additional coaching and training sessions are always available.

*Other Perks*

-Coffee and Juice bar. Smoothies, juices, lattes, espresso, etc. made to order.
-Large game room with pool tables, ping pong, foosball, shuffleboard, pinball and more.
-Huge variety of endless snacks and drinks. All the Topo Chico you can drink.
-Fully staffed cafeteria providing free breakfast and lunch daily. Sandwiches made to order. Menu changes daily and there are plenty of entree and side options for people with/without dietary constraints. I have none and was able to sample some octopus the other day at work. Not bad!
-Craft beer on tap / rotation
-Nice gym on site, complete with regularly scheduled yoga and cardio classes.
-Comfortable ""common"" areas with sofas and arm chairs. Great for collaborating with co-workers or just working away from your desk for a while.
-Beautiful courtyard for eating / working outside and enjoying the weather in Austin.

- Lack of trust with Managers.  Anything you discussed with your Manager confidentially or in private, was immediately discussed with the other Managers in your group, as well as other members of the ""team"" that the Manger hangs out with outside of work or knows from high school.  This is probably because half of the Managers have no formal training and have never been managers or have management experience prior to Indeed. 

- Favoritism is HUGE here - even if you deserve a promotion, you won't get it if one of the favorites are up for it.  

- The Internal CRM is absolutely terrible and would always break/shut down which just meant more work piling up for you to deal with later 

- Very cult-like environment.  You need to drink the koolaid in order to advance.  Oh and don't be a minute late to work or you'll get in trouble!

Indeed is nothing but a revolving door of bright eyed college grads who get hired under the illusion that this job will help elevate their career and that Indeed is such a cool place to work. Yes, they have happy hours but thats it. It's work work work and party. Most of the execs have coke or pill problems because that the only way they can get through the day. There is no coaching or development. It's clear cut...come in hit your quota party and go home. It's a glorified frat house where everyone is having sex with one another, doing drugs, etc. I don't know how they haven't had more law suits honestly. I would highly advise anyone especially a woman to steer clear of this place. Don't believe the positive reviews they are mostly Indeed employees who get incentives to write positive reviews to offset the negative.

At the end of the day, you are just a number; you get a number assigned to you when you start and when you leave all you are is a number.

- Great healthy snack options and delicious catered lunches.","To put things simply, Indeed is a place where the ends justify the means. Rules are consistently thrown to the wayside by AE's and Directors turn a blind eye. 

While on a sales call, you're conditioned to think about what's best for you as a salesperson. Not the client. Not the jobseeker. If someone turns you down, you'll be asked to call them back again and ask why- you're to question their honest responses and disrespect their requests to cease contact. And when you move on from that opportunity, another AE will give that client a call right away, with the same script in hand. 

As you could imagine, this leads to a place where our clients do not trust us- some have a new 'dedicated rep' each week. With no pricing information available anywhere else but on the phone with an AE, clients are naturally defensive and closed off. You will get hung up on, screamed at, and threatened. 

Most AE's close deals to fill their quota with little regard to how the campaign will perform. Churned business is an issue.

Besides being expected to conduct a high volume of calls, you'll be tasked with a variety of chores that do little to help your bottom line- things like running reports to give your director information that he/ she can easily compile on their own. 

Everything listed in the CRM is either a bad opportunity, or someone who will hang up as soon as you tell them where you're calling from. We're told that there's a quality team that works to ensure all information in the CRM is accurate and organized- though oftentimes you will pick up an account that is a duplicate, or somehow otherwise taken. It makes getting through your day very difficult when the platform is unreliable. 

The culture is dissatisfactory, at best. To start, the dress is meant to be business attire/ casual business- a rule that somehow doesn't apply to ladies in the Summertime. In addition, you cannot comfortably attend a company event without the pretense that there will be excessive drinking/ bad behavior. There's a collective frat-boy attitude towards every function in which you'll see your team mates drunk- Directors as well. Off the phone, clients are mocked, made fun of, and talked about- with plenty of expletives. There's no restraint here in what's supposed to be a professional setting. This can make it very difficult to network, and have pride in your work. 

In addition to that, I haven't come across many people who enjoy themselves in this role. It's understood that the lifespan for someone in this role is 1-2.5 years (before burnout or failing to meet a quickly inflating quota.) In fact, most are biding their time until something better comes along."

We are a large part in making sure accounts run smoothly, campaigns are set up correctly, and upsells are happening for key accounts.

Indeed is a decent place to start a sales career. You will be expected to be at your desk from 9-6 M-F making 60 cold calls a day.  Regardless of attainment to quota or how many deals you closed that day or week, you will need to hit 60 calls. No exceptions. For someone starting a career in sales, Indeed will push you headfirst into the world of cold calling and provide you with a very structured day to day. THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.","All promotions in the sales department are a result of tenure and not qualification.  This leads to micromanagement coming from the top down. For someone entering the company who is not an entry level account executive, this can be overwhelming. Although the micromanagement is very obvious it doesn't lead to as many people leaving as you would think because entry level AE's don't know any better."

There is a ""no office policy"", meaning that  directors, managers, and executives are sitting right there with everyone else, allowing for ease of communication and high transparency.","While culture is great company-wide, the sales side ends up as more of a boys club...very much a fraternity or sports club atmosphere. The sr. director's and many employees attitudes towards you (professionally and socially) are completely dependent on performance. Great when you are doing well, not great when you're in a rough patch.
Indeed also preaches of inclusion and employee retention, but that really applies to everything but sales positions. There is no horizontal movement for those who seek an opportunity outside of sales, and upward mobility is reserved only for those at the very top."

2023,Indeed,"Good first sales job, but not for experienced reps",2015-06-08,2.0,Account Executive,"They do like to promote from within, usually, however it is not the rule.  If  you're into free snacks and what not, then you'll be quite happy. If you're fresh out of university, this is an excellent job for you with a much higher than usual first job base salary. The sales training is good and will set you on a path to a strong sales career in the future. If you are an experienced rep, stay away, this is not for you.","First things first - if you're an inside sales rep the odds of making six figures are slim to none. Even the highest achieving reps make nowhere near that. Based on the average base salary of the team ($35k - $45k, depending on your negotiation skills), you would need to achieve almost $2MM in sales per year to reach $100k total compensation. 

Commission varies, with 5% paid out on the first month of a contract, then dropping to 2% in each subsequent month. If you're able to double a client's spend, it leaps back up to 5% for another month, then back down to 2% and so on. Also, after a client has been on the site for more than one year, you lose all commission going forward, yet remain responsible for their spend against your budget. With most clients billing at 2% commission and the average sale being $3k to $5k per three month contract, you're hard pressed to make that $100k

You are responsible for sixty dials a day, that's 6-0 phone calls, every day - no excuses or 150 minutes on the phone.  There are no territories and if you fail to close a client within 60 days, any other AE can (and will) steal the account. Example: if you have a client that is willing to come on at X amount, 90 days from now, a competing AE can request the account and close the sale as you failed to do it within 60 days, in spite of having notes suggesting a start date later in the year.

The title of ""account executive"" is also misleading. The inside sales role is, essentially, a call center job. While there are opportunities to advance, there are hard and fast rules on how you can advance."

If you are 1 minute late and have been working there for 1 year and never been late before, you will get pulled into a conference room and yelled at (seriously, it happens all the time).  Everyone parties every night so they can forget about how miserable they are during the day, so everyone is hung over all the time.
If you like being absolutely micro-managed, Indeed.com is the place for you to be.  If you like being brainwashed into thinking Indeed is the best place to work, you will love it there.  Making 70 calls a day to HR people is brutal; you literally have to be smiling and dialing from 9-6, and if you don't stay until 6:30 and come in by 8.30 everyday, you get yelled at.
Sucking up to your boss will be the only way to excel within this company-I was a huge suck-up and I got away with tons of things people that were professional did not.  You will have ot prospect for hours and hours outside of work hours (you aren't allowed to prospect during the day), and every company is taken at this point, so you will find nothing.  There is no support from leads handed to you, although you willl be told 'they are coming, don't worry, they are coming'....they never do, or are TERRIBLE.
Managers have never been managers before and have no idea how to even run team meetings.  They are terrible at motivating employees, and the only way they do is through fear that you are being fired.

Sales people bang the phones, and are encouraged to be dishonest with their clients in order to squeeze more money out of them.  With no lead generation in place (READ: no lead gen function in place) and silly daily activity metrics, reps are expected to spend an exorbitant amount of time outside the office prospecting.  This also leads to a lot of heavy competition/stealing of leads from colleagues.

Promotion/advancement is a result of favortism; this place is a boy's club.  Management is not there based on qualification, but really entering the company at the right time.  As growth slows, these windows of opportunity will close, and it will become even harder to retain talented employees."

2) All you do all day is annoy businesses on the phone. Most of the time your generating your own leads as well because there is basically no leads given out to the Account Executives, so its impossible to meet the quota of 60 calls a day.

3) Just don't work here. Trust me. You didn't get a Bachelor's to make pointless calls all day and be treated like garbage. Don't trust the positive reviews for Account Executives.

Training in Connecticut.

Career Plan - there is a career plan structure in place. Work hard and you can move up.","Micromanagement - a lot of it.

Quality of work - Certain markets should not have whole teams devoted to them. Management should do some market research and apply varied targets across different teams rather than blanket targets which see certain teams excel and while others crumble, not due to their selling capability but the market in which they are confined to. 

KPI's - 60 calls a day is not achievable - the time people waste trying to get to this number takes away from quality work they could be doing. It also seriously crushes employees morale - sort it out or people will leave. 

Training - The training, albeit in Connecticut, is poor. It is done by people who have never sold anything before. The training should focus more on selling points of the product and have practical interactive tasks rather than 5 days of tedious lectures."

During my time at Indeed, I worked hard, did my best to build good relationships with my peers, and did my best to remain positive among all of the turmoil in the California office and company as a whole has had.  The perception is that the environment in the California office has gotten bad over the last year or so, but the reality is that it has always been that way.  The turnover has been an issue since the birth of the office.  It is my strong opinion that it is a mistake to think that this environment has been created by the lower and mid-level management.  The reality is that a big cause is the poor and disconnected upper leadership.  

People feel intimidated when resigning knowing how mid-level management will react.  Leadership openly speaks poorly about reps that leave, even the reps that were top talent and worked hard everyday.  Luckily those that have made the decision to leave drive away feeling relieved and that a toxic weight has been lifted off of them physically and mentally.  Indeed continues to scratch their heads and question ""why are you leaving?"".  It is insanity.  To continue to treat people the same way after it has been more than clear that it doesn't work and yet expect different results.  They are in denial that a person may actually want to leave to work for a better company culture, regardless if Indeed is looked at as a superior product.  Fortunately, the bay area talent doesn't have to settle for Indeed's poor culture and mediocre pay.  There are tons of companies out there with great products and most importantly healthy, strong, and positive work environments."

2084,Indeed,The truth lies somewhere in the middle,2014-03-25,3.0,Account Executive,"The reviews on here are very skewed, most bad ones are by disgruntled employees who couldn't hack it, and most good ones are ones that management asked interns to write (you can tell by the generic and contrived language).  Here is an unbiased review of Indeed:

I worked at Indeed for about 2 1/2 years in the San Mateo office and recently decided to leave when my maternity leave was up (probably outing myself here).  I left not because I was unhappy, quite the opposite.  But I crunched the numbers of what I would be making coming back and having to build business again verses what I would need to support my new family, and it just didn't add up.  I also felt stuck professionally since I had stopped believing that I would ever be able to move up at Indeed, no matter how well I did (and I did pretty well).  I would have gladly taken on more responsibility if they had given me the chance.

  Most of the bad reviews on here I would have agreed with a year ago, BUT management has made a big effort to improve employee morale once they found out how unhappy a lot of people were. Outings and team building events are big here and I think management tries to nip most morale issues in the bud before they get bad.

A big Pro here is that they do hire fantastic people to work with.  My former team especially seemed to gel, and I loved coming to work mostly because I enjoyed being around them.   My direct manager had a knack for hiring awesome people, and he was also honest with me about what I needed to improve on and what I did well.  I also credit the senior manager for really turning the San Mateo office around, he made it his personal mission to whip the office into shape and I think he succeeded.  

Another Pro is that Indeed does have a great product that works.  It's something that you can feel good about selling because it has value to HR professionals and most that try it are happy they did.

Most people leave Indeed at the year mark, but if you stick it out, you can easily become proficient at your job and learn to work smarter.  You don't have to ""biz rule"" people and can instead rely on referrals and upsells for most of your quota attainment.

All in all, this is NOT a bad job.  It's sales, so at times it can be cutthroat and stressful, but what sales job is easy?  Rely not just on your manager but feel free to ask your team for help, most team members take pride in helping one another be successful.","No room for advancement and can be a little frat house-y.  If you are out of college, you will make enough so you can support yourself, but if you have a family, you won't make enough unless you move up, which is extremely difficult.  There is a reason why lots of new parents have to leave Indeed, which is pretty sad.
The 60 call a day rule is good for newbies that are starting out, but senior reps who sell bigger deals should focus on longer conversations, less calls.  This is the only company I have ever worked for that has a ""one size fits all"" approach to how they manage new and senior people.
Do not work here if you have a stick up your a**.  There is no HR in the San Mateo office for a reason, half of the people there would be fired multiple times over for violations, and I'm including myself here. When I say violations, nobody does anything horrible, but be prepared to hear crazy things come out of people mouths sometimes."
2085,Indeed,"Don't be fooled by the positive ratings, they're probably from interns",2014-03-14,3.0,Account Executive,"Indeed is a decent introduction into the world of recruitment advertising. The company offers a solid product, and the employees (though ever-changing) probably the best part of working there.","Where to begin...
- 60-call quota every day.
- Micro-management of your activity, to the point where it's counterproductive.
- A revolving door of new faces, as they're unable to keep anyone for longer than a year. Typical age of a new sales rep: 22. Fresh out of college and ready to attack their first sales role. Somewhat Boiler Room-esque.
- No incentives to stay longer than a year, as you realize quickly there's no room for advancement.
- The people that have advanced into managerial roles are typically the ones who've been there since the days when Indeed actually had plenty of opportunity for its sales reps.
- Oh yeah, NO OPPORTUNITY for sales reps. You create every single lead that you eventually call as there is NO LEAD GENERATION. Every lead you look at, every person you dial has probably been contacted by 6 other reps within the organization. Because you have to fight every other rep for leads and there's no protection of your book whatsoever, good luck trying to nurture a prospect for longer than a few months.
- Their homegrown CRM is an absolute joke. For a company occupying the SalesForce building, you'd think they'd actually get with the 21st century and use SalesForce.
- Middle management means well, but generally impotent.
- Upper management is obtuse, opaque, and downright sluggish to implement any potential improvement.

I could on for a lot longer, but I should be fair. If you're considering joining Indeed fresh out of college and have no other choices, go ahead and apply. If you've been in sales for a while, look elsewhere."

The growth of indeed has been explosive, and it has been very exciting.  I think that the negative reviews here are laughable.  They scream to me ""bottom of the barrel employee"" that clearly doesn't understand sales, and that being successful is earned, not handed to you on a silver platter.  At the end of the day, like every sales position, you get out what you put in.  If you are willing to do the work, then Indeed will reward you in more ways than just financially.  The culture is young and energetic, and at the end of the day, everyone is working toward a common goal:  Build the best search engine for jobs that the world has ever seen!","The cons that I have are nit picky.  Indeed has been an evolving business, and some people find it hard to adjust to change when it comes.  I personally find it exciting.  This is a tech company.

We feel this way for a few reasons and here they are: 

1. Management: The management at Indeed does not know what they are doing and constantly harass us on a daily basis. Instead of giving us advice or assisting us with sales they find in necessary to send us documented emails that are titled ""You Better Start Looking For A New (Cuss Word That Starts With a  F and ends with I N G) Job"". I'm not the only one who got an email like this. They are inexperienced and can't handle the stress and demand of managing a team of people. 

2. Lead Generation: There is none. Indeed makes no effort in supplying their salesman with leads. The sales floor is over saturated and more then half of their team do not hit their quotas. If you have anyone to support or are looking to make money, look elsewhere. 

3. Deception: Over the past month I overheard twice a manager ask someone to go on this site and write a good review because questions about their negative reviews were coming up in interviews....Sounds 

If you do decide to take an interview with this company you should ask the following: 

How much turnover do you have? 

How long does the average salesman stay with your company? 

How do you supply leads for your salesman? 

How is your healthcare plans? 

How is the management style? 

I hope this helps.

2093,Indeed,What it is really like as a Sales Executive,2014-02-10,1.0,Account Executive,"You get experience prospecting, presenting, and account management. Young coworkers.","Where do I begin? You think wow this job sounds great! They are relaxed and I can get some great experience. Well think again. Here is my experience: 
- you HAVE to prospect after work and on weekends to even have a hope of hitting your quota. Prospecting consists of having to sift through at least 10 cards and reading through them in their homegrown CRM that is crap. It is extremely tedious and terrible. There is NO lead generation and most good companies have been beaten to death.
- 60 call/150 min minimum. Yes this is achievable if you call fake numbers. Don't kid yourself everyone does and the management did. Is this the best way to run a company? Emails are not tracked and are by far the best way to communicate as people are way more responsive. 
- Young coworkers can be fun, but it also means a lot of gossip and cattiness. 
- Management is completely inexperienced and terrible. There was only one good manager. The others had so many issues I do not even know where to start. There is minimal training for them so they end up just micro managing you and not acting professional.
- There is no help if you need it. It is a very sink or swim mentality. Your manager is just constantly interviewing people to fill in positions. I saw around 40 people leave in less then a year. High turnover=terrible moral. There were only a handful of people that were not looking to leave when I left.
-They tell you there are growth opportunities, they lie. The recruiters and managers will tell you anything to get you in the door since people quit pretty much every week.

I will leave it at that. If you think you will have a different experience, you wont. My advice to you- do not think to yourself that you will get more experience here. It is better to get in a position of just prospecting and working your way up at a good company that people enjoy working for. I PROMISE you that it will be way more worth it in the end and will not burn you out like Indeed. Also these reviews are not from people who were fired or just the disgruntled, this is the unfortunate truth.

Most importantly, the work we are doing is helping people to get the job of their dreams. At the end of the day, it's work you can truly feel good about. Indeed is the place to be for smart and driven client services professionals.",I wish I had started here earlier.
2097,Indeed,"sales structure may have missed its golden opportunity to position itself for long-term positive recognition """,2014-02-04,2.0,Account Executive,"Great comraderie, happy hours, free lunches, product works well enough (but you have to set the proper expectations). Opportunities to learn quite a bit about SEO and performance metrics.","Business rules and rules of engagement for prospects have overly contributed to the hostile environment that reps have to navigate. Prospects (GOOD prospects) are far and few between so holding on to the few good leads you have is key. But even then, the chances of you closing a lead that has been called by at minimum 10 other reps before you is slim to none. This is because at Indeed, you must make at least 60 calls a day. If you don't have enough viable leads, you're calling the same leads more than once per day...over time, or maybe even immediately, you're going to find that people aren't picking up the phone simply because it's Indeed calling AGAIN.

The business rules only add fuel to the fire when it comes to the actual working environment. Recognition for work well done is a great thing in any organization, but it could be argued that Indeed puts too much emphasis on this. This leads to an ego-centric mindset amongst both reps and managers...there is a semblance of ""team"" structure but it's actually every man/woman for themselves. The vision of the company is lost every time someone rings the bell and gets to play their song. If you're not doing well it's only a reminder that you're either leaving soon or that you need a miracle...You only end up thinking about your specific position. I'm not saying that it's impossible to maintain the overall vision, I'm just saying that this becomes harder and harder to do and you may find that you're asking yourself if it's even worth it.  Petty-ego boosting and self-aggrandizement is a daily occurence, especially on the part of managers. This leads to excessive micromanagement that can build up to borderline harrassment and deception on the part of managers when a rep isn't doing so well. And it's all justified...because at the end of the day if sales aren't being made it is 100% the rep's fault.

So my advice to you, if you're in the interview process is to ask your recruiter very specific questions about the company culture and how long on average a rep will last in their role. If you're female you  may just not even want to bother, but of course, that depends on the person."

You can look for a new job while your working because management wont be able to tell the difference","Sales for Indeed can be summarized in one word ""Unstable"". 

No one stays lasts for more then 8 months. This is due to a few reasons.

1. There are no leads for you to pursue and management has no plans on changing things up to make it easier for their salesman to generate leads. 

2. You are highly micromanaged and must make unrealistic call quotas of 60 calls every day. If you hit 59 calls and leave for the day, you can bet that you will come in the next day and have a angry and threatening email waiting for you from your team lead. My threatening letter said "" Don't you ever make less then 60 calls in one day or you will be busy finding a new job...I will make it my goal that your A** is out of here instantly"". This was my second week and I was one of many who received this type of treatment. Also you are publicly criticized and humiliated in front of your sales team when you do no reach a goal or don't show up to the company happy hours due to family reasons. 

3. Management treats hiring and firing like a checklist process, no emotion and no thought towards growing peoples careers. It is a very transnational process and the recruiters are kept busy to keep up with the horrible turnover.

4. It's pretty much like high school all over again.

5. The quotas for salesman are ridiculous. More then 60% of the sales force dont hit their goals and management can't understand why. 

6. No one earns real money. The recruiters love to say you will earn 80k-120k your first year...don't believe it. Out of my training class of 10 or 9 there is only 1 left after a 8 month time frame. 

7. Management favoritism equals the amount of leads you are given. if you are a great salesman but your manager doesn't like you are you don't go out with him to drink ect....they will give leads to the anyone else but you.  

8. Management is clueless on how to fix the problems that exist. I asked a senior director himself on what they are planning on doing on fixing any issues. He starred at me for about 5 seconds and then shrugged his shoulders. They have no plans or ideas that are going to make a significant impact.  

If you have a family to support or are barely making your bills joining Indeed will only make things worse. I promise you. Disregard the reviews from client services or any tech positions, they are seriously skewing their Glassdoor score. if the other departments reviews were not taken into account they would probably have 1 or 2 stars on here.

Everyone seems so relaxed and laid back, the culture is relatively young, and there seems to be a sprightly ""start-up"" mentality. Give it a month and it all goes downhill from there. 

Management is horrible. Basically, the people who are managers at Indeed are the people who were with the company the longest. A lot of these ""managers' have no real management training whatsoever and get away with murder. Be prepared for your goals to be unrealistic and for leadership to play favorites when you struggle. Should you have a hard time meeting a goal you will be told to ""work harder"" and then left to make it on your own.

If you think while reading this and other reviews that these must be coming from disgruntled employees who have just had a bad experience, I URGE YOU TO THINK AGAIN. The recruiters are lying to you, I promise. Yes, you can make a lot of money in sales in your first six months to a year. But what they don't tell you is that the average tenure of an Account Executive is 6-8 months. There are no leads and everyone is kicking themselves in the butt for taking this awful, awful job. They should make the recruiters work in the sales pit because they are the ones who are doing the real selling to get people in.

In summation, the company IS great. It's making money and growing and still hiring in this economy; all pluses. But its lead by horribly egocentric managers who could care less about their employees and more about keeping up their corporate image than investing in their people. Don't believe what the recruiters (who are really just glorified sales people. Ask them about the quota they have to hit for hires in a given quarter) have to say about working here.

The Turnover: 

The turnover over is so bad that management is kept busy everyday interviewing new people to replace the ones that are leaving. About every 2 weeks someone is either fired or leaves, and about every 3 months a director usually takes off to a more stable company. 

The Turnover is due to a couple of reasons:

1. No Leads For Salesman 

Indeed has the attitude that all their salesman should find their own leads. Going into the job you know this full well. Yet they don't tell you how atrocious and overworked their potential clients are. Prospecting takes up a good portion of your day and most often you have to do it after work, on weekends and holidays in order to find a few companies that haven't been called 20 times before you. A good lead is usually passed from director to Account Executive, but usually all the leads go to one or two chosen reps on your team....leaving you with nothing. 

Example: Someone had recently left the company making their book of business or prospects up for grabs. Yet, the directors have the ability to distribute the leads as they see fit. There were about 9 people on our team. All said and done two or three reps got the majority of the leads (About 60+), while the rest of us got about 5. Extreme imbalance.   

2. Unrealistic Quotas 

Indeed is trying to reach figures that for more then 50% of their sales force they are impossible to reach. And they are trying to make it harder for their sales reps by placing package limitations and very high minimums for prospective clients this coming year. 


The Management 

Indeed's director's are very inexperienced and have little to no experience managing a team. Indeed basically promoted the salesman who were a part of the company a few years ago, when the sales floor wasn't so crowded. They do not know how to manage a team. 

The Pay

Indeed pays horrible when comparing it to other tech companies. Their base pay for their new  salesman is way below the average. Throughout the recruitment process and early on in your training you will commonly hear that you will make 80k-120k. This is pretty much false. 

Take it from my experience...
My training class had 10 people in it. Over a 6 month period 4 people had left, out of the 6 that stayed, only 2 were making quota. And this is at the point were your quota is not fully rampped up to the full amount you will have to reach after a year of being with the company. 

Now, out of the original 10, only 2 stayed and 1 out of those 2 is hitting quota. 

Please look elsewhere and do not take a job with Indeed.com. The recruiters sugar coat the company to make it look far more stable then it actually is. But in reality they are just putting lipstick on a pig. Do not take a job with this company. You will highly regret it."
2105,Indeed,"Awesome People, with a Side of Growing Pains",2013-12-18,2.0,Account Executive,"The People. This is by far and away the best part of working at Indeed, and the only reason that I did not give this organization a 1 star rating. Working in Sales can be tough, and having a Director/Senior Director that knows what's up is key. Laughter and camaraderie are highly necessary to get you through the day here. The Management team in San Mateo has their rough edges, but for the most part I really enjoyed working with them. I should mention that all of the original management team in the California office was fired during my tenure.","I'm thankful to Indeed for giving me my first real sales job. I learned valuable lessons about prospecting, presenting, following up, and closing new business at this organization. That being said, leaving Indeed has been a breath of fresh air, a sentiment shared by many of the sales people that I worked with. The most prescient problems with the organization include:

- A lack of development. Upon leaving, about 75% of the sales teams, company wide, were not reaching goals set by upper management. This is psychologically devastating, as all sales numbers are public, and the party line as espoused by the Directors is that failure is due to a lack of drive. I watched as many top performers were rewarded with inbound leads, while those in genuine need of direction and support were bullied and eventually fired. The lack of defined career paths for sales people, coupled with poor training, leads many to adopt poor work ethic out of desperation, as opposed to inherent lethargy. A lack of understanding from management only exacerbates the feeling of hopelessness.

- A lack of lead generation/marketing. A huge problem with this is the ""Small Business"" sector of Indeed holding on to leads that should be passed to the Sales team for follow up. Meanwhile, sales professionals at Indeed comb the homegrown CRM for leads held by other reps that can be taken according to business rules. This causes many sales people at Indeed to fight with one another, and new team members are often ostracized until after they've built a book. The easiest way to get prospects is to wait for others to quit or get fired, as management will pass these leads out to others on the sales team after a rep departs.

 - A lack of direction. Internal policy disputes among managers often sets different areas of the company (Sales, Client Services, Small Business, Finance) at loggerheads. This creates an atmosphere similar to a schoolyard. The upper management should get all parts of the business on the same page.

- Low pay (specific to California). A large part of the reason that Indeed is foundering in the San Mateo office is the low salaries offered to new employees, and the insulting raises given to those who have actually stuck it out. This attracts a lot of new college grads, which in the end leads to high turnover."

They are making improvements in training and new hire on-boarding compared to when I first joined.,"I was hired under the impression that the career path was defined as ""give us a good year and we'll make sure you're not stuck in an Account Executive role much longer"". With Indeed's growth, they have been able to hire very experienced professionals outside of the organization. With the high turnover, the need for new managers is null. Do not expect to grow your career here if you are in sales, no matter what they tell you in the interview process (read the other reviews).
If you're looking at this company at one of the East Coast offices, it may be a good place to gain some sales experience. If you are interviewing to work in the Bay Area office, there are far more promising opportunities at other companies in the region. The turnover in this particular office is at an all time, and quite frankly, terrifying high. The pay is considerably lower than other companies in this area."

Many of the directors in the office have been promoted from within and don't really know how to lead, which has led to high AE turnover recently. There's one director who really knows what he's doing and has a strong squad, but that seems to be the exception rather than the norm. Every AE is expected to make 60 calls/day which is often unrealistic."

My co-workers we extremely hard working, dedicated and smart.","NOTE:When you look at Indeed reviews, make sure you are comparing to the specific position and office you are applying for. A sales position is a way different environment than client services, product, engineering, etc. 

Sales reps at Indeed do not have a long shelf life. Look on LinkedIn and see how many sales reps lasted less than a year and how many have been there for 2+ years. The retention rates are low for a reason. Sales reps are expected to make 60 calls every single day. It doesn't matter how much business you are bringing in, or how long you have spent on the phone that day. Emails do not count as a contact either. This isn't 1992. Glengarry Glen Ross techniques don't pay off. Emails are effective, but leadership doesn't care to understand that. Indeed longest running rep, that is a superstar, closes most of his business via email (introduction, not actual close) and they still don't want to hear it. How serious am I about the 60 calls a day? I know reps that have been fired for lack of call volume even though they exceeded quota. Sounds like a joke, but it's not. 

Since they went to territories, it has become more difficult to find leads. Most reps struggle calling the same tired leads day in and day out. Prospects get annoyed when the are called every day. There is money to be made here, but an individual sales rep cannot survive long term, especially those starting now. 

Even the sales directors don't last here. When I say good, I mean sales directors that work with there reps to hit quotas and improve themselves professionally. Directors that do well are stat checkers. I can't really comment on Sr. Directors as they weeded some of the worst ones pretty recently. The guys that are left seem to be ok, but I can't comment from first hand experience. 

I can't say enough good things about other functions of Indeed. The product is great, the people are great, the engineers are super smart... unfortunately there it's a different world for the sales people."

If you get your work done and on time, nobody cares when you come in or leave. You are treated like an adult who can manage their own work schedule.

* Some really smart folks work here and built the company. You now have access to all this brainpower and knowledge, so you can learn from them.

* Friendly, cheerful, open-minded coworkers. Whether your thing is being Austin-y, good coffee, sports, cooking, etc., there are kindred spirits for you here.

* Extremely relaxed dress code. You could roller skate to a meeting if you wanted to. 

* The existence of a maternity leave policy. (This is a new thing.)

* Growing list of fringe benefits: spacious open office, daily catered lunches, frequent office happy hours, shuttle service, boat parties, movie nights.","* Office is in West Austin off 360, far away from downtown/fun stuff.

* Salaries are below industry standards, and it is difficult to negotiate for more pay.

* No clear path for career advancement in non-managerial positions. 

* As noted above, management styles and work schedule flexibility vary greatly by manager and department. The Engineering dept gets the most freedom. The others, not so much."
2125,Indeed,"The company is getting the job done in the employment marketplace, but they forgot about the people getting them there..",2013-08-16,3.0,Account Executive,"Solid company, great product, market place dominance, free food, decent base pay","As a sales person who's worn many hats and sold in this industry as well as others previously, I've seen worse, however I've seen a lot better too. The senior management, has so much on their (his) plate due to a recent buy out, and expected growth. This is a problem, because it's now a cut throat atmosphere in the workplace, and EVERYONE has steep goals to meet.

I enjoyed and appreciated my colleagues and immediate report, however this is the most internally competitive role I've ever had. This is a 100% cold prospecting, cold calling role which means you need to find your own leads to call on in order to have work to do that day. If you have leads or not, you still have call numbers to reach. The problem is the opportunities are few and far between, and you are limited to what you can call on. At the same time, you must request leads from your colleagues to keep a pipeline to call on. 

Attrition is the main problem that needs to be solved. Keep us happy. Sales people can and will move around if the opportunity isn't fulfilling enough, or if there aren't enough tools or resources in place to allow us to succeed. 

In closing, this was a rough bump in my sales career as I had high hopes for myself there. Again, the company is well grounded, but the sales floor is as cut throat as it gets."

Most people who work there really believe in the product.","Zero on boarding. Have to learn as you go, then you get scolded for making mistakes.
Incredible micro management, (having to copy your boss on most of your emails, getting scolded for making a decision before checking with your boss)  too many people promoted to manager roles with no management experience or training, just massive egos.
High turn over in some teams that just seems to keep happening and happening.  (look on linkedin to see how many people lasted at indeed less than a year) – for some reason none of the top management asks “why the high turnover on certain teams?”
With the Recruit acquisition, a lot of people are just cruising until they vest, cash out, and leave.
Penny pinchers – when you travel, you have to share a hotel room, good luck getting a Mac for work
Public ridicule – myself and my teammates were scolded publicly for every little mistake.  Completely humiliating.
If you leave the office before 6 pm you get called out for leaving early.
Lack of professionalism – A lot of back stabbing and talking about people behind their backs.
Zero professional growth opportunities, managers are bosses, not leaders.  They don’t lead, inspire, or teach anything to their teams.

Miserable place to work, I would not even recommend my enemies to work here."
2130,Indeed,Do not go into sales,2013-07-13,1.0,Account Executive,"Company culture is good, free food, and  happy hours .","Please take notice that all the positive reviews for indeed is for departments other then sales.
Also please go on indeed.com and check out the reviews on indeed. The sales department is literally running out of people to sell to. I have been with this company for awhile and management refuses to address it as a issue. The sales department is on track to double by the end of the year. This sounds great but over the past year the percentage of sales reps who do not hit their quotas is growing at a alarming right. For this past quarter, 46% of sales reps did not hit 90% of their quota = no bonus. Current sales reps who see this....do the math yourself. 

There is no lead generation team for Indeed. Zero, zip...nada. Sales reps do it 100% of the time. This has lead to most of the work force calling fake numbers all day to hit this required 60 call minimum. Management doesn't bring it up because they know that you can't generate enough prospects to call 60 individual companies per day. They won't admit it though. 

Be aware of the recruiters. I have spoken with other sales reps and it is confirmed  that they say false statements to get you on board. It's because they have to. I even over heard one recruiter laughing and making jokes on if they didn't bend the truth, then they wouldn't be able to do their job. 

Summary: Indeed is experiencing a over saturation of their sales territories. But they don't mind because the decision makers on top are still making money. Why would they change? Do not go into to the sales department and find a company that has stronger foundation for its sales reps."

- Free Beer and Fridays end a bit early 
- Happy hours occasionally 
- Entertaining coworkers","If you are looking to go into sales for Indeed run. The other departments like client services, small business and account management are fine. 

The training for sales is a joke. You are sent to Connecticut for a week and are taught by a trainer who openly admitted they have never sold in their life. Then your first week you need to find 75-100 prospects. This is extremely hard to do and when you do all you have is crap prospects with a very low job volume. 2nd week you are expected to make 30 calls per day. 3rd week is ridiculous, you are expected to make 60 calls per day. It is good the first day or two but by the 3rd you have run out of people to call....and then it continues tell people quite or are let fired and you inherit a small portion of their prospects.

In the sales department there are very little prospects to go around....leading to quotas not being hit. The turnover has increased dramatically and management has little to no experience to direct you. 

Also...


Beware of the recruiters, they will say almost anything to get you on board but in reality you are just another dollar in their pockets.


To sum it up INDEED is a place where salesman go to die. Under paid, not enough prospects and not enough experienced managers. 

Free beer though..."
2133,Indeed,Oddball in the Silicon Valley,2013-06-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Met some great friends ... learned some crucial account management skills.
Free coffee and bagel Friday was good","Underpaid in the silicon valley (we are talking 20-30K for same positions elsewhere). Be weary if you're 3-5 years out of college, keep looking around. In fact you're better at a start-up where maybe things are risky but they are more exciting and you will have bigger pay checks. 

Not a typical internet company. Same exact day everyday, no change. Very stale for such a young company in the SV.

*Important note: This company is HQ'd in CT, NOT California. So if you are looking for that typical Silicon Valley experience, this isn't the place to get it. 

This company is VERY ""Butt in Chair 8-5"" not flexible with doctors appts, etc. Some managers have you ""make it up."" In addition; if you want to be paid hourly in your late twenties, work here! Many of the team members had their salary switched to hourly b/c of their job description. Be weary and ask if you're interviewing. 

I have to admit I was there probably in their worst year for California. Too much negative change or non-change at once. I have a good feeling they will turn it around in 2014. 

There were poor management issues but I have heard they have fixed 90% of them. Mostly too many people far to ""green"" in their careers to have a team of their own. No real inspirational leaders here.

In addition: there is NO fluidity working with other teams. Customer feedback almost always goes unheard b/c non engineers are not encouraged to pass on comments to product/engineering team.

LinkedIn is always a threat and while Indeed may have quantity in audience, LinkedIn has quality. The product at Indeed is good but long term there is no social, how will it last when Gen Y gets job hungry? 

Bottom line; if you're hungry, if you're ambitious, and if you want an exciting career - think twice before accepting your underpaid offer here. 

Did you graduate this past year? Work here a year and then leave. It will be fine - but make sure your manager is 8-10 years older so you have a strong mentor and leader and someone who will change your life ! Always interview your manager! Huge advice and something I regret not doing with Indeed."

- some managers micromanage
- other managers are very laid-back and people abuse their freedom

2135,Indeed,Very Young Company - but not always in a good way,2013-04-30,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company is very solid. Great revenue, runs lean, upper management are genuinely great people. Fun. Their internal social application is really nice for creating a collaborative environment and getting to know people within the company. The ramp up quota is fair.  Compensation is competitive, though not sustainable in how it's implemented. Probably would have stayed longer, but I just had a much better opportunity more inline with my strengths/experience and compensation requirements.","Company is very young, lots of new grads, because of this they have some rules/restrictions that most seasoned professionals will not like/tolerate. Other small things- like sharing hotel rooms, expenses taking up to 8 weeks to be reimbursed, lack of documented policies/procedures - can be frustrating. With the acquisition by Recruit, revenue expectations were very high. In a group of 20, 4 hit quota, then quotas were raised 45% on average. They look for quarter over quarter growth. With seasonality it's just not sustainable and punitive if you sign a customer up for a full year. Also, no mechanisms for negotiating larger/longer deals, same cost to the customer today, tomorrow, signing up for a month, or six months. While they say this is the nature of the auction system, this probably really goes back to having a young salesforce that would abuse those mechanisms. As far career opportunities, in sales your limited, they use the title director for folks who manage small teams. But the company only has two products sold simultaneously, so not many options."

Great colleagues: bright, talented group to work with
Great product:  really believe in Indeed as a product
Engineers seem to have a great time!","Lack of training: the on-boarding process for my team was not good. There are no training processes in place at all, and it's sink or swim.
Lack of work/life balance: it is expected that you work above and beyond 40 hours, which wouldn't be an issue if work/life balance weren't put forward as one of the great things about the job. Be honest about what you expect from your employees. Don't just say what they want to hear to get them to sign on the bottom line. That creates unrealistic expectations on both sides.
Bad management: there's a culture of throwing other people under the bus to save your own hide. The turnover is extremely high in some places, so make sure you ask how many people have done your job in the past year before you taken it (this is highly indicative of poor training and management)."
2137,Indeed,"Great company, terrible sales organization.",2013-04-18,1.0,Account Executive,"You can make a lot of money. Young, fun co-workers. Stocked fridge with beer and any snacks imaginable. Great company and a decent product to sell. The company has the chance of totally taking over the marketplace and your potential earnings as a sales rep are very high. Easily more than $100k/year.","I don't know who is giving Indeed such good reviews... It must be people outside of the sales organization. Once Indeed was bought out, they totally lost sight of what actually matters in sales - SALES. They are forcing all of their strongest sales reps out by letting their sales ""leaders"" (managers) ruin the experience for everyone. They have no long term plan and seem to take things day by day. Their sales managers, besides the ones that were promoted internally, have never sold PPC advertising and don't bring any value to the company. They are, in reality, just stat checkers who's primary responsibilities consist of micromanaging and forcing people to make 60 calls a day despite what their day consisted of or how much revenue they bring in. This forces everyone to make fake phone calls throughout the day. Literally, EVERYONE, spends hours of their day making fake phone calls when they should be focusing on selling new business and growing existing accounts.

They do not care about the amount of meetings you set, amount of deals you bring in, or revenue sold. They only care about the number of calls that you make. This really just shows how they lack management experience and the ability to think logically. They promise big things to people that are interviewing, but the reality is that you will likely be fired or leave Indeed within the 1st year. Only around 5 people (out of 100's of sales reps) were promoted in my time being there which shows that it is either ""up or out"" at Indeed. Most of the time, it's out. This has ruined the morale. I did not know one single person that was happy working there.

It's really a shame that Indeed has gone this direction. Their turnover is horrendous, but they hide those numbers by forcing people to quit by paying them off to say they resigned rather than actually firing them. Additionally, the sales managers are highly unprofessional. They corner you in a conference room so they can yell, curse, and scream at the top of their lungs. They have no idea how to motivate and instead just make everyone feel like they are not good enough. In other words, no matter how well you are doing or how much effort you put in, you should be doing better. Nobody last 2 years in sales here besides a few people recently. These people will leave Indeed in the next few months if not promoted, and Indeed could care less.

If you have a good job or a job with any type of security, stay away from Indeed. Otherwise, you will just be looking for something else within the next 6 months."

They treat their employees like they actually are valued; Indeed does not do that.  They also encourage growth and potential in their employees; Indeed does not do that.
