You will be getting 5 lakhs target every month and you have a limited client data base and you need to call them on daily basis and from those clients you have to complete your daily targets like calling talk time and sales.

Everyday meetings are supposed to encourage the employees to make them perform better. But at Indiamart, meetings are done to discourage the employees. Plus they don't cooperate at any level. Condition of 10 ECs (effective calls) with minute data everyday is just riduculous. People at higher positions don't even have manners to talk. Only incentives can't make someone perform better, it's the motivation, the work culture which does.
The company is solely focused on the money and not the services being given to the clients. You have to first service your clients, resolve their problems, only then he'll be interested to continue. Worthless services being given to the clients and expecting revenue in return is just funny."

2. From no wfh in the past 25 years to continue wfh at covid times","1. No work-life balance: Though it is wfh but be prepared to work for 10-11 hrs and on weekends. Exploitation is at the peak
2. No policy for wfh: Even after ~5 months of working from home, they still do not have a policy for it. Taking leave will feel like begging. There will be salary cuts, extra working hours, additional work pressure (as many people left the firm due to over-exploitation)

Salary is credited on time. Payroll department helps with all the queries.
You can do external paid certifications and the company will pay for it (80% amount).
Chilled out place if you can manage your work n time.","Average Salary with huge pay un-equality.
Some MBA professionals are earning less than 25k while some graduates are earning more than 35k.

In Sales team, the senior have no manners of talking to an employee. Moreover, your hard work can be taken from you anytime and assigned to someone else, in the name of ""growth"".

HRs are lovely and that's all. They are not doing their job if they can't figure out what's in the best interest of the employees. There are some teams where employees don't stick around for long. The managers of such teams should be held accountable for not retaining the employees. But I have never heard of any such initiatives.

Pandemic exposed their lack of empathy towards the employees. We have thrice the amount of work as compared to before covid-19. Coupled with salary deductions and extra working day - saturday.

If you are switching from a financially bigger company - dont.
If you are switching from a small firm - sure, join it.
If you are a college hire - yeah, u need to see the office politics to develop some professional character.  So go ahead and join.

But either way, the organisation stays the same - lala company. Mis-managed."

They are just making fools of their employees. Firstly they will hire you as a Trainee for complete one year and after that they will extend you letter for another year saying this is the Managemnet decision and asks for
Proof that they will onroll us.
HR doesn’t know anything. 
They just procrastinates everytime . 
They won’t give you any Pf and any benifit . 
There wouldn’t be any appraisal for minimum 2.5 years. 
They will make you fool completely. Don’t think to work there. 
Managers are supportive but atlast they are also helpless with the so called management’s decision. 
Working environment is amazing. Only because of colleagues you can survive there else you would get so demotivated that you couldn’t even think of working anywhere else too. 
Thanks to the colleagues. 
Being the star performer they wouldnot even try to help and just try that the employees should leave and they would hire new ones and would make them fool too.

You would not get any appraisal according to your performance .

No one tries to help . They just want you to leave and that they can hire new employees.

3) HR is just helpless. They are the puppets of higher management.
4) Actually this is not a company. This is a family business being run by some 4-5 relatives or cousins.

Secondly they are fooling their clients by misselling the product as their product is horrible and you have to tell n number of lies to sell.  Work culture is a like a complete desi company at IM and also it has negative reputation in the market.  I had an horrible experience as i was in key accounts and they don't know the meaning of Key accounts and just blindly distributing the accounts. Also targets are exorbitant and they payment you will get in return is minimal. They basically make fool out of their employees and client both.

Full Politics at mgt level as well , too much resource optimization , forcefully ask executive to report on weekends while themselves lay back at home . No leadership qualities at Relationship Manager level also . 
Claimed as not a target based job and incentives depends on performance , yet unnecessary pressure to complete target because it will help the RM make their incentives . Too much of work pressure which is not necessary .
No culture ! No value ! .
Classic example of an ""Indian company"" .
Absolutely not a place for candidate from reputated background . Small organization and people interested in other""s business .
I have just gone through other reviews posted and I am shocked to read them given good ratings . I have worked there and spent even 12 hours to justify my work when required , still no recognition or motivation by manager . 
Most employees are still sticking here because it's a day shift job and they do not have any better option to work like in this shift . 
The culture is such that managers (BM) even shout and abuse on the production floor . One of the BM who was old in the system bluntly shouted to through a female employees belongings if she goes out before 9 o'clock to which she had refused to extend as she had issues going back home that late .
Guys ! Please think 10 times before joining this organization no word is false and every situation is self experienced ."

1495,IndiaMART,My Review,2014-07-15,3.0,Product Manager,A good company to start  a career.,"It is tough here to get appreciated just by performing well and focusing delicately on work. Won't suggest to a person who is dedicated, enthusiastic, creative and value self respect with a desire for career advancement."
1496,IndiaMART,Caveat Emptor,2014-07-02,2.0,Assistant Manager,"If you need a bump up in salary and responsibilities. This is the place to go. Management values brand names (college, prev employers) on CV and is willing to pay for it. Just be firm and you will get it.","Very difficult to work in support roles. Everyone has an opinion on everything, without suggestions on how to fix it. Owners get swayed easily by the last opinion heard. 

My bosses used to have a tough time dealing with the owners. Opinions on settled matters would change overnight. And weeks of effort would be scratched because one guy made a casual comment on the colours used. 

The CEO comes in at 12pm and stays past midnight. So you can forget work life balance if working with him/his immediate reports. 

A big exodus of seniors happened last year. All because owners didn't know how to use the people they had hired. Owners are well meaning but whimsical. Very little freedom on even routine matters. 

Only reason I came in to post this review, because I saw a lot of positive reviews from current employees in a bunch in May-Jun 14. Just thought, maybe worthwhile to post a more realistic picture. 

This rating manipulation is typical of how things get handled. Things come to a head, crisis brews and then a clean up. Which usually means, to just put it under the carpet."
