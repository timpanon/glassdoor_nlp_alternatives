5,Info Edge,Bad Management and work ethics,2022-03-31,2.0,Manager,Work life balance is good,"Poor to worst management
Management doesn't have enough qualification to be a senior or lead a team
Manager takes your work and show it as hers to the top management
Manager treats you like her personal worker
Manager gives you menial work (which she is supposed to do) and don't let you work on your KPIs
Constantly keep telling you that you are not worth it
Manager keeps on gossiping about other colleagues and bad mouthing them, creating a very negative environment for the employee
Never gives you the right picture of what's happening
Micro management is the biggest issue. Like calling you after every half an hour and then putting the blame on you that you don't work
Don't know how to treat their subordinates
MANAGEMENT IS JUST NOT QUALIFIED TO RUN A TEAM"

-business is going good
-Good support provided by the admin & operations teams during covid 2nd wave","- lack of expertise in tech teams, very few people to learn from and look up to
- despite having a framework for appraisals it isn't followed well and appraisals are done on the basis of some bell curve distribution
- default health insurance package doesn't cover parents anymore, it used to do that before. now you pay extra premium for that
- business & product leadership are stubborn and are too focused on cost cutting instead of urging teams to innovate
- no one cares about your individual growth, but people will surely point it out or lack thereof, when the time comes for evaluation
- no celebration
- tech leadership cant be trusted, they dont have that vigor to fight for anything anymore. Dont expect any backup if you are in some sort of professional conflict with product management.
- almost everyone feels they are underpaid, even those who are appreciated more, feel they are underpaid. Even new hires bounce away before joining
- estimate timelines are challenged frequently as product doesn't believe in tech. As a result senior engineering managers make false commitments around delivery timelines and instead of rectifying their decisions and due dates, they put undue pressure on team to meet the deadlines... just to show that they got this project delivered on time."

Middle layer mostly act as messengers in the system as they can’t take decisions or make suggestions. Suggestions or discussions are considered as excuses. There is no parity when they give targets . Since they make so many changes hence if one team is doing well for few months as their process has become more effective with the changes made, the other team will lose as it’s process become less effective.

334,Info Edge,Used to be a Pro Now full of Cons,2021-06-16,3.0,Lead Engineer,"This review is strictly for naukri.com verticle of InfoEdge.
1. Salary on time. Payroll department is quick to resolve queries
2. Lots of SMEs and very helpful colleagues 
3. Learning curve is good. 
4. Open source technologies are used and tech stack very upto date.
5. Job security. No firing in difficult times.
6. Good Covid support.","This review is strictly for naukri.com verticle of InfoEdge.
1. Project can close anytime. No visibility in long term goal for any project. Management won't even stick to their quarterly defined goals for a project.
2. Lots of lies in terms of appraisals and bonus. There is no defined appraisal time. 
3. Excessive work, agressive deadlines with minimal pay.
4. Some managers are very unprofessional and creates a toxic work environment. 
5. Management won't consider you an asset unless you put resign and show them a good offer in hand. Then they will meet your expected salary. So apart from your office work you have to crack a additional company to get a good appraisal.
6. Long notice period. 3 months even for junior positions.
7. No perks and benefits apart from your salary. 
8. HR is just namesake. Apart from arranging diwali functions never seen them contributing in anything worthwhile. Oh wait ... Decorations on independence day is also their KRA.
9. Very poor tech support. Laptops are outdated. 
10. Good company for any fresher with zero or little experience , but after 2 years NO significant growth or learning 
11. Biased feedback system which defines your bonus and appraisal also. 
12. Company invest more in outsourcing than building in-house products. So anyone looking for pure tech work, this is not a company for you. 
13. No extra pay for extra hours or for working on weekend. Even when you are coming to meet the management defined timelines. 
14. No initiative in research & development or patenting.
15. High attrition resulting in good colleagues leaving for better opportunities.

To be honest I can go on and on in this section. In short, anything not mentioned in the pros list is definetly a cons."

1. Info Edge invests money in the products and comes up with timely enhancements, which in turn really helps its employees project/ sell a brand that it already is.

2. The working environment was an extremely conducive one with support pouring in from all quarters. Everyone here was approachable and personally speaking, this made life a lot easier for me in my initial years.

3. Since I was in sales, I was continuously pushed to perform well and this created a healthy competitive environment where the success ratio was pretty high for the entire sales force. You give a target (read ""stretched"") to Bangalore branch and there is no backing out, trust me. Consider it done.

4. One of the best sales organizations to earn incentives and also earn accolades for the efforts that you put in.

5. Career opportunities are excellent wherein you as a performer will get a chance to go beyond your limits and take up strong responsibility at a very nascent stage in your career itself.","1. Work life balance was an issue but this might be a perceptive thing as well. As an individual, it became extremely difficult at times to prevent myself from taking this extra baggage home.

2. There is absolutely no competition to Naukri as a product and while this is definitely a great sign for the company, in my opinion this also pushes an individual to a comfort zone wherein the learning gets limited.

1. Executive Management is employee friendly (it comes across in compensation, policies etc.)
2. Compensation is competitive and they are moving towards performance based pay, so while there are some hiccups expected along the way, I saw the steps being taken in the right direction
3. One of the most successful and prominent internet based businesses in India and CEO and other executive management welcome new ideas and solutions. Great company if you are keen to work in this industry in India. 
4. Flexibility and benefits are good
5. Some really great senior leaders (see cons for more) so great place to build a career and grow
6. For most part, people (including folks senior to you and your peers) are there to help you out and it's a very open door culture (but have seen some managers not following this, but that seemed to be a few exceptions)

Overall it was a great experience and pleasure working at Info Edge.","1. Executive management is slightly conservative / risk averse resulting in at times incremental decisions vs. bold new steps. 
2. Some of the offices are old/not up to the mark in terms of facilities (cafeteria, meeting rooms, building, laptops etc.)"
