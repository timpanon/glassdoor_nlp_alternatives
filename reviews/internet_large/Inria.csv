2,Inria,Beware: the most toxic work environment,2022-02-23,1.0,Postdoctoral Fellow,Resignation in the probation period was quite straightforward.,"Please beware of Inria Bordeaux, I experienced intimidation, threats, gaslighting, manipulation and disrespect from many permanent employees. Mobbing is a very common here and management do not care. This place is a nightmare especially for a foreigner. 

When you leave, the management will try to provoke you to collect dirt to discredit you, so they can cover their path. They will send you a message that your contract has been prolonged, that they want something from you, etc. and then turn it against you to make you look crazy. 

Being at Inria Bordeaux was the most disgusting experience I ever had. Management is either ignorant or evil. No freedom to do experiments and supervisors often bully by overloading postdocs with unnecessary tasks."

Generous funds for conferences and encourages publishing.,Post PhD the salary does not increase much. howvever there are other socialistic benfits at this excellent place by govt and INRIA
129,Inria,Great place to work,2014-10-23,4.0,Chercheur post-doctorant,Great work environment. Not a tremendous pressure to deliver hence can do independent research. Very good and cooperative people. Has a significant amount of resources to do cutting edge research. Also in a very good setting.,Need to learn French to communicate. Also salary too low.  There are plenty of vacations and hence doing things can be difficult as you may find that you boss is in vacation for 2 months!!!
130,Inria,A great place to do high-level academic research,2014-10-16,5.0,PhD Student,Excellent scientific and technical staff. Friendly meetings and collaborative research are encouraged. Training is offered to anyone. Excellent world-wide reputation. The Institute is overall well funded. Good salary for academic research.,Under financial pressure due to its governmental funding. Administrative staff is mainly very helpful but some glitches can be encountered. Work-life balance can be hard to achieve in some research teams. Very difficult to get a tenured position.
131,Inria,research engineer,2014-10-01,5.0,Reseasrch Engineer,"great place, good learning curve","low salary, sometimes need to learn french"
132,Inria,I did not learn anything,2014-08-28,2.0,Marketing Communications Manager,Over protected job. A lot of vacations.,No real teamwork. Low salary because it is a governmental employer.
133,Inria,Nice experience as a PhD student,2014-07-11,4.0,PhD Student,Ideal environment for PhD students. Good pay. Very relaxed and friendly atmosphere.,"- It's impossible to get a permanent research position if you don't befriend the right people. It's more important than the quality of your work. 
- For some reason lots of people there tend to regard the private sector as the devil."
134,Inria,"Excellent level & learning opportunities, moderate salary.",2014-07-11,4.0,Research Engineer,"Access to top level engineers and scientists, opportunities to learn, nice atmosphere. In general, it is a nice place to work in, although all this depends on the actual site (several around France) and, above all, the actual team.","The salary is nothing to write home about and, if working as an engineer, promotions make little sense (you usually either stay the same or leave, no in-between)."
135,Inria,Best organisation for doing a PhD in France,2014-06-23,4.0,PhD Student,"Fantastic place to be a PhD student. Great work culture, decent pay and benefits",Depends on who you get as your advisor. Very famous people have less time to supervise you. Lots of holidays
136,Inria,PhD in Computer Science,2014-05-17,4.0,PhD Student,"I consider Inria as one of the best place to work on fundamental science, which is quite rare opportunity nowadays:
- you can easy find a professional in a particular area around you, find him\her, and get a good advice about your problem
- the environment is flexible (almost no strict schedule)
- the salary/work balance is good (of course, you can get more in application-oriented positions - but here I talk about fundamental science)
- secretaries of research groups try always to help you- starting from taxes, accommodation, language problems, finishing with simple advices how to save money or where to get discount for traveling
-researcher are dedicated to science, especially maths, computer science, formal methods. Good training for your brains for the rest of the life
- if you are self-motivated - it's the best place for you- you will find how to use all these opportunities and to become a strong researcher","I have got an impression that people hate industry here ))) If you like words like : banking, economy, money, well-paid career, investments, GDP - this place is not for you. People will not understand you and will not appreciate your knowledge about ""real-money world"". So change your vocabulary to : induction, theorems, proofs, rigorous, optimality, complexity ))) - probably this comment is true about the whole France

There is also weak cooperation with industry because of that- I believe. So do not expect that you will meet managers of Google in the hall of Inria that will instantly hire you. Industry does not care about what Inria is doing and vice versa. Money goes directly from French government that even during the crisis supports Inria quite well."
137,Inria,Very good,2014-04-04,5.0,,"Culture, multi-national, lunch, management, cover for visa, and many more.","Nothing much, well, toilets are too small :)"

148,Inria,Doing good research in not really nice environment,2013-06-14,2.0,Postdoctoral Researcher,Best place to do CS research in France. Most teams are very strong. Infrastructure is good. Lots of vacation days (no less than 5 full weeks per year).,"Strong separation between permanent and temporary (interns, PhD students, post-docs) staff.
Postdocs are typically considered as apprentices (kind of senior PhD students) rather than fully-fledged researchers.
Pay is very low: you get on hands ~80% of the salary amount and from this you have to pay the taxes at the end of year (the sum varies, but approx. around one monthly salary). No supplemental vacation money.
People (administrative or research) never ask for your feedback. Just don't care to even consider to improve something. Basically, it is a mix of arrogance and insouciance.
Many of research staff have quite poor English skills (i.e., have troubles with making even a simple talk about their own work)."

Little of the bureaucratic overhead endemic to French government establishments.
Many opportunities to work with industry and support for the creation of start-ups by employees.","Low salary and little career perspectives. This however, is a problem in the entire research community, particularly in France.
