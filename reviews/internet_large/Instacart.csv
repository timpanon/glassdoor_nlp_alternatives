The first thing is, the leads and managers on this team have very little (if any) sales experience. The whole team started as a group of non-salespeople that they are now trying desperately to turn into salespeople in the most miserable way possible. In turn, you will be “coached” by people who don’t really know how to coach you and I placed “coached” in quotation marks because that’s technically all they can do since their coaching guidance is likely coming from Udemy videos. The second thing you need to know is that you need to carefully negotiate your salary upfront before accepting any offers because you will find that other companies are paying a lot more and Instacart believes they are overpaying you already with whatever they offer. If you end up in an SDR II role, they will expect you to do the work of a Launch Specialist (basically an Account Exec) who are currently paid 50-125% more than what they offer an SDR. Yes, they are trying to turn the Care SDR team into cheap Launch Specialists! All the more reason to consider any offer very carefully and if you still really want to be here, negotiate a great salary up front before you get stuck. The third thing you should know is, if you are an SDR I your commission (which is capped at this time due to the ridiculous way they distribute leads) is based on campaign activations, something you have no control over because once you book a meeting the process is now out of your hands. The fourth thing you should know is that team leads are paid a bonus on your activations, which is unfair especially as they have little (read: zero) sales experience, don’t train you and are doing zero of the work to help you book a meeting besides micro-managing you to death. And speaking of stuck the next thing you should know is, if you are coming here below a supervisor or lead level that it is pretty much impossible to get promoted out of the Care Org into other company departments. Make sure you shake a lot of hands, kiss a lot of babies, take zero sick days and you are still more likely to get struck by lighting than to be promoted out of Care, no matter what your numbers look like. The Care Org is a basically a cemetery, once you’re in the ground you’re likely not going anywhere. Try your best to get on the cool kids’ team and stay there, hob nob with the managers, go to their events, and volunteer for every hair-pulling project they throw at you and then keep doing that for infinity years. Unless upper management really likes you, you're wasting your time.

If you are joining the Care SDR team and have no previous sales experience, this a great opportunity for you. Get as much self-training as possible from as many resources as you can because you will not get enough worthwhile sales training being on this team to help you succeed high enough to move up the ranks and/or get better opportunities. But if you want below average pay, are happy with the status-quo, only want to do the bare minimum or are happy continuously exceeding goals without ever being rewarded for it, this is the place for you. Good luck!"

The moment I joined, that all changed. Like, a 180 degree turn. Management and design processes played out as hyper cold, top-down, and nearly impossible to satisfy. Navigating the day-to-day felt more unrealistic as time went on. Unapproachable leadership created an uncomfortable atmosphere and made me feel even more isolated given the nature of purely remote work. 

In my many years in the industry, I had never felt so alone, poorly treated in reviews, and with nowhere to turn for guidance. The culture and process were simply not what I was primed for, and ultimately led to us parting ways."

362,Instacart,Times are changing,2021-04-26,3.0,Operations,"- Before it was full-time WFH, there were nice benefits of working in person such as an amazing office with multiple floors, free lunch/dinner, snacks/drinks, and a great company culture with friendly people across the org.
- The mission of the company remains mostly the same, and getting to work on interesting problems everyday can definitely be rewarding.","- Do any HR or Workplace teams even read these reviews and/or care anymore? Seems like there isn't much of a pulse check of how employees in general are doing or have been handing WFH now that it's been over a year.
- Burnout tends to be a common theme among many teams across the company - are we communicating and addressing these issues by talking about adding more headcount or promoting a better culture that openly encourages taking time off?
- The product strategy seems to have gone stale for quite some time now with VPs and execs coming and going every few months, and the same spiel about our numbers in every all hands these days.
- Management in Ops tends to have a very stagnant way in thinking, many of the higher ups and longer-tenured folks in the org are slow in implementing change and have way too long of a leash on people within the team who consistently underperform, without ever holding them accountable or taking any serious, meaningful actions to cut the fat.
- Instacart likes to take a stance on racism and inequality, but I haven't heard much after the announcement of the Asian@ ERG, and I also find it interesting that the sponsor is not noticeably Asian (am I missing something or did they think this was the most ideal representation of the group?)"

416,Instacart,"Great basic job, anything above shopper is a nightmare",2021-03-03,2.0,Shift Lead,"Schedules are fairly flexible. Depending on your team, getting to spend time with coworkers can be fun.","There is an unspoken expectation that you will be available and responding to messages from store open to close. Managers will say you don't need to respond after you clock out, but will continue emailing and messaging you. Shoppers will continue messaging you as well since they are not given any other contact point to reach if you are not in the store. Promotions are more based on whether upper management personally likes you rather than experience. Multiple times jobs where given to people that had zero prior experience vs others with more experience and better metrics. Pay would be okay if it was just a couple of stores, but store assignment is often unbalanced and someone will end up with an excessive number of teams to manage while others will have one or two stores max. Teams also change very quickly since shoppers are fired if they are not meeting their metrics, and Leads are often left underprepared to deal with the extremely low morale that comes from this . Maybe it was just my particular region, but overall very toxic corporate environment with a sole focus on profits and efficiency at all costs."

488,Instacart,Instacart (Part time),2021-01-14,3.0,Graduate Student,As a student this is a great job because it has a flexible schedule that changes on a weekly basis. Pay is decent and you get paid on a weekly basis which helps if you're working this job because you're on a tight budget.,"The app itself for employees needs a lot of improvement. It's glitchy and the programming can allow for errors and unfair detrimental marks on performance metrics. The performance is based on speed (""x"" seconds per item) which is easy to hit if you have a big order (30+ items) or standard (off the shelf) items. If you have a small order (often 1 item orders come in) it's impossible to find the item, check out, bag, print labels, and stage the item in under 60 seconds which gives you a bad mark.
If you have a small order (under 10 items) and even 1 or 2 of those items are specialty (juice bar order, hot bar food, meat or deli counter, and bulk items) you run into the same problem. The app and the speed metrics don't account for store size (larger store, more running around and more speciality sections available) so employees at large stores tend to look bad compared to instacart teams at really small stores. 
As the in-store shopper, if there's an issue with the delivery (heavy traffic causing cold items to melt or warm items to cool, any possible damage in transit, or bags forgotten at the store or in the car etc.) the missing items and complaint goes to the shopper, even if it had to do with the delivery. As a tech company, Instacart has a lot of programming issues to resolve."

I had positive experiences throughout, everyone was inviting and welcoming which impacted my decision to join the team.

I appreciate the things Instacart does to make employees feel included even while working remotely. From virtual team offsites, groups like Women @ Instacart, Rainbow carrots, Nightshades, Sazón, Parents @ Instacart, and plenty of opportunities for teams to present/share what they're working on. 

There's a lot of transparency from the CEO and upper management. Once or twice a month there's all-hands meetings with the CEO where we can ask questions.","After joining, the team continued to hire quite a bit so it was a little hard to keep track of everyone and keep a close team environment but it's improved over time.

We have personal learning budgets, management helps navigate career growth, we have regular workshops, learn new skills and bring on new tools together.","With autonomy comes responsibility and ability to navigate uncertainty. As a designer working at a hypergrowth company this means being comfortable with ambiguity and shipping design with sometimes less than perfect data.

* Unpaid on-call rotation (it used to be paid before) - especially unfair if you're unlucky to be part of a small team 
* No real opportunity for career advancement - seen this also with people around me
* Newly introduced performance review ranking system is designed and misused to keep one away from success, promotion, or salary raise.
Despite delivering several projects on a timeline and with quality, you could still get a 'meets some expectations' (2 out of 4) which is disgraceful. If they desire to keep you at the level you are, they will find a single occurrence of something negligible, keep it on your record and make it a big deal during the performance review.
* Instacart is filling more senior and managerial positions with people from the outside mostly, rather than growing people from within - make sure you can land a position that is high enough in ranks because it will be a hard and lengthy process to advance in the career ladder
* Many management practices borrowed from Amazon - they're coming to Instacart together with ex-Amazon managers and directors

Their knowledge base is huge and trying to navigate it requires practice. They allocate an entire week at the beginning for shadowing, but they do no shadowing! You basically just have to figure it out on your own and hope you won’t get penalized for poor performance. This can be extremely frustrating when you are trying to satisfy both shoppers and customers because as customer care you are their main point of contact. Their 6min communication expectation is unrealistic and ultimately just harms their customer and shopper experience even more. Imagine having to be shoved from agent to agent because they took longer than 90 seconds to solve your sensitive issue?! Team leads/trainers made an effort to make training fun but they failed to make it practical. Also, the pay sucks—definitely not a livable wage."

If you enjoy customer service, this is not the worst type of customers to deal with. Issues are not too difficult, the work is not too stressful, as long as you meet your numbers and do not have horrible attendance, job security is not something you have to worry about (unless you are a contractor as they drop contractors the same day they decide they are no longer needed)","There are opportunities to advance, however, it’s more of a favorites game. - regardless of your work ethic. If you want to advance become extremely close with your manager, lead, or someone one on the team you want to transfer to. You will be chosen over someone who works hard and is more qualified for the position.
Rules and schedules change often. Attendance policy changes multiple times a year and you are forced to change your schedule multiple times a year as well. Schedules often consists of undesirable work hours and non consecutive off days.
Leads are not trained on the basic things or maybe they don’t pay attention in training - whichever it is they don’t catch on quickly and you may often find yourself figuring things out on your own as your lead may often know less than you do.

They do not support their drivers. They throw them away like trash and just replace anyone who questions their tactics. 

Instead of listening to their people who are on the ground level with real insight on how to make their service even better. They ignore those people and get rid of them for being engaged. 

This company’s practices show they are not focused on creating a quality service but instead just milking people for as much money as they can.  

They milk their shoppers for everything they can. They have zero concern about taking care of the customers who use their service. Just try and get a refund for non-purchased items and you’ll see what I mean."

I was let go for being accused of stealing customers groceries. It’s a total lie. I’m a moral and ethical person who has never stolen anything in my life. My guess is someone decided they wanted free groceries and elected to lie and claim they never received them or someone took them after I dropped them off. I don’t know but I did deliver them. They won’t tell me who it was or when it happened. I supplied pictures of my drop offs but it didn’t matter. Beware there is a scam going on and I got caught up in this one.

I made the switch. But was repeatedly hindered by their process. Waited a week to have my driving record approved, eventually talked to a shopper assistant to see what the hold up was, he restarted my entire paperwork process over again putting me at the start. THATS NOT ALL. I check with another assistant days later, he says it was not restarted correctly so he’ll have to restart it again. THREE times I’ve done the intro paperwork. I switched from the instore position for this, I NEED to work. Honestly ridiculous that I couldn’t have done this while still working shifts as an instore shopper.

Sometimes right at the entrance where the bags are stolen.

Almost every time I had a shift something with my app would interfere and it was extremely frustrating. I couldn’t get in touch with anyone at Shoppers Help, which I am not even sure if this department existed back then or what it was called. But- when things did go good, the day flew by, and it was awesome, and I truly enjoyed connecting with customers, and the overall flow of things. BUT now; since the app has evolved some, more shoppers have been hired exc, I lost my early access due to the app stating I wasn’t accepting batches, this was LAST YEAR. I STILL am struggling to this day to even get enough hours to be able to have my early access back. Which was out of my control losing in the first place. It’s extremely frustrating for me, constbstkt checking the app, and nothing, literally ever. And if I do get any hours- I am asked to end my shift early. So I make no money... It just seems extremely unfair to me I have to suffer for technical issues from over a year ago. I feel like I’ll never get early access back. Blah. DONT LOSE IT PEOPLE.

I was desperate for a quick job so I took it...and even still you’re not guaranteed to make money $$ during your shift. For example for one shift of 5 hrs, you may have 1 grocery batch only paying you $10-$20? Terrible!
You’re timed..to get to the store , shop all the groceries with the exact items specified , cash out load car , drive to customers house/business and unload, in a specific amount of time.
Customers don’t tip always and when you receive your batch with Amt you will be paid plus tip...customer that’s super cheap can retract the tip amount after you do all the work and shop for them within a certain time frame. 
The ware and tear on your car and gas is not compensated by the company all comes out of your pocket.
Also for a huge grocery list being delivered to a building you’re responsible and not forewarned by company to buy out of your pocket a buggy to carry all the groceries to customers living in high rise buildings!
Customers complain when store doesn’t have items and remove tips and mark bad reviews on your page as if it’s your fault the store was out of stock.
This is my second time trying to post my review so much to mention but won’t go on or they will not post my review. All in all get a better more reliable better paying job. This company is nothing short of CHEAP! If I wasn’t a single mother trying to provide for my kids I would quit immediately."

Company states that shoppers will know before they accept a delivery, what Instacart is paying them and what the tip will be.

What they don’t tell you is that customers have 72 hours to change the tip amount, which leads to customers offering large tips up front to get their order accepted, and ultimately changing the tip to 0 after the delivery has been completed.

As I have a 100% satisfaction, Reliability and Accountability rating it’s safe to say this isn’t happening based on their feelings regarding the quality of service they received.

These RI's were the result of IC kicking me off shift for not accepting batches that were not profitable which resulted in ending my hours for the day and receiving the RI's.  RI's are a performance measure and fall under the IRS definition of employee classification language.  I am not an employee of IC and as an CONTRACTOR am able to perform the duties of my contract as I see fit, per IC's own contractual language.  I would like this issue escalated to T3 and the RI's removed immediately.  I am willing accept batches that do not COST me money to work.  When the store is 20 miles away, across San Diego County and I'm not being payed for mileage to the store, that COSTS me money.  Double batches with for $18, 16 miles and 30+ items, costs me money.  It is unacceptable to expect that your contractors will work for free.  Your agents response was that rejecting orders is disruptive to the batching system and causes orders to be late and unhappy customers.  Your customers are unhappy because your shoppers are unhappy.  Orders are rejected over and over because people realize they are working for free and most likely in the hole for taking orders.  You charge your customers a ridiculous fee and markup the products in some cases over 300%, yet you don't pay your shoppers even a third of the profit from the order.  It's all over the internet, your shoppers know this, your customers are being exposed to the bad press and you are destroying the brand image of the long established grocery giants you are servicing.  IC is a $7 billion dollar company who's CEO makes six figures and your lowest paid ""admin"" makes ~$35K, yet you cannot pay the backbone of your contract workforce a LIVING wage?  Your deceptive business practices, abuse of the labor force and complete disregard for fiscal wellbeing the communities you serve is repulsive and embarrassing.  Shame on you IC."

-The company is very poorly run. For instance, shoppers were paid retroactively, sent an email after they were paid breaking down the payment (of course we had already received an absurd number of inquiries before they got the email and nobody at Instacart seemed to know what was happening), a week later, somebody (who should have been fired) decided to remove part of that initial payment to pay out at a later date, and after significant backlash from shoppers, decided to give them their money back that they had already been given a week earlier. Do you have a headache thinking about that? I do.
-Free onsite parking was revoked from tenured employees with less than 24 hours notice. The satellite garage is a joke and nobody will park there due to the distance and inconvenience. 
-People get fired left and right and nobody mentions anything about it, which leaves absolutely no sense of job security. 
-Pay is extremely low for the kind of work agents are doing."

742,Instacart,Only goal is production,2019-02-25,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Free snacks at work was the only positive thing.,"The call center that is Instacart is nothing what they perceive. They have over a dozen in management and they're just as clueless about the company as the agents they train. They push unrealistic numbers to appear to be supportive to shoppers and customers but it's a numbers game all in all. If a customer has a horrible experience first thing we're told is to suffice them with a coupon instead of resolving anything. The company is constantly shredded in the media about unfair pay everything they're saying is true. Agents are overworked and there is no real room to grow like they advertise. Unprofessional, poorly managed and no support for workers. Everyone from the top (CEO)  to the very bottom (Shoppers) has to answer to someone so they do whatever they legally can to save themselves and their position. Anything outside of this is irrelevant to them. Lastly they have a contract to hire agreement they try to push on people with Aerotek. You're promised a evaluation of your work at the end of the contract to be considered for a full time position, this is false. If the goals are unrealistic they expect you to meet what are your chances of having a "" good enough"" evaluation to become permanent? Slim to none. You have a better chance of receiving an extension to your contract or being released all together and that's cheaper for the company because that means no benefits that they have to pay out. My advice don't do it."

I worked at Instacart as a senior data engineer and I observed the following:

1) Managers manage people by fear, constant pestering and micromanaging, I had never seen a company where people are afraid of managers to the extent that they can't even joke around them until I came to Instacart

2) Mangers hold supreme power and company works in very shady ways like firing employees before they reach their 1 year anniversary so the people never get the options they were promised

3) Upper management makes a big show of engineers going above and beyond each week rather than figuring out why people HAVE to go above and beyond each week, the culture is broken 

4) No training or proper leadership, when things fail ""RCA""'s are created under the guise of documenting failures but are nothing more than finger pointing, and finding someone to blame

5) For major failures first thing managers ask their teams to do is figure out how much of the blame lies on their team and once that is found they proceed to find ways of not taking any blames

6) On-call rotation was the worst, spent 20 straight hours awake monitoring constantly breaking processes for multiple teams  and was told that I'm not meeting the Rubric standard for a senior engineer in month 2 of employment. I told them that Rubric standard won't be met after I'm being asked to work for more than 15 hours.

7) People clinging to old failed processes since people who built these processes got too high up in the company so their work is not questioned

8)Engineers are stressed beyond belief and are waiting to leave company on 1 year anniversary if they can make it there at all

9) Long term engineers show signs of mental breakdown  from stress

10) I didn’t see one day where people were relaxed and smiling


In conclusion, This company is not worth working for, this company is a stop gap solution for retailers until they can ramp up their own delivery processes to compete with Wholefoods  just like Safeway and Target did."

-Instacart will try to fire you with an automated email if your account is inactive (I became permanently disabled after the car accident and the doctor and I agreed I couldn’t return to work. I couldn’t even walk without pain.  (I was rear ended again two weeks after the second accident) 
-No clear communication- I communicated with corporate about my health and they didn’t tell the      Austin team of my accident
-Pressure to return to work as soon as possible-one if my coworkers went back to work the day after giving birth because they would give her a point. 
-Automated system-need humans that have feelings"

We need some type of mileage coverage, have you checked the gas prices in Cali??? Oh okay, y’all don’t care!  I take batches I want without being penalized (loophole). We shouldn’t be penalized anyway, were independent contractors right? Then the 20 min breaks when some work 10-12 hr days.

- Business outlook is good, simply because businesses/ companies don’t want Amazon to dominate— but there still is a future for Instacart! 
- Good people: smart, humble, and compassionate","- Inexperienced managers are common. They had been promoted simply due to longevity, rather than actual knowledge or management skills/ experience. Or they have been promoted, to incentivize employees from leaving 
- Lack of accountability. We have our core values, yet upper management is not held accountable. They talk the talk, but don’t walk the walk, which undercuts productivity, allows for incompetence to run freely, and misbehavior to go unnoticed. 
- No culture. Everyone in the company works 24/7. Management rewards people who have no work-life balance and you’re expected to do that. 
- Recently, there have been many people leaving, ranging from entry level to executives, leaving Instacart short-handed and a little chaotic. 
- Compensation is lower compared to other tech companies/ startups 
- If you have multiple offers from other companies, you should take one of the others. Join Instacart is you’re unemployed or if you’re 100% miserable. If you have offers from Facebook, Google Amazon, etc… in all honesty, you’ll regret turning those down for Instacart."

Great location in the FiDi
Excellent benefits","- Inexperienced managers are common. When I was at Instacart, I saw a severely diminished sense of morale and upward movement among my team because managers were promoted with no evidence of good management. Turnover of employees at all levels seems to be high.
- Overall lack of process. It seemed that the more difficult problems persisted the longest because of a lack of team focus and wherewithal to solve them. Some projects were prioritized because they were low-hanging fruit that made managers look good - but didn't solve a real problem. When there are processes, exceptions are made when convenient leading to problems down the line. I believe people make these exceptions because they are undersupported in a search for better solutions.
- Company goals can change suddenly and without warning from quarter to quarter. I've seen a focus on short-term profit motives halt progress on projects in motion. These decisions are poorly thought out and articulated by executives who seem to not grasp their effect on long-term productivity of employees and the long-term health of the product."

They give you a reliability incident and you have to work 30 hours to remove it. But how can you work 30 hours if they don't let you work at all? Their shopper support are useless unless it's about the customer. Basically, instacart does not care about the shoppers or drivers.

-Had an issue with the referral bonus and I guess they don't like criticism because they just ignored the problem and basically took away the ability for me to have a referral bonus at all anymore. (everyone in the store has the ability to get $1000, mine is $25). So basically they're children and threw a tantrum cause we called them out so we get $25 if we refer a friend unlike other shoppers would get $1000. We know this cause everyone else has $1000 and we the two people who were in the middle of this both only have $25. 
-You're timed for orders and often it's not enough time and it makes you do a worst job just because you want to make the time. So you're doing a good job if you're going fast not if you're getting the right items for the customer.

897,Instacart,Not worth the effort,2018-05-14,2.0,Full Service Shopper,None that I can think off at the moment.,"The pay is crap vs the stress/work. Today I had to drive almost 80km (48 miles) for an order with 5 items. I earned $25.25 INCLUDING tip. I got zero compensation for the excessive mileage. I tried to ignore the order but it kept coming back. Apparently I was the only one on shift? I also had to work an extra hour because of the time the order came in and the distance from my home. No compensation for that either. I’ve had to add more data to my cell plan, to the tune of +$50/month because they are sucking all my data. No compensation for that either. Gas is currently (roughly) $3.63 USD / gallon ($1.24/litre CAD). So ya not amused about driving 151km/94 miles today. Also, the app sent my first customer’s order (and me!) to a store no where near his house! The shopping lists are garbage. Items in the wrong category or section of the store, similar items not grouped together, sending me from one side of the store to another. Lettuce, bread, pop, ground beef, milk, muffins from the bakery, chips, apples, tylenol, deli meat, eggs. IN THAT ORDER! No ability to arrange the list that best fits the store I’m at. Total waste of time. Customer wants 5 egg plants but can only choose a weight so totally guesses. That weight ends up being twice as many as he needed. Good thing I asked! Over all crappy experience and I would NOT recommend it to anyone."

907,Instacart,Full service shopper,2018-04-22,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexibility, working on your own","I've only just started working about a month ago so I'll change this review if needed but currently my thoughts are this : they are not a people / customer oriented company. They pressure you to be faster, which I get it - speed and delivering to the customer quickly is a great thing - but they take it too far. First off, 90% of the time they send me to a store location that is not the closest one to the customer & you don't find that out until after you've already checked out of the store. That leads to the second off, there tends to be a lot of items that the store location might not carry and if you would have sent me to the location closest to the customer then that location probably would have had their items because when a customer is ordering their stuff through the app they are thinking about the location that they usually shop at which tends to be the one closest to them. Also when I'm picking a replacement I like to send the customer a message to ask them what they would prefer and talk to them about it and that makes my speed go down and it makes me look bad. I get all great reviews for my customer because I talk to them throughout all of it but instacart thinks I'm not so great because my speed goes down. So unnecessary pressure. And now, I've just checked my earnings adding today's rates + per item of the order I just did and I was underpaid. If you add in my tip, I'm not underpaid but the tip isn't suppose to count, that's extra money for me, not for you to pay me with. At the end of every shift they give you an opportunity to provide feedback and it's like I'm talking to a computer because they do not communicate with you at all they'll send messages but you can't reply to them and when I put something in the feedback I don't get an email back or anything telling me ""Oh hey Samantha I read your feedback and this is what happened"", nope I get silence. They should strive to be there for their employees and to be more customer oriented. Speed is great but accuracy and the customers satisfaction is what should be top priority. Then don't even get me started on hours. In order to get first dibs on hours you have to work 90 hours within 3 weeks so average 30 hours a week or 25 weekend hours over 3 weeks, which I only have time for about 15 a week so I have to wait to pick my hours and by the time I get to pick my hours there's hardly anything so I get more like 5 a week which I don't appreciate. I understand letting people who work more get to pick their hours first but why does it have to be from Sunday to Wednesday why can't it the people who work more get to pick Sunday and the people who work less get to pick Monday and why does it have to be so many hours to meet the requirement to get to pick on Sunday I want to work 15 hours but you're not even giving me the opportunity to work 15 hours."
908,Instacart,In-store shopper,2018-04-17,1.0,In Store Shopper,"It’s not an independent contractor position. You are a part-time employee, so you get taxes taken out.

Some flexibility with schedule. You choose your availability and they schedule you within that time frame. They say you won’t be penalized if you cancel your shift 24 hours in advance, but then they started sending scary warning emails about canceling shifts. They aren’t as flexible as they advertise.","Their underlying motto is quantity over quality. They don’t care about hiring quality, professional employees. They don’t do background checks. All they care about is that you shop a ridiculously fast pace. 

They provide an hour of training and then send you off on your own. They don’t care about quality customer service, because the don’t give the shopper enough time for that, to talk to the customer and make a good replacement for them if needed. 

The whole job is done in an app that often has issues, and doesn’t take into account lots of different variables on the job. At the end the of each shift you get a number of your average speed for the day. If you have completed a certain number of orders with the company, and your speed isn’t 60 seconds per item, they fire you. But before they do, they provide “coaching,” which is really your shift lead doing 1 order with you, to get your time for that order down. They don’t give you any special tricks to be faster, but you end up faster for that specific order because 2 people doing the job is faster than 1. 

It doesn’t matter if you are a quality employee or if your customers are happy. It doesn’t matter if you are improving. All that matters is that you meet that goal so that Instacart can get more orders. That’s how they get paid. This can be unrealistic a lot of times when you consider having to wait in long store lines or waiting for meat to be cut at the deli counter.  

They don’t pay attention to details and they set you up for failure.  

I was told that I would make an hourly wage plus 20% of the service fee given to Instacart for each order. But that didn’t align with what I actually got in my paycheck. I was lied to."

Good benefits and vacation policy - it really is take it as you need it (at least for my team - haven't heard anyone complain about it).

- Food is tasty

- Interesting speakers sometimes come in","Employee morale has dipped fairly low. While I can only speak to limited teams, managers seem either inexperienced or don't genuinely care about their employees' career development and happiness. Some managers are tunnel-visioned into delivering on company goals so they can look good to execs up top, while caring very little about whether the people down below are engaged. There's a huge disconnect between how executives vs. executers view management. 

A previous culture engagement survey showed that a very low % of employees on certain teams felt there were avenues to develop themselves and gain new skills, and there hasn't been focused effort to improve this. Culture here involves managers insinuating to their employees that any lack of morale or motivation is a direct fault of the employees themselves. To that point, I say sure, employees can try to be positive, take initiatives to seek out challenges, etc. But if employee roles are defined and positioned to maintain monotonous and never-ending duties, then their opportunities for advancement will be extremely limited despite any attempts to seek out non-core work. This negatively affects morale and makes you wonder about the purpose of your job.

Worse, some managers believe that interesting projects/skills development should be sought out on your own extra time and cannot interfere with your usual day-to-day. If that's the case, then managers and recruiters need to stop overselling these roles as career advancement opportunities or do a better job of hiring for the right levels."

New senior management has helped point this company in the right direction. Fantastic perks (catered lunch/dinner, great health care, beautiful and conveniently located office).",limited structure around upward mobility
970,Instacart,Great place to work if you like making an impact,2016-03-02,5.0,Operations Manager,"I've worked in small startups, large startups, and large corporations and have yet to find a job I love as much as at Instacart.  The service we run and are in the process of creating and defining is amazing and I've never felt that way about anything I've worked on in the past.  People genuinely care about our customers and shoppers.  Order from Instacart before you apply.  It's awesome.  It is a unique problem that isn't being approached in the same way elsewhere in the tech world or historically. 

We have a great core of smart founders, executives, engineers, analysts, support, legal, and ops team members.  Is everyone great?  No, but welcome to the work world; if you don't focus too much on those people and do your job well then they don't really matter.  I can say with certainty that I have never seen as solid of a mix of people as the I did the day that I stepped into the office and started working at Instacart.

Things aren't perfect and there are a lot of challenges.  That's why I came here.  To be a part of building something and being able to make an impact on it.  I've never seen a good idea fall on deaf ears if someone has taken the initiative to explore or execute it and make the right case to do so.  

Sure, not everything works all the time, but that is because we are growing and moving at an incredibly fast speed.  I've worked at companies that have tools in development for 15-years and they fail too.  Guess what, it takes even longer for those problems to be fixed when they arise.

Sure, there is not an engineer available to solve all of my problems throughout the day, but that's simply not how a successful organization works.  I worked on an operations team at an established company and never had the opportunity to speak to an engineer.  It's great that I can provide feedback and see ideas, or forms of them implemented, but they have to go through the proper channels.  If you want to dictate how an engineer spends their time then get a job being a Product Manager. 

Does my job change on a daily basis?  Yes, sometimes for better and sometimes for worse.  But change is good and that's why I work here.  Otherwise I'd be bored.  If something at Instacart is boring and repetitive I try to find a better way. 

Is there a clear, shortcut path for my career development?  No, but I wouldn't expect that at a fast-growing, 3-year old company.  You have to pave your own path.  Sometimes that doesn't happen at the expected or desired pace, but it will if you do a good job.  If you accept a job anywhere thinking that you are going to get promoted in six months, then you are accepting the wrong job in the first place.","As the organization grows there are challenges with team sizes, changes in work ownership, technical bugs.  Fortunately, these are speed bumps and not walls.  You need to be OK with change and uncertainty to work here.  We may have a nice office but we are still very much a startup."

Work hours are flexible and I think the work/life balance is good by startup standards (though don't expect a 9-5).","I often work on nights and weekends, but there's a lot of flexibility around when to arrive or leave so my overall hours are pretty reasonable compared to any other professional- also I like the work so I don't mind doing a lot of it.

- Free food
- Unlimited PTO
- Non-manual work can be challenging and interesting
- Opportunities to collaborate with other teams","I agree with the other sentiments shared by other reviewers working in operational teams.  Generally, the engineering/product/design orgs seem MUCH happier and fulfilled than operations. Many ops roles are sold as strategic and analytical during the recruiting and interviewing process. However, the reality is that overqualified folks are performing extremely manual and repetitive operational tasks because of a lack of automation. Think thankless work like checking the weather daily to predict traffic delays, cleaning up data by merging duplicate products one by one, clicking the same buttons each day, etc. 

As with any technology company, internal tools break, bugs arise, or there simply may be too much growth and scale to continue operating using a historical process. There is an unspoken feeling that Ops must still work around those challenges by performing even more manual tasks to the point where the work is beyond ridiculous and time-consuming, instead of ""bothering"" engineering about automation or optimizing tools. This dynamic seems to be a result of a lack of communication, empathy, and understanding in the entire company (including ops management) of what each teams' day-to-day work is comprised of and how roles can get better so that we improve as a company and operate more efficiently. Automating these tasks could free up Ops time and allow us to work on strategic, high-impact projects that require brain cells rather than mind-numbing work that has become the status quo. Unfortunately don't see this changing any time soon."
