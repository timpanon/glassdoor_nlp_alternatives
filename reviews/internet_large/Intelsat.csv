Good benefits and decent salary.,"This is a company that is going to need to be honest with itself and it's massive management and leadership mistakes. A few years ago a senior executive was was recruited into the company after a very brief tenure at a previous company. We were all warned that along with the new executive would come a group comprised of family and friends. Read that again, ""family and friends"". It was the unspoken secret. It was a catastrophe. Dynamic and smart people were bullied out the door. Intimidation and dismissive comments became the norm. New organizations were created not to benefit the company but to find placements for the incoming friends and family. A lucky few figured out how to climb the corporate ladder by joining in on the junta. The results showed very quickly. There was a steady brain and passion drain and the business suffered immeasurably. Now the company has gone private. All of us who worked hard lost our stock benefits. We sit on zoom calls and each week we find out another person simply left the company, exhausted with the remaining culture and the lack of enough resources to complete objectives in a realistic time frame. What has been the result? Those of us who foolishly stayed are now watching as the same executive who bullied and berated others in public is walking out the door with a $1 Million parachute. Yet , the rest of us watched as our stock shares have become completely worthless. It's humiliating."

Some nice people.,"Antiquated systems and highly manual processes make doing efficient accurate work almost impossible. The team routinely works until 1am to be SOX compliant and they STILL often fail. This company's financial statements are at high risk for material misstatement despite extensive manual workarounds. Add to that the enormous debt and declining revenues, and increased competition, a competent finance professional would do well to stay clear of any association with the financial statements, particularly revenue, of this company.  The pressure on this department is very high in a no win situation. This pressure will inevitably push finance leadership to make questionable high risk decisions. They hyper focus on small yet politically sensitive areas while ignoring more relevant issues. Some middle management is not seasoned enough to lead staff. The Visa sponsorship allows for highly skilled low paid accounting staff from abroad to be extremely overworked. Questionable ethics."

CEO and Senior management are in line with this.  They are hiring outside industry people to help drive this change.  I think its a good time to be here,"High debt is bit concerning.  But it seems they have a plan to deal with this.  They moving people out of cubes and into ""benches"" to fit more people in the building, but  no one likes this.  No privacy.  But to be fair, even the executives will loose their walls.  But offices should not be about fairness.  It should be about effective workplaces and some sense of personal space"
105,Intelsat,Hopefully Intelsat will adjust for the road ahead,2018-08-20,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"You get to work with incredibly knowledgeable personnel within cross-functional teams that understand the satellite business.  The company has the widest portfolio of offerings within the satellite industry.  Senior leadership is ahead-of-the-curve in terms of understanding the challenges + opportunities facing the industry and is able to discuss the vision with employees at a high-level.  Often competitors imitate Intelsat innovation 12-18 months later.

In the first six months employee feedback is greatly desired by leadership, but considerably less after a year unless you have established credibility internally.  This is easier to do if you have prior satellite industry experience or background in the Media, Mobility, and Broadband verticals.  Else, it takes longer for outsiders to establish themselves, and thus leads to company disenchantment.","Satellite industry fixated on the growing planes/trains/automobiles/IoT needs and have overbuilt capacity via numerous high-throughput satellites (not to mention the LEO constellations to come).  This has led to a 25-30% pricing decline annually per NSR, and the trend will most likely continue as more capacity becomes available.  Thus, consolidation within the industry is likely (much like the dotcom era).

Salary is competitive within satellite industry, but not the larger technology market.  Thus, employee churn is high due to higher salaries and better advancement opportunities elsewhere.  

The new product launch success to gain customer share-of-wallet/spend has been mixed due in part to lack of senior leadership capability to perform these developments, limited dedicated resources for these efforts, etc.  

Crafting low-risk partnerships don't engender loyalty and exclusivity from vendors or resellers, unlike a majority share purchase.  For example, SES' MX1 acquisition and subsequent integration enables for more vertically integrated transport provider to meet customer future needs than a reseller partnership because resellers may look to be acquired in the future and want to avoid restrictive partnerships that may prevent that.

While US minorities (i.e. Asians, Hispanic, etc.) feature prominently in Engineering, Operations, and Strategy leadership roles, the Commercial (i.e. Sales, Product Management, Marketing, etc.) and Finance teams are exclusively Caucasian.  This has led to new hires commenting to how ""white"" Intelsat is at tradeshows, which showcases the old-school nature of the company and the satellite industry, and not the more inclusive nature of the larger telecom/technology sector.

Despite being a global company, nearly all promotions require a move to the Tysons location (with London being a backup of late) without the appropriate salary cost-of-living adjustment.  This reduces viable applications internally and possibly externally.

Promotions from within are rare at middle-management and higher staffing levels, and preference for external hires with new perspectives are preferred.  Mentoring + succession planning doesn't exist, although there was an email recently about creating a mentoring program soon."

114,Intelsat,The downhill trend continues......,2018-05-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Some of your colleagues are the smartest people I have ever encountered and willing to go the extra steps to ensure that the job gets done.,"The NOC was moved to a tiered format with one tier responsible for a majority of the work, but still understaffed and still getting roll over work from other tiers that are untrained or simply not logging into the phone system properly.  Training is still nonexistent despite months of promises.  This is leading to a clear lack of customer service and experience.  Tools are being rolled out to the operations floor that are incomplete or just barely functioning and the people working with the customer are expected to work around issues.  These factors are basic stressors that become exponential when you look at the fact that several employees have quit and the NOC is barely able to support itself.  Should anyone take a day off, then on some days coverage for a skill set does not occur.  Often employees are tasked with double or even triple duty responsibilities and when becoming busy with troubleshooting one action, if something happens to the other duties, the employee responsible is questioned as if this was their only task in the world.  

      The NOC is treated as the whipping boy of the company and other departments often dump their unwanted work on the NOC or speak to the NOC as if the people there have no basic understanding of the skills they were hired for.  Too many instances, the NOC is bowing down to the demands of sales, or customers and asked to violate standard procedures for the sake of a sale that may not even happen.  

     As being one of the most stressed positions, pay or advancement in the NOC is abysmal at best.  This year, our bonuses were small and raises not occurring until mid-year, basically resulting in a half raise for the year.  The pay is well below industry standards and employees are noticing this quickly and leaving for other satellite companies."

189,Intelsat,Intelsat by departing employee,2015-09-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Lots of smart people. 
Good pay and benefits. 
Good location in McLean next to Tysons Center Mall.
Interesting and challenging work. ""It really is rocket science""","Location (if you live in Maryland). The evening commute is the worst.
Not as much authority delegated down as in the past.
Benefits have declined over time.
Some good workers cut when not-so-good ones stay."
190,Intelsat,Not great,2015-09-21,1.0,Developer,"Benefits are great, above average by today's standards","My particular department, IT, is dysfunctional. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. Resources are staffed poorly, technology and equipment are old. No upward mobility throughout this department. Morale is low. However, I see that other departments are not like this and they seem to be happy in their jobs."
191,Intelsat,Senior Software Engineer,2015-09-15,2.0,,"Flexible Hours and nice people, decent benefits","Low pay, no career growth and although people are nice, team spirit doesn't exist"
192,Intelsat,"Interesting work, Multi-cultural and evolving",2015-08-27,4.0,Senior Manager,"The core business let's you be involved in projects that have a global scope and impact. The staff mix is truly multi-cultural - can't imagine anyone ever complaining about discrimination based on race, gender, religion, etc - we have it all here and openly accepted. New building/offices engendering a fresh perspective from the more conservative, risk adverse organization it has been.","Staff tend to stay a long time, thus advancement for new-comers can be slower than companies with higher turn-over rates.
Quality of your experience very dependent upon your line-mangement, some of which can be very hands-on, micro-managing.
HR/Management nearly 100% side with managers in instances of Manager/Employee conflicts - regardless of situation/facts."
193,Intelsat,Left on good terms,2015-08-22,1.0,Senior Yechnician,Great people who care about maximizing service to the customer. Working toward a standards model of operations to eliminate perceived differentistion and individual locations.,"Promotions are hard to come by, and in too few departments those are motivated by merit rather than politics (ie most promotions are political) Employee morale is low and innovation outside a limited number of departments is seemingly discouraged."
194,Intelsat,"Good, but could be great",2015-08-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Good work environment. Great managers.,"HR has no clue what the employees do. Hard to match salaries to ""market rates"". Fiber technology is quickly encroaching on our customer base."
195,Intelsat,Good Company to Work For,2015-08-04,5.0,Operations Technician,"I enjoyed the training I received, and the flexibility of my work schedule.",Nothing negative at this time.
196,Intelsat,Not so bad...,2015-07-13,3.0,,Salary and benefits are a plus and the primary motivation.,Management needs to do a better job at listening to staff and finding solutions.
197,Intelsat,Engineering Job at Intelsat,2015-07-11,3.0,Senior Engineer,Great people.  Challenging work.,"Benefits are gradually being trimmed back and, while still fairly good, the company is not differentiating itself as much from others.
Recent move to Tysons Corner has made commuting very difficult for many., although company is flexible with work hours."
198,Intelsat,lots of debt,2015-05-14,3.0,Vice President,"Good Benefits, good people, cool technology","Short staffed, heavy work load, highly leveraged company"
199,Intelsat,Manager,2015-04-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Good benefits but it was going downhill.,Full of bureaucracies and legacy people.
200,Intelsat,I gained a lot of experience in satellite communication and the industry as a whole,2015-04-02,4.0,,"Intelsat has been a leader in the industry and having been originally a multi-national organization, it offers excellent diversity of its employees",Intelsat's regional presence can be stronger.
201,Intelsat,Intelsat General,2015-03-28,4.0,,"Wonderful atmosphere to work, comfortable and clean","Very little upward mobility, advancement"
202,Intelsat,Program Director,2015-03-24,4.0,,"Great work environment, diverse responsibilities","Industry is consolidating, utilizing few of the people who have the greatest amount of experience and years of service."
203,Intelsat,Long term stability; short term fumbles,2015-03-03,3.0,Network Engineer,"Intelsat has aggregated a functionally-operational fleet of bandwidth and supporting personnel. When it comes to keeping the system working and satisfying customers, there is always an overshoot of attention, resources, and work cycles to address a problem. Very senior, industry veterans populate the ranks, from management to engineering to technicians.","Industry trends are motivating corporate change, and Intelsat has a hard time adapting. From the perspective of the employee, it's almost impossible to execute on a long-term, majorly-beneficial project. Most of the attention is spent on revenue generation. This short term mentality has existed consecutively for many years, creating an enormous burden on engineers today. An engineer can't do the best job; he has to resolve to do the job enough and then move on to the next one."
204,Intelsat,A very interesting place to work with high expectations from employees,2015-02-12,4.0,,"Fascinating domain (satellites)
Employees are smart, highly educated, multi-cultural and a real asset to the company
A lot of cool new developments going on","High pressure high workload environment for some groups while others seem to cruise along.
Company switched from being formally engineering-driven to now being sales-driven and the pendulum has not fully stabilized yet."
205,Intelsat,Not what it used to be...by far,2015-01-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits but dwindling by the day. Interesting industry. Lots of smart folks in the ""Engineering and Business Development jobs"" and most are good to work with. Big on Customer service.","Very little chance for advancement, Very understaffed especially in back office. Was a very ethical organization - now not as much. Work life balance? They don't want you to put in over 50 hours per week but don't miss a deadline and they take ""other things as assigned"" very seriously. Constantly trying to lower pay grades by restructuring. Management has no issue in telling consistently good performing employees of 10 to 15 years or more that they can take a demoted of 3 grades or take a hike. So much for loyalty. Very low moral."
206,Intelsat,Good place to make decent money,2015-01-14,4.0,RF Technician,The pay is good but not great.  The Atlanta economy helps though.  The culture is very laid back and management is very accessible.,"There are a lot of entry level jobs and not many promotions so when one does open up there are a lot of potential candidates making the odds to get a promotion early very difficult.  Furthermore, there is a very distinct class structure in the office with the NOC technicians being on the low end and the 9-5 office staff and engineers being on the high end."
207,Intelsat,Just Run,2014-09-08,1.0,"Operations Technician, RF","You still have a 401K... Weekend Pay, Shift Differential, and Holiday pay still exist at least for now.  You get to work with old out dated equipment....",Work Life balance does not exist.  Double standards are present everywhere.  Promotions are given based on popularity and sucking up versus knowing your job.  If you know anything then you are expected to take the brunt of all the work.
208,Intelsat,Great company for career and professional growth,2014-07-24,4.0,Senior Manager,"Top technology, great people, and never ending opportunities to learn and grow with cutting edge technology.",A boat load of work and priorities and extremely few hands especially on the engineering side of the house.
209,Intelsat,A place to work.,2014-07-17,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"New building.
Most people are friendly.","Now located in Tysons Corner.
Unless you leave before 4 you are going to be stuck in traffic. 
Segregation of teams can be a nightmare for who owns an issue."
210,Intelsat,Top of the satellite food chain; Good leadership; Stable; Excellent benefits; Fair pay,2014-05-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Respect for work life balance - have had leaders be supportive during tough times outside work. Very ethical environment. Riegelman, Guillemin, DeMarco are some of the best leaders I have ever come across.",Promotions incredibly difficult to come by due to flat org. Slow moving. Hierarchical.
211,Intelsat,"Once challenging, now punishing",2014-05-11,1.0,,Great people who really desire to care about the service provided. Company is the leading edge of new technologies in complete communication networks.,"Limited opportunities to advance, some groups are highly political and punish people for failure to get results from old, heavily used, unsupported, undersized equipment. Distinct lack of true merit promotion, arguably schizophrenic with regard to degree requirements."
212,Intelsat,It was getting tough,2014-05-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"challenging assignments.
nice work environment with generally great to deal with people.","increasing workload with fewer people and many old timers retiring or being laid off.
annual reviews could be improved with reviewers not being boxed into a certain model of performance distribution that could only be applied to a large production line and not a small group of a few people, who can all outperform, but yet someone must be perceived to be average for curve fitting sake."

215,Intelsat,Miraculous results with Legacy Equipment,2014-02-25,3.0,Senior Engineering Technician,Ability to provide services with new requirements using very old and legacy equipment infrastructure.,"Lack of commitment to adopt the newer standards required for media transmission. Resistant to new ideas provided by common employees that require growth and capital. The company fails to realize that by purchasing the equipment upfront for the different remote locations, you will save on operating costs involved in shuffling services around multiple areas to complete all the necessary requirements."
216,Intelsat,"Wonderful people, uninspiring leadership, desperately in need of new ideas.",2014-02-16,2.0,,"Proud history, smart colleagues, reasonable hours, excellent 401K plan, interesting work. Intelsat has a core of very bright, dedicated employees who believe in the company's mission. They make the place tolerable.","Management is woefully out of touch with employees, insular and hardly visible post-IPO. Extremely hierarchical corporate culture. Majority of benefits doled out by one's title (VP, director, etc.). No investment beyond symbolic gestures in rank-and-file employees. No equity for anyone not in upper management. Low morale, with very little willingness to change failing management practices, largely due to management's insularity. Culture of blame-shifting, with lower-level employees always taking the fall."
217,Intelsat,IGC is changing,2014-02-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great Benefits, President is a Top Notch professional.  Challenging work environment with excellent chances to excel.","Mid Level Management is lacking.  Recent departures of key VP's has hurt the company.  Some of the new ""Directors"" have minimal experience but have been given authority to make crucial decisions which are impacting the bottom line of the company."
218,Intelsat,I enjoyed the time I was there,2014-02-07,4.0,Interactive Marketing Manager & Webmaster,"Corporate communications and HR keep staff informed of company benefits and events through email and staff website.  They offer great benefits like an onsite nurse and doctor, full fitness facility, cafeteria, and the opportunity to develop a career path within the organization.  The salaries are competitive.  Coworkers are friendly and the nature of the business is fascinating.","Getting to and from the office in DC rush hour traffic was rough.  Also, not sure if it was due to the nature of my position, the length of time I was there, or how the office space is designed (or a combination of these things), but I felt isolated from coworkers outside of my department. The upside is they are moving to a new location with an open-plan office space.  This is great for some and a downside for those who prefer their own office."
219,Intelsat,The experience was very good,2014-01-13,4.0,,Very professional people that are very intelligent,A lot of work which pushes you towards your potential
220,Intelsat,Once a great place but going down hill fast,2013-12-31,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work can be challenging and exciting, good benefits.  There are some very talented and sharing people and folks try to work together.","Management is aloof, has no concern for individuals and treats them as such.  Promotions and opportunities go to those that meet a certian demographic / profile.  Hard work and contribution do not matter.  Very hierarchical with poor management and decision making.  Management ranks are filled with ""yes"" men who will lie to cover themselves and are more interested in shifting blame and infighting rather than building the company. 

Work life balance is non-existant.

Individual contributors will only hear what they have done wrong with no other feedback.  As a result risk taking no longer exists.

Executive managment is completely out of touch with individual contributors."
221,Intelsat,7 Years was OK,2013-12-22,3.0,Senior Video Operations Technician,"Good Co-Workers, Technology, Engineers, and most Customers. Full time monitoring of video services was very interesting and educational at times.","Training of new non-technical techs because of department reduction and combining made it almost unbearable. New phone recording system was ok, until management wanted to start evaluations with them...Stack Ranking for pay raises and bonuses doesn't seem to work too well."
222,Intelsat,Hot and cold.  Still trying to escape the bureaucracy.,2013-12-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some good people, overall great compensation and benefits.  Good respect from industry and customers.","Very siloed, and stuck in the 1970's bureaucracy.  Missed a real opportunity with the PanAmSat acquisition to escape the Intelsat mindset, but many of the PanAmSat leaders have left leaving older bureaucrats to do the work.  Fortunately the industry is not very innovative so it's not a big problem.  But they're missing so many opportunities to really excel."
223,Intelsat,This is the (Best-Worse) Job I have ever had.,2013-11-16,2.0,Field Service,Interesting customers from around the world to work with. You get to work with some of the newest satellite technology in the industry. The Job itself is interesting and engaging. Benefits are above average.,Pay is average. The entire promotion and raise process is appalling and is only getting worse now that we are a publicly traded company. Middle and upper management show little to no concern toward their employees. Each year the work load increases with fewer people.
224,Intelsat,interesting,2013-11-07,4.0,,The company is extremely social and people talk to each other all the time. Very friendly. Management isn't too bad as well.,The tech is slightly outdated and pretty conservative about supplies.The supplies are also really dirty and often don't work.

229,Intelsat,Getting Worse,2013-07-21,1.0,Operations Technician,You receive a shift differential and weekend pay.  Holidays are double pay if you work them.,"Expect to work Holidays.  Expect to work overtime.  Work/Life balance has fallen by the wayside.  The management will lie to your face and will not listen to any complaints.  You can not turn to supervisors for any technical advice, that is if they are even present that day.  The rate of advancement is dismal."
230,Intelsat,Intelsat is a great company that cares about its employees and their interests.,2013-02-13,5.0,Flight Dynamics Engineer,"Current location, plenty of work, flexible hours and dress code, liberal leave policies, friendly, international workforce, many opportunities for expanding your experience, exposure to the myriad facets of satellite operations, sales, capacity management, etc","The new location in Tyson's is not optimal for commuters. The compensation is on par with the industry, but does not seem to try to be in the top percentage of salaries."
231,Intelsat,Technician,2012-10-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Benefits are alright. For now.,"Management is terrible. Lots of lying, stalling and fudging of numbers. Do them a few personal favors and they'll throw other people's money at you to keep the favors flowing. Area is high crime, too. Maybe it's contagious."
232,Intelsat,Disappointing due to failures of leadership.,2012-09-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Benefits package comparable to other industry leaders, and the name recognition of the company. Experienced employees willing to work with and train less experienced team members. The current 12 rotating shift schedule.","Lower management refuses to stand up to upper levels of management  in the interest of their employees. There is a lot of playing favorites in the company. Company sponsored training is almost non existent. Frequent change just for the sake of change, not to improve any processes. Lack of interest from management on work and equipment installations being done and documented correctly."
233,Intelsat,Great place to work,2012-09-07,5.0,Senior Engineer,Company goes out of its way to keep employees happy.,Don't have too much bad to say.
234,Intelsat,Industry giant neglects dedicated workforce,2012-08-13,2.0,Principal Engineer,"The quality of the people that work here is high and the type of work is very interesting.
Pay is about the middle of the rest of the industry, benefits are above average.",IT support is awful.   Work load is continually increasing and does not look like this is going to level off any time soon.  Poor IT support makes an already heavy work load even tougher to manage.   It can take a long time (over 2 years ) to get a promised promotion.
235,Intelsat,Good for Resume If Nothing Else,2012-05-26,1.0,,"Resume addition.  Decent amount of sick days.  Decent 401K.  Affordable health plans, good dental and vision plans.  Opportunity to work with customers world wide.","The company does not provide a decent work schedule, and expects you to completely rearrange your life at the drop of a hat.  The employee turnover takes too long to replace anyone who leaves.  The work seems to just be increasing every month with less people.  Instead of hiring to cover for lapses, they would rather have people work multiple 12 hour shifts many times a week.  Respect is nonexistent in many cases.  Very old school mind set.  Low growth ceiling for many positions. IT department is incompetent."
236,Intelsat,No career opportunities here,2012-02-27,2.0,Principal Revenue Assurance Analyst,"Nice fitness center, nice benefits",Below market pay and no career development opportunities
237,Intelsat,Things going downhill.....,2012-02-17,2.0,,The company offers average salaries. The benefits package is above average. Health plan options are affordable and there are several options. 401K plan is excellent.,Working conditions have been on a steady decline for the last 8 years. Incentives have been discontinued. Tools available to employees are outdated and inefficient. Management has failed to maintain an acceptable amount of employees due to turnover (As a result of the current working conditions). Turnaround from the time an employee resigns until a replacement is hired can be as much as 5 months. Management has shown complete disregard for some of the divisions within the company. The amount of work has doubled in the last 8 years yet the amount of slots have been reduced. This could be a great place to work. Unfortunately Management has not done a good job at providing a positive environment for employees.
238,Intelsat,Rewarding Career Potential,2011-07-25,5.0,,"Good Training, Good Advancement Opportunities","Bad Work Schedules, no rotation in current department"
239,Intelsat,Decent people. Good place to work,2011-07-22,4.0,"Senior Communications Operator, Carrier Management Center",Company is making lots of money and has a history of retaining their staff. This is the place to be for anyone interested in expanding your connections within the telecommunications industry. Intelsat has a large multinatiional customer base and some travel opportunities.,"""Old school mentality"". No one wants to fight for change because they're afraid to lose their jobs. IT sucks. The company is generally behind in terms of technology integration."
