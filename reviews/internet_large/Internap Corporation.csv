30,Internap Corporation,Stay Away from Support,2020-09-08,1.0,Tier II Technical Support,"I worked for the company for a number of years, through a large number of managerial and executive changes - both as INAP and as companies prior to acquisition.

Pros:
- The pay is almost competitive. This will vary depending on which physical office you're based out of, what your position is, etc, but pay rates I've seen have at least not been outright insulting.
- Most of the people in support are pretty cool people.","The list below is just a few things I could think to outline without going way too in-depth. I left because these cons combined into a feeling of total chaos at INAP.

- Executive leadership is constantly changing, and as a result, the company changes direction and goals constantly.

- Company recently underwent bankruptcy. 

- Management within the support department makes no effort to hire employees with an acceptable base level of knowledge. Support Technicians are not given product-specific training on many products that INAP offers, but are expected to support those products. There is no structured training for support staff new hires. ""Sink or swim"". I cannot emphasize enough how bad the training situation is at INAP, if you've ever worked anywhere with a respectable training department, you will be stunned.

- Support is expected to cover 3 ticketing systems from several of INAP's acquisitions, all of which have different offerings, scopes of support, and different methods for working cases and working with customers. This is all handled using 3+ documentation systems, with wildly outdated documentation.

- Management, to their credit, is desperately trying to both manage the team, and deal with constant angry customer escalations. Unfortunately, they tend to fall short on both. This is because most rational organizations create new departments to handle certain workloads (such as scheduling, training, etc) so that management can focus more specifically on employees, customers, or both. Management carries the burden of most of this, and it shows.

- Orlando's 'Upper' support management is invisible. He gets on conference calls, and disappears in his office while the normal 'managers' desperately try to keep the wheels turning. Occasionally he will come out into the Orlando office after slamming several Red Bulls and yell about sports, TV, Politics, or some combination of those, so that the team knows he exists. He has no leadership qualities.

- There is a huge issue of lost or tribal knowledge. There are a ton of ""legacy"" things within INAP (aka things INAP obtained through company acquisitions) that people just don't know fully how they work anymore. Things that were built by people who left years prior, which were never documented properly but are still in production. In the best cases, there may be '1 guy' in the company who still knows a thing, so if something goes wrong, you're left chasing that person hoping they can help - even if they're not involved in that department/product anymore.

- ""Pizza Party"" levels of morale building."

I am really excited about our new CEO. He is a breath of fresh air coming in and seems like he is actually working to make positive changes, focusing on improving culture, listening to employee feedback, and just improving business operations overall. I finally feel heard by leadership, which is something I haven't felt in a while. The company is also handling the COVID-19 situation well. They have put the employees first and smoothly transitioned to all non-essential employees working remotely. I'm impressed with the leadership and grateful they are in no rush to make people go back to the office. Good perks - commuter reimbursement program is awesome, gym subsidy program offered and nice offices and office location. Good work-life balance, understanding and down to earth leaders and coworkers.","I didn't feel like leadership listened to employees or tried to communicate, but with the new CEO and leadership team I am really hoping this will continue to improve.

Qualified people are let go to make room for the ""good ole boys"" that have no idea how to succeed in Colocation. Unqualified people are brought in because management is ""comfortable"" with them despite their lack of qualifications.

Bonuses will be rescinded without any justifiable reason, your manager will change the terms of your compensation plan to suit the company's needs, and you will never receive a transparent answer to any questions about the business or operations. It is a regular practice to have no compensation plan in place until nearly the second quarter of the same year.

If you try to provide a nuanced answer to a customer instead of bending the truth to get a contract signed, you will be punished or taken off the business. This is a place where mediocrity is rewarded. If you want to excel, you will be marginalized, even if you are pulling more than your weight and helping the company make money.

INAP went through some very significant challenges a few years back.  I wasn't here, so I don't know why. I assume that leadership got complacent.  Since then, an almost entirely new leadership team has come on board.  And I don't use the word ""TEAM"" lightly.  These folks are single-mindedly focused on building the business and have an ABSOLUTE - can do attitude.  If you are interested in a ""sales driven"" company (aka a company that focuses on supporting customer acquisition and development), this is your place.  In my brief tenure, I've requested leadership support on at least 5 key initiatives: 1) Additional hires, 2) Marketing lead gen campaigns, 3) Channel, Broker and Customer promotions, 4) A ""grand opening"" event, and 5) Sponsorships of key events.  In each case, I was fully supported by leadership.  In terms of our ""offering"", with the acquisition of SingleHop, the company shored up its ability to deliver the most relevant solutions to the market, in line with what every target customer is challenges with - Hybrid Infrastructure solutions, Disaster Recovery Services, Managed Cloud Services, Colocation, High Performance IP, etc.","Anytime a company undergo's significant change there are going to be those that grasp and embrace the change and those that don't.

-Great place to learn if you want to and have the drive.  There is a lot of opportunity and hard work is rewarded. 
-Good benefits.  After going through the recruiting process with other companies and seeing what they offer, it was a bit of a surprise just how good INAP's benefits actually are when you compare.  Multiple plans to select from and company contributes to an HSA account if you elect that plan.  You don't even have to do anything to get the money, just be in the plan. The cost of benefits can be a little high, but its not outrageous. 
-401k with employer match
-Starting to offer more perks.  There are monthly chair massages in the Atlanta office and free snacks.  Employee referral bonus.
-The people are all very friendly and appear to genuinely want the company to be successful.","-Departments are very lean, which can lead to internal delays as well as burnout if not monitored appropriately.

-Communication is a constant challenge.  Figure out a better way to get information out to employees.  Its nice to have meetings and send emails out, but at some point all the meetings and emails get to be too much . It has been getting better, but there is always room for improvement. 
-Legacy systems are antiquated.  There are still a lot of manual tasks that should be automated with systems upgrades (i.e. invest in the systems!! this is a constant issue that must be addressed to move forward and be successful).

But the cons outweigh the pros.","Employees are the LEAST valued asset of the company.  Company has consistently fired high-quality, high-experience workers for absolutely no reason other than to cut costs at the expense of customer satisfaction.  There are LESS workers doing MORE work and it shows in the quality of service provided to customers.   There are critical positions in the company where only one person is trained and there is no backup plan.

Never expect to get a bonus at this company.  Work you backside off to take care of the customers and the best you can expect for a bonus is some swag like t-shirts and coffee mugs.  The executives just bought out another company for $132 MILLION CASH, but gave ZERO bonuses to the people in the trenches who actually do the work of supporting customers every day.  This demonstrates extremely poor judgement on the part of the executives.   Not even a token bonus was offered.

Healthcare plan is horrible.  HIGH premiums.  Horribly HIGH deductibles.  You also have to fight the insurance company CONSTANTLY to pay for any kind of specialist care or non-generic medications.

People are usually friendly. Some managers in the whole company know their stuff and actually listen to the needs of their employees, and try to help their employees.","Where to start?
- Salaries and work load: Underpaid and understaffed for the amount of work. You have enough work to last a lifetime and a little bit more.
- Job security: You never know when the person sitting next you is gone for good. There has been massive layoffs these past few years.
- Environment : The work environment is at best toxic. With years, the environment in the offices has worsened to a point to become untenable, and extracting the motivation, hopes and dreams out of the employees directly into the dustbin. 
- Organizational: The company has undergone so many restructurings since I've started that I don't even know who reports into whom. At one point, the company tried to integrate the ""iWeb"" organization, then gave up and put the whole company for sale. Now, they're trying to rebrand as INAP, but keep iWeb as a brand.
- Communications: There is a huge lack of communications within the company. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. On the other side, some of the communications are just badly written and/or badly targeted. I do have to say that it has been getting better.
- Employee benefits: Most of the benefits were cancelled since I started working here. 
- Human Resources: Not sure what the whole point of HR is at this point, if they let the environment become toxic.

With all of this, no surprise that the employee turnover at INAP must be the highest in the business."

116,Internap Corporation,Level 1 Sysadmin/tech support,2017-07-27,3.0,Systems Administrator,"- Good place to start your career, you will learn a lot in your first year
- The team and supervisor are helpful and they will answer your questions so that you can improve
- If you work weekends and night, there will be only 3-4 people and it's a very relax atmosphere to work in
- Many different cases/support tickets, at level 1 you will work with Windows, Linux, cPanel, DNS, email issues, spam infection, etc etc.. 
- Salary has improved in the last year, if you are new to this career it's a good pay to start and you get a good raise  if you are promoted to level 2 support","These are not flaws with the company, more like the challenging realities of a job as tech support.  Read this and decide if this job is really for you or not.

- shifts: 24/7 schedule and 6 week shift rotation (day/evening/night), the supervisor does their best to accomodate everyone's preference but sometimes you will get stuck with a 6am or night or weekend shift you don't want. If you prefer the normal 9 to 5 week job, you will  find it difficult. 

- since this is a technical support job, you will face some ""special"" clients that have ridiculous expectation or do stupid things.. patience is essential, managing the client's expectations as well. 

- phone calls, if you do night shift be prepared to call a client in India to tell him that his server has been compromised by malware or rooted by chinese hackers and he needs to reinstall everything.

- multi-tasking: be prepared to work on 2-3 different ticket at once, and be able to divide your attention between several tasks. The attitude in technical support promotes solving issues fast, and you will be expected to reply to a client within a 2-4 hour SLA.

- Stress: the shift rotation, the ""special"" clients, and mistakes that you will make when you learn make this a difficult job to do for a long time, in my opinion. Physically, sitting in the chair for 10-hour shift, I had a lot of back pain and I gained 20 pounds in 1 year (make sure to adapt your diet and exercise habit, I did not and payed the price)

- internal tools: since iWeb is an old company, a lot of the tools used internally and some of the services sold to clients are out-of-date and will never be updated. Expect to learn to work with some interesting software that has almost no documentation, you can only learn by asking the guy next to you who was there longer, or figure it out by yourself.
I can't blame them for this, it's just the reality of a large company - it takes a long, long time to restructure and implement new tools and services because we cannot have any downtime."

- To have a relaxed ambiance where you can work in your own bubble unless you're on the night or weekend shift.

If you came over with the manager, you're golden. You can be promoted multiple times in a year, get failed certification exams covered multiple times in a row, and basically get away with murder. If you're not in that club, you will be left to languish no matter how hard you work to climb the ladder. You will be promised a promotion, given the workload, and when the pay becomes available, it will be allocated elsewhere and you'll still have the workload.

Company wide, turn-over is atrociously high (95% or so), and the most talented people leave because they just can't deal with poor management and ever-increasing workload stemming from a do-more-with-less attitude, even though the money is there to add on headcount.

The company was great 3 years ago, but the Voxel acquisition was rocky, the iWeb acquisition was a disaster, more than half the VP's and SVP's have been replaced at least once, and even the CEO was given the boot because he was trying to do right by the company by not being willing to sell it for scrap.

Internap breeds a culture of fear. Unfortunately, there is not the ability to bring up problems in good faith without fear of retaliation.  Employees are often blacklisted.  If someone is rumored to step out of line, word goes out to disassociate with that person.

Extremely poor management creates completely non-sensical workloads for the rest of us, and there is no forum to openly discuss better ways of doing things.

Rather than doing things in an organized way that makes sense, people routinely spin off their own system (wikis, ticket systems, OneNote systems, etc). Once there is a spinoff on a different platform, it’s very difficult to bring it all back in.

All that matters internally is perfuming the company for an acquisition (read latest recommendation by Russell Glass ), not actually fixing anything long term and support problems.  This strategy has resulted in way too many sales reps, way too few internal R&D and support people, and no smart processes.

This is a decent stepping stone if you are “stuck” in colo and want job with responsibilities further up the stack that could take you more interesting places later on.

If you form personal relationships with people, you can get things done.  (Unfortunately, that is the only way to get things does as there are too many larger systemic problems, as seen by the previous company reviews. Everyone is disorganized, limited by toolsets, and stepping over each other. )

For the most part, Internap is made of good people (albeit in a horribly managed company).","Internap has two core dysfunctions, each of which feed off each other — it grossly understaffs internal roles and it grossly overstaffs external roles.  This is in no way sustainable.

Together, these two dysfunctions result wide array of bad behavior: tearing others down, passive aggressive leadership, destructive gossip, conniving politics, and abundant negativity.  Internap has rapidly deteriorated these last few years as it absorbed Voxel and iWeb.

Take the grossly inflated sales staff, for example.  Compared to other companies, Internap has significantly more sales people, especially when you look at the business expected in a local market.  This created all sorts of burdens on the “skeletal staff” (as previous poster put), and without the right organization and processes, people quit without releasing proper documentation. If there were fewer field people, less churn, and retaining good people who think about leaving, then we internal people would likely make less mistakes on service delivery.

The effort needed to pull off very simple tasks inside Internap is enormously complex, so it’s not surprising at times when people stumble, 

Talk candidly those who know Internap, and you will see that this trend has been around for years. Marketing and HR lately have started a “bread and circus” campaign (jerseys, awards, parties, etc), but it does little to address the root of the problem.

Silo’d department are an understatement. Unnecessary hierarchies leads to only “manager talking to other managers”, which unfortunately results in loss of translation like the previous poster said."
197,Internap Corporation,"Skeleton crews, silos and no support for anything technical",2015-04-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Internap offers access to an incredibly diverse set of enterprise technologies, whether that include IP, Colo or Hosting.  There are some really great people who are nothing short of brilliant, and legitimately want to help make Internap better for customers and staff.  Additionally, the company has expanded a lot in the last 4 years, bringing in Voxel and iWeb to enhance their Cloud and Hosting portfolios.

There is a 401k with 50% match (up to 6%).

CEO is a pretty cool guy.","Very few of the brilliant people here are around long enough to make a difference, usually because they're chased away, or just aren't being given what they need.  If you work in any type of cost center (IT, MH Support, DC Ops, SOC, etc), expect to be doing the work of 3+ people, because when people do leave, the positions will seldom be filled unless it leaves a complete vacuum.  INAP also doesn't like to invest in current staff (training, promotions, raises, etc).

Company wide, Internap likes to pay on the low end, and benefits have gotten worse since I joined.  The stock options that were promised were never delivered because of ""technical issues"", 

Departments are also very silo-ed.  Sales never talks to support, support never talks to engineering, engineering never talks to IT, etc, etc, etc.  Considering every sales order has to go through 6 or 7 departments to even become real, and none of those departments ever communicate, it's a miracle that any accounts exist at all.  Don't expect any of the documentation generated by the Solutions Engineers to ever make it to the NOC.  It's all like that children's game, telephone, where the message that's sold is 110% different from what's heard by support after build-out.

In addition, Internap would rather hire people to sell the product than to actually make sure the product works, and the culture is to simply not talk about it.  Our FCP product literally hasn't been updated in almost 10 years, apart from changing the Network Cards to 10Gig, yet we charge 5 to 6 figures for it, when much newer, more capable devices from other competitors can be had for an 8th of the price.  There just isn't a desire to invest in the products, or the people who make them.  This ""Don't talk about it"" mentality extends to how we deal with paying customers, too.  There are no forums, status pages or knowledgebases that a customer can access.  If you want to know how to do something here, you have to pick up the phone and hope somebody is available, or email in and hope you get a response the same day.  Currently, or ""Enterprise"" CDN's portal looks like it was made before the DOTCOM boom, and it (nor the featureset behind it) have been updated since, and rely on dead technologies nobody uses anymore (Java.  Really).  To better illustrate this point, all of our engineers in all technical departments, in all data centers and offices in the world, still don't equal just the headcount of the Sales organization, or just the Marketing organization.

Looking closer on the support departments, some sections are so devoid of headcount that staff isn't  allowed to take accrued vacation time, and more people are leaving, and there seems to be no intent to fill the 7+ already empty seats, much less the 2 or 3 soon to be empty ones.

To make a long story short (too late), get in, get the experience you want, then go somewhere else.  That's what everyone else does here."

(Company is really two companies — iWeb and Internap.  Each has its own IT infrastructure — chat, messaging, email, inbound leads— and iWeb reps have further territory reach than Internap reps who cover smaller patches.)

Company is moving towards more self service sales tools, and other internal resources are being used for renewal. This is generally more efficient and the direction that the market is moving.","Many regions have a 60% rate, and some are even as high as 80%.  (We just got 8 new sales reps after the last exodus.) This creates a huge burden on all levels of the company, and internal BUs and operations teams tend to create additional buffers and processes in order to shield themselves from the extra workload from newcomers.  This extra overhead is incredibly inefficient.

If you are sales, be careful with accepting new accounts. Customers at Internap tend to be very unhappy with what last desperate AE promised. Inherited accounts tend to be inherited problems.  These problem accounts will take 90% of your time, and you will STILL be penalized for a write down.  Probably best to just hunt for your own accounts and set expectations early with your contacts.

“Success” at Internap usually means one of a few things: inheriting one of the top accounts, being favored by your market manager so that you get MQOs, bringing in your own contacts, and sticking around long enough so that you can cherry pick the best stuff from the last AE who churned.

Under our new commission plan, if we are not at 100% of your quota, we only get paid a small fraction of our total commission.

Internap is an environment that rewards inaction more than it does action. As the previous poster said, people at offices try to appear busy when they really are not. It’s amusing, but understandable given how some of the best ideas have been met with great resistance. (Seriously, be careful with feedback. Got a great idea?  Keep it to yourself if you want to survive.)

BU resources are stretched then, but are unfortunately the gatekeepers on all approvals. Something as simple as a one cabinet colocation quote can take multiple approvals, and if there is the smallest problem, it gets kicked back down to the sales rep to redo everything."
199,Internap Corporation,Low pay compare to market,2015-03-24,3.0,,I web has a friendly young work environnement and people like to relax on Friday afternoon with beers and chips.,"I WEB HAS low SALARIES for tech cie, compare to the montreal market  they are at least 20 per cent lower"
200,Internap Corporation,One step forward and two steps back,2015-03-24,2.0,,"Networking team and NOC are pretty sharp, but many other areas of the company are severely lacking.

I think most employees are trying to do the right thing, but it's more of a skill problem than a will problem.  Obviously this is a generalization.

Salaries are competitive.  

Great product for customers.

Executives are trying to make things better, and there have been several good improvements over the past two years.  I really liked it when they reached out to employees for feedback and also when executives held the ad hoc innovation competition in the 3rd quarter of 2014.  Both of these efforts were great.","Lower to Middle management adds little to no value in my department.  Internap puts non-technical people in charge of technical people and gives the technical people very little voice in decision making.  

Internap is a small company which acts like a big company.  Hierarchy and rank are valued over good ideas.  

Some people take advantage of the disorganization by sitting at their desk and pretending to work instead of actually working.  This is not the norm, but it happens enough to be noticeable.

When key positions are vacated, those key leaders' positions stay vacant for too long.  This causes a leadership vacuum, and the surrounding incompetence flows into the vacuum created by the missing leader."
201,Internap Corporation,mixed bag,2015-03-15,1.0,Data Entry,"Stock at an all time high.  Internap is benefiting from cloud adoption at large.

In 2015, a lot of cool things are predicted to gel together nicely.  Over last two months, company has made good strides in that direction.

Here in Atlanta, Internap is at the top end of tech companies.

Lots of intern positions are available here.","Internap is still an extremely turbulent environment. This week, another VP left (one of the best ones). In 4 key VP positions, we've had 2-3 change outs in a little over a year.  This not normal or healthy.

This culture does not tend to promote from within, so many people who want to fill key management role are told that they're not a fit.

There is some truth behind the ""sexism"" and ""racism"" criticism.  Women of color have it rough here, and they are heavily discouraged from bringing forth complaints of favoritism.

Internap has an obnoxious culture of hero worship.

If you are feeling under-appreciated, best to get another job and then come back later.  This is not an environment that works with you while you are employed with them.

In other metro environments, you can almost always do better than Internap.  Compared to these other tech companies in different markets, Internap will seem backwards.

Reports about crumbling NOC are true. Internap is not investing enough there, and customers are leaving because of a bad NOC experience."

I have been with several companies and this is the one that I call home. Benefits are very good and you are always learning new technologies.","So the thing about Cons, is what you make of them. Leadership direction: we are in a constant state of flux because we have to be in this industry. The leadership has pushed us from a simple IP company to add - colo - Managed Hosting - multiple Cloud products. For some this is hard task to grasp, if learning new technology is not for you then Internap is not for you. Work-life balance -- that is up to you...no one can manage your time for you."

I've met some great startups my first month here.","I feel like I've made a huge career mistake.  Every day I feel micromanaged and do not have basic sales support.  It took me many days to get a login so I could start quoting.

At my first sales kickoff in Atlanta, there was hardly any new product information.  There doesn't seem to be much innovation here."
206,Internap Corporation,Still Struggling,2015-02-06,1.0,Account Executive,"Technical talent is excellent (just poorly managed).

Internap marginally improves as iWeb people take over key roles.","Bringing ""cloud"" to Internap is like bringing democracy to China -- it may sound great, but it is next to impossible to implement given senior management's misunderstanding and lack of experience with cloud services.

Hardly any sales training on product line, internal processes, or quirks of quoting tools.  Internap must fix this ASAP with the current churn in the sales force. 

Sales is KPI driven, not results driven. If you inflate your engagement metrics, then you get the leads.  We are told to have a pipeline of 20x our quota, which is unrealistic by industry standards.

Frat culture on sales teams.  Sales kickoffs are more like spring break than they are professional meetings."

Internap's future is in self serve and turn key solutions.  Now it just has to execute on that plan.

Individual people here are okay to work with.","Cloud strategy is murky, particularly with iWeb executives scheduled to leave.  Given the mass exodus, it is not clear how Internap can pay off the millions of dollars in debt that it incurred purchasing iWeb and Voxel.

Internap has lost a critical mass of people in several departments.  When people resign and don't leave behind documentation or update coworkers, then the rest of the company suffers deeply.

Support is abysmal.  NOC managers are forced to tell customers with major networking problems that a tier 2 support person will not be able to call them back for several hours."
211,Internap Corporation,"Interesting product, good team, lots of potential",2014-11-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good product focus and roadmap, hundreds of happy customers in several countries, good revenue growth, strong team that is easy to work with, awesome office in NYC, good recent hires, more investment recently from parent company is great with more to come","Downtown location may not be ideal for all, it can take some patience regarding IT and HR issues sometimes (like getting a laptop or password), make sure top performers paid very well"
212,Internap Corporation,Convoluted Sales Strategy,2014-11-04,1.0,Sales,"Engineering talent is top notch, just poorly managed.

Internap's portfolio is fairly well rounded. Problem lies mostly with poor execution and integration.","Selling at Internap is like being given toy weapons and then sent to the trenches. If you are ever successful, it will feel it is in spite of those around you, not because of them.

Senior sales reps will tell how they went 6+ months or even a year without a sale, and when they do become successful, it is often because someone gave them a break or they inherited accounts from someone else.

Internap tends to throw unequipped people at problems and then blame them when things go wrong.  (The mass exodus at NOC, BU, and sales being the latest examples.)  New hires often feel like they are set up to fail.

The new sales model has not been thought up properly. Senior management is pushing to make field reps more like inside sales, and more important than performance is now KPIs (e.g. pipeline must now be 20x quota).  Sales reps now grossly inflate numbers just to keep their job, and these inflated numbers now create all sorts of other problems and extra work throughout the organization."
213,Internap Corporation,difficult if you play by the rules,2014-10-31,1.0,Sales,"Good environment for learning about complex managed hosting sales.

People in HQ generally want you to succeed.","Internap sales is a harsh environment if you play by the rules.

Over this last year, accounts not covered well were broken up and distributed. Account reps was told to only work on only their particular accounts.

Some reps still called on other's accounts, and then when they found an opportunity, they asked management to change in SalesForce.  In many cases, management still allowed the account change even though most people played fairly."

I have been given the freedom and trust to get what I need done. Its funny because you see most people that write reviews are the ones that leave. That probably means they weren't doing so well and anyone will be frustrated if they don't succeed. I know a lot of people who have worked here for years that love it.  But, this is a sales job and not everybody likes sales. Great starting pay, good benefits,","There is some disconnect between sales and upper management.

NOC people at Internap have a great name in the industry.  Field sales and customers are good at connecting NOC people with opportunities.

Ex-NOC people are always looking for new people in Atlanta, Seattle, and New York.  Hosting guys in Cali and cloud guys in Montreal are extremely good.","Almost everyone from Voxel is gone, leaving our internal system (Ubersmith) with little support.

Large IT problems hamper our productivity in NOC.  IT is horribly unorganized, even by NOC standards.

Annoying ""officers vs enlisted"" attitude between newcomers and management. 

When you bring up issues (and solutions to address them), management overreacts by pushing back with answers like, ""Do you even want to work here?""   Not the sort of environment that inspires people to fix problems.

HR does little to fix people problems in NOC.

Best way to survive is do as little as possible.  Here it is best to simply be mediocre than to interfere with someone else's fiefdom.  Consequences are harsh.

NOC is exhausting.  No matter how long you are up on major problems, you have to get up super early each day.

Sales reps and solution engineers can get clingy, which makes it hard to move on to big problems that affect everyone.  They escalate everything which makes it hard to focus on the real priorities.

This is not a healthy place for people with families.  Benefits got worse, and you have hardly any time outside of work."
217,Internap Corporation,Could be better but not the worst,2014-10-20,2.0,,Great coworkers and team effort,Management just does not have their finger on the pulse.  No real future goals to succeed just treading water at best.
218,Internap Corporation,Great product ruined by poor management,2014-10-16,1.0,NOC Engineer,"Good benefits, lots of products to learn, fellow employees are a great resource to learn from.","Where to start. Staffing in the NOC is a huge issue. People are burning out very quickly due to upper management and corporate introducing new products to customers and telling the NOC to troubleshoot it without teaching them how to support the product. This leads to too few employees doing far too much work. 

The culture of upper management is an exclusive club. They don't speak to their subordinates on issues, they constantly dodge questions, yet they are still employed. The managers that didn't adhere to this left the company feeling very burned out. The solution for solving an issue when they request to speak to a manager? Page the on-call person to handle it. 

Provisioning is a mess. So many of the orders handled are done incorrectly and with nobody to review the orders before they are activated. This caused so many customers to get free service. When these issues were brought up to management it was swept under the rug and ignored. If a company has lost revenue for 6 straight quarters common sense would say correct this issue. Not the case here. 

The IT department is an absolute joke. The NOC knows more than the A+ certified IT team yet has no power in correcting any of the issues. When systems break the night crew is often forced to wait until dayshift shows up to correct the issue. Even if it's affecting customers."
219,Internap Corporation,Going downhill fast,2014-10-08,1.0,N/A,"Internap has a good name with certain niche markets (gaming, ad tech), so having it on a resume is good for some.

High employee turnover provides young ambitious people willing to work for less an awesome start.

You now get a special t-shirt if you are here for several years.","It is incredibly hard to get things done through the corporate offices in Atlanta. The startups that Internap bought generally has a ""can do"" attitude and diligently help find the ""path to yes,"" however Internap corporate seems to make little effort in keeping good talent, so many key parts of the original technologies goes completely unmaintained.

Hardly any career opportunities exists for minorities.

An ""anonymous"" survey was sent to everyone recently, but since it was clearly not anonymous, few people took it or wrote anything too honest.

Many more layoffs rumored to happen.  Not a good time to come here if you want to stay long term (but great if you just want something temporary or simply want a check).

Lack of sales enablement and product marketing make it difficult to sell products easily. Only way you can sell is if you have an incredibly close relationship with inside people who can give you the right technical information.

Products like FCP are horribly outdated and lack support.  Customers who purchase the product (with support) get virtually no help when they call the NOC.  Companies like Noction have a much better product for the value.

Sales organization is in constant turmoil, thus making the recruiters a fortune.  Earlier this year, the sales turnover number was calculated to be something like 65%.

Morale is at an all time low for those trying to sell.  There seems to be little strategy for unifying different products into a single a compelling value proposition, so marketing pitch comes across as cliched."

There's no work life balance at Internap.  Vacation time is difficult to schedule due to the ""always understaffed"" way that they arrange the teams.

Buy-in is needed from everyone so it takes a long time to make decisions

Everything seems to be done last minute with little thought going into planning - general mindset of do it halfway now and fix it later

Can't turn off work - expected to be available at any time 

High turnover in general - about 50% and higher in sales - rare to meet anyone with tenure longer than two years

Not a very social culture overall - don't expect team sports, lunches, happy hours or christmas parties
 
Not a lot of interaction with senior management- very tiered/lots of middle management, little communication from the top

Very cheap - will choose the most incompetant vendors in the name of saving a dollar/management questions every nickel and dime spent to the point of exhaustion

Don't invest in employees - use them and lose them attitude/not generous with company bonuses

Inflexible- vacation time is accrued, so if you don't have it when you need it you are SOL - not willing to work with you"

249,Internap Corporation,No CTO = no collaboration,2012-01-17,2.0,,"VP leadership seems to be in place now, just need someone above to incentivize them to work together.","Departmental technology silos strained ability to get anything done across the boundaries.
Managers did little to discourage silos and so implicitly furthered silos.
Some groups attempted to work with others, but a few really self-interested apples spoil the bunch."
