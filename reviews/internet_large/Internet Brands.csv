- for my position I was paid about 5 grand more than I was at my first job 5 or 6 years prior. Also promised a rocket plan with a 5 grand raise every 6 months. So far only given 1 of 4
> long hours (sometimes up to 200hrs a month)
> high turnover
> poor documentation
> bad communication throughout teams and management
> Deadlines not respectful of employees' work /life balance
> Often handed incomplete code bases or jira instructions and expected to know what the gaps in information are
> Poor communicators are more annoyed you don’t understand them rather than trying to improve what their communicating
> Management and devs are often spread thin in their tasks and asked to do too much. That strain is carried on to workers. 
> PMs disorganized on who’s available, who and when to give tickets, and often times turnover leads to lack of information on who can be assigned to projects
> Speaking of turnover, we’ve had several people leave on teams who have specific information on projects that often times we don’t get the information that only they have for specific repos that slows down work flow and consequently can lead to lower levels of efficacy in the code. 
**On a personal note, In my 2 years at IB at least 4 people have occupied Senior Director role and by the 4th time the position was open, it was blurred for a bit who was even in that position. It could have been 2 people but there was little communication and no one answered emails. This was an important position to talk to especially when contacting issues about management and about stress and pressure of the job so we could alleviate some of the deadlines. But because of turnover, every time a pressing work matter was explained and they could help remedy those conditions, a new boss comes in and we have to recontextualize the problems PMs and leads under them are putting on the team.
> Consistently told to go faster. I caught covid and didn’t take a day off because we needed to meet a deadline. That’s how much pressure I felt to get something done for the company by people over seeing me.
> There are also a large amount of employees on H1B visas at the company. I suspect that lower pay comes at the benefit of covering visa/green card sponsorship. But if you're a citizen, you don't benefit from this. However, as expressed by colleagues to me, they do feel the pressure to be more ""behaved"" and not push back on work loads or deadlines especially for fear it could cost them to lose their job which jeopardizes their status in the country.
> Current team lead and manager, while maintaining work formalities and skirting the bounds of what was appropriate, asked me questions trying to figure out what HR and I talked about in recent meeting regarding work relationships and job related stress. It was very uncomfortable."

21,Internet Brands,The Best Place to Start Your Career,2021-12-14,5.0,Corporate Recruiter,"If you are a recent college graduate or looking for a career change, Internet Brands is truly the place to go. This company will truly build you from the ground up to set you up for success in your career, and best of all, their entry-level roles are truly entry-level, unlike other companies that require 3-5 years of experience for an entry role - I started Internet Brands with no recruiting experience and learned rapidly.

Another bonus is the work/life balance. Once you clock out, you are done for the day, no pressure to reply to late-night emails or anything of the sort.

Great benefits, especially if you are a recent grad.

Organized and caring management that truly wants to see you succeed. Also, diversity and inclusion is a top priority for the company and is reflected throughout all ranks.

Overall, this is a great company to be at where you will be surrounded by amazing colleagues, rapid growth opportunities, and a collaborative work environment. If I was not given the job opportunity of my dreams, I would have never resigned.","While the compensation tends to be on the lower end, it is fitting due to the fact the company tends to teach candidates with less experience instead of hiring candidates with years of experience already."

24,Internet Brands,"You deserve better. Join if you must, get out as soon as you can.",2021-11-24,2.0,Technology,"Work-Life Balance: Line- and Middle-managers understand that you're being paid an unethically low wage/salary, so they tend to be understanding and have at least a soft commitment to work/life balance. Unless you get a really bad manager, you won't be expected to ""go above and beyond"", ""give 110%"", or always be available. In that sense, this will not be an intensely stressful job outside of work hours

Job Security: Among the technology department, there are so many legacy systems to maintain and new companies being acquired that there's basically a never-ending amount of work. Plus, because head-count is kept brutally low, you'll always have something to do! Aside from COVID, layoffs are extremely rare.

Opportunity: the constant turnover from your colleagues getting better opportunities elsewhere and leaving means that, if you're competent and try even a little bit, you'll have an opportunity to ""shine"" a little bit and increase your skillset, and possibly even attain a better role and title. You'll still be pathetically underpaid though, but if you're looking for an experience play, you could do worse.

Experience: if you're just starting out your career, this is a great place to learn some painful lessons early on. You'll have an immense appreciation for what a healthy culture and environment is when you compare it to your time at IB. You'll learn how incurring years of technical debt makes improvements and innovations almost impossible. And you'll learn that most companies have zero regard for you, and it's up to YOU to make the right moves for your own career.

People: the people who DO stick around tend to have great personalities, in the sense that they maintain a grim optimism in spite of the awful overall conditions and culture. Others will be extremely angry and bitter, but they tend to leave pretty quickly.","It's been written plenty here on Glassdoor, but InternetBrands compensation is truly bad, and it stems from the strategy at the top. Successful companies nowadays are embracing a 21st-century mindset that the company IS the people who work there. That's not the philosophy at InternetBrands though. It's abundantly clear that to top leadership (starting at the very top with Bob Brisco), employees are not the life of the company, but are reduced to a single value on the quarterly balance sheet in the expense column, and leadership wants that number to be as absolutely low as it can possibly be. How do they do this? A breakdown:

1. Offer well-below-industry-average compensation for open positions. The only people who accept will be either desperate for a job either due to financial reasons or because they're just starting their career and will take what they can get.

2. For positions that ""can't"" be filled (because anybody qualified for it in the US won't accept the low pay), they abuse the H-1B visa system to pay an immigrant even less. This helps mitigate the turnover risk, because it's VERY hard for someone on this visa to change jobs. It's highly unethical.

3. Keep staffing levels at absolute bare minimums. If a team would ideally have 10 people, it'll have 7. If a team needs 8, it'll have 5.

4. Similarly, if someone leaves, there's no rush to fill the position. Other people on the team will pick up the slack for a few weeks or months even.

5. Do very little actual innovation or product-creation. To build something new, you have to risk failure and unprofitability. It's much easier to buy an existing small profitable company, cut their benefits and stop giving them raises, and cycle out those expensive salaries from the holdovers who get discouraged and move on, replacing them with new low-paid replacements.

6. Dangle a carrot for new-hires, which is a soft-guarantee for raises. The way this works is, yes they'll acknowledge that the starting pay is low, but this plan will steadily increase your pay regularly, until it caps out at about 80% of your actual market value today, but it'll take 18 months to get there. Oh, sorry, it's taking longer to get your raise processed for some reason. Don't worry, it's coming! Oops, your next review ALSO is taking extra time. Oops!"

You WILL be worked to death and there is no work/life balance, You are expected to be available 24/7 even when you take a bathroom break or PTO to deal with family emergency and don't be surprised if you get a call during a funeral of family and expected to attend to IB instead of your approved time off. I don't know where those that claim there is work/life balance are working but it is not for Internet Brands. 

Compensation is below market and in many cases it can be deemed insulting. Salary increases, try .5% and then expect it to be presented as a windfall for you. 

HR is a joke, don't allow yourself to be fooled by the company photos Internet Brands posts depicting itself as a large happy family with company activities. Most of those photos are of the HR group themselves who had a party every other day pre-Covid as that is all they seem to be good at doing. 

Speaking of Covid, they absolutely don't care about anyone anyone's health or well being. The CEO is eager to bring everyone back ASAP and if he could find a way to get past current city and state mandates he would. As it is now there have been cases of people infected in the building and all they do is send a generic message stating that someone somewhere sometime in the building was discovered or reported as being Covid positive. Right now they are starting to allow people back on a volunteer basis. Soon they will start packing everyone back in as much as they can."

Benefits are absolute crap, HR is a joke. It's a constant revolving door of people going in and out of the company. During Covid they didn't care about their employees safety at all.

41,Internet Brands,Dumpsterfire Incarnate,2021-08-11,1.0,Director,"You get a paycheck. After that, it will depend on if you were hired by Internet Brands or wound up there through an acquisition.","If you are part of a company they acquire, you're gonna have a bad time.

At best, you will get termed with severance and find a new gig. How much severance, etc. probably varies quite a bit. If you don't get eliminated by a reduction in force, then you'll get to watch Internet Brands wipe out the vast majority of your former co-workers, either through terminations or through making working there so miserable, leaving is about the only option.

Internet Brands races to the bottom in terms of how they seem to look at their staff. Staff members who were ""too expensive"" relative to what they underpay are usually in the layoffs. Once the dust settles, they look to backfill any skills/needs lost by hiring someone who costs significantly less, generally has less experience, and will likely cause more problems rather than filling in for the lost talent.

After that, be prepared to get whatever benefits you had before wiped out. 401k, medical, etc. are all bad for most normal corporations, but particularly abysmal for a ""technology"" company.

Finally, if you are still there, be prepared to be entertained by their bungling management of their acquisitions. They are hopelessly lost in just about every facet of their technology stack. Almost every decision is driven by cost, regardless of everything from contractual obligations to common sense.

Basically, if you wound up there through an acquisition, you'll either get laid off, quit, or watch them run whatever you worked on before into the ground until they extract every last dime they think they can from it. 

Was that stuff you worked on growing? Were your revenues increasing? Not anymore. You'll find it's impossible to maintain growth when nobody invest in your platform anymore, while only giving it the minimum needed to try and keep extracting whatever former value it had.

If all of that isn't enough, you will also get the distinct privilege of being blamed along with your business unit for the ""huge"" costs of keeping all of you employed there. The more revenue declines, the more everyone in the business unit will be blamed. Can't get the work done due to understaffing? Knowledge loss? System failures? That's your fault because clearly you are incapable of doing more with less.

So, if you were acquired by IB, that's unfortunate and hopefully you can land somewhere better quickly.

We're you hired directly by IB? Then you are most likely the cheapest body they could find to do whatever it is you do. You are either being underpaid relative to your worth, or you are probably a new drone to help manage the cattle."

They allowed the company they bought, which was the one I worked for, to keep some of our perks and benefits which is nice because Internet Brands has crap benefits and culture.","Oh where do I begin. For starters, they issued a statement during Covid-19 that there's no work week. Meaning you need to work around the clock, including weekends and vacations. 

They kept pushing for people to return to office as cases were increasing.

When I asked about professional development, they told me to look for free classes. When I asked if there's funds available, they said yes but it's PREFERRED that we go to free sources first. Meaning you ain't getting it.

When I asked about what I needed to do to get promoted, I got the runaround for 3 years. I kept working harder, longer hours, and had no life outside of work. I did everything they asked and more. Still, I was considered an underperformer.

They want more with less money. I never got a penny for any projects I worked out. I had to learn new skills to get the job done, which is their MO. Get employees so fed up that they teach themselves and save them a pretty penny."

70,Internet Brands,"Soul-sucking, only cares about shareholders",2021-03-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None that come to mind.,"They laid off a bunch of employees because of COVID and then held a company-wide meeting showing us how much more money they made than they had the same time last year. (Meanwhile we were all put on pay freezes for 6 months. We were still expected to perform the job duties of any promotions we received, without the compensation. We were not given back pay.)

The CEO sent out a video telling us all to work harder to get the shareholders more money (again, in the middle of COVID). Said we shouldn't be making ourselves unavailable during our off-hours or vacation time, since we're a global company and need to be available to answer questions for coworkers in other time zones. It was so bad that our company's president sent an email apologizing on the CEO's behalf.

Won't stop pushing for us to return to the office prematurely. Can't figure out that the increase in productivity they claim they saw might be due to the fact that none of us have to commute anymore.

Great employees keep leaving ever since IB bought our companies. No one can stand working for them. They don't like innovation or creativity (both things that our industry requires in order to thrive and compete with similar companies). 

Internet Brands is only a good place to work if you love working yourself to death so rich people can collect paychecks they didn't earn.

Oh, and they are making fake Glassdoor accounts to try to increase their rating. It's a running joke among employees."

151,Internet Brands,Only for the desperate or lazy,2019-12-16,2.0,QA Engineer,"This is in terms of QA.
* Very casual in terms of office culture and work load.
* Never felt pressured with a deadline or felt overworked.
* For the most part, can set your own schedule and are free to change it once in a while.","* The salary pay is abysmal. Easily under $20-40k in comparison to other companies. Bob Brisco once sent an email stating how he was affected emotionally in seeing homelessness in El Segundo to the point where he created a townhall meeting to discuss issues to tackle the problem. I just find that ironic seeing how little he pays his employees who are probably in debt with school loans and that he also paid a lot of money for WebMD. I once found an intern job posting that listed a hourly pay that was higher than my salary once.

* The turnover rate is high with people leaving at a consistent rate. This is most likely due to the first point where the pay is low enough, that people need the job in the mean time to look somewhere else.

* The products you work with are horrible, which is also due to high turnovers and low pay. They tend to not work for the most part which makes it difficult in performing ""Quality Assurance"". So developers end up leaving and then the replacement takes a while to come since the salary pay is bad and have a bad product to work with.

* Some business verticals are stretched thin in comparison to others, so QA in one team is fully equipped to handle their needs since their verticals makes the most money, while others are left dry.

* The company only hires interns for QA and I was as told this specifically from the higher ups. The QAs that are not interns were promoted to full-time so when someone from QA leaves, it creates a gap until another intern comes in and has to go 3 months of training before they can replace someone. You will also probably with outsource workers which might creates issues with communication.

* You are easily disposable in QA. As in, someone left and now we are moving you from one team to the next to fill in that role. Which leads to issues where now your work schedule might need to adjust if you have a outsource team to work with also.

* They pay increases are laughable. They give you $2500 pay increases every ""performance review"" which happens ""quarterly"". It hasn't been ""quarterly"" for a couple years and also the base salary you start with is so low that the pay increase, while being something nice and you always want it, is still disappointingly low. When an intern was promoted to full-time, I also learned that they ended up with a higher salary than me. I don't know why that is or the reasoning, but it still to this day, frustrates me.

* The company is just cheap in general. You can tell instantly by the squeaking chair you sit on for the first time with the old dell computer, monitor, and keyboard. This year, full time employees finally started to upgrade to Windows 10, but I feel this is because it would cost more money to pay Microsoft for Windows 7 support. They also stopped paying for TestRail which is the tool that we use the most for QA. The only money Bob wants to spend on is another website to recoup the cost by shoveling ads all over the place.



The following is for any potential interns that apply.

* The interview process is too long and too involved for what you are going to do. I had to do a phone interview, an online hacker rank test, an additional phone interview, and then an in-person interview. It took a month to get the job.

* Despite taking years of schooling for your degree and the interview process, you will most likely not even write a single line of code. You only have one shot of writing code in a daily basis by doing well with automation training and that is your only opportunity. If you don't do well, you won't join the automation team and you end up doing normal QA in some vertical. All those years studying Computer Science for nothing.

* You can ask to basically start your internship over by asking to change into a ""developer"" internship, but that also mean re-applying once again, but not before finding someone from the higher-ups to let you. I have only seen this happen 3 times after around 30 people that have came and went from the company.

* You are done after 3 months. You will have learn everything the company can offer and you can either just keep the easy money and get full-time employment or find somewhere else to put your degree into. Their job description might give the impression that they might not, but that is a lie. You WILL get a full-time position offer. Why? Because of the high turnover rate. Average time to full-time employment is 8-10 months, but you will get it.

As long as you can write code in general, it should be easy enough to get the intern position, but will be annoying how long it takes. The pay is bad, but the work load is easy and you can set your hours whenever and everyone is friendly. So if you are just an incredibly lazy person, this is just easy money. If you are desperate to find a job, THIS has to be your final choice. I can only recommend it if you cannot find anything else."

Outside of working in retail, this is my first real job.  Been at Internet Brands for just over six months and it's honestly so great.  I don't think I can speak for everyone else, nor should I, but my experience has been just as described.  Joined as an Account Manager with the understanding that if my performance was good, I would get a bump.  I did, and I'm looking forward to graduating to my next level in 6 more months.  

My manager has been here for a long time and they're great.  The training is great.  And my co-workers are great.  

I'm still on my parents benefits, nor do I really care about a 401k match, but they have it, and by all accounts all the benefits are good.  

My team has weekly lunches which are awesome.  The company itself doesn't do many companywide events, but there are little things like snack days and over the holidays we had a party.","Maybe I'm too new to corporate jobs, but everything here seems great.

Admittedly I left IB for what I thought was a better situation: more pay, cool product, pizza Fridays.  And I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I really missed IB.  I missed the work, the managers, there's something about the environment and camaraderie here that is really intoxicating.  If half your life is at work, I'd rather work in a real environment rather than a façade where nobody is productive and everyone is a month away from being laid off.    IB is no frills, great people, solid products, and ultimately, reliable and consistent.","I think truly indulging in some of the things that I ultimately left for would ruin this place, but a higher base for most would go a long way."
196,Internet Brands,It's...Different,2019-04-10,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Been with the Company for almost a year, and can safely say it's one of the more unique businesses I've ever worked for.  

Agree with a lot of the reviews on here that mention the company moves fast and is challenging.  The environment is a bit ""figure it out as you go,"" which has it's pro's and con's.  On the pro side, as someone who was previously micromanaged, I appreciate the autonomy.  I never feel like I have someone watching over my every move and feel like my manager has empowered me to make decisions that truly affect the business.  Trust that is almost startling at times.  It's amazing and completely different from anywhere else I've worked.  

Benefits are the same as every other organization I've worked for.  Standard medical plans.  3 weeks vacation.  401k match.  

Something I didn't read on here that maybe others are taking granted...free parking.  My last two companies charged a monthly fee.","More direction and communication.  Actually surprised this hasn't been fixed, but echo the thoughts of others on here.  I work in one vertical and know nothing about the others.  Also, to my above pro, ""figuring it out as I go"" is okay, but having more direction would be much better."

Since I first started, everyone has been super helpful and in our team there has been no turnover.  I know for other groups, they may see more, but our team has been mostly the same for my entire time here.  My manager and lead are helpful and my coworkers are fun and smart.  I've learned a ton, and can't say enough great things about my team.  On the corporate side, everything is pretty basic.  401k match just got rolled out, which everyone seems pretty excited about...though I'd prefer tuition reimbursement or fitness reimbursement.","Agree with others on the compensation, it can be way better, but I think you could say that everywhere.  My biggest gripe is that though my team is great, I know nothing about the rest of the company.

Though the above is something I personally like based on being at companies that were all talk, it'd still be nice to have some events, meet the other verticals, get a top down perspective on the organization.

However, it may depend on the team that you are working with.","Management don't care much about people. They don't appreciate quality work. There is not much scope for promotions or bonus or even a growing path for professionals. Salary increase may or may not happen. There is no clear vision on the growth of the products they work upon.

If you think turnover at fast food restaurants are bad, wait until you see this place. They're always looking for ways to cut costs and drop morale as low as possible. The break room constantly runs out of coffee, tea, and even drinking water. There was almost an entire week where no drinking water was availible and no one seemed to care.

Compensation is about 50% of what most other Bay Area companies pay, and probably 25% of what the top companies pay. This is why turnover is so high. At nearly every weekly team meeting, it's announced that someone has just put in their 2 weeks. It's so common that I'm actually more shook when there's a meeting and no one quits. They company expects lots of work to be done, but refuses to reciprocate. 

No one really cares about the company so it's easy to work hard and be recognized, however only C-suite executives from IB headquarters have the final say on on raises and promotions so those don't happen often. Interns here are seen as extra-disposible despite promises of full-time offers after 6 months. No intern has been converted to full-time at this location for at least a year.

There's only 3 types of people that work here: 
1) New grads / late career changers - this is an easy way to get into the tech scene for recent grads and people who went to bootcamps

I can’t say that I had great work life balance here. The hours are long with very minimal work to do and an overstaffed team. The hours could definitely be shorter for the amount of work that they provide.

-Boring, and you'll probably be working in a boring industry
-Extremely crowded

I left after 3 months because I was so bored. 

Think about this critically. Internet Brands is NOT a tech company. They might market themselves as that (like wearing casual clothes) in order to attract talent, but it's a conglomerate of companies. They're essentially a private equity firm owned by another private equity firm (I'll admit, being owned by KKR means it's good - FOR THE INVESTORS, not you). The sole purpose of this company is to acquire other companies within their 4 main industries and strengthen their verticals. They're going to find whatever company is willing to sell, find it's inefficiencies, and then gut it and make it more profitable. They're trying to increase their profit margin by any means, and that's why the benefits and pay are lacking. 

To put it into perspective, they're the biggest fish in the smallest pond. Look at the industries they're in and the types of companies they acquire. They're so niche, that the play is to acquire as many niche markets so that they eventually own most of the market.

If you're looking for a job, okay, then do it. If you're looking to grow and challenge yourself, and make the most of your time working, then there are way better opportunities out there."

It's a successful and growing company, decisions are very customer focused and data-driven and tend to be implemented after a team discussion.

Strong leadership, C level executives are strong and knowledgeable.","I have directly managed employees who couldn't get used to their role (or new role) w/in Internet Brands for a couple of reasons, hope this helps. 

a) IB can be a challenging environment to candidates who don't easily get used to change.  It's a fast paced and growing environment, which opens up a number of opportunities as roles/tasks/responsibilities may change because of change in priorities. 

b) It could be frustrating for candidates who get used to the status quo and/or expect to be constantly told what to do. It's a fairly entrepreneurial environment where all team mates (especially the ones w/ a longer tenure) are encouraged to independently lead and/or bootstrap solutions/ improvements.

My advice: as always, learn as much as you can about the company and the individual divisions/sites you are considering (and their teams)."

Workload is not overwhelming, but you aren't learning anything either.","The kitchen is WAY too small and there are only two working microwaves for a hundred people on the floor. There are only two fridges which are always packed, so you're lucky to get a spot for your lunch. You have to spend time shuffling food around just to get yours in. 

People are paid so low that everyone has to bring lunch everyday, yet the facilities don't support the amount of people using them. There's barely room to sit in the lunch room when it's busy, which is why the majority of people eat at their desks. One of the fridges has been leaking huge puddles of water for months, thus decreasing the available space for food even further. No one seems to care to do anything about this, even though it's a health hazard. Someone just keeps putting up a yellow cone over the puddle as a solution.

Free food happens maybe three times a year, and it's gross and clearly the cheapest option when it does. 

Overall the company is not generous across the board. Health insurance premiums are just as expensive if not more expensive than just getting a plan on your own. Raises may as well be nonexistent, and there's no way to get additional vacation days even after you are there for years. 

If you are anything lower than a manager, you have to clock in and out if you want to get paid, which is frustrating as you have to be a slave to time, which really impacts your life in the long run. There's no work from home policy (unless you're salaried) even though there's no reason to come into the office everyday, especially when this is an Internet company. If you aren't going to pay your employees more or promote them, you need to provide SOME other benefits to keep people interested and working hard."

Bob Brisco came up exactly once when the acquisition was happening, and talked a big talk, drinking champagne as he spoke to the employees with lots of pretty words about how he would be improving the company and our lives. Little did we know at the time that he has to approve every single raise (even a cost of living increase) for all near-1,000 Internet Brands employees, and that he runs the business by cutting corners in every possible way, to extents that didn't even usually make sense.

Extremely high turnover as people realize that the company is run with employee happiness and mental health being the absolute lowest priority on the totem pole. 

I feel like I can breathe again after getting out of such a toxic environment with the way upper management ran things. The whole upper management team gave off a very ""Koch Brothers"" vibe, which was uncomfortable to work for to say the least."

With so many people here, it's hard to get it right with every single person that has potential, but I think the company is making progress in this area.

I worked for almost 3 years and I proved my worth over and over, I had a lot more responsibilities than most of my former coworkers, I even held interviews for people applying for senior positions but I never got offered the position to me. I stayed as a Junior QA while often I had more responsibilities than seniors, more critical features/websites to QA and managed teams as well, I was doing senior work without the title and without the compensation for a long time.

Low entry salary. I started with a very low base salary and, while I got relatively high raises, my salary was still very low compared to other people in my position.

No formal training.

No formal career develop. I tried to develop my career with Internet Brands by myself, but it was too hard for me. I applied for a new position internally and got accepted but they didn't want to renegotiate my compensation. The reason I was given, paraphrasing was: ""You should feel fortunate for the opportunity we give you, so take it because we don't give it to a lot of people, otherwise they all wound want to do it"", despite the fact that the base salary for that new position was just a bit less than the double I was getting paid at the moment, it was too unfair to make half what other people made with the same responsibilities and the same skill level I had, I'm not a money chaser, but that was just too unfair and an eye opener to me, so I found opportunities elsewhere."

-They truly do not care about their people. Low raises + no opportunity for growth + mean upper management = insanely high turnover. HR would occasionally hand out popsicles or hot dogs as a ""we appreciate you"" gesture - gee. A 25 cent hot dog. I feel so loved.

-A very reactive, not proactive, approach to management - whenever Google would come out with new search analytics/metrics, management would have us all scrambling to keep up, despite the changes being announced months prior, and of course we'd lose money. They also refused to come up with mobile apps for our sites (which is easy to do these days), putting us so far behind our competitors it was laughable.

-I finally quit after I was offered what amounted to a demotion and pay cut, and informed that if I took that job, they'd fire someone else to ""give"" me the ""privilege"" of a spot. NO. No no no. I couldn't do that. So, for the first time ever, I quit with no safety net."

*The company also has very little overhead, and has been consistently growing from when it was founded in 1998 through the recession, to the present. Your job will be secure.

*There is a slim to none chance that you'll ever be fired once you're hired on. 

*The company regularly tries to have special events and treats for its employees - particularly around the holidays and during the summer.","* The pay at Internet Brands is extremely low compared to what the industry standard would normally be for a tech company across virtually every position. This is the largest trade-off for the benefits.

* You will have to impress your managers and fight for every raise if you want one, and promotions from within are extremely rare. The company almost always hires from the outside when management positions open up. Career advancement can be challenging at this company

* Because of these first two things, turnover is high. Most employees come in, get a year or two of experience, and then move on to other companies who pay better or offer better career advancement. 

* Because pay isn't very competitive, it's hard to find replacements for certain higher level positions. Sometimes recruitment for these positions takes months, and you're forced to make up the work in the meantime."

company is located in NY, and Internet Brands is located in California, 
so we didn't actually get to meet a representative from the company 
that was now essentially taking us over. They did however send over 
someone from another company based out of Chicago that they had 
previously bought out. This company was similar to ours, also a website 
hosting company.  The guy who came to our office let us know that 
everything would be “business as usual”, yet he also stated how 
""excited"" he was for what was to come. We never did get to find out 
what he was so excited about….

Over time, they would send someone else over from that other company to 
check in with us. We had very little interaction with anyone from 
Internet Brands though, and were never really told who we could go to 
with concerns, or who was ""in charge"" of anything. We had an HR 
contact, but once that person resigned we weren't officially given 
another point of contact. Promises had been made in original employment 
contracts that were not being honored. Yearly performance reviews that 
were given in the past or that had been promised were no longer being 
given, raises were no longer being offered, and no one received end of 
year bonuses which were offered every other year and were relied upon 
as part of our yearly income. We were overworked and underpaid, with no 
one to voice our complaints to because we no longer had a boss and the 
upper management didn’t have answers for us either.

Employees quit due to the unfair treatment and realizing that there was 
zero room for advancement anymore, and temps were hired to replace them 
instead of permanent salaried employees. Training was not offered to 
these temps, so the work was not getting done properly which made the 
workload and frustration levels increase for the remaining employees. 
Eventually they just completely stopped hiring replacements for the 
employees that kept quitting so it was basically impossible to keep up 
with the workload and no one was compensated for taking on double or 
triple the amount of work than they used to do.

We soon found out that while we've been asking them to hire more people 
for our office in NY, they instead had secretly hired a ""back up team"" 
at the Chicago office to help us out. Why would we need a back up 
team?!!  We needed a team in OUR office. We kept asking if they were 
shutting our office down, and were assured that everything was okay, 
and we would still have jobs. They claimed they were looking at the 
budget first, and then we would get new hires.
Well, a few weeks later, an HR rep from Internet Brands hopped a plane 
to our office to deliver the news that our office would be closing and 
we are all going to be laid off. First time we ever actually met 
someone in person from Internet Brands.

Now we are expected to basically train and assist the new team that is 
replacing us while they transition into taking over the company that 
our staff collectively spent years building loyal clients for. Good 
luck retaining the clients who have been treated like gold by a hard 
working and caring staff. It’s unfortunate that no one from Internet 
Brands got to know any of us well enough to know who the real honest, 
loyal, and valuable workers were.

It WAS a wonderful place to work, with a great culture and casual environment. Read below","I imagine the corporate office at Internet Brands may have a different opinion, but I work for one of the companies that was acquired (Baystone Media). We were ensured that while the name on the door was changing, nothing about our office, workload or culture would change. For the first 10 months, this was true. Recently, after five employees left the company for better opportunities within a month's span, it was clear re-hiring was not a priority for IB. Workload was dumped onto other employees with no incentive, including managerial responsibilities. We were then informed that a ""back up team"" had been created and was ALREADY fully trained to ""help"" out, based at one of the other IB offices in Chicago. The back-up team came on board with more employees than the number of people left in our customer service department, which was both disturbing and shocking that we were not informed that these people were learning our jobs prior to them swooping in to seemingly save the day (Full training would have taken at least 6 weeks). After a month it became clear that this ""back-up"" team was not trained to help us, but to replace us. We were informed that our office would be shutting down and the Chicago team would take over, laying off every employee in our office (including those who have worked hard for more than 5 years)."

I have co-workers who have been with the company for over five years without even a cost of living increase. Every single raise must be decided upon by Bob Brisco, the CEO of the entire company (of hundreds of people across multiple locations), which shows how little people receive raises and what a bizarre way the business operates. Not long ago, the VP of one of the IB verticals wanted to give a few employees celebrating their 20th anniversary working for the acquired company a bonus day off, and Bob Brisco refused to allow it. Also, whenever an employee leaves (which is constantly), they typically attempt (often successfully) to pawn the workload off on whoever else they can, rather than hiring a replacement, creating a pyramid structure of ever-increasing workload."

The CTO engages in a brave struggle to keep the sites alive and relevant, while the CEO and COO find ways to undermine the business, from penny-pinching (CEO) to gross incompetence (COO). They will not tolerate disagreement with their plans, and are not crossed by anyone at the company. 

Other reviews go into the ""cost saving"" practices of the CEO - which are legendary. There is plenty of money - tens of millions are spent on new acquisitions every year - but nothing is spent on retention, employee development, or even market-level wages. Its a miracle we were allowed to have a second beer at the holiday party. HR/Recruiting is constantly spinning its wheels, as there are as many quality people fleeing for the exits as can be brought in the front door. 

As for the COO, a skilled Operations Executive would be concerned with (among other things) creating a well-trained group of sales people, and leverage that group to grow the business. The sales floors at Internet Brands are a graveyard of poorly trained people trying to hit their numbers. The ""solution"" to this problem - as the COO sees it - is to constantly fire & replace the people who have been thrown into the fire and can't seem to escape.

Many startups are operated on a shoestring budget because they are fighting to survive. This is neither a startup, nor fighting for survival, and yet the budgets for resource investment - anything that doesn't go directly back into acquiring more websites - are deemed completely unnecessary by the powers that be."

540,Internet Brands,The Real Deal...,2012-12-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"When I was interviewing here, a former employee called and said ""it's the WORST experience I've ever had!"" She warned me about all kinds of things: high turnover, cheap management, lack of process, etc. 

But I wanted to make up my own mind, so I asked some tough questions during my interview, and I took the job. It was a great decision. 

I've been here for 3 years. I've gotten promoted a couple times, I've gotten the chance to develop a team, re-imagine how we do our department's processes, and my supervisor has been very supportive - both personally and professionally. I've made some friends and moved my career in a great direction. 

Internet Brands is a solid place. Not perfect, mind you, but solid.

Technology: we have more web traffic than Instagram, and nearly as much as Netflix, but our business is spread across 10 categories and 200+ websites. We don't have to solve a couple business puzzles like a single-site business. Our business units face down innumerable challenges every day. It moves fast, and our tech team is literally world-class. There are few in the industry as good as them. 

Business model: We are diversified across 10 business categories, and try to connect highly-engaged consumers with valuable user-generated content based on issues they care about. I'm proud to be connected to a network of sites that are geared towards providing quality internet content, rather than being a farm of marginal/worthless content that's only designed to generate once-off pageviews. 

Company culture: We are a dot-com, and it's very friendly/casual. There's an annual ping-pong tournament, there's casual dress, low ego, few offices, open floorplan, ocean views, great location (assuming you live on the westside).","Here's the deal on our negative reputation: 

- We are budget-conscious (what some on here call ""cheap""), but we've also never had a layoff or a negative-growth quarter, so we're clearly doing something right. 

Lesson: ask for a fair salary that 1) fits your salary history and 2) you can be happy with, because they'll take you at your word and make an offer that fits in your ""acceptable range."" Lesson 2: If you've been at the company a while and haven't gotten a raise, ASK for one! We're not the government - we don't have automatic raises that go into effect every Jan. 1, so - own your career growth and put on your adult-shoes: ask for some feedback and a raise if you want one.  

- In certain sectors, turnover sucks, and the Internet is one of them: companies poach from each other all the time. We also have a very large sales force, and of course if you don't make your numbers, you'll be wished well and sent on your way. So our turnover is about on par with our competition in those fields: about 10-15% annual in tech, and 20-25%  annual in sales (nearly 30% in auto sales).  

There's a certain class of employee that jumps ship every 12-18 months to look for the next thing, and then there's the people who are ""lifers"" and never take a new job no matter what, but I think we're pretty well-balanced from that angle. There's really not a ton of ""churn"" in the crucial positions. Having been here 3 years, most of the good people have been here along with me, if not longer. Plus the senior management - people actually running the business - have been here consistently 3-5 years. So the strategy/management of the company is very stable."

552,Internet Brands,Underpaid but great learning experience,2012-06-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Because Internet Brands understaffs and underpays, you will have a lot of responsibility, no matter your position. You will face tremendous challenges as a result, but they are chances to learn a lot for your next job.","Because Internet Brands understaffs and underpays, it is difficult to get things done because resources are always stretched. It's the worst of both worlds of a startup and a large corporation. You get the shoestring budget of the former and the bureaucracy of the latter. The company actually seems to be doing well financially, but the profits go only to management. Meanwhile, each new acquisition stretches the employees further. Morale tends to be low."
