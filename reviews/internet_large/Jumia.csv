Young managers- which is inspiring
One is given the chance to think for themselves and problem solve","- Management focuses on numbers, not people. As long as you are able to make the company profit, they do not care what kind of manager you are. You can get away with murder as long as you are bringing in money. Which is funny, because 8 years later they still haven't broken even. So focusing on just numbers is clearly not working
- Office politics- its like being in an episode of scandal. 
- Too disorganized- too many cooks cooking the broth, you end up reporting to like 4 managers
- Racism- white managers get better salaries & are given more leeway to make mistakes. Black managers are fired as soon as they cant meet their KPIs, white ones are given another opportunity to prove themselves
- Poor HR structure, the HR always picks the company's side, cannot be trusted to be objective. Personal conversations will be used against you. Fired with no professional courtesy. They can close down an entire venture and just communicate via email
- High turnover
- Poor salaries, no real benefits, slow growth trajectory
- Office gossip even from the executive team, immaturity
- Ancient tools

Good place to learn. See how the systems work, and then you will learn how not to do things in the future.
Somewhat a good place to learn new stuff and launch your career. But get away from it when you gain experience.","CTOs and Team Leaders micromanage people, they show favouritism, and will blackmail less paid people to do more by comparing you to these people in evaluations.

When joining Jumia be prepared to find team leaders who always try to exploit your good will, that is, even when you do more than you should, they will complain and punish you in your evaluation.

Lack of transparency in the evaluation system. They will tell you that evaluation is done in a 6 month period, this is a lie, my last evaluation actually took 9 months.

The promised training is all a lie!

Bad office conditions, computers are not really that good.

There are many people that do not have any soft skills, and they should be fired immediately.

Furthermore, there are people who are hired with a higher level than you, and yet they do much less, the salary differences can be abysmal.

There are team members which can get access to special tasks, which you never had the chance to perform, and which you know you could, and yet they will throw this at your face as a means of not rewarding you in your evaluation.

People coming from abroad will be better paid and will be much better treated than local coworkers. In fact, the company will aid them getting a room to stay and live. I can live with this evryone should be well treated, but there are also other people that, not just they are getting severely underpaid, they have also to pay a rent in Oporto which can be a lot nowadays. What is the purpose of doing a lot of kilometers per week and pay high rents If one could just work in a local factory doing a simple job and save more money at the end of the month?

This company is full of people who live in their own little world. My team leader for example, who does not have the same skills as I do, nor did he do the same things that I did currently when he had the same experience as I had in the company, who claimed I still needed to improve in areas that did not belong to my job description in my evaluation. The truth is that he never really had the ability to evaluate me and that is why I am going to work for another company. One of the best companies to work in Oporto.

It is a shame, If I was treated with fairness I could still be working for Jumia. I truely believed its purpose, and that is why I joined. But my good will was exploited and this is something that cannot be forgiven.

I know that sometimes I did not act correctly towards others, I am no perfect, nor are you, and this should not replace my hard work. I am well aware of my capabilities, and I am sure, that in the future I might work for one of the top companies in the world. I will do my utmost best to achieve that plateau."

Salaries are paid on time which is good - they have never delayed on that in my years with them.

Really young team and open office (at least in the building I work). It is free and no pressure on your dressing like other places I have worked.","No clear direction from top management
Silly politics
Sufficiently lacking inexperienced staff
One too many phantom projects
Disjointed strategies
Terrible internal communication
No synergies between the teams
Too many powerful people at the top (Elephants fighting at the top, the grass suffers). I feel this has led to some questionable decisions that negatively affect the business.
Targets keep growing YoY but little effort is put into developing the employees meant to deliver these KPIs.
Not a racist company but being a white(especially French) gives you some extra benefit in growth, position, and salary.
