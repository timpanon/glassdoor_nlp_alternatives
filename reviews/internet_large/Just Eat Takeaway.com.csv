Working on large event based distributed systems can be an interesting learning experience if you've not done it before.","Since the merger, the UK (Just Eat) side has lots most of it's own character. 

Promotion process has become much more bureaucratic, turn around used to be 1 month and now it's 3 months. The whole process is driven by the Amsterdam office and doesn't seem to be aware of differences between other country divisions.

Leadership seem desperate to ship new functionality but the business can't keep up. This results in half baked products going to market with unhappy customers & restaurants meaning worse launches than hoped for.

Decisions are completely driven by financials and not by customer satisfaction. This has resulted numerous times in worse financial results than expected and the parts of the company going into fire-fighting mode for going against the customer / restaurant data to begin with."

Probably nice job for lazy people, as there can be very slow and boring days where you maybe get one order.","If anything happens to your car due to tje poor road conditions you had to drive through to get to a customer's home, like a flat tyre, broken window from a stone, need a tow truck due to a rock being stuck in your tyre, then they will not pay any of that. You have to pay for all of the damages. 
You have to pay for parking and then fill in a form afterwards to get it refunded. You have to pay any/all tickets if you get any, so MAKE SURE you are in a place that is 100000% allowed to park and turn your car off in. You only get 120kr per hour, and if you get an order then they pay you an extra 60kr per order, and that is supposed to be to cover road tolls/bom, gas, the use of your car etc. 
But mostly you can only take 1 order per hour or 3 orders per 2 hours due to the distance you need to drive, and due to the waiting time. 
Also, they have the same hourly rates all week all hours. So no matter if you work on a sunday or a monday.
Not worth it at all unless you are maybe a student, and your parents pay for your car/gas/roadtolls.
Clothes are also very uncomfortable, and color makes you look like a traffic cone."

They will pay you as little as they can and mid-way through the year, change your pay band so that they don't have to give you a fair raise. During the highest inflation in 40 years (more than 7.5%), they are offering a mere 3% raise (including merit, if you perform well). This is when the company's revenue surged by 22% YoY. When asked to reconsider, given the high gas/heating costs (more than doubled), the leadership suggests working from the office to save on bills

- Third-class leadership (C-level) team who is tone-deaf to employee feedback and tries everything possible to only look at the company's interest and not that of its employees. One of their values is 'care' but that's something they don't about their employees

A commission structure which is unachievable little or no recognition for the work which is done and no interest taken to the challenges faced in individual area. The regional sales managers have supported a young sales team through a pandemic grown at pace and have little support and no training, with only support from each other. There is a constant need to stretch the managers while heads of sales just push more and more work on to them. While taking ownership of very little.

61,Just Eat Takeaway.com,Worst HR and IT team,2022-02-16,1.0,Senior Product Analyst,"I have worked in the team for nearly a year. For a company of this age the product is absolutely not worthy. It baffles to see me how users are using takeaway app/website at all. The reason that there is not other competition, make them even ignorant of the customers. 

You will be working on stuff that you may have learned early stages of your carrier and you just stay there. The entire team is extremely unproductive and the are not contributing to anything. 

You constantly get OKR's from the management and does not reflect the reality of the problems faced by the squads/teams. There is no freedom of decision making. Any skilled persons will soon be forced to shut their mouth and play along, HR team will ensure that happening with massive support from leadership team. 

I tried to support the entire team (inspired by one skilled PM) despite my personal conditions (tragedy in the family) and I was forced to take up contract position, when I wanted to leave the company completely (due to family condition). They then forced me with new contract signatures. When I had enough and left the company, now they are harassing me in the name of devices & employment contract, coercing to play along. It seems to be the trick that was much discussed on their slack channel to retain the people. You will regularly see the customer support messages where IT team would sell the devices off market and harass the members. 

The HR team it seems targets racially disadvantaged people and they take advantage of skilled persons that are mainly hired from abroad. Dutch laws are extremely disadvantageous to skilled persons from non-EU countries who are dependent on the Sponser (dutch company). 

So be aware especially if you are getting hired from abroad. Make sure to be not sympathetic to them and I learned it hard. I am still to this day fighting their malicious practices months after I left the company and left the country. 

- If you do not want to work and just pass time you can join
- You can be the most knowledgeable person 
- You can spend the entire time learning new things if interested.","- IT teams are thieves and HR team are liars. 
- You can learn the height of harassment and mental torture from the team
- Teams are full of people who over promise and under deliver.
- If you are from non-EU country, be ready to be taken advantage of.
- Uncompetitive market positioning means no innovation needs
- No company culture what so ever. 
- you have teams that are completely isolated and act on their own"

Some of the middle managers are quite competent and supportive.,"Average white men are consistently promoted over more deserving and talented diverse employees. 
Listening to the CEO and senior leadership in general is extremely embarrassing and dispiriting. 
Random tasks are frequently passed down to teams from the C-level with little to no intervention from senior management. 
The company will not budge on allowing people to be fully remote after the pandemic and outright refuses to take people’s preferences into account. 
Salaries in Amsterdam are way below market after benchmarking, so I assume it’s a conscious decision from the leadership team to underpay talent. 
The Just Eat merge has been horrifically chaotic and mismanaged. Decisions appeared completely random and were never consulted with teams. A lot of people have left because of this and the company isn’t even trying to stop them."

- Pay is just above minimum wage
- Free tea and coffee
- Hub staff are friendly
- You can take sick days easily","Just Eat suffers from a lack of organisation and consistently breaking the most basic of employment laws. 

You have to deal with three groups in total, you are hired via Randstad but work for Just Eat, and then have to work with a dispatch team based in Amsterdam. There is a lack of efficient communication between the three as well as from all three to you as an employee.

They claim to have flexibility, and that you can work whatever hours you choose. This is a bare-faced lie.
Despite being on a 32-hour contract I am often forced to struggle amongst other couriers to pick up extra castoff shifts from Just Eat when I've been scheduled just 20 hours for one week. This is illegal and is causing employees to leave in droves. 

The bicycles that the hub make you use are dangerous for people who are short, they hire them from Greenmo and they are incredibly dangerous. You have to pedal backwards in order to brake which has caused multiple couriers knee injuries after using them for prolonged periods. They also cause testicular injuries when dismounting because the top bar covers for the battery are too high for shorter riders, the handlebars are also too wide which makes sudden turns difficult and dangerous to do. The company claim 'We wouldn't use them as our bikes if they were dangerous', another lie, they just don't care as they're too focused on keeping courier numbers low and food orders high for a profit. What're a few dead/injured couriers in the name of cold hard profits? 

If you have something go wrong mid-shift you have to message their 'dispatch team' who are based in the Netherlands where being a cyclist is much nicer, these are office workers who don't know what the road conditions in British cities are like. They are rude, they are argumentative, and they don't care if you only have 15 minutes left on your shift because you will make that 5 mile delivery in the rain so they get their performance bonus because they only see you as a timer on a screen. 
You will be constantly told off for breaking rules that you didn't even know existed, or these rules will be constantly changed and you are just a lowly courier, so who cares if you know?

I was in an accident over an hour away from our hub on foot during a shift, I was left stranded with a concussion without a way of getting back to the hub to collect my belongings. There was no initiative, the place is run by people who don't know what they're doing and it's an absolute joke.

I was led on by our hub manager and told that I'd be up for a captain promotion during November 2021, it's been a month since then and still, nothing has happened. There is no career progression, it's all a lie and I advise you to avoid this place if you want a career, I'm just here for a job that pays the bills until I get a remote working position elsewhere where I don't risk dying every shift. I'm so stressed working here that I picked up smoking as a habit and my wife begs me to quit once I find better work."

Think about none sense bureaucracy for your daily work, top down decisions with subpar leaders and a strong cost focus meaning they will hire anyone who ""fits the budget"".
That mean many workers seem to have lost their drive and energy, staying on what they have always done due to the risk of ""standing out"". Some forget about the low pay with ski trips or free food.

Was one of the longest workers here, and started in February nearly when this scoober first launched in Birmingham. Never had problems, until new captain joined and started to make unnecessary problems with me, e.g not wearing helmet when im off the bike which just does not make sense, i dont know what the hell was his problem most likely jealousy. Today received email saying *i have been terminated*, i went to the hub to question and for assistance, went to the 2 randstad ladies which are absolute jokers when the same captain that dislikes me spoke up saying 'this is the guy that i saw without the helmet' i spoke up saying 'bruddah let me speak to these two randstad ladies, mind your own business'. The captain goes to me 'listen dont speak to me like that, if this was out of work it would have been different'. He said this infront of the 2 randstad ladies, the 2 jokers laughed it off saying *bye love* to that captain, when he clearly made a threat. So then the 2 randstad ladies continued to brag on about how rude i was, when i just told that donny to move and mind his business when he clearly made a threat to me. I told em clearly several times how much i experience i had and how this guy disliked me, but they didnt want to hear my words and just wanted to argue how rude i was.."

298,Just Eat Takeaway.com,There are many better places to work at,2021-07-13,1.0,Software Developer,The people you'll work with are great. They are motivated and passionate despite being undervalued by the leadership team.,"There are several:
- Poor compensation, especially compared to competitors. There is no excuse for this as Leadership always promotes how much the company is growing and how much money has been made. Yet they reap all those benefits for themselves, and don't share it amongst the 'lowly staff' who actually got them there. 
- No equity. Again, all the profits seems to go to top leadership. 
- Problematic leadership. Not only in regard to selfishness and lack of flexibility but also comments made. We've had SLT makes comments on 'women are great because they keep the office clean' to comments made about blackface. It's gross and disgusting. 
- Lack of flexibility. SLT has the motto of 'my way or the highway'. Despite employees practically begging for remote work flexibility, LT remains resolute on their opinions. Comments such as 'remote workers are those who sit on the bench during a football game while those who are in the office are those on the field actually doing something.' 
- Micromanagement from SLT. It's insane, but I don't think LT have realised how big the company has gotten. It's no longer a startup. Meaning it's no longer excusable to change plans and priorities made by an entire company due to 'an idea you came up with last night'.
- Employees are like little worker bees to LT. They truly don't care about the infividual. The Just Eat side of the corporation is the only human facet to this company. The Takeaway.com side is abysmal, cold, and problematic.

I truly regret having decided to work here, knowing that I might have missed the opportunity to work with companies that not only treat their employees better, but also have an exciting product."

300,Just Eat Takeaway.com,"Management from the stone age, toxic place, no equity",2021-07-10,1.0,Software Engineer,"* They talk about your personal growth a lot..like too much! (because they lack heavily in other areas. No stock grants for regular employees despite seeing a massive growth)
* Monthly allowance for making orders on the platform
* BVG pass costs covered
* Could be a good place to learn how to scale a product
* Couriers are employees","* The management is from the stone age. The CEO calls himself a businessman in all-hands even though its a public company. Look at his social media handle, he is picking fights with other CEOs and always talking about the stock price instead of the platform.
* Too much focus on ""killing"" competition rather than focusing on own third-rated product. They celebrate when competitors lay-off employees.
* Management straight up said NO to any form of stock compensation or stock savings plan. It is only reserved for themselves.
* Management said NO to remote work despite the fact that the company grew massively during the pandemic which correlates to employee productivity as much as demand.
* People who have been around for a long time are starting to be toxic to everyone else as things are changing fast. Very senior engineers are bullying everyone else as an act of resistance to change in work processes. They want every topic to flow through them and they make the decisions for everyone else. The idea of autonomy is deeply flawed here.
* The amount of Nepotism here...I can't even....
* Engineering interviews are a joke. The hiring bar is really low. There are NO open sourced projects, there are no engineering standards, they don't even apply principles they write about in the job descriptions, integration tests are absent for most part. And the whole process can take 4 months!!!!
* Engineers work hard to keep the platform up and running but the salary scale for them is one grade lower than others such as BA, Data, Scrum Master, etc. So a mid-level BA would make the same salary as a senior engineer for example. Engineers are the bottom of the barrel here."

The C-suite have been very opaque as to strategy, seemingly because they have none and they're making it up as they go along - one thing that became apparent is that they don't care about technology. They've discarded Just Eat technology despite being superior, in favour of anything that comes out of Amsterdam. This has created an environment where the group is operating as two seperate companies with competing teams - information flows one way, to Amsterdam.

Lots of experienced heads and directors have been given the boot in favour of uncharismatic leaders in Amsterdam, for which their teams are run ragged supporting terrible technology. All of the talent within the company has been drained over the past year."

- Reasonable benefits, including great pension matching, learning budget and learning days
- Good bonuses depending on performance
- Work life balance + flexibility
- Decent pay with the caveat that many people say it's towards the top end (it isn't and you can certainly get higher elsewhere)","- Bureaucratic ""level move"" and promotion process requiring you to fill out pages (10+) of criteria and completing tasks to check boxes for senior management rather than actually improving as an engineer. Level moves and promotions come easier and more frequently to those in certain groups of friends in senior tech management, including the creation of new and unnecessary roles. The career document also breeds a culture of selfishness and results in people only completing things/helping people if it’s something they can put on their document
- Stagnating technology stack 
- Culture is dwindling
- There's a problem with reinventing the wheel rather than using industry standard solutions (Why have we created yet another internally built deployment pipeline?). Focus on custom internal built solutions to problems provides less benefits to engineers and creates more company specific knowledge that isn't beneficial to your career or transferable elsewhere
- Platform/Continuous Delivery teams completely separate from engineers, making decisions without regularly consulting engineers which are ultimately the users of the product - Has resulted in a new pipeline that creates more issues for engineers than it solves
- Quite a lot of CV driven development

391,Just Eat Takeaway.com,Embarrassing.,2021-03-15,1.0,Live Operations Supervisor,"The business is growing quickly so in pure theory, if you are talented you can grow up quickly.","Everything might have changed since I have been there because I worked there 4 months ago but this is what I can tell:
- the expectations given during the interview, were to work during day time and the first hours of the evening. ""We will create a team for the night shift"" they said. The reality is that working up to 1.30am is the minimum you can expect if you are doing the late shift. On top of this, on the contract is written that basically you need to be able to work at any given time, even during the night...and guess what happens if you don't sign?
- Between shifts you should have by law at least 11 hours of rest. A lot of times this does not happen. 
- Night shift pay is paid just after midnight and not even enough
- Training is so basic that you need to sort out all on your own or in bits and pieces if you are lucky enough to find someone who has got the right answer
- Maximum 7 euro per day to be used on their app for the lunch are a joke. It should be a benefit but this does not consider that the delivery expenses sometimes are half of that amount so this benefit is kind of not really existing. Especially if working in customer service or live operations, it will happen that most likely you are working on weekends and at night. Guess what? This benefit can be used just Monday to Friday up to 5pm.

Oh, by the way...I asked feedback from the second day just to have an idea of how I was doing. After 2 weeks I asked for it again...not at any point I received any.

I have been let go saying that I don't accept feedback. I thought they were joking considering I never received it but on the contrary I was asking for it.

Consequence? 2 months salary of compensation for this. But hey, we are in Netherlands so as a one-off payment, you get taxed crazy and I received less than 1 month salary net. Embarrassing."

* Fantastic pension scheme.
* Hands down the best pay in Bristol.

* Encouraged and expected to get involved in org-wide technical initiatives and working groups no matter your rank.","* As a result of the merger the company has increased massively in size, lots more management have been introduced. Mostly from internal promotions so nothing hideous but there's a feeling of distance between leadership and the contributors.
* Can sometimes feel a bit alienated if you're more central or conservative in your political views. Product and Tech leadership are extremely liberal and weave this into every day life. It's easy to disconnect from it, but there's not always the recognition that some people just want to get their job done.

Management roles have been filled by who has been there the longest rather who is the most experienced or best fit for the role.

You are constantly bullied to a corner until you comply to their ways of working, no new ideas are welcomed and quickly become someone who should be leading a team as per your actual job description to someone who is not deemed important and valuable at all. There is no management training or experience, stakeholders are argumentative and act like high school children in a playground. It is a very much ME and I culture, a team who think think they are embracing change but very set in their ways. The irony.

The very company and organisation that tries to pioneer in mental health support in the work place are the ones that cause continuous conflict, discomfort and unfair treatment to employees. Some of the HR team are very biased on who they have befriended and makes the support system corrupt. I should have left a long time ago."

588,Just Eat Takeaway.com,Decent job,2019-09-08,4.0,Courier Recruiter,It’s chill. You can work at your own pace and if you work hard it will get noticed but can possibly take a while to advance to other roles.,The pay isn’t worth what they want from you.
589,Just Eat Takeaway.com,"Great Company, Not so great Job",2019-09-05,2.0,Territory Executive,There are a range of fantastic benefits as well as a great team to support you once you start work.,"I initially applied to the company as a Market Activator, however during my first week I was told that I was going to be a Territory Executive. The recruitment company Wiser Graduates that Just Eat uses promised a range of things such as  a Brand New BMW 1 series. They forget to mention that it is actually a used Ford covered in Just Eat branding. This is still being advertised with current openings and needs to stop.

The training period is relatively short although I learned the most through my team during field based training during my first few months on the Job.

The first few months I found myself easily driving over 200 miles a day with long hours, the targets were initially achievable but have recently been changed and it is almost impossible to reach the top tier of targets. Every new restaurant that Just Eat signs up has to be seen face to face within 14 days. This planning is done at TE level so I would often drive over 100 miles just to see a single restaurant. This is incredibly inefficient from a business as well as an environmental perspective.  

The Job is relatively lonely as you are on your own all day, often there are ebbs and flows when you are either seeing loads of restaurants or not doing much at all. 

The job is advertised as a commercial development scheme although there is not much development involved, once you have done the job for  few months it becomes very repetitive . In terms of working hours it really should be advertised as a night job. 70% of restaurants don't open till after 4PM so this is the time when you do most of your work. 

After speaking to other Territory Executives who joined at the same time it is clear that we all seem to be doing different things and there is no clear guidance for what our Job actually entails.

-Members of staff often “managed out” with the a full support of HR, if you’re not an old timer or a management favourite - you are at risk
-Underperforming colleagues are not made to be accountable or step up - excuses are made 
-Customer operations department in Borehamwood has a awful atmosphere- occasion free lunches isn’t going to change the fact that the senior management team within the department aren’t seeking a progressive culture, they run a cost cutting exercise and want everything outsourced to vendor sites, they aren’t honest about the real customer operations strategy for the future, you’ll find out a new vendor site is opening days before it goes live for instance, meaning there’ll be less need for customer service agents in the Borehamwood head office 
-Suspiciously high number of colleagues on long term sick at Borehamwood - this is due to the fact management is so inefficient and have no desire to really do a good job and “lead” their teams/department, people are left disgruntled and stressed
-Don’t bother going to HR in Borehamwood if you have a complaint about how you are being mistreated by a colleague or manager, they’ll tell you they know/have had that feedback before but won’t address the issue, they are more interested in gossip and getting friendly with people- terrible example of a hr department 
-A majority of the management team in customer ops in Borehamwood for been in the same position for several years, always a reason to be suspicious- with the same people at the helm, nothing evolves or progresses 
-If your colleague or manager leaves, you will be expected to cover the tasks they did- however you will not be paid more for it, they’ll try and sell it to you as “valuable experience”
-Terrible pay across the board for the work you do- management openly admit they cannot pull in the desired talent as the pay is so low, the company know this and have said for over a year they will reverse all salaries, yet nothing happens. Yesterday the company announced they made 780 million in the last year and profits are up yet they employ customer service agents at 17K per year with no London weighting because, although most staff live within Greater London, they say Borehamwood location dictates the lower salary!"

There’s senior people shouting at each other and instances of what you could consider bullying or intimidation.

The majority of people are contractors because the turnover is so high, hence why there's a never ending recruitment drive - they can't get permanent staff to stay long-term. 

Overall, for the majority of those I worked with it's clock in and clock out.

The management are inexperienced, changing processes on the fly, choosing when and when not to implement company wide plans (different teams carrying out the same project working blind) - absolute chaos, more and more meetings saturated by too many decision makers creating more chaos. 

The politics killed creativity and innovation.

You only have to use the app to see how poor it is and how little it's changed over the years (much of the day-to-day work is to satisfy a political agreement within the company).

Finally, the company created a list of values and have no idea what they mean so performance reviews have no benchmark so basically made up. Nail in the coffin."

-Restaurant partners and customers are often unhappy due to the technological shortcomings of the platform and unpopular changes made by the company in the interest of profits.
-Unrealistic sales goals leads to a lot of pressure from management. Failure to meet these goals is seen as the fault of sales executives, not management. No matter how hard you work, there is an expectation that you come in early, stay late and shorten your lunch break.
-The sales managers and team leaders have formed a clique; anyone not in this inner circle will be kept in the dark about upcoming developments and is treated as an inferior.

- For a company the size of JUST-EAT, I can imagine it is mandatory to have a steep hierarchical structure but the atmosphere is completely the opposite! The culture in the company really does tick the box and more on providing autonomy and self-realization, facilitating a very 'flat' organizational atmosphere.

- The company is a market leader in multiple countries in what a lot of economist would agree a 'immature market'. The excitement of being part of a company with a 'blue ocean strategy' and is doing something that has never been done before is thrilling.","Nothing bold springs to mind but I could imagine the following point can be perceived as con for some people.

- A lot of companies advertise 'fast paced environment' as a positive thing. It is positive for me personally because I enjoy what I do but for some employees it may not be the case.  Due to rapid growth of the company, things move fast.

Laid back starting time in the morning.,"This is the most unorganised, and quite frankly, uncaring company I have worked for.

They did not know how to report accidents properly, so just ignored them or made a joke of them. They gave out contracts with spelling errors and typos. They changed my salary, claiming that the original salary I signed for was a 'typo'. They also expected me to work weekends when my contract only detailed the 9-5 weekdays. 

They actively encouraged what could be considered sexist and harassing behaviour, calling it 'banter' and part of the 'cheeky' nature of the company's brand tone. Members of the company allowed my personal data and personal phone number to be passed onto customers and clients without my permission.  This made for a very bad work-life balance, as the two just became one.

The time-off polices were badly handled, so employees and employers were constantly confused about when people were due holiday. The tax codes were never applied correctly, so people were over and under taxed. A high level of expenses were expected to be used on a fairly low salary. They also managed to lose some of the expenses forms and then forget to pay back some expenses.

Some members of management also deemed it appropriate to talk about work issues in public places in earshot of strangers. A lot of senior members of staff were very informal in their communications, even with regards to serious matters. Sometimes these communications would be completely grammatically incorrect and thus nonsensical.


Overall, it seems to be a rather unorganised company, that is confused about its own policies and ethos. Perhaps suitable as a passing step on the ladder to one's career."
821,Just Eat Takeaway.com,Shady business from a company with potential,2015-02-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great staff, great culture. Nice office","Ripping off restaurants by having shady billing practices. charging fees on taxes and tip and delivery charge, contracts are not clear about what the fees are causing restaurant owners to feel taken advantage of. These issues could be corrected but aren't because these shady charges generate a lot of money for the company."

There are so many talented and innovative people that you get to spend time with everyday. We are growing everyday and with that comes new challenges and experiences, no two days are the same. It is a very exciting business to work in with the opportunity to grow and develop.",With so much going on and the excitement that comes with working at JUST EAT it can take over your life (But I wouldn't have it any other way!) this isn't really a con to me but it said I had to write something.

Exciting culture in the head office in Toronto, but this is not the case for reps outside the GTA.",Management has lost their direction.  Does not care about the partner restaurants.  Lack of support for regions outside of Toronto.  Expecting crazy hours from reps.  Need to get more solutions for the reps to sell.

826,Just Eat Takeaway.com,"MICRO-MANAGEMENT, NO INTEGRETY OR HONESTY, STRESSFUL, UNORGANIZED, SEXCEST, POLITICAL GAMES",2014-07-21,1.0,Business Development Consultant,"Great partys
Grat people (although most have now left!)","MICRO MANAGEMENT - Extreme micromanagement is an understatement

- Trackers are checked every day, they even look at what your doing at the weekend!
- Performence is irrelevent to how your managed, no trust for their staff what so ever
- Call logs will be compared against tracker reports and then they will google the area to check what's there
- All drive time (for example appointment to appointment or home to patch) is classed as personal time, this will not   contribute to your working hours, so if you do 4 hours driving, you will be expected to stay on patch an extra 4 hours, they moniter how long your engine is off per day and if it's less than 5 hours you will be looking at a dicsiplinary
- Management will try and befriend your team mates for information, so you'd better make sure they are loyal to you!
- Management are never honest with their staff and you are left constandly second guessing them
- Sneaky

STAFF RETENTION - Extremely poor

- From an expanded sales team of 60/70 a year ago, approx 15 original staff left
- Constant staff turnover means you never know who your team mates are

WORK LIFE ABALANCE - None

- No work - life balance, you will work long hours, late in to the evening, every evening
- If you are home before 9 you will have a phone call from your manager asking what your doing

PAY/ COMMISSION - Well below industry average

- Starting salary of £18000 - £22000, although most will start on £22000, + London waiting if your in one of the London teams
- Yearly pay rise of £500 - £800 depending on %target achieved the year before
- Monthly commission of £600 - £1200 however, it is very rare to earn over £850 if you hit at all

OPPORTUNITY/ JOB DIFFICULTY
- A call with a delivery restaurant is very easy, you can provide goods figures and 9/10 times the customer will sign up
- Very little opportunity left, most areas are highly saturated by Just-Eat, this leaves only collection only restaurants which are extremely difficult to sign up as they may make £20 every 6 months with Just-Eat as opposed to delivery who make on average £34000 per year, yet you will have to sell it for the same price, then Just-Eat will penalize you when they leave.
- Targets don't change even if you only have collection only restaurants left in your area, therefore you will never earn any commission!
- Just-Eat will take money from your pay at every opportunity, for banking not being cleared within 7 days, for customers leaving etc.

TRAINING
- There is very little training, you learn out in the field by yourself by pure hard work
-  Just-Eat pride themselves on training sessions however, what they do do is classroom based and is absolute rubbish that you would never use in your day to do job, because if you did you would never sell anything!

PROGRESSION
-  Most recruitment is external
-  No middle amangement role etc. to allow BDC's BDE's to progress
-  Politics - all about who you know at the top

SUMMARY
This used to be a brilliant company to work for and a fun job. Changes were made in January which has made Just- Eat a very stressful & frustrating company to work for. Targets have gone up, commission has been cut and you are left constantly looking over your shoulder worrying about money/ job security etc.

It is a good role to have on your CV if your just starting out in field sales, but there are much better companies out there where you will be a lot happier."
827,Just Eat Takeaway.com,"Micro management, stressful, no support, unfair targets, high staff turnover!!",2014-07-06,2.0,,"Nice people, good parties, manage your own diary.","Everyone has the same target despite the opportunity being different from area to area.

Extreme micromanagement with trackers on all cars which will be looked at even if your figures are great. Call logs will be compared against tracker reports ect ect. No trust for there staff.

Drive time isn't taken into account as part of your working day, for example if you have a large area 4hrs out of your day might be driving if not more but that wouldn't be taken into account.

Very high staff turnover so constantly feel like you don't know who your team mates are.

Unless you have a city as your area like London you won't progress up through the business get promoted ect ect.

Was a great company to work for however changes were made in January which has made Just Eat a very stressful & frustrating company to work for. Targets have gone up, commission has been cut, charges are put in place so even if you do hit commission they can fine you for not banking on time not sorting customer complaints out quick enough ect ect."
