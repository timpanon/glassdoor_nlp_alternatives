Neither do they know their customer base, nor their requirements.
It's an obsolete business platform","Everything.
None of the sales executive who works in Just Dial in Delhi NCR wears his i-card because you never know where you would be beaten in the market or held captive due to the frauds the company and the employees have done.
Speaking in English is not something the Seniors encourage because you will be asked to visit the ""Corporate Business Locations"" which in reality are the puncturewalas, Ac Mechanics, scrap walas, Electricians , drivers and even the Meat sellers and they only understand local language.
From bottom to top, everyone focuses on Sales, whether you convince the customer or you make fake promises, they don't care. 
The business owner would then arrange another meeting over some fake business name and would then hold captive of the sales executive and snatch his belongings because someone from the company has done fraud with him or the company did not stop his monthly deductions even after his continous requests.
On Monthly deductions - A fixed amount , which is in thousands, will be auto debited from the customers account, even after he applies for stoppage. They just won't stop it."

* Pay is good and salary comes on time but it has been reduced by 20% due to covid19
* Good appraisals","* Negative worklife balance.Its only work and no personal life kind of culture
* Long working hours, even on weekends you wont be spared if you are good at work
* Pressure on you is directly proportional to your talent, more the potential more the pressure
* Your personal space on whatsapp wont be spared as well, most of the work comes on whatsapp thanks to the new culture inculcated by the CPO
* Management will harass you on weekends too by calling or whatsapp with some urgent changes ** remember - everything here is urgent **
* No realistic deadlines, every development is ASAP and is needed in a day or two no matter what it is or how much big it is
* No process oriented work , management needs to be educated about SDLC and implement PM practice
* Work can come anytime ** By anytime I seriosuly mean anytime like at 11 PM in the night with a deadline of next day morning before the CEO gets up
* HR dept here is only facilitator for management with not much power
* There are more product managers than developers
* Increments are usually delayed by 2-3 months every year, though arrears are paid
* Micromanagement by CEO and CFO especially
* Canteen food is cheap but food quality is not upto the mark
* Office Infra in Mumbai can be better
* No WFH
* Work is repetitive with no new learning, you will end up doing/changing the same thing again and again
* Job security is a bit of a concern here, they can fire you anytime once they are done with you
* Once you are old and experienced, you will be a liability and will be on the radar
* No quality work

688,JustDial,Tough but helps you to develop yourself,2020-05-14,3.0,Certified Internet Consultant,"They are brutal when it comes to sales. Good for people passionate for sales. As it teaches you a lot. 
Supportive managers.

Payout is good","Useless, ill mannered, Lazy and nonexistant HR with zero communication skills and command.

They even recruit 18, 19 year olds from 12th grade in sales. With no maturity or emotional stability to handle clients or represent Justdial on field/market. So if you're fresh out of your bachelor's or Master's degrees then think about it.

Abusive VP and Managers. Treating senior managers and team leaders like nothing that too before new employees. If you're an old employee; it makes you question your existence and effort as they dont value you. 

Money maniacs that wont even care if you die on field for them. So there is nothing like work life balance as they force you to work even after your working hours are done that too without paying you a penny. 

 Customer support service is namesake. Yeah sometimes they do help. Coz ""Sir is very moody"". There should be some strong steps on their perpetual ECS/EMI skip,  pause or stop.

Spot Schemes and bonanza is just a MYTH. They seduce you with a good spot scheme for some day and then wont credit the spot money or bonanza if you bought a deal. 

Managers are pro in fooling employees for solving their problems same as their customers. 

Unusual Paycuts. And salary deduction in the name of data anomaly.

Should start providing petrol allowance and should increase the salary as they give only 15k ctc for fresher."

Some employees are helping and well behaved.","JustDial are cheaters. I worked as a UI Developer at their Mumbai office in Malad.  This is the kind of harrasement they do.
- They make you work longer hours and for lesser pay
- People are extremely rude and judgemental. (barring a few) No help is provided of any sorts.
- The management is pathetic. Specially for the software developer role. There is no HR to address your issues. The whole sole decision maker is the CTO
 No transparency and no proper hierarchy.
- Absolutely pathetic work culture. You work like dogs. You get no appreciation for the work you do. 
- People don't know how to talk properly in English. But they pretend as if they are heroes and heroines of this world.

It is my sincere advice. Don't go to this pathetic place. There are better companies providing good opportunities in the role suitable for you. Choosing this company would be your worst decision. Specially for the software department.
DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF JOINING JUSTDIAL.
If you go read the review section in Google play, you'll see the kind of fraud products they are selling and the kind of comments the people have put there.
Infact the only people who have put up good comments are either friends of the CTO or the current employees."

Good incentives.,"It's been more than a year that I have joined just dial. It was fun in the starting few months. But the longer it gets, you get to know the policies.
We have to focus on two main things daily :
1) Talktime ( 3 hours )
2) Appointments ( 3 )
when you're good at those things, they ask ""why aren't you able to get a contract""
when you're getting contracts and stay on top of your team, they say "" you're not doing appointments and talk time "".

we were said that we'll be given every Sunday holiday and also an additional 4 week off for the month while joining. But they changed that policy and removed our week off. 

The ultimate motto of anyone working here is incentives. Today, they deprived us of it too. They kept deductions of 100rupees/day if we don't achieve the required talk time. I generated contracts worth more than 50k  which should get me an incentive of 4% that is around 2k. but I got my incentive credited today not more than 200 rupees.

Bottom Performer meeting - Here the pressure is same entire month... and if any day you are coming  on NO SALES or ZERO SALES.. you are suppose to report to office at night 8.30pm for BOTTOM PERFORMER MEETING... and trust me nothing happens in those meetings... they will just make you sit till 10.30 or 11pm...
The Management provides funds for outing to all the teams, but there are some team managers who utilize those funds for their own good and nothing comes to the team. 
Highest attrition rate in the industry"
1283,JustDial,my experience,2017-05-31,5.0,,part time in justdial with a good amount of salary for just five hours is really good.. the work atmosphere is really good and the process is very easy too...,it would be better if there were more time for break for the  part timers

1290,JustDial,Worst company ever.,2017-05-23,1.0,,The person who is working at ground level are very friendly.,"1).The person who need to join Justdial as a Business Development executive(BDE) should buy an iPad.
2) There is no work life balance in the company, Top level management thinks that you are a machine who generates sales for them.
3) Lack of support from management side if any customer ilocks a BDE in his office 
4) Worst business strategy. Generally if a company launches a product, it need to advertise the product. But here in Justdial, despite of advertising, they will pressurise the employees like BDE and telecallers to sell the product. Company thinks that advertising is an extra cost for its product
5) Worst customer support. Justdial always wants money from customers and they dont even consider of providing service to the customer for the amount he pays. Next time, If an employee like me visits his place, he will literally slams us down either physically or verbally
6) A BDE in justdial is like sleeper cells. He has to either spend his time in busy traffic or under the tree for appointment.
7) Compensation is very less for the work we normally do. I used to get around 17k every month even though i had done my MBA from prestigious institute. 
8) Work life balance is zero. Usually my day starts at 8AM and ends at 11pm. I usually feel that I am here in Justdial just to take scoldings from management and from customers
