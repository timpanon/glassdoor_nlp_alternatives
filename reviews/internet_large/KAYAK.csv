The coworkers are mostly good people and always happy to help. You're rarely expected to do more work than you're able to at a sustainable rate.,"The nail which sticks up is hammered down.

If you want to apply latest tech trends or grow in a tech career, forget about it. The company has grown complacent as the leader in its niche. The tech stack is 10-15 years old and will become a limiting factor for the speed of innovation, yet any suggestion for different ways of doing things is met with ""we haven't needed it before, why would we need it now"" or ""we already had someone look into it and it didn't work"".

Promotions are meaningless yet difficult to get. They seem to depend on being friends with the right people, or having gone to the right schools. Don't expect managers to be interested in your career growth.

People in EU beware: Upper management in the US considers the work done in some of the European offices subpar."

- Competitive salaries and benefits
- Good work-life balance 
- Strong technical mentorship
- Managers are competent, generally have been around for a while and know the company well
- Strikes a good balance between a professional and casual environment
- Nice offices with decent on-site perks
- They invest in their employees and want people to stay long term","- Advancement is slow.
- Management talks about horizontal culture but in fact it is very hierarchical, which can be disorienting until you learn to separate lip service from reality.
- Bias towards status quo and conformity. Many employees are primarily concerned with protecting their position and appearances, making honest discussions and appraisals of situations difficult. 
- Lots of engineering work for scientists and analysts. More data and ML engineering support would help improve the pace of production and free up scientists and analysts to use their strengths.
- The tech stack is old and the mindset towards developing data science products is very old school. The justification for using outdated and suboptimal approaches is usually a mixture of ""we can't do that because we are too lean"" and ""we don't need to do that because we have been doing fine without it"". 
- Management doesn't know what they want from Product Managers, leading to high turnover in this role. I would beware of joining as a PM.
- Poor trust and communication between marketing Account Managers and data scientists. AMs can be forced to use algorithms which obviously aren't working well and if you ask the data scientists what is going on, you will get evasive maneuvers and bluster about how ""sophisticated"" the models are. 
- Poor record of retaining female tech talent and exceedingly few women in leadership roles.
- Culture is ultra-WASPy fake nice. Diversity groups are forums to virtue signal, praise the company for how inclusive it is, and avoid challenging discussions that could upset anyone."

After many months of waiting for a promotion I was promised and working the more senior role for almost a year, I ended up leaving because I found another opportunity. The feedback was that they wanted to see you work in a role to make sure you could handle the more senior position, but that feels like a way to underpay/undersell a staff member for their hard work.

Ultra-cliquey 
The culture is very junior.
Your only metric for success is how much money you make for Priceline.  Regardless of what they tell you in the interview  - you will NOT be revolutionizing the travel industry.  You will however be a slave to A/B testing that is set up by people with no testing expertise, only spreadsheets and profit reporting.  Yet they pretend to be a wonderful holistic startup full of wonderful values.  If you buy their HR fluff, then go ahead and join their cult.  If you want to add real value for CUSTOMERS (not Priceline necessarily) then look elsewhere.
Sure nearly everyone is nice, but they are almost never considerate, thorough or even competent.  
Will your manager tell you when they are going on vacation?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  
Will your coworkers stop pretending they are good at your job too and hoarding work because it makes themselves feel more important?  Maybe, maybe not.  
Will your manager be clear with you about what they expect and when?  Maybe.
Will your manager have a deep knowledge of your role and the skills involved?  Probably not.  Will they pave the way for your success rather than theirs?  Are you kidding me?.
Instead you will be put through a series of 2 minute meetings that add up to nothing you can act on.  They like to rush around like they are super busy, but all that happens is everyone is interrupting everyone else so frequently that barely any work gets done at all.  
With 20 of the right people you could easily out-perform the entire Cambridge office.

62,KAYAK,"Fun place, great people",2015-07-21,5.0,Software Engineer,"Everyone is incredibly smart.  It's fun to work in the travel industry since everyone loves to travel, and it's even better if you can help people save money!  Awesome state of the art office with lots of perks, outings, social events, etc.","It can be hard to find out what else is happening within the company.  The business division is in Stamford, so it's hard to communicate with those folks at times.  The Berlin office is our largest office which also creates some communication issues."

- Chaotic sometimes, but that's part of the fun. Not for those that prefer everything to go 'just so'"
65,KAYAK,Great experience,2015-02-10,5.0,Software Engineering,"I had a great time interning with KAYAK over the summer. They treat their interns very well and it was a great opportunity to learn and develop new skills. The teams are quite small, and you work very closely with another employee, so there is plenty of opportunity to find a mentor. As a company, there was a lot of openness through the different teams and rungs of management, and everyone regardless of position was very approachable and friendly. The workplace environment is great - everybody works reasonable hours, tons of perks, etc.",None - it was a great experience
66,KAYAK,Best job I've had,2015-02-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great place to work. Definite room to grow within the company, fun work culture, good work/life balance, beer:30.",A lot of core engineers have been leaving the company because their previous stock options have vested.
67,KAYAK,Cares about its employees,2015-02-05,5.0,Software Engineer,"One of the best things about KAYAK is that I feel like it genuinely cares about its employees. The CEO is always dropping by to see how things are, the perks of the office are great. Furthermore you really get a sense that people care about what you're doing. Managers talk to you like peers and treat you with respect and value your input. Easily the best company I've worked for so far. The location of the Cambridge office is also fantastic, you're right in the center of the tech hub.","Like most companies, if it's crunch time, expect to put in quite a few hours. Wish there was a better feel of how to move up/around the company."

72,KAYAK,Horrific management,2014-08-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Strong business model, excellent growth potential.  Dedicated peers and colleagues.  Fun, generous CEO.","C-level executives are astonishingly bad at management.  Google them and you will find proof.  Their personal lives bleed into their professional work.  The CFO and CMO are married.  The CFO also runs HR.  All misbehavior from C-level personnel is ignored.  No regard for human resources policies, protocols, career development.  Employees are disillusioned.  Morale is low, and good people are quitting by the day."
73,KAYAK,The turnover continues.....,2014-03-27,2.0,Commercial Team,Benefits are good. Product pretty well known.,They cannot keep sales team staffed which is very telling.... Also lost lots of key engineers which makes quality of product suffer.. Suck ups promoted over top performers. Very passive aggressive culture instilled by management team.  Starting to constrict the flexibility that was once one of the pros of working there.
74,KAYAK,Turnover continues....,2014-03-08,2.0,Commercial Team,Good benefits. New office so nice working environment.,Turnover big issue especially on engineering and sales teams. Problem attracting and retaining talent which in turn allows some mediocre performers to stay longer by default. This impacts the rest of us negatively. Many members of founding engineering team gone over past year which invites questions about continued quality of product. Sr. Management team as a whole lacks professionalism and some members appear to be over their heads.
