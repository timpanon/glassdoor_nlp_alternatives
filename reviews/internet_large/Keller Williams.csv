You'll meet wonderful people that you'll remain friends with after you've left.","Priorities in one's 'life balance' is wack. Not all agents (but many) feed into the 'you need to make more money so you can go on better vacations with your family' or ' you're not happy cause you're not making enough money or selling enough homes.' Meanwhile, so many realtors have NO idea what their kids are up to, kids have eating issues due to processed food cause no one is home to make them a real meal, drug problems, etc.... and again their answer? 'sell more houses and make more money and your problems will go away!' Obviously not that heavy handed as that, but 3 months of listening to the culture you'll see it."

Don't expect them to do it for you, although they make a lot of promises, it's really up to you how successful you are in real estate. KW is just the vehicle, you are the engine.","A lot of promises of opportunity that are false and misleading, and a lot of distractions and agendas that are counter productive to the agents goals of selling real estate and building a great real estate team. One of the biggest distractions is their mediocre technology. My experience is that KW is great at promising great products, but none of them actually work. There are much better technology products from third party vendors that do not lock you into a specific broker."

You can have the best training, resources, management and plans in the world but if talking to strangers, asking people for anything (including their business), and/ or hearing your phone ring makes you physically ill there's not much that will change that. I actively worked against all of my innate traits and preferences to ""be good"" at real estate. I earnestly tried. Now I don't and as a result the majority of money I have made in RE has come from buying and selling my personal homes, the rest has come from referring out of town friends and family to other agents.

740,Keller Williams,Local KW needs major overhaul,2021-06-13,2.0,Real Estate Agent,"Company has a number of top producers and long time agents, and backed by the biggest international real estate brand, with access to quality training and systems that agents can make use of, if they choose.","1) Network Marketing Model that is so focused on having to be the biggest company with the most number of agents, regardless of the quality of the agents hired. 
2) High turnover of key leadership positions, and General Manager or Statewide manager that is only focused on her office in Santa Fe and could care less about Albuquerque. 
3) Agents are just numbers. It's hard to get support from the office staff and qualifying broker when needed because they are so busy putting out fires and answering questions for new agents. 
4) KW has good training programs as a company, but it's focus on training has made it a magnet for brand new agents, often lured in by the network marketing model and false hope that they will build a valuable downline. 
5) Office politics , favoritism, and in some cases, discrimination , are frequent practices due at least one of the local owners and more than one staff member. 
6) Businesses within the business -- Agents wanting to earn more money or have additional revenue streams can become business coaches, BOLD coaches, push mortgages, or form teams despite having little to no experience or qualifications to do so. They usually last 6 months or a year before onto something else. 
7) The company got too big too quick, lacks focus, and needs leadership that is established and reputable in the real estate industry. 
8) The Leadership Council is a joke. It's the same 10 agents year after year after year after year. They must have egos so big that they think the company will fail if they aren't at the center of it. Wrong.... if they think they are so valuable as leaders in the company, they should apply for one of the leadership positions next time there is an opening. 
9) They company still has some good agents , but should own the fact that they've lost a lot more good ones over the last 5 years than they've kept or gained. 
10) Quality matters more than quantity. So does integrity, honesty, professionalism."

1250,Keller Williams,STAY AWAY!!,2020-12-03,1.0,Product Manager,"If you're a realtor, the most frustrating thing you'll deal with is Command, a terrible product Keller Williams rushed to build, that you will be expected to pay for otherwise you'll need to find services on your own and pay for those to do your job. They continue to add more features without concern or thought on if it will break, which it does most of the time. Sometimes causing you to loose all of your client information and progress. 

If you're looking to work internationally instead such as tech support, product manager etc, expect a far worse experience, EVER DAY! Management is terrible, smile in your face but throw you under the bus, completely lacking in leadership or human decency. Oh and don't even expect that if you speak to HR they will do anything, as a matter of fact they will just terminate you for complaining and say it was something else despite clear retaliation. They will also tell you to do one thing and then the next day yell at you for following their directive. Its just a mess and not worth it. If you're not looking to be a realtor go elsewhere, even McDonald's treats its employees better. Oh and there's no career opportunities, its all about favoritism and turn burn mentality.",Everything but glassdoor requires me to add more characters.

Everything has a cost, they are going to tax you at every chance they can. The classes and trainings that are held are done by current agents. I have been in trainings that I knew more than the agent holding the training, and ive been in real estate for 1 1/2 years.

-You're forced to go to 2 real estate conventions a year, share a hotel room with a randomly chosen coworker for one, use only their mode of transportation if you want transportation covered, and get a daily stipend of only $25. You'll be giving product demos.
-No support for learning at all- not even PTO for conventions where you've paid the registration and transportation or tech certs where you've paid for the training and course. If you want to get better, you have to do projects on your own time that won't benefit KWRI at all because KWRI doesn't implement many new projects and you're always overloaded with the existing projects. But if you don't do projects on your own time all night and weekend, you'll never go further in this industry because you'll be tied to KW's obsolete tech choices. You have no autonomy to implement anything else during your work hours and you'll end up learning bad coding practices if you rely only on KW.

At the very minimum there should at least be a requirement to shadow for a day or take a ""welcome"" course. I was a brand new agent with no idea how to do ANYTHING. Dotloop is not an easy program to start with, I had no idea where to even find the real estate forms initially, etc. It was a lot of hype and false promises and I very quickly became disgusted by the obsessiveness to recruit.

Lots of resources (classes and videos) to help guide you.,"They don’t tell you how to actually do a transaction, only how to lead gen so you must hire a transaction coordinator ($400/transaction). If you’re not already best friends with a successful agent, you have to pay for help through coaching club which they STRONGLY encourage, which takes 10% of your commission then another 6% for KW royalty fees. Your 70/30 split turns into a 54/46 commission split!! You’re locked into coaching club for an entire year and caps at $9k/year. Definitely not worth it. Don’t forget to add in $400 for your transaction coordinator and $89 monthly KW fee. Once you have a couple of transactions under your belt, drop KW and go to a boutique broker than can give you closer to 100% commission. At KW you’re just paying for the name. At the end of the day, nobody cares which realty you’re with; only that you (the agent) is available and you do your job well, making sure your client is happy."

1516,Keller Williams,"Making Money in Real Estate is simple, but not easy",2020-04-01,5.0,Realtor,"In reading some of these reviews, I feel very fortunate to have the office and managing broker I have. They have high standards for administrative staff and accessibility, and invite constructive feedback whenever offered. The positivity and helpfulness oozing from the agents and staff make going to the office an experience that makes my day.

While I haven't applied myself as much as I should or could have from the many trainings I've taken, I've seen several agents go from fumbling newbies to grossing hundreds of thousands in a few short years. Each of them attest it to believing and applying the training and/or coaching they've received with the company. 

Something a lot of these other reviewers have to remember, or be taught, is that being a real estate agent means you are a small business owner. There is no regular salary or benefits. Your income relies solely on your ability to close deals, no one else. While each office is indeed different, the culture does reach pretty much everywhere and the million dollar producers will generally be helpful and answer questions you may have. Seek advice, show value and promise, don't wait for business to come to you, go find it.","Technology roll out has been very bumpy over the past 2 years. The features are phenomenal on paper, but have not been properly executed yet.  Launching it in bits and pieces before fully de-bugging each piece makes for a frustrating user experience, especially for non tech apt agents."

So much mandatory training that you don't have time to actually try to sell anything.  Too much technology that you are expected to learn and use, even when it's flawed.  Playing favorites, and not allowing everyone to join a team if they need to (to gain experience).  I asked about it, and was told the teams weren't hiring, but then hired several new young agents who were in training classes with me.  A LOT more red tape and paperwork than other agencies.  So many fees that by the time we got to the closing table, my share was about 1/2 of what it is with my new company.  They act very egotistical, and as if they are better than everyone else.  They hate Zillow, but are trying to dominate the market just like Zillow is."
1661,Keller Williams,Good company,2019-10-11,4.0,Real Estate Agent,"Overall great company, friendly and supportive culture.","None, however more support is always appreciated."
1662,Keller Williams,Terrific Culture!!,2019-10-10,5.0,Realtor,"Collaborative culture 
Great training programs
immersive experience","commission based 
building client base"
1663,Keller Williams,Don’t believe the hype!,2019-10-10,1.0,Realtor,Lots of training and technology (almost to the point of confusing).,"They only care about making a ridiculous amount of profits from their agents. By structuring itself as “a technology  company”, they do well at helping cut throat agents to make tons in commissions, but in reality, they are a giant pyramid scheme. Every sale made has a portion of those dollars trickled up 7 levels with the final level being the co-founder, CEO and chairman, Gary Keller. Their main goal is to bring on as many agents as possible with an unrealistic goal of EVERYONE doing the most sales in the local market. To this end, they have high turnover of non-paid brokers and lowly paid administrative staff. Definitely not the place to be for any trustworthy and respectable real estate agent."
1664,Keller Williams,Great place to work,2019-10-09,5.0,Realtor,Awesome training program.  Technology is top-notch,I don't have any complaints.  They continuously try to make things better.  Hard to be upset with that.
1665,Keller Williams,Problems with Splits and Cliques,2019-10-09,3.0,Agent,"Nice office, they do offer classes","The cliques here are pretty ridiculous. If you don't have the right designer gear, perfect highlights, luxury car, and haircut, don't expect to make friends or be included in things. Also, as a non-Christian, I felt uncomfortable sometimes. The whole impression of the agents I ran into there was that a lot of it was a facade. They're nice to you if they think that you fit in with them and/or they think they can get some kind of benefit from you (getting you to join their team) or even referrals if you decide to leave the business.

The splits are another problem. You have to pay 30% to the company, plus an additional 6% as a ""franchise fee"". The franchise fee is $3000 a year, and the cap is $15000, so that's $18k out of your pocket that goes to Keller WIlliams, IF you're able to cap and go to 100% after that, until the year starts over. On top of that, if you are struggling, they encourage you to go to classes that cost money."

The training made available is top notch which was very appealing starting out as a new Realtor. I learned a lot over my 6 years with the company, and I felt like I had a competitive advantage over my competition who didn't get access to the same training. 

More importantly, however, agents don't view each other as competitors. If I had questions about a listing presentation or a cold call script, everyone in the office was happy to share and help. For me, that makes them the best.",Some of the technology systems were dated. Required a few 3rd party subscriptions to stay competitive.

Still a great plan for such a small employer.","If you thrive on negativity with no positive feedback this is the department (ISA) for you.   This department is not welcoming to new employees and their turn over has proven that.  The company's health insurance plan is expensive and has subpar coverage.  You are required to cold call people who are on the ""do-not-call"" registry - not just once, but several times.   There is a ton of arrogance in the management of this company; they believe they do everything perfectly and there is no room for improvement.  If you don't agree with everything they say, you are considered un-coachable.   The commission structure for an ISA for the work involved for that commission is extremely subpar.  Your commission is also dependent on someone else's sales abilities so you are basically a glorified appointment maker."

I interviewed with a couple different companies but KW put an emphasis on training which was a huge incentive. I feel like most places will leave you to fend for yourself but KW offered a one week training session which I took advantage of and asked as many questions as possible. Real estate school can only teach you so much. I worked with a mentor for 4 transactions (he received a portion of my commission) and it was necessary and a huge help.,Unfortunately those training seminars did not happen on a regular basis.

There is an exodus of talented people running out the door. People who can leave are, and the rest are riding it out until they can find something else (unless they are long tenured employees who just don’t know any better). This is an incredibly political environment where leadership decisions are made based on personal relationships, family connections (yes! really!!), or whether or not you can stroke the ego of the narcissist in charge. All the talk is about about pivoting into a tech company, but no one really knows what that means and the “tech” being produced is flawed and there is no business or profit model behind it. They just want to create something techish before someone else does and are banking on their cult-like following among real estate agents."

Great culture, respect for staff, friendly, hardworking, and extremely knowledgeable. All agents are willing to learn, and are very supportive.","The ownership at this company is a complete disaster. This corrupt group of people will use you to any extent they are able, and in the end, no matter the efforts on the employees end, it will not be sufficient. Greedy to no end, and they will always do whatever is necessary to save their profit, which means there is no return investments into the company, or in the growth of others. Be warned that the second you stand up for yourself during mistreatment, whether hazing, or other, the ownership will immediately label you as useless, and it will be the end of your positive, professional relationship. It is unfortunately impossible to ever outlive this label while being employed at the company. They are extremely unappreciative of even their best staff members, and needlessly aggressive towards people, at the drop of a hat. Favoritism is clearly shown for those that support the owner's egos, and they will do whatever they can to undermine you in your relationships with others. They are skilled in their manipulation, and it's shocking the extent they'll go, to make their stories believable to those who have yet to see their true colors."

Telemarketing/cold calls are NOT the only way to generate leads (what year is this!?) however they tell agents that they will fail if they don't spend 21 hours a week doing this. Absolutely NO support, expensive monthly fees (even though you do not get your own desk and the commission split is abysmal), expensive mandatory classes and books that are unhelpful,  HUGE pressure on agents to pay thousands of dollars for expensive motivational self help seminars and bogus""coaching"".  Terrible commission splits. Weird cult/EST vibe.  GOD is the first thing mentioned in the company mission statement. Religion should not have anything to do with a brokerage firm.  Feels more like a MLM/Pyramid/Ponzi than a real estate brokerage firm. Team leaders/Coaches are more focused on recruiting new agents than on fostering the growth of their agents. How can you receive any real training and  help if your coach is too busy trying to recruit agents all day every day while ""coaching"" 50 new agents? The answer is you can't. Too much emphasis on  ""having a positive mindset"" and other vague unhelpful mantras you would find in something like the book The Secret. Not enough emphasis on making sure the agents follow Real Estate Laws, know what they are doing and are prepared for listing presentations, showings,  contracts and any problems that may arise.  Major rip off."

New Kelle App System is great tool.,"Strange cheerleading team meetings with several agents hogging the spotlight just to talk about how great they are, with thinly disguised belittling of their peers' (perceived) lack of ambition.  Seems to be no apparent oversight from management. Self-proclaimed strong value-system, with little day-to-day evidence, unless a camera/advertising is involved."

Again, because you are working for independent agents, they get to choose benefits. In my case, I was never offered any and have had to pay for my health insurance out of pocket.

Bonus structure is based on the agent's number of closings. If they sell several million-dollar listings and choose to take the rest of the year off because they reached their volume goal, you have to suffer the consequences as the employee."

They have a ton of training to help you get off the ground.,"Their training system is mostly geared towards those who are new to real estate and/or sales. So for someone with years of sales experience but new to real estate, there is a lot of redundant information. If you are already an experienced agent, you will find yourself with a good company to link up with especially if your expertise is CRE as their comp plan is very favorable.  Unfortunately, I fell in the middle with a decade of sales but no CRE and the training is mostly for residential."

People are 'nice' to you, but unless you are a mega-agent you really have trouble pinning down any leadership to talk to you as a person/agent(kind of a pro and con).","Leaders are ALSO competing for same business you are, so... Training can eat up your time, but w/o training you can't excel - web based anytime training is a better option.  Because leaders are beating pavement, it can be hard to get quality one on one time. Mentorship model is better than training model in my opinion. Honestly, splits with KW are HUGE, especially if you join a team - how is an agent supposed to ""win"" and ""crush it"" when they are giving up 55% of their 3% to team while still having 33% taken out until the 21K cap/royalty is met. Do THAT math to see what I mean. Just not feasible unless you are a unicorn and get in on a unicorn opportunity with a unicorn lead. High office fees even if you are not benefiting from access to office, but you have to rent a cube in the office if you want an in office 'spot'."

Whether you are just starting out, or you want to grow a massive team, KW has the training for you! KW is also the industry leader for technology. KW Command is the best end-to-end sales platform for real estate agents. KW technology will help you save time, money, and help you stand out to the consumer. Lastly- Keller Williams culture is the mortar that holds the value together. KW believes in win-win or no deal, everyone succeeds together, and in results thru people.","Leads will not get handed to you on a silver platter, KW will teach you how to fish. You can make millions or you can make nothing, it's all up to what you put into it. It's not about working harder, it's about working smarter.

KW is not the cheapest brokerage you can pick, yet it has the most value for what you do pay. If paying the least amount of money is most important to you than this might not be the place for you. If MAKING the most amount of money possible is most important to you, then do your business a favor and talk to KW."

They do have a support staff that will help you, but if you want any real coaching or mentorship they will make you pay for it someway.  They are a popular brand name, and you will have a lot of access to successful agents there and opportunities to potentially link up with them or join there teams.","They charge high desk fees.  Any real training or mentorship, beyond there basic sales training, they will make you pay for it.  They will give you no leads.  You can sign up for desk time, but I got one deal out of that in a year, and I was lucky to get that.  They will offer you little support.  It's all a numbers game, so the more agents they sign up to the brokerage, the more desk fees and money they're bringing in.  Knowing that 9/10 agents fail the first year, it's a revenue stream they created and they don't really care if you succeed or not.  My advice is go to work at a smaller company or a property management company where they can give you leads and you can learn the business and build your clientele, instead of learning how to make cold calls and practice cold call scripts for weeks on end.  Upper management does not care about you, you're just a statistic to them!"

As a new realtor, you are given absolutely no support. After you join, the vibe is terrible. Few acknowledge you exist and are of no help. Good luck trying to hold an open house or shadowing someone. They collect your monthly fees and leave you hanging until you leave. If you have any questions (and as a new agent you will have many), you won’t find someone who will help you. Yes, they have classes, but you can do better through the board. Keller Williams is known for their training and there may be offices out there that will provide that for you. However, keep in mind that each office is independently owned and operated. Their Aventura office does not fit the profile the company claims. Do your research ahead of time and ask many specific questions. Ask to speak to the new recruits."

You'll be told over and over how great of a company you're getting involved with.,"Everything. They only care about you as long as you have thousands to spend on their ridiculous fees and hoops they force you to jump through. You pay a big chunk of money and think you're in, just to be told there's some more payments. You pay those and then you're told you have to join the board of realtors (not a legal requirement by the way) which guess what! More money! They claim to be the best trainers with this fantastic mentor program. Everyone gets the same mentors and they dont help you do anything, but they gladly take a huge chunk of your first couple commissions. They give you access to this online system that spams you all day with emails basically asking for you to give them more money. If you're a stay at home spouse who has access to unlimited amounts of money and you want to pretend like you have a real job this is great for you. If you want a real real estate experience and are just starting out this isnt where to go. They cater to the rich and if you're not rich you'll be ignored and sucked dry of all of your money."

They give you expired and fsbo list  daily with phone numbers but many are on dnc and most have been called by 100 other agents at kw and the people get pissed off.  Some numbers are wrong number or out of service.,"Worked here part time for 2 years, went to numerous training classes.  The classes after a while repeat the same info, it’s really just to get your spirits up when you’re a new agent.  It would be better if someone gave you real confidence and sat you down to show you how to fill out listing agreement, etc.  The mentor stated he would go on appointments to help you close deals but he was busy trying to help 50 other new agents, work his own stuff so even if you got someone interested for a listing appointment you were never sure of availability of mentor and his schedule.  What are you supposed to do tell the person you’ll call them back and check with Eddie.  He should have had his schedule in Dropbox or on share point with available slots. Worked at landmark in Bayside/ Flushing and it was so cliquey run by really fake women that would walk off when you needed help for cigarette breaks and go missing. I went to summer picnic once and asked to get in softball game, no one even said hello to me, didn’t let me play.  No one subbed out.  Huge favoritism with big teams in office.  If you are part time or new don’t waste your time, or $55/ month and they are so annoying with business cards and proofs.  This is there approach to get leads- network sphere of influence, call leads daily and door knock which in pretty sure is illegal in are now.  So mainly networking.

My team leader was a KW coach and spent the majority of her days do that and never properly trained me. When I would tell her at the end of every week how overwhelmed I was, she would consistently tell me that I’ll figure it out, rather than actually taking the time to help me. I would get twenty new things thrown at me every morning with in the first five minutes I walked through the door, then when I would ask a question about something she would snap at me and say that I should know how to do it. It is safe to say there was a large lack of disrespect. As far as salary, I am a college graduate with a bachelors degree and was not paid close to the minimum entry level salary. With the amount of crazy thrown at me, that salary was a slap in the face. It is safe to say I will never do business with Keller Williams in the future or recommend the company to anyone."

I complained to maps about the coach giving this sort of talk to people (maps is the kw people who run their training program) but they never gave a response. So I left. If maps had said that one person giving the speech was their own and they don't endorse it then I would have stayed but maps never commented and I tried contacting them several times. I believe this is part of kws regular routine to tell people to charge their credit cards for their programs. I hear from others this same feeling towards kw and it irks me that the company takes advantage of people and their dreams. For that I don't see an ethical company."

They have weekly meetings so you can feel like you have a job for an hour a week.,"KW is expert at recruitment. They will woo you to join because if you name one of them as your sponsor that person will always get a cut  of your earnings.  Once I joined, my “sponsor” was MIA and I received no training or leads from her.  They do offer lots of training, mostly KW specific though.  If you join a team or try to apprentice under a seasoned agent, make sure you have an agreement to be paid an hourly wage and a cut of their commission.   The “family reunions” and BOLD trainings are just another opportunity for corporate to line their pockets. As long as you are paying that monthly fee and paying for specialized coaching, etc., they are happy enough with you.  This is not a part-time job. You must be willing to put in a lot of time cold calling and unashamedly marketing yourself.  It’s too much work for very little money for the vast majority who try real estate. Put your money into training for another job!"

Most of it is free and all of it is worth going too.,"Because most agents are there for themselves, once you have gone through the training you are kind  of out there on your own.  There are some coaches but the good ones you have to pay for.  All this is true for most all Real estate companies though."
2414,Keller Williams,Agent,2017-12-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Agents have a lot of resources available to them. Access to coaches and classes which are especially helpful to those just getting started in real estate.,"Commission splits are tough starting out. A typical split that new agents will get is 70/30 which doesn't sound terrible. However, you also have to pay a 5% coaching fee and a 6% royalties fee for every transaction. So you actually give up an extra 11% of your GROSS commission until you cap out for the year. 

For example, say you get a lease commission for $1000.00. $300 goes to the broker, $50 for coaching, $60 for royalties. So of the original $1000 you are left with $590 and you still have to pay taxes on it. Keep in mind, every broker is different and there are plenty of people that are wildly successful under this system. Just be prepared when you start, have money in savings, or have side gigs lined up. Real Estate is an all or nothing game. Good luck!"

They don't care about their employees, but rather about figures and income, and numbers. This is NOT the KW I signed up for. I am hoping KW in the US can do something about this because KW is a great brand that is getting a bad name in South Africa.

2500,Keller Williams,Cornelius NC Recruiting company Not a sales company,2017-09-22,2.0,Real Estate Agent,The idea - the idea that by joining this club that it is designed to guide you through the journey of a new career with a foundation of high level trainers and support and the only thing holding you back is yourself. I came from a similar industry straight commission extensive training made amazing money heard the reputation from past employees and assumed it was true,Not true... besides miss scheduling and canceled classes at the last min I was also informed of additional fees for new agents for the first year. I figured well as long as the hype was true I will make up difference keep moving forward. The classes seemed to consist of random agents asked to do favors and give personnel experiences. No vested interest at all in the students. No full time trainers that I met or saw the are assigned to you. More of a beat my chest brag a little while throwing some tid bits  of info to the new recruits. Being from a corporate high level sales background and trainer it is easy to spot pretenders. 3 of the 4 so called (trainers) although very nice people had very little sale teaching experience. For example how do you make a potential client feel good about signing? Drop 1 % commission. Customers love that . Now in real life professional sales training there are multiple steps to create value and trust now each of these so called trainers had the similar advice for us rookies. Red flags right I would have fired these guys if they worked for me on the spot.  Now keep in mind 2 classes where canceled after we arrived as well as miss scheduling issues. Walking in 2 weeks prior I explained I had a house to sign up can I get some assistance. The BIC who is super nice sends me to the coach . I introduce myself but they had no idea who I was or that I was hired 2 weeks prior - no introductions obviously . The coach says if you need help go to the transaction coach.  I can’t find transaction coach so I email Coach with waving my need for assistance with an actual possible sale $$$ money now at this point  that I now realize I’m WAYyy overpaying for this “extra special” care and training and assistance lol.  Next day I receive a phone call that this weird automated recording introducing the transaction coach and it say if ever I need help just email or call. Are you kidding that’s what I’ve been doing. By the way the bic was nice enough to print me blank forms  so I could just move forward on the deal without anyone . At that point I realized before I sign a new client and if I’m going to do this on my own than I refuse to overpay for this to people who are just sitting around trying to get there hands in my cookie jar and more concerned about recruiting more people to believe there own hype. The last “trainer” I approached because I’ve still got this house to sign still and wanted to utilize this “amazing” system I approached him and asked for some guidance. The response was - I’m happy to Spit 50 50 with me and we can do it together . After 3 weeks I’ve left. My feeling is that they bring in random agents to do favors to train new recruits and my guess is this is all volunteer work. These trainers make there money by selling houses not by training Very disingenuous. I emailed one of these trainers for info the so eagerly offered if we followed up with them and also got no response. They consistently where all on same page recruit and sing the song of hype but no follow through. I figured I go tell them in person  2 days in a row can’t find 3 of the leaders so I email when is a good time? 2nd day I get response I’m out of office and there wrapped up in training else where lol Business is what you make if it!!! KW will not make you succeed you will make you succeed. It s that simple This is not a sales organization if you are a top producing sale savvy career oriented high end producer this company will only frustrate you. You’ll smell the lack of sales experience and low level training a mile away.  I believe that KW at one time had a strong foundation but grew maybe to quick and lost focus on the real objective .

For a big office the system is quite efficient.,"The company is so largely focused on recruitment and growth i think it misses connecting with the day to day people right in front of them.

to begin with training is provided yet its not hands on & i personally have learned more from personal research than from going to training 
next, the commission split is 70/30. there are plenty other company's that can offer something more competetive, on top of that expect to pay about 90$ a month for mls, o&e insurance, fmls , etc. that doesnt even include an office space. you have to pay extra for that. all in all its fine if you have a developed business however as a new agent you will find it extremely difficult and stressful trying to be successful."

They go through new realtors like M&Ms when I started there were about 220 realtors they add between three and five every week or average about 15 to 20 every month and there's less realtors there now than there was when I started.

Helpful things were hard to find or locate. National KW leaders were proactive in coming up with new and better technology - but it sometimes took forever to roll out to the small time agents. 

Training available, but much of it was online and not necessarily current. Trainings offered at my brokerage were repetitive and once you've learned the topic - not useful. I offered suggestions for training at my brokerage that went ignored. 

Perhaps it depends on the brokerage you go to, but we never had a central person that you could go or call at any time for help in understanding basic concepts or for useful advice. The Team Leader's job was recruitment and keeping the top agents happy. 

The splits are OK if you are already successful, but for those starting out, don't expect to make much money.  You are paying for the brand."

They had the receptionist training us on how to use their database of contracts/forms and how to create our company website/profile. I was never told who is who in the office, so I struggled to know where to turn with various concerns or questions.  Way too many agents for a small office, so it was very easy to get lost in the crowd and feel like just a number. If you're a seasoned agent and like to work on your own, this office may be a good fit for you. I would not recommend this office to any newly licensed brokers. We all know we learn nothing about actually practicing real estate in real estate school. When you are freshly licensed and you join a brokerage, one would expect that they'd train you and show you the ropes. No such luck here."

But certainly not as a full time employee. I worked at a franchise location for 2+ years, got married and became pregnant. I was about two months away from my due date so I spoke to the brand new ""team leader""  about taking off for my maternity leave. She agreed and told me we woud have a meeting the next day. The next day I go into her office for our meeting, for what I think is going to be about my leave, and she fires me. Two months before i was due I get fired. Fired from a company whose core values are "" God, Family then business"", which is all a lie. So naturally I file for unemployment. Shortly after I start receiving unemployment, I get a letter in the mail stating that Keller Williams was appealing my unemployment and that I was to show up a court date, that happened to be very near to when my baby was due.  Sure enough, my child was born the day before the court date. I was able to get released from the hospital early and make it to the hearing, the day after having a baby!!  And now almost 7 years later of dealing with this awful company.  I am still dealing with the aftermath of unemployment. Because God forbid the company had kept me as an employee and pay me any maternity leave. So I will leave my long review with this... their core values of ""God, family then business"" are all lies."

2631,Keller Williams,Headquarters - IT Department Needs a Major Overhaul,2017-06-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Has great training for new realtor's.  Many current/former cheerleaders/theater people that are just waiting for the opportunity to cheer you on for doing your intended job.,"Potential new employees need to know things before working at KWRI Headquarters.    

This company claims to be about having a good God/Family/Life  balance, yet behind the scenes they have purposely created a ""fear mentality"".  Management wants employees to work in fear of losing their job, so they have done as much as possible to create this unhealthy environment.  Do not ever forget this, upper management is about money, and they will throw anyone under the bus to attain it.
 
This is a right to work state, and management is serious about that.  It is a CYA environment.  This is true for all departments.  Get everything in writing or be prepared to get thrown under the bus by management.  In the IT department, this ""thrown under the bus"" mentality is seen with the CIO (Chief Innovation Officer), and trickles down.  The CIO has even taken credit for ideas by other people and received a company ""brick of value"" in one of the monthly company staff meetings.

Do not get caught up during the hiring period that a low salary will be offset by the end of year bonus.  It is not worth it, so make sure you get a fair market salary, and don't except less.  Bonus is talked about as an offset to below market salary, but then top management discuss it as a gift.  A gift can be taken away at any time.  Don't fall for the bonus/gift trap, get a fair market salary.  If you take a below market salary, you will stay below while employeed at KWRI.  There is a yearly merit raise, which is up to 3% of your salary.  A manager gets 3-4% for each employee, then distributes it on how the manager sees fit.  If your manager likes you, good, if the manager does not like you, good luck.  The only way to get a larger raise is to get a level raise (which is 10% or less), which again is up to the manager, so previous sentence applies again.

In December, a certain woman picks a day to hand out what upper management calls a ""gift"", but are really bonus checks.  It is literally a song, and possibly a dance, show.  Your suppose to show how grateful you are, even though you earn the bonus.  And the person handing out the checks will decide what day the bonus will be handed out.  It is at their whim.  This gift is not worth what it takes to earn it, and each year we are reminded that it can be taken away."

Freedom with regards to hours, attire and making your office personal.","Too many to list.  The company culture promoted does NOT fall in line with an MCA's reality.  The realtors are obnoxious, rude and at times verbally abusive.  Our Team Leader would not help teammates. You could have three people at your desk, the receptionist out to lunch, two phone lines ringing and the UPS man needing a signature and the TM would walk away saying ""That's not my job.""  Guess what - it's all our jobs since we are the office staff.  You are on your own.  You can get training, but the realtors will pitch a fit and lie about not getting their checks on time because you weren't there to crank it out the minute they think you got the check from the title company. (Maybe it came, maybe it didn't. Doesn't matter to them - only that they ""think"" it's there.)  Not sure how you're supposed to train off-site and cut checks at the same time on-site, but that's what they expect.  You will be offered 3 weeks+ vacation/time-off, but be unable to use it.  If you figure out a way to get a day or two off, be prepared for being yelled at when you get back.  I was asked to do things I felt were dishonest.  Too many of the realtors at our MC were brand new.  There was a constant flow of disgruntled ones who weren't told upfront about the copious fees they owe.  What you see on walls promoted about culture and are told during the interview process does NOT match reality.  I was on at least 4+ hours of mandatory phone calls each week, required to back up our receptionist and other duties not related to finance - more than 25-30% of my week and still expected to do a full's week of my finance duties.  The conference calls are a total waste of time if you aren't a profitable MC.  The culture promotes using the same words over and over again until you want to throw up.  The word ""leverage"" is banned from my home.  Overall - the worst job I've ever had.  Had high expectations based on the interview process.  Feel lied to."

* lots and lots and lots of fees (even if you don't use the service being charged for)
* highly competitive -- especially in a seller's market with limited inventory, the 
   more agents there are, the less each agent has the potential to make.
* ""fake it 'til you make it"" mentality is a disservice to clients
* expect to be told to do lots of cold calling and doorknocking to get leads -- I did 
   not get into real estate to become a telemarketer or door-to-door salesman.
* not taken seriously as a agent unless you take the additional, very expensive 
   BOLD training that emphasizes calling everyone you know, then cold-calling 
   everyone you don't, constantly.
* lots more agents than office space, so only high-producers or office ""clique"" is 
   actually at the office. 
* If you're not in the paid coaching program, don't expect to be taken seriously, no

Convoluted computer systems and way too many programs required to make your business function properly. They use 3 different databased to search properties. Since the company is also based in Austin, TX, a lot of their training material and software is designed for the national real estate market, which is different from NYC's workflows (ie single-family homes vs apartments, coops, condos).

2737,Keller Williams,Training But It Will Cost You,2017-03-09,3.0,Real Estate Agent,"If you want a culture that thrives on continual education and training then KW is a great place for you. 

Open door policy 
Flexible Schedule - You are an independent contractor you choose when to work and when to play.","Franchise - each office is run independently with a set of base guidelines and business rules that must be met to carry the KW branding. This allows for each office to be run differently and may not provide the same services as others that carry the KW branding. 
Training is unorganized and not geared towards someone who has never done the job before. 
COSTLY Fee- Unlike competition there is a fee for everything literally everything and its seen as a small fee $100 here $100 there. If you want to work in the office and in an actual work-space there is a fee for it. 
Advance Training- is highly pushed and again can range into the $1000's 
You get recruited and provided entry level training and then thrown to the wind and just told to lead generate, even if you have not a clue how to do that. 
Commission splits are high you must donate $20,000 to the company before you get your full commission, some competitors are much lower. 
Providing constructive feedback to upper management is seen as a negative and not well received.
DISC Personality Testing - the test is used for every position you attempt to apply for, even if you are already an agent with them and want to join a team, its a test that can be flawed and manipulated by the test taker yet is used in 99% of all decisions. 
Follow Up & Communication - Communication varies and follow up from other agents is either non-existent or not timely.
Transferring and Office Affiliation - Once you sign an agreement with one office it is highly frowned upon you switching to another KW office, I found the KW office 5 mins from me to be more convenient yet when I asked what the process would be to move there, my request basically landed on deaf ears."

Keep in mind that they are a ""coaching and training company"". They just happen to specialize in real estate. What that means is that the staff is there largely to make money off of the classes and coaching and it's very expensive! The second biggest thing is recruiting and it is a well disguised MLM network.  Their methods are old school and they teach you things that many ethical people simply will not do such as ignoring ""no solicitation"" signs and the do not call list.

Charge them for this and that and yes, the training and the coaching...it's going to cost you....$1000 a month! And what do the coaches do? Tell you to door knock, know your scripts. It's all so old school. It's all boils down to how much money can be sucked from the agents. And the other big goal is recruit, recruit, recruit. The Team Leaders, who consider themselves the CEOs of their office, are considered only ""recruiters"" at corporate. The top dogs are pulling in a half million a year, or more. The agents? Well, the turnover rate with agents is astronomical because most don't make enough to live..

recommends you to attend a series of free trainings, with the pretense you will become a better agent. However these trainings are previews of Paid trainings!! Again with the same excuse that it will help you

Not to mention that after every free training, they bring a third party vendor that tries to sell you something, again with the excuse that it will help you be a better agent. 

They charge you 89 dollars a month, just to work
for them and you get no leads no clients nothing. You are 100% on your own, plus 25 cents per
color print out copy. Finally the split is 36% of your commission for them 64% for you, until you Cap. This makes no sense cause, Keller Williams has nothing to do with you getting any sales or leads.  

Any Broker will hire an agent for free because its a Commission only job with no benefits, and perhaps even give you leads and a better split. Don't fall
in this place cause you will go broke buying their trainings and products and third party recommended products before you make any sales."

You  have your monthly office fees which  vary from office to office and franchise fees. They also try to get you to sign up for expensive training retreats. There are also little fees such as color printing etc. .If you are going to be a new agent here, you have to hold open houses and take as many training classes as possible to sell otherwise you are just spending money."

You work when or as much as you want but as a result you are responsible for your own success.","This is definitely a career for someone who is self motivated/starting. You are responsible for finding all your own clients and closing deals so if you aren't (politely) aggressive when it comes to sales, you won't find the success you might otherwise be able to. It also helps to have a LARGE sphere of influence starting out. Probably a better career for more established business-savvy folks than those who are new to the career world"

The monthly fees are relatively cheap compared to other brokers. Everybody wants to see each other succeed. Awesome splits and profit sharing!,The only con that I've experienced is that in today's market everybody stays extremely busy so SOMETIMES the leader you are wanting to run a question by in the office will be busy but it's easy to find somebody else to answer you question if you can't wait.

Suggest looking elsewhere if you're new to Austin or have solid professional experience. Only reason KWRI achieved ""Best Places to work"" is because they included Market Centers. If anything the working conditions was Toxic. Very little substance at this company due to poor management and profit share being the deciding factor. There was very little professional development and/ or low employee success. If you get in, get out before you pick up bad habits."

This companies values and support are amazing. I've worked at all the main Real Estate firms and by far KW surpasses any of them and I mean any. They teach you how to run a business and truly offer areas within the company. Team building and Expansion opportunity that the other companies reserve for only the brokers. Absolutely the best choice.",With any firm there are too many monthly fees. But KW most reasonable. Could be lower overall with every firm considering technology brings us less in the office.

If you feel like a 60/40ish split is good and fair, by all means ignore my cons, but if that's an issue you should really check other places as some only have a 10% or even less split and cheaper monthly fee's.. training might not be that great but they don't rip you off.

Almost forgot, they have this referral program where if you can get an agent to sign up with KW they will give you a very small percentage a month of that person's sells for the life of that person's duration with the company, the more people you refer the bigger your monthly bonus check is (to me it's reminiscent of a Ponzi scheme to me)."

Fun working environment but very competitive.,"It's difficult to get clients unless you know lots of people or are willing to call or pound the pavement everyday.  Lead generation is not for the timid!  KW recommends you work from referrals so you need to be willing to contact your family, friends and social network to build your business.  Best personality for this job is someone that is motivated by winning, competitive, strong willed, driven, self confident, direct and results driven."

- The commission split is better than some places",- Get rid of the 6% additional royalty fee
3040,Keller Williams,Associate Broker,2016-05-16,4.0,Associate Broker,"KW offered excellent training and was always willing to strive to stay current with the latest and greatest as far as technology and assistance with growing your business for their brokers.  They are a company that believes in the team system and they encourage you to build a team.  They have 2 big national education conferences every year, Mega Camp, and Family Reunion.  Both are fantastic and you get an opportunity to hear how the high producing and successful agents are having success.  Some of the speakers aren't even KW agents which I thought was very broad thinking and inclusive of the company.  You do get a sense of belonging to a family there which I really liked...a real estate sorority and fraternity if you will.  They give back to the community, and hold several events to raise money and build brand recognition and employee culture.  I would recommend KW to any new agent wanting to learn the business and get excellent training.  Almost all of the agents are willing to help and are very open about sharing their success strategies with you.  You also can earn additional money by recruiting more agents to join KW, and many people receive a residual income from just recruiting.","The only reason I decided to make move to another brokerage after being there for 5 years was that I was interested in making more money.  I got tired of paying franchise fees, royalty fees, and addl. insurance that I was required to get.  I am one of those type of agents that does not like being on a team, and I was not interested in growing a team either.  I""ve already been a licensed agent for over 12 years, so I felt I wasn't so new that I needed the training.  Already having a successful career, I felt that I didn't need the brand name either, and that it wasn't worth 35% of my paycheck.  I did end up going to a brokerage that that takes much less of a split, and as a business decision, it was the right thing for me to do.  It afforded me the opportunity to expand my business by advertising more with the money I was saving from the commission split.  I would go back to KW, if they considered changing their commission structure, but by the end of the 6 years, and $130K+ paid to KW, I felt like it was time to make myself some money, and not the KW big wigs. The culture has also suffered because the company has had difficulty getting agents to participate and engage in KW culture events.  There is also a sense of separation between the two offices there instead of a feeling of inclusiveness.  Many times the offices would not include one another in events and/or training."

Lots of smile in your face, talk behind your back little cliques. 98% are very low production and low quality agents who speak the language and try to mimic the top few agents in the company. Picture a child walking around in adults big shoes and hat pretending to be grown up. This is the environment of being around agents at kw. The recruiting concept looks good from the outside but in reality causes people to mislead others to want to join the company by highlighting the upsides and covering up all of the major down sides."

There were no additional brokerage fees, as I've heard some other brokerages charge, unless u wanted one of the private offices.
For anyone just starting out, or looking to make a move in real estate, I highly recommend finding a Keller Williams office.

They are active in supporting their community.  You couldn't work for a better company.","As most people know, being a Realtor, you are on commission.  Therefore, until a sale closes, you are not paid. This is the norm of the Industry.

Company more vested in browning their business than retention. Forced to work from home due to no office space. Training/development is weak and painfully lethargic.

You can bring clients there but who does that...,"They call it ""free training"" when you're paying a monthly fee. Then when you complete your ""free"" training, they push these expensive training sessions that are paid week long events. Let me summarize your FREE training for you here: ""hold open houses on weekends"" then ""send thank you notes"" and ""call your dentist and tell them you are a realtor now!"" There you go. You can now move on with your real estate career with all of that vast knowledge I have cliff noted for you and saved your time and monthly fee. You're welcome. Now heed my advise. Go somewhere that will actually buddy you up with a real estate agent who will let you shadow or be a buyers agent for their team. Don't buy into this scheme at KW.

Every firm has costs and fees associated with being a realtor but compared to my market KW was slightly high. However, if you are a leading producer you can get 100% commission.

3316,Keller Williams,Money pit,2015-08-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Great training. The reason I was so interested in KW was their extensive and truly excellent training.,"Unfortunately, EVERYTHING at KW costs a great deal of money. Their monthly fees and everything else costs more than the average realtor can make in a year. It broke me. The biggest problem with this company is their MLM approach. They recruit like mad, leaving little to go around. Really? Advertising for Brokers on Craigslist?."

3318,Keller Williams,Great Culture - Intense Training,2015-08-17,4.0,Realtor,"There's a real culture of sharing at KW. There are a lot of agents so it's easy to book open houses when you need one. There are a lot of things to love at KW. Company enthusiasm, encourages success, uplifting and supportive, constant classes on a rotating schedule as well as new classes and information, the staff is always working hard to improve the offerings. Offers Ignite Training to get an agent started in business. Strong Christian environment.","It's very much a sink or swim environment. There is no mentoring or hand holding. There is coaching done by 1 person who serves ALL the incoming agents. There is a compliance director who is available to answer questions. If you are lucky enough to hook up with a veteran agent who is willing to take you under their wing, DO IT! Heavy emphasis on growth spreads resources a little thin. You absolutely must go ask for/find/figure out what you need in order to succeed. Very aggressive sales culture. This is an expensive brokerage to be a part of, but if you are a go getter or you work with a team it might be worth it. Strong Christian environment."
3319,Keller Williams,Keller Williams Training,2015-08-17,5.0,Real Estate Agent,"Keller Williams is the most amazing company. They have the such in depth training, for their real estate agents. Bob Baker as well as the other trainers are so informative and have a passion that is  contagious. Thank you Keller Williams","There are no cons for this company.

3320,Keller Williams,Too Expensive and Too Many Better Choices,2015-08-15,3.0,Realtor,"The office is beautiful (but you pay for that with the terrible splits) and the people are nice and friendly.  Really the people are the best thing. However, working with nice, friendly people only goes so far and it doesn't pay the bills which is why so many people are leaving!","One of the most expensive brokers you can work for. Sure there is a lot of training but the most useful training, and any kind of real one on one assistance, costs extra. The splits are terrible - 60/40 when more progressive brokers with better technology and free leads are giving you 80/20. Free support, especially technical support, is almost non-existent. Keller Williams is all about recruiting and training and that's how they make a lot of their money. Once you're in, they turn their attention to getting more people in and selling you on all their expensive additional training. If you want to be in real estate to actually sell real estate, there are so many better choices.  If you do get in, be careful as it is nearly a cult and there will be people who show a whole different side if you ever try to leave."

Every individual does a lot to keep this company going at the rate it is. There are at least a few people who probably do the work of two or three, by themselves. Still, it is a rewarding place to work, and they seem to be hiring quite a bit, which should offset some of the work load."

3325,Keller Williams,Agent-The Woodlands & Magnolia,2015-08-12,1.0,,Lots of information and extensive intranet,"Nickel & dime you to death with their fees. They give NOTHING for free. You even get charged $150 for your training binder which they do not tell you until you're in the office to sign the agreement. If I'd known how bad the training was, I would have chosen another brokerage. Might as well stay home and read the binder but they make you go to the classes to qualify for property time. 

Also, they take a percentage of your sales the first year right off the top for their so-called Coach whether you use her or not (she spends most of her time talking about how great she is and is impossible to get an appointment with). They even charge you to use their signs. Been there awhile and still can't figure out what exactly they are giving for all the fees they charge. There is a fee to belong to the Profit Share group ($25 per month), which creates the atmosphere of an MLM. 

Overall, a very greedy organization set up as almost a pyramid scheme."

3344,Keller Williams,Great Real Estate Company,2015-07-20,4.0,Realtor,Keller Williams offers great Profit sharing opportunities that no other real estate company offers.

Great company that strives to instruct all agents on the importance of personal branding and lead generation.,Too strong of a focus on the profit-sharing benefits of KW can tend to attract the wrong type of personality.

Help is always available from management, staff and other agents
Everyone is interested and invested in your success","Frankly, I can't think of any"
3390,Keller Williams,IT Dept - Franchise Headquarters,2015-06-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"In most instances, you're given a great deal of autonomy and empowerment to accomplish your goals. Rapid growth has led to extraordinary opportunities for employees on all levels ... the current HR director was first hired as the lobby receptionist, for example. Upward mobility is a very real possibility for those who have ambition, ability, perseverance and enough self-awareness to navigate the politics.

There is an annual profit share bonus that generally pays out in the 20+% of your annual salary range at the end of the year. This is touted as a ""gift"", yet is factored into every salary negotiation (i.e., you'll basically be expected to accept a salary less than your actual worth with the expectation this bonus will make up for it at the end of the year, which it generally does).","The cult of personality reigns supreme at KW International. Department goals and objectives are regularly derailed by one manufactured crisis after another, more often than not the result of some well-connected person in the field calling in favors or making complaints. 

Staffing levels are almost comically insufficient to maintain our current technology offerings, and in no semblance of reality are they adequate to meet the stated goals of the organization moving forward. ""Work/Life Balance"" is a line they sell to the agents and franchise owners - expect to work 50-60 hour weeks, or see your annual reviews suffer. Participation in the constant events being hosted is mandatory: Two yearly conventions (one of which you must share a hotel room with a co-worker  for a week) as well as the constant events being held in Austin will entail a constant flood of requests for mandatory ""volunteers"" to participate. You will be clearing food off of tables, holding up signs, directing people to busses, holding microphones for attendees (and being derided publicly by the speaker if they think you aren't hustling enough) and other menial tasks regularly throughout the year. 

Leadership works on a ""chaos by design"" principle, which is basically a cover for ""making it up as we go"". Your priorities and focus will be in a constant state of change, partly due to lack of planning, partly due to what's ""hot"" at the moment (again, VIPs calling in favors), and partly due to an overloaded IT infrastructure that the organization has long since outgrown yet cannot be replaced due to lack of resources. 

If you crave working endless hours on largely undocumented 2008-era technologies that are constantly falling over dead, this is the place for you."

Down line profit share program
Zero Corporate Debt
After you ""CAP"", you get to keep 100% of your commission typically after the company earns somewhere between $20K and $45K
Competitive Splits pre ""Capping""","Individual offices can have dreadful management and cronyism
Some of the Managing Brokers are a bit too focused on spending as little time as possible advising their agents when legal issues crop up. Additionally, they utter the words "" Your client needs to hire an attorney"" a bit too often
There is a constant  & intense pressure on team leader to recruit any warm body. They will often focus on Quantity over Quality. In a booming market we end up with people who shouldn't be in sales. 
Some team leaders will try and ""steal"" people you have recommended so you don't get the downline, they do. This is highly  unethical.
Favoritism: The Team Leaders and Managing Brokers make money in their downline for folks they brought in. They therefore will provide incoming sales leads only to people in their downline.
Mentorship: Newbies are required to have a mentor who takes 25% of their first three transactions. Some of the Mentors are not up to the task, some are excellent. No oversight or standards for mentorship."

As a highly experienced agent the demands placed on helping to train others became excessive.,High volume of paperwk to complete.  Expected that you would train others all the time.

The Team Leaders are at your disposal and the seasoned agents are readily available to answer questions.,Must be a self-starter and motivated to take advantage of the training and put it to work in the field.
3501,Keller Williams,World class training!,2014-12-28,5.0,Broker Associate,"Great culture, very clear mission and value proposition, unparalleled training.",All advance level training comes with a lofty price tag.  Corporate commission added on to office commission and desk fees.  Get's very expensive.
3502,Keller Williams,20 Year Top Producer  Switched to KW and Loves it!,2014-12-27,5.0,Realtor,"After reading about the diverse interview experiences here it brings one thing to mind - they are as diverse as the people who interviewed them - and they sound like experiences you could have walking into ANY real estate company.  If you're newly licensed you want to feel listened to and have the interview be about you and all you can bring to that office.  But the reality is, EVERY broker wants you to sign with them - YOU are the commodity and they are trying to show you how their company is different and better than the next.  So look beyond that and start thinking in terms of who you are going to pick not who is going to pick you..  That being said, I was evaluating my options for a couple years - every company was a lateral move - until I learned about Keller Williams opening in my area.  I researched the company and got to know the people running this market center. I respected both.  Not only that, but HAND DOWN no other company offers anything close to the training Keller Williams does for either a new or seasoned agent to expand their business.  I was with another large franchise for 19 years and never heard one hour of the pragmatic, direct, 'hears how to do it' training KW offers regularly.  As for the pyramid 'scheme' - yes, they have an incentive program for bringing in other agents that can pay you dividends or life.  Smart people, because like I said, EVERY broker wants more agents.  That was the last consideration on my list.  If you're serious about selling real estate, don't worry about it - it's there, great, but focus on selling and getting all the raining you can.  The commission structure is amazing - and consistent around the country.   They can afford to offer the dividends for bringing in new agents because they run lean offices - and have a transparent, 'open book' policy for their market centers.  The broker owner is only allowed to keep a percentage of the center's profit.  Believe me - THAT is huge too - unheard of in most businesses. They also have a great website that puts your listings out across the internet to over 350 sites. I am as pleased as I hoped to be with my switch to KW.  Great people, great company that understands what agents really need to grow their business.","Everything can be a double-edged sword.  The company's 'putting agents first' policy means all of your advertising has YOUR contact information on it, not the companies - so your efforts come right back to you.  And they give you a greater share of the commission than most companies.  But that means you take on more of your own expenses - the initial outlay for signs, headshots, business cards, etc... as well as your on-going advertising expenses.  You have to plan for that."
3503,Keller Williams,"Great brand, bad leadership.",2014-12-23,3.0,Agent,Brand recognition and training opportunities.,Not an agent-centric business model.
3504,Keller Williams,Great company to work for. Lots of technical advances,2014-12-22,5.0,,You can do very well if you work on a team with an experienced Broker.,"You are on call 24/7 and have to be available always to answer phone calls, texts and emails.  More work thaen people think."
3505,Keller Williams,Culture is second to none.  Do more to put money directly into the pockets of agents.,2014-12-21,5.0,Market Center Administrator,"The culture at KW is very well developed, matriculated, and practiced.  The educational platforms are also very well put together.  At this company, more so than at the other traditional brokerages, the environment is more professional and business like, and they excel at coaxing increased production from all of their agents.","Pay and treatment of employees (non-agents) can be very poor compared to other professional services firms.  This results in a good amount of turnover.  Being that each office is independently owned and operated, however, I'm sure this isn't the case in all regions.  The real estate industry (in general) can attract a lot of motivated, clever, but entirely uneducated people, and with KW's emphasis on growth at all costs KW offices (as with most other traditional brokerages, I'm sure) can be plagued with a lot of shady business men/women."

Great education. Tons of free classes, training opportunities, and online resources. KW lives up to its claim of being ""an education company disguised as a real estate brokerage"".
Team brand/model. Business structure focuses on team branding rather than brokerage branding. Freedom to create your own company within a company. Focus on expansion and leverage for big picture thinkers.",Lots of red kool aid.

3527,Keller Williams,"Good for short-term or VERY long term.  ""Eh"" in between",2014-11-06,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits (21 days PTO; 95% coverage of medical, dental, vision insurance; 401K matching; education reimbursement program)
Job stability (0 layoffs in the history of the company)
Room for growth (positions are created based on need - if you find a need in the company and can fill it, you have the potential to move up quickly)","Indecision - the company has pet projects that it comes up with multiple times a year, follows through on some, scraps others, or will have an entire project completed before deciding that's not what they really wanted to do after all
Poor follow through - Will come up with a project, and either not be able to complete it (due to no budget or not enough knowledge) or the project will simply ""go cold"" because some other idea came up
Poor project management - some project managers can't manage projects!  When the entire role of an individual (or several individuals) is to manage projects, there is no reason projects should consistently fail on delivery.
Pay is ""okay"" - the company offers significant profit share checks, but you have to wait until the end of the year to get them.  The amount of profit share is factored into how much they pay you (it becomes a part of negotiation.  If your position should pay $100K, and profit share would be $20K, they will try to give you a BASE of $80K because ""with profit share, you're pretty much there"""
3528,Keller Williams,"As a realtor, how can you not be working at KW??  Best real estate model around",2014-11-06,5.0,Sales Associate,"KW's model is untouchable compared to the other local brokerages.  No other company offers profit sharing amongst the agents (the opportunity to build wealth and allow for retirement at some point in my life)) rather than the owners keeping all of the profit for themselves, the most current technology (agent websites with easy navigation for clients, back end website for agents, and an online filing system that can be shared with clients), education offered on a daily basis (they want you to succeed and have the top agents showing you the path to get there), and a family culture where people are team players and go out of their way to help.... yes, in a busy office there are actually people who are always available to help and want you to succeed.  I previously worked at an office where the commission splits were high and where everyone works very independently, which was great for awhile and I thought the best deal available, but when I learned of KW coming to town and compared the amount of money I gave to my office (all to the owners) vs what I would have paid to KW, it was unreal.  Literally 2.5x more expensive to work at my previous company, which had me at a 95/5 split and monthly rent. No opportunity for growth there and no synergy.","As a realtor you are responsible for your own health insurance.  I'm fortunate that I'm covered under my husband, but benefits are not offered at KW and other real estate offices.  KW has preferred vendors they work with for discounted prices, but I don't know much about it.  Just be aware that this cost is on you and be sure to inquire when interviewing."

3530,Keller Williams,Great Company but you better enjoy sales.,2014-11-03,4.0,Real Estate Agent,The commission scale is great. They provide a great deal of training prior to and during your career.,The only issue i had was not with the company itself more with the industry. I felt like i was trying to sell things to people that they didn't want or need. Again this was a personal issue and in no way reflects on the company itself.

I came from a smaller, local firm, and KW simply blows them out of the water with their tools and training available. Every agent gets 3 websites as part of their monthly fee. We also get our own branded mobile app. Our market center has weekly training classes on all sorts of topics. Every seasoned agent is available to help. KW has a unique win, win mentality.

The pay rate is also very undelightful. It is commission only, so if you don't already have a foundation it would be incredibly hard to afford the real estate expenses. There were ALOT of expenses. Including the brokerage fee, transportation, marketing, association fees, and it didn't feel good working for free.

They are a very philanthropic company that does truly try to give back. They are very pro work-life balance and host many events for their employees.,"This is not a review from a Realtor, so for a Realtor, it may be a very different experience there. It was very hard to contact anyone in charge if I was having issues.  All the offices were independently owned and there was continuous contention between the owners, each wanting things done their ways.  I quite often got stuck in the middle of office politics with one deeming me and my position unnecessary and one one telling me I'm doing a great job.  I never knew where I stood in my position.  I also never felt that the manager of the actual office I was hired through had my back in anything.  You never get a sense of where you stand and there is no chance of advancement.

-100% commission after $2M in sales
-""Free"" coaching","-No leads provided. Ever.
-$75 office fee on top of 70/30 commission split. And what does that $75 buy you? If you find out, let me know.
-Too many agents, so you will get zero personal attention or assistance.
-Hard to talk to the broker or coach to get important, and often time-sensitive, questions answered
-Training classes are taught by fellow agents in the office. They will help some, but ultimately they don't want you to do well because you would just be taking clients from them. Also, you are tricked into thinking these classes are provided by your broker to help you. No. They just want to charge you $400 for them, and move on. Recruiting new agents, collecting the $75 monthly office fee, and getting them to pay $400 for basic classes, and $800 for Bold (an ""accelerated"" class), is the only thing they are concerned with.
-The coaching program is a joke. You can never get the coach on the phone, they have dozens and dozens of other agents they are coaching (so good luck getting them to remember what last talked about), and they are an agent as well (so don't tell them a new top secret marketing strategy because they will probably steal it).

3598,Keller Williams,"Unfriendly, unwelcoming, and spiteful",2014-07-14,1.0,Administrative Assistant,OK pay. Free classes that were sometimes interesting.,"My review is coming from someone who worked as an administrative assistant for a well-respected team at KW. The agent(s) I worked for were unfriendly, unwelcoming, and spiteful. I could not believe how much other agents admired this team considering that when anything ever went wrong, they would bang their fists on the table numerous times like spoiled toddlers.

I was hired for the position after emphasizing that fact that I had no background in real estate. Although they stated they were OK with this, I received scant and rushed training which practically set me up for failure. While asking questions and trying to adapt to the new work environment, the agent(s) completely ignored or rolled their eyes at me for not knowing something I was never informed about. So much for a ""helping-hand"" culture.

This is a company that stalks property owners by calling them daily and begging them to allow them to sell their home. 

Everyone in this company is OLD (40+) which isn't necessary bad -- however it makes for a very old-fashioned, backwards thinking culture. There is no age diversity; at least not at this KW chapter.

Also, the storefront's colors (black background with red and white lettering) make it look like a tattoo parlor. Yuck."

Director of HR, for an example, is uncredentialed.  Her job is to please the executives rather than being the advocate for both the company and the people who work in the company. 

Of all departments, MarCom likely to be the worst of all.  Can't expect much from this team when it's led by someone with very limited experience and often makes decisions based on emotions.  Lots of blaming throughout the entire company. Management cares only for their personal gain.

However, it was nice to hook up with like-minded colleagues who were not sharks, but helpful.","You are on your own, after all and no one is going to pay you if you don't do the work!

Win-Win meant to be everyone wins or there is no deal.  At the HQ only management wins.  Relatives of leadership team also wins.  Integrity: to most ego-driven leadership team, do the right thing means do what benefit themselves the most.  Customers do not always come first. Leadership team does."

I've never seen a company more committed to maintaining relationships and satisfaction among those that seek support of the franchiser. KWRI is truly committed to it's Market Centers and the independent contractors within.,"Hiring direct family members into significant leadership positions brought the KWRI IT department to its knees. The talent has all but walked out the door leaving the rest to stay and either frantically look for jobs elsewhere or wade through the disdain and general unhappiness that remains. The decisions to continue to bring in additional directors and middle management while the workforce walks out should be better thought out. This is the exact reason the KWRI IT Department has not developed a solid, in-house product in well over 2 years."

3658,Keller Williams,Stay away from I.T. Dept.,2014-03-16,2.0,I T,"KW is a great company with many smart, capable people through out the company. Nice culture with annual bonus - called the ""gift"" employee events etc.","The I.T. department is a horrible, dysfunctional place that rewards mediocrity, incompetence and hostility. Led by a family member of an executive with little or no I.T. or management experience, the department is in sad shape - anyone who has any talent or marketable skills are gone leaving behind the incompetent.  There is a strange structure in place with a horde of middle managers who have no one to manage and no accountability for anything. Every vendor relationship turns out to be a bad one.

Stay away from I.T. if you have any talent, ability, like to be rewarded for being competent or like to work with other minded people. If you happen to be related or connected to any of the senior management staff and can't get a job on your own - it will be a great place for you."
