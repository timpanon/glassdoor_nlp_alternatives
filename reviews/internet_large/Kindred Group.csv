Non of these things exist anymore.
Salary is mediocare at best. All of the benefits what we had basically were taken away, and now that the pandemic is over the company is not in a rush to give them back. Horrible behaviour from managers and HR - this company is still a boys club where women and espeically women of color are not being treated fairly. It takes ages to advance in your carrer as a woman, and you are being told its because you are too emotional or too assetive. 
Everybody is burned out, and those of the best who havent left this sinking ship already are being fired or offered lower positions and therefore are forced to leave because of the countless reorganizations. Thanks to these, nobody know who is responsible for what. 
HR is trying to get people fired they dont like and managers dont have your back. Avoid this place, it will take your will to leave away."

21,Kindred Group,Disappointed,2022-01-23,2.0,Copywriter,Until last year's no-sense restructure I really enjoyed working here. The company's culture was great and colleagues and managers friendly and competent.,Everything went downhill after the restructure. They gave new roles to people who didn't deserve them but were friends of the people who had decisional power. So the best people left the company and the chaos began.
22,Kindred Group,Great company to work for,2021-12-16,5.0,Customer Service Agent,"- Possibility to grow

23,Kindred Group,Excellent in almost every way,2021-12-05,5.0,Senior Marketing Manager,"Having been in the company more than a few years, I've seen massive and radical changes to put employees first. And it really shows: loads of benefits, excellent offices, equipment, flexible work, mental health focus and a genuinely great company culture... which isn't really even cringe-worthy (that's a challenge). You're actively encouraged to develop your skills, and there's absolutely no shortage of internal- and external courses of excellent quality: even support of paid courses/certifications and possibilities to visit trading events globally.

Great colleagues, positivity, socials and a flat company structure makes this a place you can get your voice heard, and are not afraid of pushing for change (one of the company mottos is 'dare to challenge'). 

The management team have a lot of experience and in many ways have evolved themselves based upon feedback into a more flexible, and agile-based company focusing on sustainability and growth. 

Benefits are good, with plenty of holidays, corporate insurance, pension contribution, well-being days etc.

Very, very inclusive as well.

All, in all though, you really wouldn't be able to find many companies of this caliber, which shows in the genuine engagement among employees, the transparency and positive vibes you get here. Truly deserves as 'best employer'!","The negatives are comparatively few, but like with any company, there are some: slow career progression, out-dated rigidity in some aspects (far behind competition in creativity, boldness, data-driven decisions).

The most negative aspect would have to be the (sometimes severe) under-staffing in certain core teams, where a lot of people and teams are essentially 'putting out fires', leaving lot of dreams and little hope to bring real change through testing and innovation. The backlogs are multi-year long for most product-related improvements. There's also often too many people involved in even simple decisions, which delays and revokes moving forward.

Working in marketing, it's also evident that the company really lacks on the creative side; which is a shame. as this is of course a fundamental enabler for company growth. 

Lastly - whilst the company has become a lot more data-driven and ROI-focussed last few years - there's still plenty of decisions which are not scrutinized from an objective, data-driven approach, despite there being a lot of data. Utilization of available data is massive: but this often boils down to the under-staffing spanning across many core teams.

Lastly, whilst salaries are vastly better than (ad) agencies, they're still on the lower side."
24,Kindred Group,Losing it's way,2021-11-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people - this is what makes Kindred one of the best places to work. Some of the people at Kindred are some of the smartest and most competent I've ever had the pleasure of working with.
Socially, Kindred is a dream - you'll get very close to some of your colleagues and definitely make some new friends should you stay long enough.
Depending on what vertical you're under, you'll find work extremely easy with the great people around you.","Senior Management are running the business into the ground. Before covid, Kindred was heading for what you might consider the bottom of the barrel. The share price was in the toilet and somehow senior management kept on as if it wasn't clearly a company on it's last legs. 
Since then, Covid saved Kindred, it's share price and the expected takeover bid, but unfortunately not its ways of working. Multiple restructures in the last few years have lead to the strangest process and hierarch model you can imagine. Nobody knows who is responsible for what and as a consequence, a very small group of people are carrying the burden for a business boasting 2,000 employees - and as an even bigger consequence, some of the brightest minds at Kindred have left, or are about to."

Lot of back stabbing even against the company itself and people trying to look better than they are just to protect their own jobs. 

Old workers tried to put stop to all development which would force them to actually learn new ways to work.

The managers liked to travel all over the world doing nothing but hosting winning players at different kinds of sports events leaving the actual work for others down the hierarchy. Tons of money spent to crazy marketing ideas, events, expensive dinners and such with no actual positive impact to the revenue. 

Old workers hanging tight into their jobs doing things they are not qualified to do. 

Lot of bullying and harrassment happening behind the curtains."

99,Kindred Group,"Used to be great... Now a nasty, toxic, political and cold place with no focus on employees",2021-01-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A nice office in a good location and a diverse working environment. That is all.,"- Pay significantly below the gambling industry standards - the main excuse is that Kindred is a great company to work for, which should attract good candidates. Well, this is sadly no longer the case. Meager salary in a dreadful and cold corporation. Poor annual salary rises. 
- 3 major reorganisations within 4.5 years, making a lot of loyal and well performing employees redundant. No feeling of job security or stability. The last wave of redundancies happened just before Christmas 2020, where more than 75 people were laid off. All those people haven't gotten all their bonuses or shares paid as they deserved. Cheap way to save on operational costs - instead of looking into closing down on inefficient brands or markets. 
- Kindred always brags about their focus on wellbeing and mental health of their employees. This is a total lie. Senior management and HR business partners have zero interest in your wellbeing, quite the opposite. They will happily drive you into mental breakdown with their bullying and inappropriate processes. I have seen a lot of employees going on a long term sick leave, caused by work related stress in the most recent years. If your wellbeing is important to you, AVOID this place at all cost.
- Favouritism is just beyond your imagination. Kindred has a policy to open all roles internally for at least 5 days, but this is only for show. In reality, the top senior roles are often just offered to people under the table, without opening the roles for applications.. Those happen frequently on the highest levels, also in Exec Management (CCO for example). SHAME! If you are not a blond Swedish male, or Nordic overall, forget about a career growth. The role that you would at least deserve to apply for, will go to someone else for the most lame excuse.
- HR is unprofessional and borderline incompetent! Nothing Human about them, seriously! 


Overall, not worth the effort and hours you'd be expect to work! There is plenty of good companies out there!"

-No consistency between rules and consequences, some people get the benefit of the doubt, others are assumed guilty
-Pay for everything but Customer Service is low 
-WILL FIRE PEOPLE AND NOT GIVE REASONS
-No work/life balance, even if you’re paid hourly you will be expected to answer even if you’re off shift & if not they will get mad at you
-They will initially throw perks at you in order to suck you in but will quickly stop following through on promises.

You usually see a good marketing review , fancy videos etc. This is because its a gambling company , its in glamour world , it has to show off. In other words , it may be a King in good times. 

Once you are in , initial days you will enjoy by being in a new country , monthly beer parties at office , Sodas etc. Once you settle in , the worry starts - Whether my job is secure ? Does my experience valid in other mainstream companies ? Why many local people are not joining the company ? Why company is not associated with Unions ? Am I really proud to say that I work for Gambling company ? Am I doing a harm to my career ? Do I get any recognition ?

You as an international candidate goes through lots of stress . You cant change the company as well because your visa is tied to it . So basically you are in trap for some time . It may be a clever utilization of your expertise. 

I do not want to say these are cons . But do an introspection . You may be a leaving a good mainstream company to just experience a different world or expectation on better life . Think twice about your action because whether we like it or not , Gambling is always on grey side of business with ever changing regulations and rules across globe and that will have direct impact on your job as well."

Promoting people just for the sake of showing a good corporate profile will not solve anything, especially when the people promoted are not equipped to lead.

- HR is unprofessional and borderline incompetent. They simply don't know how to handle cases, ranging from simple tasks to very serious ones, or how to support managers at any level. Many mistakes have been made, where in most cases HR act as robots reading from scripts or stating policies, quite often reminding sketches from Little Britain where “computer says no”. All in all, HR are the leading team in creating quite a hostile atmosphere in London, and beyond.

- A lot of good people forced out of the company one way or another and in certain cases they have been treated so badly that they broke under pressure. In the past 12 months there's been a surge in people taking months long sick leaves due to burn-outs and/or mental health issues caused by a toxic working environment. In recent months there’s been many such cases simultaneously under the same department. For the people remaining there, it’s quite evident that this is not the place it used to be just a year ago, where the latest restructure and quite poor selection of new C-Level execs in Commercial (R2) and Marketing has contributed a lot in changing the working environment so much for the worse. 

- The additional layoff of 75 people in May – during the peak of Covid-19 – shows that Kindred is increasingly becoming a heartless monster, especially if since there’s been at least three cases where redundancy happened during their maternity leave. 

- Cutting benefits for cost cutting purposes will only hurt the employees moral and makes management the laughing stock during water cooler chats. I mean who cuts benefits such as fresh orange juice and try to blame it on the environment…"

Kindred has done nothing to show that they are doing anything for communities around the world during this global pandemic and in fact is taking advantage of the Coronavirus crisis to bury bad news in that they are making redundancies.

It’s well accepted in the company that management can say to an employee that the company only cares about the business value rather than people

Your future career is mainly defined by whom you know and if you go on a lunch running sessions, it really has nothing to do with the personal performance

If you are lucky and have a supportive manager you get help, if your manager is a poor leader you are stuck as there is no way to raise the issue up . 

HR team is a bunch of kids who have no idea of what they are doing and if it is even legal. Recently there were times when they did something and then had to revere it it was illegal.

Senior leadership has their own life and personal goals and you only see them during a company update. The company is in a tough financial position now but there are no words of encouragement or support from senior leadership apart from official and very contradicting statements and bear in mind the company is not a multinational conglomerate as they are calling themselves."

204,Kindred Group,Terminated after 5 months,2019-01-16,1.0,Information Security Specialist,Great top level initiates. There are some really energetic people that lift the organisation.,"Lack of openness for feedback. It is hard to be truly yourself, honest, sincere and still be a part of the team. I was surprised to get a half pager mail because I raised a suggestion to have 1-1 meetings in one of the team meet. This was with a reason stating that I was on probation. I was expected to give output but not raise concerns or thoughtful suggestions for the team.  Highly lacking professionalism. I haven't heard a single time 'Good work' although I worked with all purity. Lack was to the point that my lead/manager was reluctant to shake hands and let the other team members know it was my last day and it somehow didn't work well. I had to step up alone and do that. There is a strict hierarchy. You can't challenge people although it is stated as a part of the cultural values. Building trust as mentioned in one the company values is solely the responsibility of the people under you to build. I must agree that I failed to do it one sided. Transparency is only bottom up. I had no clue what my manager day or week looked like. I had to update the smallest things. There is too much micromanagement (it may sounds funny but at once I had to state that I was in washroom). I could say that even in my exit interview I was quoted no strong reason for this decision to terminate. All I was told was I don't fit well although this was never communicated even when I asked in one of the 1-1. HR was reluctant to intervene and know either sides. It looked like it was already a made up decision with a form to sign. I was refrained from external training mentioning probation however few others were allowed who were on probation too. It was one of my worst experience and best learning so far of my professional experience. 
I humbly thank for all the learning!  

To HR: If you really want a constructive feedback feel free to get in touch. 

P.S; Few of the above discord also resonates with some current employees who have been open to speak on some occasions with me. Hear them, they really have something of value."

But as an employee that won't really be your problem - sit back and relax with the rest of your colleagues. If you don't like to be challenged, this is the place for you.","They often bend the truth at interview stage. The job I thought I was interviewing for turned out to be only 75% of the duties, the other 25% I was not informed about and was over qualified for. Not a good start. Worse yet, their contract of employment terms favour management and HR, effectively allowing them to change your job title and role whenever they like. What happens if you fight your corner in that situation? Well, if you've had less than 2 years' in employment there they'll dismiss on the spot with some paid leave as hush money. This genuinely happens. The HR team, in collusion with management, are snide and sneaky and are not afraid to use employment law to their advantage again those further down the hierarchy. If you can somehow last two years here (only a select few ever do) then you will hold the upper hand legally, but everyone approaching the two year threshold is vulnerable. The higher up the hierarchy the less work you do, so naturally there are a lot of 'veterans' happy to pick up a big wage for nothing and stand in your way, so this is not a place for anyone with genuine ambition."

Due to lack of training, makes finding a job difficult as I have the need to explain why I haven't got as much experience in certain aspects as one would expect from the length of time for these roles. Answer is, no help.

No help meant struggling to try and get projects done without any guidance for deadlines. Which lead to huge amounts of anxiety and stress. Lead to depression which saw me not wanting to get up in the morning to go to work.

Just the complete opposite to what I was promised when joining the company, when it was making the transition from Unibet to Kindred Group.

There's so much toxicity in the team that no one ever talks to anyone and we don't trust each other. It has reached a point where I can go days without speaking to anyone.

Furthermore, pay rises year-on-year tend to be minuscule even if you excel in delivery.

The recent restructure has diverted most powers to a few select Centralised teams and led to the decision-making abilities for other departments being curtailed. Strategic choices are being made without a realistic understanding of the executional difficulties involved. There is a growing self-congratulatory culture getting embedded into the company, meaning aspirations are often high but the end product is mediocre.

HR dept seem to be one of the better areas of the company however whether they take on board any feedback and try and improve things in future is another matter.","- Worst culture I have experienced at a company. It is very closed and cliquey which makes it very difficult to fit in particularly if you are new or not used to this type of culture.
- Personally I found my manager demotivating to work for. I was promised so much in the interview as to what the role would be like and as time went on it was clear that the role was not going to be anything like I imagined
-Good work is often gone unnoticed and unappreciated.
-Most of the people in senior roles shouldn't be there as they don't have enough skills or experience."

* Latest Java technologies used and encouraged as well as (generally) good architectural design patterns (event driven, distributed micro service environments).
* Good flex/work-life balance
* Excellent extra-curriculum activities and community.","* A few of the architects here inhibit development speed and creative solutions. If it's a proof of concept piece, knock out as many conceptual solutions as you can, test them and based on the results, build! Rather than focus on quite possibly the worst engineered solutions, iterate over and over to squeeze out every last ounce of efficiency and waste everybody's time and experience. This a software house - collaborate and listen to your engineers and don't dictate dated solutions that are poorly designed.

* Developers should have the option to move around to different teams when extra hands are needed. This benefits the developer's domain knowledge and allows them to share and gain new expertise with other colleagues."
331,Kindred Group,Terrible Company,2016-09-29,1.0,User Experience Architect,"HR are great if you have issues.
Pay and rewards are pretty good.
Relaxed and laid back culture as the company is Swedish.","The Eco system of the company means there is not much drive to innovate. Basically all the systems are up and running already. Customers can place bets 24/7 thus the company is always making money.

The Swedish culture means some people are way too laid back for their own good and little gets done in the way of productivity.

Be warned !!! You may end up with managers and leaders who don't take likely to the laid back approach. In general my experience was of a micro managing bully boss, who has been like this for years. Demoralising the team, leading to high staff turnover and making the their team a silo in the organisation."
