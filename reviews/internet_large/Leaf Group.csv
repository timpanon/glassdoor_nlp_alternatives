-In my department, my manager was great as were a few of my co-workers, but overall the culture was pretty unhealthy in my department. Most of the people on my team were vehemently opposed to diversity of thought. There was a lot of unnecessary hostility and weird attempts at controlling and micro-managing from people who weren't even my manager.

If I had to compare their business model, and the types of ""employees"" and pedigree they hire, it would be comparable to Refinery29s toxic culture. With the majority of the employees being caucasian women, I strongly believe the group lacks diversity and inclusion. I am surprised nobody has called out their leadership team for their ignorance for not hiring well-qualified people of color during my time there so far.

It's a good place to start a career, and you may even be able to make up your own unique position there down the line. If you have a job offer from them, definitely take it. It's much better than most 9-5s out there.","There is not a lot of collaboration between teams. Layoffs came unexpectedly. There is no overarching motive like, ""We're making the world a better place."" It's simply corporate. You're there to make money for the company.

Employee turnover in key departments is over 50% for some positions.
Layers of dysfunction between VPs/directors in different departments.
Cronyism galore. You will often witness managers arguing with each other over who has a longer relationship with the CEO, when one of them tries to escalate a mundane issue; behavior not unlike that of Japanese Macaques, but without the voice of David Attenborough narrating.
Employee suggestions are generally valued unless they clash with the baseless opinion of a well-connected manager. This is true when it comes to organizational changes, picking projects for teams to work on and even when it comes to engineering decisions. Name dropping trumps months of work any day.

People in the team are leaving left and right (already 4 people leaving this month, including the CFO) and more to come.  There will probably be positions open within the group.  Leaving this here as a public service announcement, avoid all Accounting and Finance roles here. Every quarter, our employee survey results are the absolute lowest.

It's a hostile work environment and leadership is making decisions for their own personal gain, not what is best for the company or the bottom line. They are also very deceptive about what their teams are doing and what their actual numbers are. When confronted with facts, they pick holes at everything so they don't have to acknowledge that what they are doing isn't working. The nepotism is also a problem. Meetings are like a family reunion.

Managers were encouraged to listen, and for the most part they did. People got along great with each other, no matter their role.

Over the course of several years Demand Media made a handful of poor hiring choices in upper management, and a fair bit of internal damage was done before those choices were corrected. And for the last two or three years before the Austin office closed the company experienced a slow ""brain drain"" as smart, motivated employees left for better opportunities.

I had the pleasure of working with very talented engineers who provided mentorship and conducted themselves always in a professional manner. My team worked in Agile sprints, using code reviews and pull requests which kept code quality high. I enjoyed my time at Demand and would go to work for them again. I feel like the company has turned around its reputation as a content mill and is on the road to doing great things with marketplaces and high quality content production.","The downside of Demand Media in my opinion was the location in Santa Monica and L.A. in general. Housing for a family of four is astronomical anywhere within an hour commute, so after numerous rent increases and need for more space we were priced out of LA and a great job. They should do more to facilitate remote work so that employees aren't spending 10 hours a week commuting."

Over the past several years, I have seen this company shed its former image and steer a massive ship in a better direction.  This has been challenging, painful at times, and certainly not for the feint of heart.  

Quality is precisely what we are going after these days, and no one at the top believes that ""quantity"" is the answer.

The company has repeatedly sought the best talent externally, and has looked internally to elevate and deploy top performers to lead growth initiatives.   They are putting a stop to title inflation and promotions for ""you've been here awhile now"", which may be tough for some to swallow, but its the right thing to do and good for culture long term.

Senior management and People Operations have an open door policy and no voiced idea goes unheard and no question is too taboo.  It is incredibly empowering,.","Hard work required
Little room for under performers
Catered lunch on Fridays make people think we're hiding something

I get to use my creativity and brain in many different ways in order to help our team be successful...(AND work alongside very smart people while doing it!) Each day is a learning and growing opportunity, and I think that is what most people look for in a fulfilling career.

-- Wonderful (and Talented) People
-- Noteworthy Perks -- Catered lunches, fully-stocked common areas, plush accommodations, etc.
-- Tech-Savvy -- Dial in, live streaming, plenty of conference rooms...it's a well-oiled machine

Demand Media does excel in terms of their location, and facilities. The recently renovated building is gorgeous, inside and out and feels very humble and welcoming. Hands down, the best part about working with Demand is the people and the passionate culture (so long as the company itself is doing well, which it isn't.)","-- Losing massive amounts of money
-- Financial Hardships
-- Constant Restructuring and Reorganization
-- Layoffs are constant
-- Owned and Operated Proprieties are failing to turn a profit
-- eHow is dead in the water

Stocks and shares are down, and the company is desperately trying to do constant damage control. Long-time executives have been terminated, or asked to leave. Restructuring of properties is a futile and near worthless attempt...it's more like resuscitation at this point, and everything is flat-lining. The CEO's vision doesn't match the business model, either. Layoffs are constant, with 25-30 a month for the past couple of months."

Everyone is being patient to see if we will see improvements in the next year, but our stocks say otherwise. Also, taking away Christmas closure was not a good idea. It was a forceful move to have everyone spend all of their vacation so that if anyone gets let go or leaves voluntarily, the company doesnt have to pay out as much. Christmas time is slow so making everyone come into the office with bad attitude during the holidays just makes people unhappier. All the employees got through the tough times with the turnover thinking that the benefits received such as the Christmas closure outweighed the fear of  getting let go as result of the management firing people with no mercy... But we continue to keep seeing these benefits being taken away, which makes us more inclined to leave when approached by the recruiters. Many more companies are starting to close during the Christmas time because they realize there's not much work to do. Demand Media seems to be regressing..."

Fair benefits that got better over time. Same with salary, which got closer to industry standards the last few years. The culture at the Austin office was great, I enjoyed my time there.",Huge disconnect between Santa Monica and Austin office. Austin office often looked down upon or regarded as less than valid. Had to deal with some completely unnecessary drama from the CA office from time to time.
221,Leaf Group,Great Company Culture,2015-09-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Just a few of the many reasons why it's great to work at DM:
- opportunities to socialize and feel more engaged
- events to learn more about the industry and be in-the-know about the company

226,Leaf Group,Unstable Company,2015-09-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people are cool, the culture is great (they do Thirsty Thursday"" every week), lots of food and snacks all around the office, benefits were decent.","Some of the businesses they own are just questionable. They're trying to turn it around but there's not a lot of promise especially because communication is horrible, leadership is close to nonexistent. No one knows what they're doing because there's zero direction. Unstable company with a very bleak future."
227,Leaf Group,Uprighting a ship requires heavy lifting,2015-09-02,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"This company went from being the darling of Los Angeles media tech to a shell of its former self in the period of time it took Google to walk across the room and click ""change algorithm."" In one fell swoop the audience had been driven out of their media brands and with it, revenue and market cap. Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise because it caused the company to rethink its years of crappy content and is now in the middle of a massive transformation with a clear mission/vision on high quality. 

But while that alone would send most recruits running, they are not the people who Demand Media are looking for. The biggest solvable problems at the company are actually the biggest opportunities and for those who jump in feet first and make it happen they can be part of a massive turnaround. Recruiting has tightened up, ergo the pool of candidates and employees have become sharper. 

The pros to working for this company are in the details. Investments are being made in the business units and it would mostly depend which business hires you. It would be worth reading the company earnings call transcript to get a full understanding of how this shift is happening under completely new management. 

Should be noted that many, if not most, of the reviews on Glassdoor are from any one of the thousands of writers who wrote articles for the studio. While their opinions matter it should be understood that their connectivity to Demand Media the company is limited only to their freelance writing assignments and their relationship to the editor. They are not employees in the sense that they work at the office, participate in company All Hands meetings and contribute to the overall corporate culture. 

And yes, there are plenty of yummy treats at the company that if you didn't leave with diabetes or alcoholism, you'll leave a little heavier.","A start-up culture had returned to the company. Most people are not up for the do-lots-with-little  mentality and if you can't live with a some resource ambiguity, this might be the right place.  More is being expected of people to work smarter. Morale has been low in the past but seems to be improving."
228,Leaf Group,"Good work environment, solid teams, believable direction",2015-09-01,4.0,Software Engineer,"The kitchen perks are well-noted in other reviews, and they work. A lot of neg reviews over the past year are based on a rough period of change. It feels like a lot of that roughness is fading and the company direction is feeling firmer. The vibe internally is more calm and upbeat than one might assume from the more neg reviews Pay is on par for the area, better than farther inland in my experience. And the tech campus vibe of the area doesn't hurt.","There's still a bit of a mishmash of eras and groups, since there was a lot of turnaround in the past couple of years. That will smooth itself out over time, but know that the energy in different parts of the building is different. Some folks blow off the company events because once things overflow out into the halls, it's pointless to try and see or hear anything - need more or better space for those."
229,Leaf Group,Great place to work,2015-09-01,5.0,Accountant,"Demand has great people and a great culture. Most people enjoy very flexible hours and dress is always casual. The business is dynamic, which keeps it interesting.

232,Leaf Group,More Bad Than Good,2015-09-01,2.0,Editor,"Good work-life balance, good people, free lunch on Fridays","New management is awful -- taking away benefits to save money. A few weeks ago, they cut our Christmas vacation without warning, so everyone in the company got a 5-day pay cut. We used to have beer and wine on Fridays starting at 4, so everyone can mellow out and relax before going home. Now, we have beer starting at 5pm on Thursdays -- unsafe because no one wants to drink right before they drive home. Management made that decision so that people wouldn't leave work early on Fridays. New CEO plays favorites and makes that bias obvious in weekly emails to the company."
233,Leaf Group,Unsure Future,2015-09-01,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Overall Demand has been a great place to work. They provide great benefits and if you're on the right team they have some very talented people.,It has definitely gone downhill over the past year.

238,Leaf Group,Content Marketing Manager Interview,2015-08-25,5.0,Content Marketing Manager,"I had one phone interview with a recruiter and another phone interview with the hiring manager before coming in for an in-person interview with other staff members which was about 2 hour long or so. Everyone was always pleasant and easy to deal with and although I probably met with a lot of people than normally, I loved having a member of their HR / Talent Acquisition Team come in during the interview and offered honest feedback on my people skills as well as gauge how happy I would be personally here, not just about the job duties. It was a refreshing break that made me feel that this company cares about their employees well-being too, & that they care about who you are as a person & your attitude too -- not just whether you can do the job but whether you would be a cool person to have in their office (which is a beautiful space).  I was also notified immediately after the interview that I got the job -- so I was a huge fan of the not-waiting-around sweating / overthinking about my responses stage. Everyone was really nice at Demand, down to earth, and transparent about the position, company culture, and what's expected of the job.","After I applied online, it took a recruiter a few weeks to get in touch with me and then the hiring manager at Demand another few weeks from there. By the time I made it to the in-person interview it was a month since I applied. But I'm not one of those people who just sit around & wait for one co / offer / position during the job hunt process so I didn't mind. However I can see how someone who had high hopes or who was placed with another job during the interim would find it annoying. The waiting for interviews to be coordinated process, I suppose then, is a con. But I imagine that's because they have a lot of applicants to sift through. Otherwise, great experience with the interviews itself."
239,Leaf Group,"Start-up mentality, good benefits",2015-08-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Demand operates several platforms so I can't speak for each and every experience, however, my experience thus far has been great! Demand has the structure and stability of a corporate work environment - but makes for a start-up culture since each site continues to evolve. Employees are welcomed to take initiatives and strides towards business improvements. Upward growth is always an option as long as you keep your eyes on the prize, vocalize your career goals to your management, and work hard to get there. The benefits are good. The culture is fun and considerate. The company has an awesome facilities team that is ready and willing to help you with any office request imaginable! We also have informative monthly town halls so the entire staff is kept up to date on the performance of the business as a whole.

Open to new ideas.,Saying you want to improve your business is hard when so many people are still playing like (old) business as usual. There were instances where senior execs said they wanted to change but the middle management just wanted to keep pressing forward with the same plan.

If you're part of a recent acquisition, get ready for the company to get bored of you within twelve months, and then shut you down without warning. 

The simple fact is the executive staff drinks their own kool-aid, and won't listen to feedback from the people on the ground. Get ready for the quarterly company ""all-hands"" meetings where they'll unveil the most recent pivot - It happens every quarter without fail. The ever changing priorities within the company makes it increasingly difficult to close new business, and maintain existing business. You, and your clients simply won't be able to keep up.


Career development is a moot-point here. After several meetings with VPs, and EVPs about career development, you'll become frustrated at the lack of anyone willing to give you a road map on how to get a raise, get promoted, get better accounts, etc. 

The company promotes a lot of internal events that claim to promote ""team building"" such as days in the park playing games with your co-workers, Hackathons, National Sales Conferences, but, all it really does is disrupt your week."

Overall the people were great--personable, knowledgeable, and good to work with. And the office experience was good. The perks were wonderful and the work I had was for the most part fun and provided good opportunities for learning and growth. They were also great with flexible hours and working from home, which was a huge help with child care and more.","Despite all these pluses, after 14 years in IT operations Demand Media has, hands-down, one of the most politics-laden and mismanaged operations environments I've ever seen... Chronically random enterprise environments, operations groups that rarely communicated with each other (and in a few cases even flatly refused to), random layoffs with virtually no consideration for the operational support holes left behind in the process, and more. At least once while I was there an entire dev ops team supporting one of their bigger products was restructured by one manager--existing people abruptly let go and replaced with people he wanted, and the environment restructured with little or input from other operations teams or business units. I was once even ordered to stop work on a project (which everyone agreed was badly needed and which eventually became one of the company's standard operations support tools) because, I was told, it's success was making my boss's boss look bad politically (he had been given budget to do the same thing and hadn't made significant progress). The company's customer-facing downtime reflects this sort of thing. Demand Media is also notorious for low pay per industry standard, which is typically justified by throwing in stock options. But as of this writing the stock is $2/share lower than it was at this time last year and barely 1/4 of what it was when the company went public 2 1/2 years ago. While I was there these things and more were taking their toll on many operations and dev personnel and turnover rates were significant."

I would have preferred a clear email that said ""Your services are no longer needed"" than being strung along and told to apply for various positions and specializations that I was always turned down for.
