- Some really nice people to work with and spend long hours at the office with.

- They pay really well.","- Horrible work-life balance: Expect to be working 50-80 hours a week if you are a part of the Design, Analytics, Live Operations, Product Management. You should also expect to be asked to cancel your time off, and be frowned upon if you refuse to do so.

- Extremely fast environment that focuses on reactionary tactics rather than solid planning and execution. Expect for plans to change every single day MULTIPLE times. This will increase the amount of errors every team makes and lead to a lot of post-mortem meetings that could have been avoided.

- Volume over Quality: If you're passionate about making GOOD video games, don't come here. They will make promises to you about your opportunities to build out and rebuild games. If you still aren't convinced, require your demands be written in your contract. They will refuse.

- Micromanagement: The everything needs to go through the CEO, even your time off requests. Team leaders have no say in how their team operates and Executive Producers dictate every single thing you do. That's not to say the Executive Producers are bad, they have to deal with the CEO looming over their shoulders at all times. Expect to be contacted on your days off.

- Discretionary Time Off = You're less likely to actually take time off. They say there's no limit to how much DTO you can take off, but HR keeps tabs on people the moment they've taken more than 40 hours of DTO."

20,MZ,Political Game of Thrones,2020-09-19,2.0,Engagement Specialist,"Compensation is pretty good. Decent bonus structure. 

If you're hourly, you'll reap the benefits. Ability to move up if you just put in the hours (not really about contribution or tangible impact).

HR leaves very nice reviews of what the company could be. I think it's a positive because we can all strive to be better.","Place is great for people who like politics and maneuvering through the corporate ladder. I've seen junior associates get promoted leaps and bounds because they were willing to put in the hours. It's not really about impact, it's more about perception, and how many hours you're willing to clock.

No one really even plays the games that work on the games or are even gamers. Designers only look at excel sheets and a person I worked with who ran an important team she barely even knew what the IP was about or games in general.

The work environment is terrible because everyone just puts in hours versus works intelligently. This means working on weekends and a culture that promotes this. This literally means weekends at 1am. You can choose not to do this, but your chances of moving up regardless of your tangible impact will be close to nothing.

They'll tell you things are getting better, but the leads here don't value it. Everyone on the team I worked on that were the leads pretty much worked all the time and super inefficiently. I've never seen so many people do things so inefficiently. Because everything is so inefficient everyone has job security which might be the intent.

I've worked at other companies where three people could run a game. This company has about 30 people run a game because it breaks up all the pieces so everyone gets their tiny slice. They're also majorly possessive about their little piece so it's impossible to garner any more efficiency. Literally if you do something because it's more efficient, but someone else was supposed to do it you'll hear an earful about overstepping your role."

Permanent crunch mode. The game teams are disorganized messes and individual contributors make massive, costly mistakes without even a sense of regret (""Ooops, I just blew out a vertical and cost us tens of thousands of dollars with one keystroke.. Better luck next time!"")

There's no established way to get work done. By this I mean no real processes. There are reports and dashboards that people forget exist or don't care about where you find ancient bugs and logs of high impacting user issues.

The only thing you might learn here, if you last long enough, is how to recognize tons of red flags for your next job."

No-limit time off policy with manager approval and mostly flexible with working from home if needed.","Time off, even if approved, can be cancelled and forced into reapproval if the company is crunching for something, even unrelated teams, and a lot of pressure is sometimes applied to not take time off. ""Core hours from 10am - 7pm"" which means everyone stays later than they should. Not a lot of emphasis on fixing things that are breaking, just pushing out new things so there are constantly live issues causing some people to drop all their work with deadlines to handle what's breaking. Generally seems like there isn't a good sense of how to get out of bad months/quarters/years except to work the same people harder, which then leads to more mistakes."
37,MZ,Facility Technician.. Challenging learn something new every day,2019-11-12,5.0,Facilities Technician,"Life work balance , good management","Zero cons , can’t complain"
38,MZ,May the Moogle Be With You... Always.,2019-11-07,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"MZ faces the same challenge that every single game company faces... how to stay relevant.

The games business has historically been the most forward-looking, risk-taking tech industry. And perhaps for that reason and many more, the most beloved. Every innovation hits games first. Every engineer wants to make a hit game.

Games make us go wow! They blow our minds. They connect us to our instincts to learn, compete, make friends, get lucky, and win. They are dazzling and baffling. Coin-Op. Console. PC. Web. Social. Mobile. And Beyond. MMO. Card. Shooter. Puzzle.

While the games business is vast, carving out a niche isn't easy. And carving out a niche while paying for Palo Alto real-estate is the most epic mongo baller of all wins. Video games were born in the Silicon Valley and Machine Zone is right in the middle of it. The buildings are brand new, clean, and beautiful on the former Facebook campus now in reconstruction.

Early into the mobile games market, MZ owned top slots on the AppStores for months coasting on innovative SuperBowl advertising and then diversifying into Ad Tech, AI, Crypto, Real-Time... God Stuff. But the universe ebbs and flows. Where are we on the tech adoption curve... who knows? One thing remains true... customers expect a lot as they economize their entertainment dollars.

So MZ has managed to win over a very loyal group of paying players. Every technology and community changes.  Will people still program on PCs one day? Who knows. Will people still play the MZ games we operate today ten years from now? Who knows. Will we all upload? Man. Big questions.

What's real is that MZ has been contracting over the last year and a half to focus on what it does best... developing and operating games. On the operations side we are embracing lots of new cloud technologies. On the development side, we have in limited release a beautiful new title that shows off our continued ability to innovate on the client, art, game design, and server. We have vast capital, intellectual assets, potential and good people.

Contraction isn't pleasant, but it is often necessary. Some of what you see on Glassdoor is a reflection of that. What are you gonna do? That's life and our individual experiences will very. Ultimately our personal outcomes are a direct result of the individual choices we make in the stream of choices we have available to us. We recently re-branded as MZ... 1. Which i think is cool. As per U2 we are not the same, but we ARE 1.

Culturally, I'd say we are aggressive for the games business. We lean toward core and blue. After all, we made Game of War. Teams naturally internalize their titles to some degree. But games also naturally attract fun-loving creatives. I feel that that is what we are at our core. And we are much more... Final Fantasy and brilliant technologists, artists, and game designers.

To be continually relevant we must continue to make good decisions, place good bets, and make the connection with more loyal paying player fans. All game companies share this mission.

MZ is a big game maker / operator by most standards. This is not just a few folks in a room. So we have teams and subcultures and thus your experience may vary. 

If you are into the games business and looking forward to a long-term career in it and you live in Silicon Valley or catch the Cal Train to California or carpool down 280 or live in Supertino from the SJC to the DMZ, I really think you should take a look at MZ. Perhaps you will be THE one young Jedi. Come say Hi. Take a look.","Lots of change and people re-identifying with a new mission and vision that is more focused than the broad vision of ""become a tech giant""."

I would love more people join LiveOp team. This is best team for you to grow in MZ. Plus you have awesome teammates and super nice boss :)",You have to get used to game industry culture.
41,MZ,Positive creative atmosphere,2019-10-03,4.0,3D Artist,"The art team is full of talent but more importantly teamwork, even across multiple projects.  Art directors I've worked with have a lot of experience in the games medium here, and are able to set clear goals, they aren't ""idea guys"" with vague requests.  

Additionally for LGBTQ+ and allies, the environment here is very friendly.  Im a trans woman, and I never am misgendered by coworkers.  Additionally, even with racy characters in some games, the art team is very sensitive to treating their female coworkers well and not devolving into a ""boys club"".  Teams here also have very wide ethnic and national diversity, definite plus.

If you are a foodie, the food here is very very very fancy, but if you like more regular stuff like me, there are those options too.","I wish there were more women in the art department, but the company does too and definitely wants to recruit more.

Also...the commute in and out of Palo Alto can be absolutely brutal."
42,MZ,Horrible company to work with,2019-08-30,1.0,Marketing Analyst,Cannot think of any pros!,"Toxic culture, intensive politics, chaos management, sinking business, high attrition rate, the list goes on and on.

The company is also obsessed about hours everyone works instead of the results.
They enforce weird 10-7 working hours which is believed to be a way to drive away candidates with families.

If you have a family, especially if you have kids. NEVER EVER, NOT EVER, CONSIDER MZ!!!
If you don't have a family, also NEVER EVER, NOT EVER, CONSIDER MZ!!! Everyone around me are interviewing and leaving."
43,MZ,"Well funded, hard working, future hazy",2019-07-31,3.0,Engineering Manager,"Machine Zone has taken fantastic care of me financially, offering excellent opportunities for advancement, rewarding hard work and proposals.  It's enabled experimenting with management techniques.
It's well funded for future ventures and the board works to create a healthier road for the future.  The CEO visibly works to make sure that rewards for company success can be shared well with staff.
It's got 3 meals a day by a reasonable cafeteria crew that take good care of the group.  It takes care of a lot of out of pocket costs for benefits.","We don't know what builds success, but have succeeded a lot, leading to very painful patterns (Projects without staff or roadmap or pitch).  Decisions on major company timelines can shift quickly and multiple times a year.  Building a 6 or 12 month plan is an exercise in futility for the most part.

A lot of teams are understaffed from a constant drive toward shared service models.  Promotions often lack filling the gap promoted out of, leaving folks responsible for wider and wider spaces.   Accountability is so distributed as to basically have no accountability for almost all of our game products.

We brutalize our customers with buggy and poorly considered content, leaving them with the impression we don't care.  Off hours incidents are multiple times a month.  Some teams crunch excessively."
44,MZ,Never a Dull Moment,2019-07-26,4.0,Engineering Manager,"The single most prominent feature of MZ is that I am never bored. There is way too much to do and probably too little oversight, giving me enormous opportunity to do something new and make an impact. I often do things that are not my job and not part of a plan because they are the right thing to do, and I generally don't get in trouble for it, the times that it's even noticed. On another note, if you want to make games and make rent, come here - the compensation and benefits are great.","It's chaos, more or less. Schedules are aggressive to the point of being delusional and often our optimistic plans degrade into little plan at all. The company is great at operating and marketing and selling games, so once one staggers out the door it's going to do great. I simply recommend taking deep breaths and letting go of a lot of the craziness.

Other cons - I guess the hours can be long. This is a game company, and it doesn't excuse our planning missteps, but other game companies can be quite worse. Also, MZ seems to be quite wary of hiring junior talent, and I think would be well served to start doing so and giving leads and managers time and support to mentor those junior contributors."

CEO is really making changes that are up leveling us like never before and being more open and transparent, the pay, bonuses and equity...and working with REALLY smart and passionate people! The culture has definitely made a shift, and while we all still work extremely hard, it feels more flexible. There are growth and development opportunities for me and my team, and I learn something new everyday.  The #triumphtogether mantra is bringing the one MZ feeling back!","It is challenging to have core hours that are so late, but nice to come in later. I wish we had a little more flexibility there. The Game Production teams are working extremely hard, which means a lot of hours for them at month end. What makes MZ successful is the blood sweat and tears put in by everyone. That also means some teams have a window of critical crunch time, and we need to find creative ways to support them."

49,MZ,Input = Output,2019-06-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"MZ is a great place for folks who are motivated by their personal growth. There's very little that gets in the way of making big contributions, and impact is regularly recognized and rewarded. There's huge potential for people that are self driven and not afraid of stepping up. That said, MZ is not for the faint of heart or folks just looking for a job. 

Awesome perks and benefits that outclass most any other privately held company, and rival any of the name brand public companies like Google, FB, etc.

Last years change in executive leadership and renewed focus on gaming has been a blessing! Teams are more focused and aligned, and the tone around campus is brighter than I've seen in years.","Very aggressive schedules and goals. Makes an exciting work environment, but also takes it's toll. We are a business and need to keep the bills paid, but hopeful we can find a bit more balance between company objectives, catering to our player base, and employee lifestyles."
50,MZ,"Good place to start, bad place to stay",2019-06-04,2.0,Live Ops,"Pros:
-Team and co-workers in general are great
-Review cycles/raises/end of year bonuses
-lot of opportunity to grow and learn
-A “we’re all in this together” mentality 
-free meals/snacks/gym/perks
-A lot of people here who have talent and really love games

Overall a great place to start out in if you’re single and willing to work. You get rewarded for the time and effort you put in, and accumulate a lot of knowledge quickly. Outside of my own team, working with other departments has always been a great experience and people genuinely want to help each other out.","Running games 24/7 means a lot of opportunities to end up working late, weekends, and holidays. Management expects you to work late if needed but taking off early another day will quickly get you noticed. 

No WFH other than weekends and holidays means that people burn out quicker, and “DTO” is tracked and monitored, so it’s more like PTO without any payout. 

Company has little interest in changing culture or strategy to keep talent around, which means teams are always short or new, resulting in more mistakes which are become more and more costly. People leave, don’t recommend the jobs to their peers, and the talent pool for hiring falls short. There’s a total break down between who teams need and who management/HR wants to hire - they don’t want to hire anyone who can’t meet the job reqs, but no one who meets the job reqs wants to work at MZ. This means more hours for the current employees, more burn out, more turn over, etc. They’re new guys less than they used to which is fine for business, but bad when it means it’s easier for that guy to leave and get paid elsewhere. 

MZ is either oblivious or willfully ignorant of their future. You can’t push the pedal to the metal and also expect fuel efficiency, but that’s exactly what they do.  They say save fuel but once they see that they’re not going 100mph they change their mind and say gun it. Then once they’re low on fuel they blame the teams for not “doing better”. It’s demoralizing and has not changed."

Great place to work if you're single. Great benefits and generous bonuses.,Zero work-life balance. Everyone works long hours. Face time is very important. There is no WFH culture. If you're not in the office then you're not working. Expected to make quick decisions on unbaked data expecting to hit goals. Mismanagement in terms of comummunication and guidence.  Managers and directors take all the credit. Unlimited vacation time but not allowed to take any time off due to workload or blackout dates.
54,MZ,Case Study in Mismanagement,2019-02-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The games are played by people with lots of disposable income allowing the company to offer higher than average salaries and great perks.,"The board of directors and other executives allowed the founder to take the company in too many directions and the wrong direction.  The Legal and HR teams eventually demoralized the staff with arcane work hour policies, overly litigous requirements, poorly handled layoffs and divestitures, and deception through avoiding divulging information about the company.
Due to all of this there was just a lot of bad management and results that were accepted.  Product and game engineers that didn't deliver new games.  IT that didn't enable the workforce.  Cost overruns and poor planning within TechOps.   The company shows that all of the money in the world from users and venture capital cannot make a well-run company."

Their 3 games are dropping like stones."
79,MZ,An Actual REAL Review - NOT FAKE (paid for) LIKE THE REST.,2018-06-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great pay! For many roles they pay way above market rate.  Though they think that just because they pay you a lot, they can treat you like trash in every other aspect, so take that for what it is. 

Catered meals and cafeteria are really good! Again, this has the caveat that normal working hours are 10-7, and breakfast is cleaned up at 945AM and dinner isn't served until after 7PM... in other words trying to trap you into staying longer at work. 

Perks are great! Paid cell phone, gym membership, massages on site, etc.","Here we go. 

Someone is paying for fake reviews. MZ had been trending at 3.0 on Glassdoor for a longtime, then spiked to 4.0 out of nowhere. There are 2-3 ""fake"" reviews that pop up a week. If I was a newhire and depended on those reviews to get a feel for the company, I'd feel lied to. Obviously management is aware of the internal problems, but rather than try to actually address them and better the entire company, they're just sweeping them under the rug, ignoring it, and lying about doing it. This practice is absolutely deplorable and I'm not sure how Glassdoor allows it to continue. 

They also recently blocked Glassdoor from the internet access on campus, yet there continue to be positive reviews being posted every few days saying how great the company is. Hmm.

Management is atrocious. Many are promoted from within just because they have a pulse and the position is open, and quite frequently people are put in positions they're not qualified for in the least. This leads to a lot of mismanagement. 

There is a lack of transparency in everything they do. For example, the ex-CEO went ""missing"" for about two weeks before it was finally announced that he was leaving the company, and the COO was taking over. People knew for over a week that something was up, but management refused to acknowledge anything. The way they went about it was tact-less and tells your people you don't value them at all. 

There have recently been MASSIVE layoffs. The company was over 1,000 employees in January 2018, and now, less than 6 months later, we're just under 700. However, they're continuing to push fake Glassdoor reviews saying how quickly the company is growing, despite the fact that almost everyone feels like they're going to be next on the chopping block. A quick walk around the office will show that about 3/4 of the people will be applying for jobs at any given time. That's  healthy, isn't it? 

Unethical actions. If you plan to be reimbursed for your cell phone bill, they require IT to install software that allows it to monitor everything you do on your phone. EVERYTHING. I've overheard management ask IT, on several instances, ask if they can search for private text messages and emails on employees' phones (outside of company email addresses, Slack channels, etc) to see what they're doing both on and off campus. 

Managers will also do questionably, sometimes illegal things. When HR is approached about these situations, the most that will happen is a ""sit down"" with the two employees to discuss the situation, but no action is ever documented or taken. Often HR will dismiss the situation entirely with, ""That's just how he/she manages. Just deal with it."" It's not uncommon to see employees frustrated to the point of tears  AFTER approaching HR with a complaint. 

They actively marketed all of their games and products to steer away from MZ as a whole. The campus has no identifying markers, and they even had a different address than what the campus actually was on Google Maps. In other words, they're not trying to build brand loyalty at all, but only focusing on making as much money from their ""customers"" as possible by exploiting their weak self-control. The minute the games start making less money, which I suppose has happened (hence all the layoffs), MZ will fall off the map. No one will ever know who we ware, because they steered so clear of branding themselves with any of their products. Shame. 

Attrition is horrible. The average worker at MZ stays less than 12 months before leaving. 

Work-life balance is non-existent. There were employees who worked 300+ days in a year, and I know of at least one who worked a full 365 work year, meaning had NO DAYS OFF. NONE. If you work here, expect to get ""emergency"" calls on weekends and late night. Management has explicitly said to cantidates, ""If you have a family this probably isn't the company for you."" Something something, ""not a culture fit..."""

The required hours were 10-7, regardless of when you came in or actually left.  It is not performance based.  On top of this, breakfast ends at 945 and dinner begins at 7, so although the food is great, it’s a trap to keep you to stay longer.


My experience there was on the team was that it was tenure based. Like seniors and freshman’s in high school.  When trying to optimize/automate things that didn’take sense, the response is usually “well that’s how we’ve always done it” or “you’re just being lazy”.  Work was required on the weekend, at a set schedule that was not declared when accepting the job.  The response was you’re the new kid and it’s now your responsibility.  

Not a lot of risk taking for the new cognant clients, just reusing same stuff from the MZ games but without the optimizations.

Finally have on-site parking, though not enough for all employees .","I will not get too specific here bc I do not want to get sued. Everything below is my opinion and how I interpreted my experience, as it relates to me.

MZ seemed entitled to all of my time, 24/7/365. It felt like I was always on call and on weekends I would get nervous and feel guilty if I went out or had fun and left my laptop at home. MZ culture did that to me, and I’m not in a happy place. Also many coworkers have shared similar feelings. And for such a big commitment, you would think that they pay accordingly. While it’s true that the salaries are strong, it’s also true that if you are truly a top performer, there are a number of other companies willing to pay you substantially more, AND treat you like an actual human being.

Speaking of top performers, it’s interesting to watch, again, this is my opinion, the majority of the top talent leave the company over the past few months. I myself am about to leave, just waiting for some official paperwork to come through. But it’s not all bad! Part of this whole experience is developing awesome connections with people, through your shared mutual disdain and distrust of the company. Given any group of MZ employees, all it takes is one person to start on the topic of MZ and a full blown vent session breaks out. I don’t know a single person who is committed to this company long term.

Last thing is that the leadership is lacking at all levels and possibly the worst I’ve ever experienced. HR is actually out to get you, and is run by immature and unprofessional people. The CEO is... read some of the other reviews and decide for yourself. 

TLDR: I’m not going to excise my options and that’s all you need to know about my outlook on this place."

No one cares about your name, nor your work ethic, nor your loyalty.  As soon as you start showing physical or mental signs of stress, you're out.  I saw a guy pass out and was rushed to a hospital.

This is the trend I see throughout all the development departments including art and engineering.  Work you 12-16 hours a day every day, make constant changes to your features and schedule on the whim of the Sales team, and then you get the blame when something goes wrong, since Sales can't be held accountable.

The CEO of MZ is exactly like Jack in the Borderlands, successful yet weird, with lots of ego. This passes down to the whole company and essentially forms the culture of the company. And this alone explains why the reviews here are highly polarized. Someone happens to be on the winning team and tends to think they are gods. If you happen not to on winning team, life is tough.

Instead of taking the high road and trying to learn from negative reviews, MZ tries to cover them up like turds in a kitty litter box.  

MZ has actually done well, whether it was through dumb luck or hard work, or both.  The head count has grown, but innovation hasn't.  Even if someone comes up with a good idea, it goes no where for fear of sticking your neck out   That's why MZ's only success has come from making copies of its original cash cow.

My immediate boss at MZ was the first boss I had that took me seriously when I told him I wanted to move up, and took the steps to help me learn and grow and as a result I received my first promotion a little after a year. 

The work environment is very relaxed and we are treated like people/ adults, unlike other jobs I've had. The leadership is friendly and personable, rather than the stuck up types I'm used too. Another benefit is that there are no quotas to struggle with which is infamous in the QA profession.","The only drawback that comes to mind is that certain things have become more ""corporate"".

There are always opportunities to take on interesting new projects because of the rapid pace of change. The pay, benefits, and perks are very generous; especially for the Las Vegas area.

Performance is recognized and rewarded. If you see an opportunity for improvement and propose a solution, it will be seriously considered regardless of your position. Micromanagement and red tape are practically non-existent.

Management is very direct about their expectations; communication from Senior Management feels much more authentic and unfiltered than I've seen in previous workplaces.","The fast-pace can be extremely challenging, depending on how adaptable you are.  While I enjoy the rapid pace of change, it does make it hard to get comfortable in a position. Could use more paid time off to improve work-life balance. Communication isn't always great.

There is no passive movement forward based on tenure. You have to want to advance, work to advance, and ask to advance. I don't consider that a con, but many people might."

So there I was for 14 hours.  No break, no lunch, and on bad knees from my years of running.  Let me ask you dear reader, did I really feel like a team player that day?   Waking up at 3am to get in line at 4am, only able to accomplish my purchase of 2 iphone 6+'s 14 hours later?  Not really.  I felt like I was an expendable peon.

There are some VERY smart people working at the analyst level and, as a previous review mentioned, strong friendships are forged out of the mutual hatred for the company that people have here.","Oh boy, where do I begin?

1. I've never worked at a company that is as emotionally unintelligent as MZ. There is absolutely no compassion or empathy for your personal life here.  At MZ, you can either be successful at work because of the hours you put in, or you can be happy in your personal life. The hours you spend in office count more towards career growth than the actual quality of work you do here.

2. This is a place where work/life balance comes to die a painful gruesome death. There have been all hands meetings where the CEO has proudly proclaimed that they don't allow working from home and they're proud of people who work 14 hour days.  

3. Dozens of people have quit across all departments of the company for the same reason and yet the upper management is bamboozled and puzzled as to why someone would quit the best company in the world?!?

163,MZ,Don't let petty people/reviews scare you off,2017-05-10,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"I truly am a former employee and no, this is not a ""planted"" or fake review to get ratings up..... 

I learned more at MZ in the 2 years I was there than I EVER could have at other tech companies.  Yes, it is fast paced, yes the hours can be tough, but if you are looking for long term career growth and are willing to put in the time at MZ you will walk out of there with more experience and knowledge that will greatly help you in the long run.  

People knocking on the comp truly have no concept of comp/salary ranges in the valley.  MZ pays very well and is either on par or above most other companies who are of similar size and location.  MZ does not have Google money, so please stop thinking they will always pay like Google...c'mon people! The bonuses are discretionary so if your recruiter does give you a range remember that word, discretionary. So if you think you are for sure getting a 30% bonus because your recruiter said you have the POTENTIAL to get that then that's on you.

The benefits are wonderful, truly.  None of us should take for granted how fortunate it is to have an employer cover 100% employee coverage.  Go talk to a teacher about how much their benefits are before you complain.  We are all so spoiled to work in silicon valley its easy to forget how lucky we are.  

Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt.  People who are jaded by a bad performance review or were fired of course are going to taint the pool with grossly exaggerated reviews.  As for the current employees on here writing reviews, do something about your complaining.  I worked a lot with the People Ops team and they were always willing to help and do not take claims of harassment lightly as some other reviews have mentioned.",Work/Life balance is really tough.  That is mentioned here often and it really is something to be aware of and talk to your manager about before joining.  While some groups may have flexibility outside the 10-7 norm that is few and far between.
164,MZ,Silicon Valley Mercenarism at its worst,2017-05-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good pay and tangible perks  - You will get pay above market, you will be nourished as Hansel and Gretel and you will get opportunities to have more if you work insane hours, perform, drink, help, create and distribute the Company Kool-Aid.

Ambitious Company and a seducing apparent place in the Sun -  A confident promising red-eyed unicorn likely about to explode into Internet Dominion.   

Growth - This place will push your limits and force you to grow 

Talented wonderful people - They are plenty. Some Ronins have honor and noble goals for which work is just a means to an end.","And here is my critique:

Notice: MZ, just like in all of its practices, is just as aggressive in its recruiting strategy and tactics. As you may notice from the responses and moderation to the reviews, it is actively involved. Untrained moderators (the recruiters, whose team has much turn-over as well) easily let the passive-aggressive defensiveness transpire through the lines out of a somewhat desperate attempt to gain some face by any means necessary. Positive reviews are all strongly encouraged, if not in fact insisted upon by your recruiter, right at the beginning when joining the company at the beginning of the honeymoon. I am of the opinion that without this practice, the overall rating would be way below average, even though it has already decreased by more than a point out of 5 in the last year.   You have to give credit to the effort.
     
Purely Mercenary: To make it at MZ, you have to be good at what you do, you have to be tough, you have to be in it for the love of surmounted pain from overcoming challenges that you thought were impossible, and then, your ultimate reward has to be cash - if it’s something else you are looking for, I don’t believe you will find it here. You’re well paid to do a job, do it well, do it hard, execute for as long as you are needed, don’t stir anything, go home home for the shortest period of time possible to recover because you need to and repeat.  

A ruthless aggressive company - The game model keeps being refined by pure data analysis and is  successful because it is a clean cut scientific optimization of prime “house always wins” monetization mechanics. The model has nothing good to offer in terms of gaming experience creativity or art other than mathematically feeding the densest parts of its players’ addictions. MZ is not really a gaming company, the CEO says that himself, so if gaming culture is what you’re after, this is not it.  

No Soul, no heart, no joy - There is a total absence of articulated kindness or benevolence within the administration of this company; these attributes are seen as weakness. The high demands of the business leave little room for the sense of humor and lightheartedness gaming companies have been known for; the stress drives people to take themselves quite seriously. The meritocracy management claims to aim to create is false and arbitrary, I see it more as compliance. The core values may be sincere but they are in fact frightening, like straight out of a satire of what hardcore tech capitalism has brought Silicon Valley down to. MZ is a sad, cold place to work. My time there and the future vision I saw for this company seemed straight of a bad Orwellian dream.  

No work/life balance - if you have a family, there is a 100% guarantee your family life will suffer here and you will not get no sympathy for it. As claimed by leadership, that is the current price to play to win. It’s hard to win. He’s had it hard to get where he is. You’re going to have it hard too to keep him there and follow his lead forward. Serious time sacrifices are very much part of the check."
165,MZ,Machine Learning / Data Science / Analytics,2017-05-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Decent free food. Some good people to complain with daily. Benefits for young people who don't need them.,"Top level incompetence trickles down throughout all management levels into your headache continuously. MZ should stick with games and they shouldn't make too many more. I don't believe they are a tech company by any means and any effort to brand themselves as such is only in the interest of higher valuations, which doesn't make much sense since there doesn't appear to be a plan to go public. The stock options promised are toilet paper and you shouldn't factor them into your total compensation. Generous bonuses are only given to the buddies of management and are not merit based. The politics are worse than big companies and it would be wise to change your race to get ahead.  Everyone there who are performers know how crappy the company is and are only awaiting better jobs to be lined up so they can bail. The only happy people there are those who work long hours producing nothing meaningful or the fat cats on top who don't actually do anything except bloviate all day.

In a nutshell, if you actually apply (or stay if you are currently there) then you are a moron and you deserve what you get."

169,MZ,"Intense learning experience, true mobile UA at scale",2017-04-07,5.0,Senior Media Buyer,"As a person who spent more than 5 years in mobile UA, and almost 10 in digital marketing all I can say is that this is THE place to learn how to do user acquisition at scale right. You are surrounded with extremely talented and experienced people who keep pushing the envelope in the mobile UA space. What is so different about MZ as a gaming company (which is probably a bad way to categorize it) is that marketing is valued equally important as engineering and it's given enough support so things could get automated which lets people focus only on what their core job is. You don't see that quite often in this industry.

If you are a UA nerd this is the place to work at. If you want to know all the nitty gritty details about mobile ad tech look no further. And ignore what others tell you about it, you cannot be the most dominant player in the industry without investing extra time and effort to succeed. It's like that in any space, and I don't see why would it be different here.","Working at MZ is not always easy and is not for everyone. It takes time to get used to the environment and requires a certain level of commitment that many people are not eager to make. And that's fine. If you are worried about hours talk to the recruiter, they've been really good at setting expectations.

Second thing that can be annoying is the pace of growth. When you hire more than 500 people in a year, it is expected that some things will break. Communication, for example, can be challenging at times because of this. 

Last one is in regards with people who live in SF. Having shuttles like the other big guys from the are would help make the commute a bit easier."
170,MZ,Exciting place to work,2017-04-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There is a lot going on with opportunities to step up if you want them. The Company is growing on multiple fronts, which is really exciting. This place doesn't claim to be perfect, but everyone is pushing hard to achieve, which I find refreshingly honest. It is a challenging environment but in a good way. Its due to the growth taking place.","High growth = high commitment so if you are looking to coast, this is not the place for you."
171,MZ,Energetic workplace with lots of room to develop,2017-03-29,4.0,Staff Build Engineer,"The company is very financially sound and is in a position to go after a lot of interesting projects, with tremendous room for designing tech to improve things and an active inventions program.  It also has a lot of active challenges it needs solved, and is willing to pay well to get them solved.

It definitely doesn't apply throughout the whole company, but our part of the game dev team does not crunch, works very rare emergency hours, and gets to enjoy our weekends.  Strange to say given it is an all-hours company.","It can be chaotic and the infrastructure in both process and hardware has not kept up with the growth.  Tools and hardware are generally subpar though improving.  It is an all hours company that releases things all the time, so mistakes can be very expensive, very quickly.  Good check in discipline is a must and it really hurts some groups hard."
172,MZ,Most Challenging Job I've Ever Loved,2017-03-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"After years of wondering the wilderness of game development, often without a guide or a trail, arriving at MZ is much like finding a path in dark wood. You know it can lead where you want to go. Further ahead is a clearing that’s full of promise and excitement. You’ve been trying to reach it for a long time, but now you can finally see where you and your team are going. That’s a pretty amazing thing.

That doesn’t mean it’s easy. The famously fast pace here makes it the hardest job that I’ve ever had. I think that’s okay. It’s also a place with smart people, pushing tirelessly for the same goals. They care about results, and they care about getting things done. We make games, sure, but we also play to win. And when our hard work results in wins, the rewards and opportunities follow.

That’s my experience here. If you can help us reach where we’re going next or better yet help lead us to where we want together in a better way, there’s no other place to be.","Does MZ have flaws? Sure, it does. Throw a rock and you’ll find a broken process, an under-developed tool, or something else that needs fixing. That said, I’ve only been here nine months, and I’ve seen so many things get better, fast. There are the usual struggles between making something good that we need now versus something better that we want for the future. So we have had lots of growing pains, and probably more to come if the company keeps growing at this rate."
173,MZ,Do not join this company if you have another choice,2017-03-22,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The fact that their games are doing very well cannot be denied.

The experience is like a nightmare: there's no sense of priority and everything should have been done yesterday. No work-life balance, and in fact, the C-level people are very proud of this. Most of the things recruiters told you about (options, bonuses, culture) are not true. Some teams are more messy than others and re-orgs and let-go's are happening everyday. I have been here for a few months, and half of my teammates are already gone. 

For me, it's really time to go... if you ever have another choice, do not even think about joining this company."

Management does not know either how technology works or how to manage people. They have been making random decisions and changing directions and all the new products have been unusable for 2 years. They are in no way like software engineering managers but political chit-chatters. There're no fair performance reviews, and they're really good at letting people go because they need to find scapegoats for their own under-performance. The attrition rate is very high in this group and people are leaving one by one while they also do not know how to hire. Having them in the management is totally a joke..."
175,MZ,For Artists,2017-03-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Amazing art team. Loads of talent, regardless of said talent is put to use. Everyone is easy-going, at the very least. Most are hilarious, snarky, curmudgeonly, heavy drinkers, goofy, humble. There are a few people with their head stuck youknowwhere, but that's any team. As for the company itself, ""perk laden"" is the phrase. Massages, snacks-a-plenty, breakfast/lunch/dinner. Huge parties. New Cintiqs. Gnome that sneaks around giving surprise foot rubs. OK, maybe that was my job before I left. I MISS DEM FEET. Also, by the by, the CEO is insane. This is under pro because I like him. I've spent some time around him and find him just genuinely entertaining. He's quick witted, totally evil sense of humor, his favorite skate company is friggen Death! He had a goal (conquer the mobile gaming world) and it was insane and he did it. What did you do today?","Constant hiring from outside for middle-management positions, resulting in a line of dudes asking about TPS reports while the top end (decision makers) and bottom end (overworked grunts) are squeezed and routinely blamed for failures out of their control. Every task is ON FIRE despite the fact they are nearly all COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. Meanwhile, the actual important artistic endeavors (game tone, style, coherence, any semblance of character or story) are marginalized or intentionally ignored. Studio randomly drops work to hastily clone some hot-new-thang then they discard everything when said hot-new-thang falls off the IOS top ten. Which makes no sense, since MZ makes the hottest thangs on the top ten. Art decisions are often left to game design, who are artistically beyond ignorant. Everything needs to be ""more awesome!"" which means ""make it all gold all the time!"" Their ignorance also leads them to wander by at 6pm like, ""oh hey, I like this illustration. can you just change the camera angle and MAKE EVERYTHING GOLD?"" resulting in an entire day (week?) of work being voided based on nonsense whims with no bearing on success. I could go on forever, but you get it. If you enjoy art and demand an intelligent work environment, don't work here. If you don't mind making dumb stuff to get a paycheck and you like taking shots of top shelf booze, you'll be fine."

and that's it","Out of the reviews here, Some matter of facts from small data analytics:

- Most reviews are on the 2 extremes: either 1-star or 5-star.

- Usually there's a series of 5-star reviews after a couple of 1-star reviews. 

- Those 1-star reviews have much higher number of ""Helpful"" votes than those 5-star reviews. Most 1-star reviews have around 30 votes while most 5-star reviews have nearly 0, for apparent reasons.

- Keywords in 5-stars: hyper-growth mode, best company ever to work for, smart people

- Keywords in 1-stars: bad management, firing, no work-life balance, no ethics, too much politics,

I'd say my opinion aligns with most, if not all, of the 1-star reviews."
177,MZ,The only thing you can trust in an offer is the base salary,2017-03-14,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"base salary can sometimes match those from bigger companies, and indeed you can get the paychecks every half a month, but that's all.","Literally, the only thing you can trust in an offer, from any recruiters at this company, is the base salary. I hate to say that, some (or even most) recruiters are bluffing too much, sometimes UN-ethically.

They say that, the target bonus is 15% ~ 30% every year, but the fact is that, even for top performers (promoted), few could get even 20%, and on average, it is lower than 10%.

They say that, the current equity value is X per share, but it is at least 5 times cheaper on the secondary market.

They say that, the company is valued at very high and they're going IPO soon, but even the C-level already hinted publicly that's not the plan.

They say that, the company is at hyper-growth mode, but you can see politics everywhere.

They say that, the company culture is very laid back, but you can find all kinds of rules such as mandatory office time from 10 to 7."

MZ's pace is swift and expectations are high, but the rewards seem to match the expectations and the technology is incredible. I have found the people to be great, there is an endless amount of food and drinks and management is sharing more and more about what is ahead. Culture and values are being reinforced which is also helpful. New campus on the way which should be a welcome upgrade to the physical working environment. Opportunities to step up for those who want it and show they can handle it.","The millennial whining is ridiculous.  If you see a negative review, you can almost bet it was written by someone who wants to sit and collect a paycheck or would rather be at pottery class.  This is a place for hard working achievers, which is fine with me.  The only con is if and when the whiners are allowed to stick around.

I knew people who left because they wanted more money to do less work. If this sounds like you, then please leave this good company alone.

I'll never forget the people here. The co-founders are such humble and hardworking people.

I'm getting positive and some corrective feedback from my manager which helps me. I have friends among peers and I stay in touch with many ex-employees.

I'm not very experienced in Silicon Valley market and I can't compare with many other companies. From others gassdoor reviews I learned that in other companies you get more money, work less, and be cared for. That is ok.

I like demands and a little of stress of working in MZ. It lets to deliver a lot of value and keeps in shape. I've had a few different managers within short period of time and our team had many different initiatives. It's a challenge to get along with new people often and to learn new things often.

It makes me feel safe about my career, as I know that I can work with anyone and do whatever market demands to be done, and be happy doing that. It's unlike to very slow companies where you stay in the same project and in the same team for years and you don't really know if the market still needs you for real.

Besides contract terms, I get a lot of additional help from the company in form of perks, some legal support, trainings, business trips, bonuses.","Some people a frustrated working here.

The SRE team is (or was?) made up of great people on both the personal and professional levels.","Expect extreme hours during crunch time. But don't worry, it's crunch time just about year round. Not an exaggeration. 

Absolutely everything requires a ticket. Spend 30 minutes researching something? That's a ticket. Add a new monitoring check? That's a ticket. You love working on big projects? Well, you better love tickets. The most a ticket can cover is a day's worth of work, and even that's discouraged. 

If the above sounds like micromanagement, then that's because it is, at least directly according to the individual responsible for rolling out this model of work.

This all ties into a scrum approach. Scrum itself isn't bad (though is definitely an awkward fit at best for such an interrupt driven team), but I will say, after having worked with scrum across multiple companies, that it's an extremely poor implementation of scrum.

If you're excited to do some engineering work to improve the environment and make it more robust, this is not the place for you. The role is SRE in name only. If you don't keep up on the menial work you'll be pulled aside. The menial work is sky high and never ending. It's been acknowledged many times that things will improve Real Soon, and that SRE needs to focus on this menial work for now (as it has for the entire existence of the SRE team at MZ). However, come review time, you'll be dinged pretty hard for not doing the high level work too. What high level work? Weren't we just told we had to focus on the menial NOC work? This is called a double bind.

There is also an extremely pervasive culture of fear. Turnover is rampant, much of it voluntary, much of it not. People are called out all the time for mistakes, or more often ""mistakes"". If upper management hears you did something awful, they'll call you into a special meeting which will be a very unenjoyable experience. You won't get a chance to explain what actually happened. Instead, you'll have left a lasting impression with upper management, which to say at Machine Zone is a big scarlet for incompetence. I've witnessed this happen to multiple people, where management simply made assumptions and did not understand the actual situation, and blamed people for things that were not remotely their fault, or were unavoidable. But a scapegoat was found, that's the important thing!

While the culture of fear at Machine Zone comes from the top, most of the issues with the SRE team at Machine Zone are not so far removed. From the micromanagement to the double binds, these issues are directly SRE related, specifically the middle management. The team has lost 4 senior people this year already, and will be hemorrhaging more."

That is how the company will attempt to measure your 'commitment' to the company.  Read an email and have to think about it?  Create a ticket.  Gathering information on one of the dozens of infrastructure pieces and projects?  Create another ticket.  Testing some changes?  Create a ticket.  *Every* *single* *action* ***requires*** *a* *ticket*.

At MZ,  SRE is another name for 'NoC'.  You will be required to deal with more monitoring tasks than actual Engineering.  If you hope to make an impact, you will be driven into a corner and told that you are not behaving like a model employee and you need to get in line.  Having an opinion, or forward thinking will get you nowhere here.

Pay is below average for the Bay Area.

Parking, due to the building being under construction, requires that anyone that is not an executive take a shuttle.  Prior to complaints from employees, the lot was not even patrolled regularly."
210,MZ,MZ is dedicated to making this a great place to work,2016-10-05,5.0,Senior Database Administrator,"I don't even know where to start!  MZ is a company that really wants to share it's success and all the wonderful perks that go along with it with their employees.  I have gotten to do things here that I never really imagined.  Taking a selfie with Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of those things....  there  are many more.  

Do I think our CEO and upper management really care about me?  Yes, I do.  And I am not young and idealistic - and this is not my first job.  My observation is that they spend less time here telling us they care and more time showing it than any other company i have been with.

From the highest levels of the company a culture of respecting EVERYONE and treating everyone well is encouraged.  I call it ""a culture of kindness"" (hopes that will catch on)  I get even more respect for our CEO when he takes the time out of everyone's schedule to talk about how important our great facilities staff is, how hard they work and how they must be treated well.  That seems obvious, right?  No matter how brilliant you are, if you are the kind of employee who yells and and mistreats people you think are less important than you are...  you will not do well at MZ.

The people here are really smart - hard working - dedicated - and kind.  I feel so lucky to be a part of this team.  I am continually impressed with the people around me!

Thank you MZ and Gabe.  Your employees really do appreciate this company.","Behind the building is basically a construction zone.  I can't wait for the state of the art new building - but in the mean time parking crowded, and the shuttles can be crowded.  The tasty food can be fattening...  hit up the salad bar a few times a week - trust me."
211,MZ,Bad bad Culture,2016-10-02,1.0,,"A few smart and dedicated folks are still keeping the company alive.

Good  blanket advertising to induce you to  buy gold to play the game.

Breakfast, lunch and dinner cooked on premises.","Very bad team culture and autocratic especially in the sre and db teams.

Be  real careful if you join the above teams. High pressure at  work due to bad middle and top management.
Most of the employees moto is to survive another day. No trust among the various individuals and teams.

Very high voluntary and involuntary employee turnover. Be sure to take vacation as they have ""unlimited vacation"" policy, and you could loose it if you don't take it. Company saves on paying vacation  money when they ""terminate"" employees.

All hands on deck to solve game issues, you will be pressurized to come to office to solve problems regardless of day/time.

Its not a fun place to self actualize your goals, ad hoc planning, direction, execution and  fire fighting all the time makes it a dull place.

Company has annoying and bright flashing advertisements to sell ""gold"" when you play their games.
You can only do good in the game if you buy gold, spending time to learn the game is a waste of time,
as the whales with  Billion purchased power will come and knock you out even if you have million power.."

They work hard.","Culture. MZ has a fear based culture. There's a lot of finger pointing and people working to avoid taking blame when anything breaks. This ties into the lack of ownership. People write systems then hand them off so they can't be blamed when they break. Priorities change often.

Long hours. Little recognition when things go well. Blame when things break. Lots of ticket work, not much engineering. SRE largely does production work that other teams don't want to do and that doesn't have a well defined owner.

Employees are treated like children. They are not respected. SRE has been instructed never to communicate with (one) other team without going through management. Talking to upper management is strongly discouraged. Employees get yelled at. SRE (and other tech roles) has a high attrition rate.

When people give notice to resign, they are often asked to ""voluntarily"" resign effective immediately without any severance. The company asks new hires to rate them on Glassdoor during orientation before they actually get to know the company."
213,MZ,Being treated like high school kids,2016-09-29,1.0,,it's a job. take the paycheck.,"Literally being treated like high school kids. In the all hands, they are like a parent scolding his children. Threat to fire you for anything. You will be treated like a machine, never as a human. No respect.

You can be let go any time for any reason whether work related or not. Less than 10% of the people stayed longer than 1 year. I have seen over 50 colleagues gone.

Politics. Small company but big politics relative to its size. You need to join some small circle to become the 10%.

Unethical to game players. Want only their money. HR and Recruiting will say whatever beautiful story to bring you in for a reason."

229,MZ,beware of data platform and marketing team,2016-04-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"people are fired very often and without good reason.  Management uses the tactic to scare  the rest of the team.  Decisions are made top-down only.  one feels very diminished and dis-respected on the team. you are always a dispensable resource rather than a valued asset.  The team has a hard time hiring strong leads.  So they will do everything to get a new hire into the door.  Do not be fooled.

The leadership is weak to non-existent.  Basically you would be expected to deliver everything, except there is no guidance on what deliverable are expected.  So good luck! 

Working hours are very long.  It's not uncommon to see people working past midnight.  Problem is: management is proud of that they can make employees work long hours rather than seeing it as a problem. So there is no end to long working hours.  

Leadership is weak at data platform engineering team.  Development is all bottom-up because there is no vision nor roadmap from the top, though all decisions are made at the top.   Forget about stock options.  either you don't get enough to make a dent.  Or if you were promised any,  you will be fired before you get any.","long work hours

Are those 20 words?","Notice how all the low reviews have the highest Helpful votes. It is because they are truthful and not written by some company shills to dupe some naive potential employees to apply. The attrition rate is horrible for a reason.

The place is ran very amateurish with the insane CEO running the asylum. The clueless and childish managers following the CEO are what one expect from a place like this. Working way more hours than the standard week as stipulated in the employment contract does not make the so-called ""game"" better. Lame company outings also does not help morale if the actual working employees are not respected and working crazy long hours."

Is it true we work hard? Yes, however we play hard as well. Machine Zone goes above and beyond when it comes to recognition and rewards.  

Our CEO is a true visionary.  He is hands on, always interacting with his employees.  He is truly interested in not only the work they do, but who they are.  I am extremely fortunate to work so closely with him every day and I know he genuinely cares about his employees.

The CEO is incredibly generous and is passionate about our mission.  You get to work with smart people who care about winning.,"The challenge ahead of the company is difficult, ambitious and will make a profound impact in technology - ""we're not just a gaming company"".  As a result, some people can misinterpret our passion and focus as working too hard and not having work/life balance.  This is a hyper-growth startup that requires a level of hard work and dedication that most companies never get the chance to attempt.  There is a reason why there are less than a dozen startups on the unicorn list.  I find it ironic that the people who write mean things about the company are mostly 'former employees' even though there is no way to fully verify that the person is currently employed by MZ.  You might be thinking that you are only attacking the founders of the company, but in fact you are attacking all of us who are working hard to deliver this audacious mission."

Some of the smartest people I've worked with.","1. No life/work balance. Average 14 hour days. Some weekends.
2. Autocratic management. Do as you are told or get fired.
3. Lack of planing. Everything is an emergency and has to be done yesterday.
4. Lack of direction. Make up your mind about what you want to be when you grow up. If we're a game company, where is the second and third game? If we're an infrastructure company, where is our sales and account management.
5. Management-by-firing. There is no attempt to understand what went wrong, or why. You're only as good as your last project."

281,MZ,Challenging company to work for - work to death for high rewards,2015-05-31,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Perks are good - free lunch, lot of good snacks, benefits are the best (with one caveat, see below).  Co-workers are the best I've worked with in awhile.  They're smart, dedicated, and fun to work with. You definitely will sharpen your skills there. Company is currently making tons of money.","A very big grind.  It's a 24-7 operation meaning a little down time means huge loss of money.  Unlimited vacation is a joke - it's unlimited since no one has time to take one, and if you do take one, you'll be on the phone a lot anyways or you'll be silently chastised for not being 100% dedicated.  CEO has ""Steve Jobs-itus"" - very, very tough to work with. You're also require to complete your assigned task even though you're getting pulled into fire fights or last minute requests."
282,MZ,Not the best...,2015-03-18,2.0,,"Fully stocked kitchens, free lunches and monthly team events.",You are expected to be on 24-7 which probably works for most employees since most employees are single with no kids. But to the ones of us with families it makes it very difficult to have a work-life balance or even get home at a decent time. High turnover and no communication from management.
283,MZ,Incredibly Talented Team + Great Focus + Strong Product = Amazing Career Opportunity,2015-03-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Joining Machine Zone has been, by far, the best career choice I have made. Before I came to MZ, I worked at two different public competitors. Although I had talented colleagues at these other companies, I felt like management lacked conviction, and the companies didn't have any clear vision to execute on. As a result, failure was par for the course, turnover was high, and employee moral was low.

MZ has been a completely different animal. It goes without saying that MZ is full of incredibly talented people. But on top of that, Management has strong conviction in their vision, and the company's ability to execute on that vision. As a result, the people at MZ are working together as a focused team. And a strong team rallying beyond a clear vision has led to a lot of big wins. What is more, with each new win, employee moral is strengthened and the team is that much more focused on the next challenge.

Finally, base compensation is quite strong and the company is exceptionally generous at further rewarding people who go above and beyond.","The biggest challenge now is managing growth. If the company can successfully grow headcount without losing its culture or lowering the bar, it could continue being one of best career opportunities in the Bay Area for years to come."
284,MZ,They're successful for a reason - but people need to more of a priority.,2015-01-31,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Incredibly talented team and some true visionaries on staff, from academics to tech to design. Strong production leadership. Engineering and Ops teams that can and will accomplish anything. Data science team that is the best in the business. You stand to learn a lot in a very short amount of time if you can keep up pace with everyone else. Quite honestly some of the best perks in the games/tech industry and they have a great incentive structure for hitting company goals. This company is here to stay and their success is not by accident.","**This is is not a video game company.** Ultimately games are a vehicle to a broader company direction. This means if you're looking for the fun, collaborative, creative game environment, you won't find it here. Game design, art, and architecture direction comes from one place and one place only: The CEO. The CEO is very, very smart, but very hard to work with. 

It bears saying that this isn't a company that has *any* sense of work/life balance. If you're not in the office contributing 12 hours a day, or willing to be on call 24/7, they're you're actively walking yourself out of the company over time. The well oiled machine is treated like a 99.9999% reliability enterprise product and small mistakes are punished harshly. 

Also beware the internal career track; this company is a great learning experience, and will be beautiful on your resume, but don't expect to move outside or forward in your role for a very long time, if ever. Machine Zone wants gears in the Machine, not human employees with goals and ideas about how to improve the company/product/themselves."

The mobile industry is still really young and constantly changing, and as a result the workplace and assigned tasks tend to be very dynamic and exhibit a lot of variety. You receive all the typical perks you expect from an up-and-coming tech startup, and their new office is extremely spacious. And let's not forget they make video games, so that's pretty cool too.

If you've ever wanted to work in mobile, now's a great time and Machine Zone's a great place to do so.","It's really busy. There's always something to do and oftentimes you won't be able to complete everything you actually want to do. That's sort of what tech startups are about, though."

The leadership team are approachable and they listen to feedback.  They've always open to looking for ways to improve the work flow and processes.","Not necessarily a con, but I can see how the perceived work/life balance won't suit everyone's tastes.  The pace that the company moves at is very quick and many on the team are highly committed."
291,MZ,"Good product but technically dysfunctional, no room for growth",2014-09-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Good salary and benefits, just moved to a nice new office.
- Very successful, no worries about job security.
- Stable work hours.
- Some coworkers are true experts that you can learn a lot from. MZ is not successful by accident.","- MZ reinvents the wheel over and over. Almost every code library used internally was custom written, and not usually an improvement over open source alternatives. Everything feels like legacy code and little is documented. Amazingly, many engineers think that our tech stack is so much superior to everyone else, arrogance that must come from lack of experience elsewhere.
- Growing pains. Company has grown fast and hierarchy is emerging and becoming more complex. It may be hard to have an impact or have room to grow if the company can't keep up its rapid growth.
- If you join now, outside of very senior positions your role will be very narrow. In some engineering teams creativity seems actively discouraged in favor of soldiers who can keep oiling the machine in highly specialized ways without question. Not good for long-term career prospects."

Machine Zone treats the employees well with compensation, events, social outings, and listening to what you want.","The only people I have seen leave the company were looking for a relaxed place where you can sit back and code for a few hours and go home.

The people I worked with were knowledgable and competent.  The compensation and benefits were excellent.  They actually paid the bonuses they promised during the interview.  They did at least try to work with me on the work/home balance issues.,"The company is centered around people who are completely committed to the success of the company over anything else.  Since so many of them spend so much time at work, the company makes efforts to provide small social opportunities daily and large ones reasonably frequently.  This is a great environment, if you want to make friends at work and combine your social and professional lives.  If you have a preexisting social or family life that is important to you or you just aren't very social, then the environment can feel isolating instead of inviting, like being a stranger in a large family's home.

They will try to work with you on the work/home balance issues, but the culture is still centered around presence.  Management tends to rely on people they can walk up to and have a conversation with; they haven't really embraced chat or teleconferencing.  If you cannot be in the office every day when the important decisions are happening, you lose effectiveness very quickly.

Also, operational and development responsibilities tend to fall in the same role for a component.  Pretty much every engineer is effectively on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."

Management and CEO have a real handle on F2P market. Great HR staff, and tech guys.","Engineers and artists dislike being locked into roles. Not the best company for artists.
