Product is broken and is running on hacks. The engineering is run by an evil CTO who has no pedigree and has been running the Bihar berozgaar yojana to say the least. People are dated and have a poor technical know-how. Could be forgiven but the intent can't be. There is malafide intent across the org. The few product guys who have stayed (or rejoined) have become experts at this game and their personal vision coincides with the org's vision of sucking everyone in the ecosystem dry to show some profits, and create linear growth without ANY product innovation and getting accolades by licking the CEO. (Bombarding users with spam messages, calls, notifications is NOT an innovation) ~ 
It will also cut your salary for miss punches (when there machine does not work) and you will need CEOs approval to get it corrected . Best part is you will be so overloaded trying to sweep the grime that you won't even know. While leaving, they will try to cut from your FnF. They are experts at this game.

2- New Rule is to reach office before 10 a.m. because it’s increasing the productivity,

3- Saturday’s working sometimes but it’s very rigid because managers have to show that there team is coming office so that he gets better appraisal.

4- poor code quality- Never expect to learn good coding quality.

5- 9 hours mandatory on daily basis.

6- you might have seen hackathon in tech driven companies, they have a 24 hours bugathon so that you solve all the live bugs whole night 😂😂😂 Now you can open the Magicbricks site, it’s all bug free.

7- People are leaving right now who ever is getting a chance to leave and some people like me still hunting for jobs 😂😂.

8- Attendence is taken in scrum tym and whosoever is absent is informed to CTO. So there is no proxy system here😂.

9- Hacker easily hacks there site it has happened multiple times.

10- There is a black board outside the CTO office where you mark team name and a red circle if the sprint is delayed so that everybody can see. This is the height I have never seen this in 6 years of my career anywhere. Even in school’s teacher don’t do these things.

Unrealistic sales target may makes them to score highest in attrition percentage soon on the chart this year.
Person at the leadership level has no humane left in him, i wonder how he reached there. Anyways the promises they make seems nowhere touching even a bit of the targets they set for themselves. He has no clarity what he wants to assign to whom, its a dicethrow game seems like.

419,MagicBricks,A Product Managers Playground...(More Honest Opinion)!,2018-01-26,4.0,Product Manager,"On this part I would like to keep one of the reviews posted by my colleagues as reference - 
“1. Highly sales driven company. Do not understand what product and how creating a great product can drive revenues down the line and help scale. No. Too narrow vision. Patching the product to help increase revenues. Look at one of their pages with almost 10 CTA's. Why not include a CTA on each group of 16 pixels and fill up the screen with CTA's. You will achieve your targets.”
To a certain extent – MB is a sales driven company – so what – many companies are – the tricky part and the job of product manager here is to cater to the needs of 
1.	The users – the buyers and tenants who come to the site, how to showcase them the best quality properties – work on both search and listing quality improvements. 
2.	Our Buyers – Agents and Builders who pay to us – track their payments, see if we are delivering basis expectations. Product and Listing Optimizations etc.
3.	Besides this we are always involved in figuring out new innovative products – Experience Center, Auctions, Forums, Flash Sale, Big Billion Sale like events – GOHF, DHF, STDC, Big Bang Sale and so on.
4.	The work doesn’t end here – we are market leaders in research because one of our key responsibility areas is understanding different segment of buyers – Residential Sale, Commercial, Rental, Luxury and so on. Offerings are tailored to each of these segments.
5.	There is an entire Alerts Management System, a CPL system, a Lead management system and so on – all ideated by product managers.
6.	We use Solr, Google Analytics, R, CrazyEgg, Mouseflow, Excel, MySQL and lot of other tools to get hold on our user needs and work on the same! 
“2. If your aim is to grow into Product Management in terms of skills, don't join. Just dont. The product managers here do not possess even an iota of Product Management skills. You wont get to learn anything from peers or seniors.”
I think the team here is so diverse and extremely competent from diverse backgrounds. We have people who were leading logistics and supply chain in one of the biggest companies in India for operational and process optimizations, data analysts, gamers who give a different feel to user experience, segmentation and Gamification, real estate stalwarts who have been consultants in the likes of JLL and Cushman Wakefield, Digital Marketing Experts and so on. Everyone plays on their own strengths and are busy working on their targets. To know them better, you need to spend time together at lunch or in product parties. People here of the caliber who can save a sinking ship from drowning!
“3. The trend I have noticed is that they quote a figure in the offer letter and end up making a mistake in the totalling. Please check the offer letter once thoroughly. Has happened to a lot of people.
4. The team do not stand to the role and designation promised. You have to fight to make the HR honor the offer letter.”
Doesnt happen in 99% cases. Because it is a Group company and that too one of the biggest and oldest media groups in the country. So if some of the information that you shared in your resume, does not match with the actuals, or if there were some discrepancies in the actuals and quoted figures by prospective employees, something of this sort is likely to happen. Well other organizations might just terminate the employment in such cases!
“5. The peers are extremely rude. No smiles, no introduction, no involvment, no knowledge transfer.
6. Politics is rampant at each and every stage and since the whole organization is so target oriented, which I agree it should, people step on each other's foot by buttering the seniors, sabotaging work of colleagues, going back on verbal promises to name a few.
7. ""Its not my job"" is rampant and when people do this, they say ""Welcome to MB"". Tells a lot about culture and the ""Its what works here"" syndrome.”
I don’t think politics is as rampant. Well everybody works to earn credits and get appraisals so a professional atmosphere should exist. Politics in a negative context means saying something upfront and thendoing something quite contradictory or trying to pull each other legs. Well leg pulling does happen with different teams – I guess a product manager should know how to handle this. However, politics is not rampant! As a product manager we are working with different teams to arrive at a common goal. If somehow we are not able to do that we tend to blame others.
Read about Good and Bad product manager. A bad product manager will always have n number of excuses. It is only this attitude that has resulted in the above feedback!
“8. No documentation. Had gone to a meeting with 10 people and spent 4 hours to determine how the system was created. Each person having own view of the same and suggestions thrown around to patch it up to make things work. Simply Wow!
9. Agile and Scrum are fun words here with no one understanding the core behind it.”
Agile means little documentation and this is ok. We have everything maintained on JIRA. And anytime any requirements corresponding to Search or Listings or Alerts can be found on JIRA. So even though there is no comprehensive documentation or word docs or pdfs, anyone can understand the system entirely using JIRA labels or stories!
I agree that we are not experts in Agile. Actually there are product managers and then tech leads. Agile is usually done by Project Managers – however here the Product manager is all – Product Marketing Manager, Product Owner and also Project Manager(to some extent) so yes Agile is not followed in entirety – but the entire team is working to make that happen and we would see it soon.
“10. Old Old Old Tech Stack. Not scalable. No open source technologies used. Tech team is extremely incompetent.
11. HR prides itself on less attrition rate when they do not realise is that this is what would sink the boat eventually. People staying on for years doing nothing and paid well. Ofcourse attrition rate will be low. Thats a no-brainer.
12. Oldies in the organization throw around weight and ensure that work does not get done.”
Having old people in your organization actually means that the organization cares for its employees. Look at struggling startups where the average time a person is on the job is less than one year. On the contrary here people do work to achieve their targets, are motivated to come to work daily because of new events and because of a challenging, conducive and learning environment they prefer to stay longer. There is flexibility in working time – 11am to 4 pm is mandatory though to facilitate meetings etc. Employees can occasionally take work from home. For product managers, the environment is very trustworthy and the leads assign targets basis discussions and then give liberty to the respective owners to achieve the way they want to. There is little to no micromanagement.
Having old people in the team also creates a good family like atmosphere where we get to learn from the more experienced and seasoned employees. Often times a lot of their experiences and suggestions help us save a month of efforts! For work life balance and recreation on  specific occasions even families can visit the office – On childrens day, we had invited childrens to the office and everyone had a really good time.
“13. EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL colleagues. Have to touch their feet to get work done. Not responding to emails, not accepting meeting invites, promising of a discussion at a mutually agreed time and not turning up.”
Well this does happen occasionally, but it is not because of unprofessional or rude colleagues but because a product manager is too busy interacting with different teams wearing different hats of a project manager, marketing manager, designer, qc and sales lead and then in his/her own planning and analysis that there is little free time. So unless you meet or remind them they might miss it unless it is a critical meeting.
“14. Not data driven at all. All decisions taken on fly and based on Gut or HIPPO (Highest Paid persons' opinion). When asked what is the basis of taking the decision, the answer is we have tried this earlier, it doesnt work. When asked where is the previous report, they say there is no report. Absolute ""My Way or the Highway"" attitude.”
As already discussed all decisions are data driven. For app and web almost all releases first go through a A/B testing before final release. 
Sources of data are multiple –Broadly SQL db for details and Google Analytics for rest. We have our own data tracking integrated at various touchpoints.
“15. Some teams are given huge leeway which crushes all the timelines of the dependent teams. Just because that team is closer to the CEO.”
If you achieve your targets and surpass them by a large number frequently – you are bound to be the senior management’s favorite. There’s no science in this! The product head takes the call on which tasks to prioritize so if 1 product team is working on their P3 item which might be overall Priority 1 compared to another teams P1 item than the P3 item is bound to get priority in sprints. I think he/she who has written the review should have worked harder to get closer to the CEO..
“16. People SHOUT at you. Yes, in front of the crowd, they literally shout to get their way. Nothing less than a fish market. And you cannot concentrate sitting at your desk .
17. Promotion hungry colleagues by sucking up to the senior management. By Crook and only by Crook.”
I think these are all opinions and not facts. It depends on your nature and the way you handle disagreements. It is your soft skills and people skills that decide how people behave with you – more so in a product management role!
“18. Supporting functions like Finance are extremely lazy. You have to make 100's of trips to their seats to get a job done.
19. Followup Followup Followup. How can the work be done if you do not followup? It is your job to get the work done right? Unless you follow up with me atleast thrice, I am not going to give you what you want? You are not paying me right? --- That is the attitude of all the teams.
And believe me I am just tired to list down any further reasons to stay miles away from this company. For God and your own career's sake, please stay away.”
I think it is a group company – so definitely there are bound to be some hurdles in admin, finance processes. The best way to approach these functions is by first interacting and discussing and then doing as suggested/adviced.
Well the organization rewards hardwork and technical know how and you become dearer to the senior management if you achieve your targets. The product team is very close to the CEO and has good respect within the organization and it is not by way of authority, but by way of ideas, competitive rankings and past results. 
Magicbricks is just like a family away from home. People fight, people age, people discuss and people innovate - we all are one when working for the benefit of our customers – buyers, tenants, agents, builders and partners alike!
