- I am in my 6th role in 6.5 years of being here, and each role has provided me with different learning opportunities and immense opportunity to create impact as well. 
- The organization takes a punt on people to boost their careers once you have built credibility and trust in the system.
- You are allowed to make mistakes and learn from them; the risk taking appetite of the org eventually grows onto its employees as well.
- As a working mother, the organization has always stood by me and ensured I had sufficient flexibility whenever required to balance work with my personal needs.","We are an organization that runs on networks - literally and figuratively. When people joined us virtually, they would have taken longer to create those networks and hence settling time would have been higher in comparison to the time when we would all be in office.

88,MakeMyTrip,Mediocre at best. Covid and bad management have destroyed the company.,2021-12-14,2.0,Software Engineer,"Nothing as such. Highly team and manager dependant work, leaves etc.","Quality of work is mostly very bad. Since 40% (and only increasing) employees have left in Covid, main job of new joiners is to cover up for them like debug their code etc. 

Too much attrition. Almost half the company has left. Just see how many ex-MMT employees are in Amazon on LinkedIn. That's how bad the company is people prefer to move to Amazon. Underpaid, overworked.

Company is in the phase of extreme cost cutting. That's why even in Covid they were in profit with such less revenue compared to before Covid when they were not in profit with triple the revenue. (check MMYT quarterly revenue and profit on NASDAQ for last 2 years). So focus is on cost-saving not quality.

Open leave policy totally manager dependant. Some managers don't let you take leaves at all. It's better to have a counted number of leaves.

Highly understaffed. Don't follow SDLC principles at all. Improper and manual testing. Also no proper guidance since almost half the company has left. 

Toxic culture. Most of what you read here is a lie trust me. No one is satisfied here. People here use sir & mam for most senior staff which is very rare to find in respected firms."

544,MakeMyTrip,Decent company,2020-04-13,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,Good office space in Bangalore,Engineering leadership is not good enough
545,MakeMyTrip,Worst Experience,2020-04-09,1.0,,You can get average pay if you really like to stay in NCR.,"I have never seen the worst management than here in my whole professional career.
Nothing is planned, not even critical projects.
My manager did not know anything about the code and looks like he never have coded a single line in his entire life. He don’t know how much days would a task requires.
For a 2-3 month projects, they asked us to complete in 2 weeks and as it is not possible to complete the same so you will be taunted by the directors/vps of the team because you have delayed the project.
They do not care anything about the employees.
You will have to request them so much to take the planned leaves and even after that sometimes you are not going to get the leave. Even you can not attend the important function like your friend’s marriage because that is not important to you at all according to them.
You will have to work on weekends too and not only when something urgent comes up but they want you to work on every weekend if possible.
They want to spend all your time in the office only. I asked my manager once why are we spending this much time in the office, he replied that we have to show off to the upper management that we are working our a** (glassdoor would allow bad words - have to use asterisk) off.
They do not follow any process while working on projects. I feel they never have attended the project lifecycle classes. 
They want to take project live without testing. And testing would mostly take place post release. There will definitely be some issue on production as testing never happened. They force you to stay late and solve the production issue which occurred because you sent the untested code in release as you had to release the 2-3 month project in 2 week. 
They never asked the employee to share the timelines and even if you share them, first they will approve and when you start working, they will pressurise you to complete in the half time (they couldn’t have approved the timelines at the first place if they had the issue) by working till late.

There are so many cons that if you start counting and start writing then you would be able to write a book for sure."

4. With goibibo merging in, work culture has gone shockingly down. 
5. After 16 years, they've still not come out of the ""startup"" culture which reflects the failure of their internal small projects/companies - Rightstay, GoRooms, MMT Value +, which had given sleepless nights to the jobs of the employees who were told to resign in a number of 200+ in two nights.
5. Job Security of 70% (of the overall) BD folks is not there at all as they're impulsively told to migrate to different cities giving a short notice after overseeing failed project/ventures (point no. 4). A mass exodus of 300 employees was there in the past quarter."

They are very good at what they do and are responsive. During my hiring process they offered great support and guidance. They were always there when I felt lost or needed help.

Engineering:
Fundamentally, the company has a service oriented architecture (SOA) for its internal software systems.
I had a good number of project opportunities and got exposed to important technologies such as Java EE, Spring, & Couchbase. This list has been growing as I explore new projects here.
Initially I worked on a brand new project, which helped me learn to develop a web service from scratch.
I also got to be involved in technology migration activities, which helped me understand the differences and nuances between old and new technologies.
There has been an increased focus on software quality by incorporating tools such as Sonar.

Team:
My team is brimming with experienced engineers: Senior Software Engineers and Tech Leads. We all have similar experience and mindset and come from diverse backgrounds. Working with them helped us establish professional friendship - we help each other out when needed.
More importantly, there are highly experienced engineers as well - Principal engineers & Architects. Working with them has been a great source of learning and inspiration.

Management:
Senior technology management is easily accessible and has provided good direction when needed.
There are various internal tools that one can use to effectively communicate with senior business management as well for any other concerns.

Benefits:
Annually an offsite trip is funded by the company, where a team can go on a vacation trip to a place of choice.

Work-life balance:
I have worked at a different e-commerce company before. Basis that I would like to comment that the work-life balance at MakeMyTrip is good.
In fact, it ranked #1 recently in work-life balance of all the e-commerce companies in India.","I can't think of a con from the top of my head, maybe because I was satisfied with the pros here.

913,MakeMyTrip,"Pathetic work culture, low average talent and unethical HR",2016-11-03,1.0,,"None, for any strong technology professional.","- Worst company for strong technology professional.
- They are not a tech company by heart. They fake tech aspirations but in reality it is more like a company driven by Product managers and treat Engineering team as support staff.
- Most of the MMT tech crowd is either highly incapable or wrongly trained. They just can't even write a loop properly and take ages to implement simplest of tasks and still miss use cases.
- The moment you do code reviews strictly, they will cite code reviews as reasons for delays.
- There is absolutely no sense of architecture in the tech leadership. These folks of a very weird notion that just using popular and new open source technologies and framework can make a great architecture. Selection of these too is based ob one's fascination.
- Outages are common here and still instead of action oriented RCA it just ends at blame game.
- One of most weird performance appraisal which is completely hypocritical.  it is based on hunch and perception.
- Among leaders, There is a chronic aversion to getting into technical details of proposal, problems and solutions. It is very difficult to have a healthy debate on anything. It will always will be shadowed with one's designation and political muscle power.
- If people will not be able to beat you with arguments and rationale, they will use illogical but extreme skepticism and form a lobby of such guys and kill the idea.
- Product leadership is confused and in reality they are kind of doing on thing or the other and you will never get any sense what they are really trying to achieve. 
- Here PMs seem to have more interest in tech implementation rather than driving product, and will was their hands in case there is an outage due to their design. Engineering teams have adapted to this quite well. So if you try to break this i.e. disagree with hacks and stop gap solutions of PMs, you won't survive.
- HR is very unethical, especially the moment you say you want to leavne. The will make avoid responding on email but will give assurances and make promises only to go back on them later without any explanation."

1. No respect for talented people(especially at lower levels).
2. If you can't show off your work, you are treated as a useless resource.

4. Very less number of smart people. Most of the guys put more efforts in buttering their managers.
5. Nothing to learn. Your existing skillset might even deteriorate if you get stuck in some really bad project.
6. In the end, it all depends on you. If you are a champ of politics, this place is surely for you.

2. Top management in QA is spineless, they talks big but does not deliver, does not back their managers on critical fronts and fails them. Organization is in a mood of hiring new resource and get away with the old one who don't work for more than 12 hrs.

There is no  change management process and nothing about knowledge management and knowledge sharing. so ITIL process is just  word.


manager are good for nothing, you can not ask for leave they would deny all time.
if u show ur work that has no value and just a single mistake would down you to bottom and that mistake will always be accountable at the time of appraisal. 
managers will never appreciate  the work done by any individual. when some thing goes wrong by their own they put fingers to each other and put down the matter and upper level management (L-Team) are unaware of them.

Work in some of the teams is good and relaxed. They know how to balance work and also have fun along with it.
Very good learning as there is a lot of work. Work from home option also available. Flexible timing.
One offsite trip every year is a nice policy where the company pays upto a certain extent of the expenses.","Internal politics and playing favouritism is so prevalent. People who show off work rather than those who do the real work are appraised and promoted. You can't grow without boot-licking.
And just forget about ever getting appreciation for your work but be ready for facing the consequences for even a little mess up.
Lower Management is so pathetic with no people skills at all and don't know how to handle the sub-ordinates. Asking for a personal time-off from work is like a crime. People are over burdened with work and work-life balance is messed up big time.
The HR is powerless and has no control over Team managers. The managers working from a few years tend to boss around even after such an obvious high attrition rate in their teams due to their poor management. Their strategy is to burden new employees with work till they get frustrated and leave. And the same is continued with the next batch. And the HR just sits back and does nothing.
Training provided at the time of joining is really insufficient and very short.
The fun@Work element the company boasts of is nowhere to be seen. Team lunches and parties are so rare like sighting a comet in years.

Its not a coincidence that the Economic Times Great Place to Work Ranking of the organization has dropped from top 5 to 48 in recent years."

1043,MakeMyTrip,MakeMyTrip in real screws your Professional Trip.,2014-07-23,1.0,Senior Executive,"There are definitely strong reasons that one should consider working here, such as:
1) Good Pay Master.
2) Brand Name.
3) They make you work a lot, which can in-turn help you learn a lot.
4) At times internally, being an employee of this company you get to know good airfare/packages deals, etc. which might help  you, your friends and family to plan trips at cheaper rates.
5) Infrastructure is good.","There are multiple reasons that could be stated here from the experiences I've personally had, though will in general share a few of them:
1) Lots of Internal Politics starting from lowest Manager level.
2) Partiality and Favoritism of Bosses is the ""Key to Success"" here among each and every department of MakeMyTrip.
3) Your hard work, stretching for long hours, coming on weekends for work, won't make any difference at all, in the eyes of your Manager, as that is all going to go in vain at the time of Yearly review. As your KRA's are just set as a part of the process to complete the formality, but, nothing else, they won't make any difference when it actually has to be discussed at Year end, it can either be changed anytime during the year without your information, or you can accept to hear strange ways to measure it or compare it with others in team, not told to you at the time of KRA setting, which will fade off/nullify your entire work done throughout the year.
4) Bad working culture prevails here, especially for Females, such as, Managers prefers for Evening dinners with teams, instead of Day-time lunches, which is always convenient for all girls in the team, on the contrary girls are forced to join them for such events. Drinking a lot and loosing control after that is a very common scene here at Office Parties. Use of abusive language among males is a frequent sight in office hours & premises. If you wear formal to work place, you would be made fun off, with comments such as (""where are you going for an interview today?""). Managers tries to be overly interested/poking in whats going on in your personal life, and if you are not of the same nature, and have your own set of family values and work-ethics you will have a tough time working here, else be a part of his/her gang, and be happy. Managers will ensure round the year he/she keeps  you insecure about your Job, and no matter how much efforts you are putting in, or have actually shown results, you can be asked to leave anytime with vague reasons given to you, as compared to those members of your team, who rarely work, but, know how to please there Boss. Huge monetary contributions can be a regular ask here for events day-in and day-out, like somebody's B'day, marriage, offsite contributions for drinks and non-veg food etc. (even if you don't drink or eat non-veg), and if you are not comfortable for contributing in it, your manager will ensure to taunt you for such things publicly every-time and make you feel awkward and look-down upon yourself, that you can't afford such expenses etc.
5) Higher Management is not at all supportive, rather very diplomatic and manipulative, if you reach out to them for help, don't expect anything from them, or any understanding but, sweet talks and sympathetic replies in return."
