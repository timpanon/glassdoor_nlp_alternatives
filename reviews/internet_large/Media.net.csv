Sound business model - literally cost arbitrage of workforce. They hire some of the best engineering talent in India and all their customers are in developed markets. They earn in $, churn products quickly and incur cost in INR. 

Experience high life when traveling abroad on business.","No product management function. They market it as product management but it isn't. No product leaders on rolls and strategic program managers (their name for PMs) reports to engineering managers, which is absurd. 

Can potentially get stuck in a pseudo PM role as peers would have learnt the craft of product management and progressed careers. 

No company/product vision.
Execution focused role. 
No room for innovation. 
Zero mentorship. No career growth path.
Company lacks business ethics in their quest to make profits.
