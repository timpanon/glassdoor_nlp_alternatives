55,Medlife.com,Only work work work - Worst HR Team,2021-04-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Medlife is a place for people who wants to experience startup culture in their career.
-Lots of learning opportunities ( you will learn business end to end ) irrespective of what role you are.
-You will be playing the role of marketing,tech,product,coding,business decisions,call support. 
- You will come out as an mini entrepreneur !","-Only for workoholic guys otherwise don't join if you are looking for work life balance
-Biggest con in my experience : Worst HR Team & Management, Less salary to potential candidates, delayed salary, no reimbursement of internet bills,travel expenses,no relocation provided despite it was mentioned in my offer letter. Basically very KANJOOS in paying the employee. Many highly talented people are leaving because of this. Please PAY THE RIGHT AMOUNT ! We are not asking medlife money we are asking to pay our money for the value we provide 

-Work Life balance will be an issue - You can't expect that after 7-8pm you can chill. No you can't. So this company is only for people who are okay with compromising personal life. My biggest regret is that I missed taking leaves as i was too much dedicated to Medlife.
- Appraisals are not good enough. Please look after employee retention. 
Example : If an existing talented employee salary = 12 Lakhs
If that employee is asking 16 Lakhs - Don't negotiate ---- If he is talented he will keep providing more value. But Medlife problem is - Instead of giving 16 lakhs to existing employee - They will hire 2 new employees with 8 Lakhs as salary each. 
It might look as a better option, but what if those 2 new employees are not as great as existing employee. This is the problem ! I hate this. 

-There are no employee benefits or no fun. Like we never had FUN Friday in last 2 years of my tenure, No Diwali,No New Year No Festival gifts. They kept some sweets in the front desk office. We have to go there and eat. It looks so pathetic & awkard.
If HR Team really cared about employees, they can arrange some gift voucher on Diwali or New Year.This matters a lot. It makes us feel more connected with the company. Neverthless - HR Team should have right leadership & actually brainstorm together. 
-There was no any employee support during COVID. All they want us to do is WORK WORK WORK. Bhai, work is important but not all employees like this. We have family to look after. It's okay if work is taking a back seat for some time. 

Final Settlement - They will be very KANJOOS in this aspect as well. First, HR team will never reply to your emails when you resign. I don't want to mention name of HR Manager They will cut maximum amount in Final settlement as much as possible."

No clear communication at all from HR. Same mail copy pasted every week, every time till now. Not even 1 word changed. Transparency .. NEVER.

- Everyone in leadership never talks about the delays in commitments (financial & other work related) made from the company, but is always focussed on work & outcome, expecting everyone to work 24x7. Of course no one says it, but yes the expectation is such that even 24 hours will not be enough.

- Even during the ongoing Salary Crisis, not even a word spoken from the CEO that is assuring.

- Layoffs of really good talent, who have worked their hearts out during pandemic, without substantial notice & compensation.

- Leaders (Non-Tech), understand very little on the importance of technology. When things work they praise for 5 seconds job done well. But if there are any unforeseen issues, you'll end up getting a lecture for 15 mins about how badly everyone sucks at their job."

144,Medlife.com,Worst Management and Worst workculture,2020-04-18,1.0,SDET3,Salary here is credited on time,"Tech Issues:

1) QA team doesn't get requirements from product team. Once the development is done,  Developer team directly shoots the mail to QA to pick the feature. They won't event include QAs in requirements discussion also.
2) No Proper Test Environment to test. Now People are testing in preprod environment instead of their QA VMs. People fight each other to deploy their builds in preprod environment in order to test and get it released.
3) No requirements document for any feature or bug.Not even the Jira ticket also. Everything happens on the fly. No proof nothing.
4) No Debug APK to test. First Time I saw people testing it on release APK. Developers share only release APK. Very difficult to debug if any issue comes.
5) Developers will give feature to test on today and product manager is behind you to release the feature by today EOD. Every feature/bug we do is of Critical Priority so every feature has to go live on the same day. Literally every day release. Saturday and Sundays too.
6) For None of the feature, Development team do unit test. Because of this, it takes more time to complete a small feature also. Finally they blame QA team saying taking more time and not able to deliver on time. 
7) Every day release starts at Midnight 12. It will continue till 3 AM. Some time end ups in morning only. QA team has to support for these release. Releases on Saturday and Sunday too. Of course, QA team has to work on weekends also  in order to do the releases.
8) Worst Devops team I had ever seen. They always blame QAs for any issues in Preprod environment. Preprod is currently maintained by Devops team now. 
9) Literally there is No Road Map for the QA team. They don't want any QA/SDETs going forward.
10) Builds for every day release gets freezes around 10 PM or 11 PM. In 1-2 hrs time we need to run the regression and analyze the results for the release at sharp 12 midnight. why can't you freeze the builds at least 4 hrs before. who can analyze the test results in 10-15 mins???

Management Issues:

1) Hire and Fire Policy. Firing is a Norm here. They fired more than half of QA team recently.  Now rest of the team is struggling because of the resource crunch. Their plan is to fire the entire QA/SDET team. Without any proper planning they did the firing and still Management support themselves.
2) Not a Employee friendly management.
3) Ask/Force the employees to give good feedback in glassdoor. Most of the positive reviews in glassdoor for this company are fake reviews.
4) They recently started tracking time spent in office. If a person works till 3 AM in the morning for a release, how come he will be in office by 11 AM in the morning???

I am seeing Medlife nearly from past 2 years. Nothing is improved. In fact work environment is getting worse day by day. what is the point in hiring CXOs from Myntra and Walmart? What change they made?"

146,Medlife.com,My Experience at Medlife,2020-04-07,2.0,Senior Marketing Manager,"You can get away with being utterly ignorant, incompetent and not working at all if those are pros for you. Especially if you get someone reporting to you. 
The top management is not interested in who is doing the actual work, and anyone above you will take advantage of this. 
This will seem harmless until your reporting manager gets all the appraisal money, and you are given some pocket change like a 1-5% raise for working really hard, not only for the company but also playing secretary, stenographer, and gopher to your boss. 
The salary comes on time.  
It is a part of the pharma industry that is always growing.","Salary hikes are non-existent. Anytime you spend here over 1 year will set you back, both financially and in terms of learning and real professional experience. 
Decision making is completely ad hoc.
Top management doesn't care how employees are handled by their reporting managers.
Hiring standards are really poor, often hiring incompetent people from unrelated roles and putting them in charge of harassed juniors who have to then not only work but educate their own bosses. 
The HRD is only there for paperwork and is worthless to you as an employee. 
If you're worried about your health (yes in a healthcare company), carry your own water to work.
Only giving it 2 stars because of the few unfortunate nice and hardworking people that work there."

Higher management only focus is to track attendance and do micro management and by the way no one talks about the extra hours your have worked.

2. Do see there leave policies mentioned by few reviewers  here.  It's terrible. 

3. The worst HR higher management you will ever come across..  Instead of making employee friendly policies and help people stay longer in the company. They support all the terrible micro management decisions. Attrition rate is high. There is just no one in the HR team to talk on these terrible policies

4. No process in work. They want to finish every new feature in 2 to 3 days and release. They just don't care what developers are going through. For them even leaving office at 8pm or 8.30 pm is early.  

5. Cafeteria is horrible. There will be no place to sit, unless you go at 3 pm. Caterers are horrible and It's difficult to survive unless you carry your own food

So if you join here you basically don't have a vision, don't know what you're working on and yet you have to be in office and not take leaves. This is not office this is a slave market. 

- when you join this company there is no one to guide you. You have to keep sitting at a seat or wander about lost to find out what you are meant to do here and who is in charge of induction and laptops take three to four days to get assigned in your name. 

- They also make people sign documents before joining stating if they don't join by the date given they will have to pay the company three month's worth of salary. 

- There is constant instability. Upper management don't know what they're doing. 

- Many good people joined but recognized the nonsense in this place and are leacving. 

- I advise people not to join this company and also people in this company to leave asap. This place is not worth your time and dreams. 

- All employees are demotivated with employee unfriendly policies and you can see the result of it on their facebook page reviews by customers. The comments on FB will give you a good idea of how employees are working because they are so highly demotivated. And the upper management thinks by making stricter rules they will get work done!
