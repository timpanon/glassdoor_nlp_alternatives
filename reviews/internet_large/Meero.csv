The managers had a giant board on which was written ""don't ask stupid questions"" displayed for all to see that willing to improve your knowledge is not welcomed;
The product offered to investors is not actually functional. The reason that editing is done so fast is that they have a huge team of people working on Photoshop.

People took pride in their work and made an effort to make things happen.,"Do not be fooled by the aesthetic office and the young and attractive people. The upper management here was lenient towards those who were French or male. God forbid you do not agree with a manager! The company encourages you to speak up, but if it does not align with your manager's vision, then you will be fired for ""not embracing company culture"". Now, this was not the case with all managers. Some were supportive and were helpful. Too bad they were the ones that got fired first, and only the compliant ones were kept. Horizontal mobility? They promise that there are opportunities to transition to another team, but this only happened if you were French or friends with the manager in charge. Otherwise, you will be told that the role you are currently in fits you well and you wont be considered."

26,Meero,From good to awful,2021-06-10,1.0,Software Engineer,"The pros are mainly a thing of the past. There is nothing much to say really. Apart from the fact that there are some nice people here. But it has nothing to do with Meero. It just happens that there are good, fun and interesting people here.

In early 2019 the company was quite ambitious, but it is not the case anymore.","The pros are mainly a thing of the past, when Meero was in its hypergrowth stage. This stage ended at the end of 2019, when some investors weren't that much happy with the performances and decided to cut the budget. Which resulted in many issues. If you're thinking on joining this company, here is a bit of context :

Employees

Since late 2019, the company used every opportunity to get rid of people:
- First they fired, in a quite ugly way, most of the employees who were in their trial period. ""You are just not good enough"", is what they were told, when in reality it was an excuse to start saving money in very cheap ways.
- Then they used government’s help during the covid period which somehow lowered the rate by which people were fired.
- In August they announced a plan to terminate contracts on a large scale, which took effect in September.
- In December they announced a new plan, but this time to fire people on a large scale.

So when you read in the job offers that the company has between 500 and 1000 employees, everyone knows it’s just BS. 

The employees who left during the two last plans benefited from interesting compensations. The remaining employees didn’t get anything. They were to be happy that they kept their job. They put in place a very restrictive raise policy, and most of us got ridiculous raise, while expecting us to be grateful for it.


Communication and organisation

When all this happened, the communication became extremely opaque. 

The organisation was already messy, but is now a complete mess. As stated in many other reviews, the managers have no experience but still have a sense of elitism. They were just opportunistic enough during the hypergrowth stage. What’s crazy is that they kept the same number of managers for the few remaining employees. Resulting in very hierarchical structure, which makes the communication very opaque as stated above.


The work in itself

Because of the policy that consists on cutting the budget in every bits and places, there is no more place for innovation. The ambitious projects are constantly questioned / cancelled… So expect to be mainly working on unfulfilling tasks without a clear and coherent vision, and on aging technologies.


Recruitment

They decided to recruit only to replace people who are fed up and decide to leave. So if you’re applying for a job offer, or they are reaching out to you, it’s not because the company became suddenly ambitious again and want to re-build their teams. No no no. You are more likely to be replacing someone who was tired of having no compelling things to do, of having no clear vision, of having to be grateful for the very inconsequent things that they do. It can be you. Think about it."

29,Meero,"Decent benefits, questionable culture",2021-05-17,3.0,Business Communications Specialist,Good for recent grads. Entry-level jobs in Business Communications department (essentially customer service with additional responsibilities) are compensated fairly. Health insurance + 401k benefits are nice. There are opportunities to improve processes and grow alongside teammates and managers.,"Culture is very college frat-esque. Lots of young people with no clear direction in life and just want a somewhat dignified office job for the time being (if this is you, it may be a good temporary option). There is lots of drama and not much accountability or transparency from management. Most jobs tend to become monotonous after a while. Workday goes from 9 until 6 (or some equivalent nine-hour workday)."

2. Not a single chance of getting more that the minimum wage (SMIC) unless you’re able to negotiate from the beginning the salary. 
3. Very slim chances of getting a raise, unless you are being a part of the group of friends who run the company. 
4. Not transparent in regards to the AI that the company uses for the « automated editing of the photos ». In reality, a team of editors works in bad conditions in order to deliver the photos to the clients on time 
5. Financial state of company is at stake. Especially after the pandemic hit, Meero let go a lot of workers in Paris."

• High employee turnover rate.
• Management lacks maturity, integrity, and leadership skills. 
• Training protocols are left to poorly selected Team Leads—stemming from out-of-touch company executives who were either missing in action or hiding in their private offices while playing online fútbol. 
• Problem solving was left to lower level Coordinators, often at the cost of their jobs DESPITE management screwing up client and photographer contracts.
• Terrible communication between office teams, and A LOT of blameshifting and underhanded managerial tactics.
• Very clique-y work environment, management only listens to their ""friends"". 
• Personal lunches were knowingly stolen from the fridge by gym/drinking buddies of management with zero repercussions. 
• THE BIGGEST RED FLAG - NO HUMAN RESOURCES. (...and no, a 'Recruiter' does NOT qualify as proper HR)
• Zero way to measure an employees' work progress, leading to unjust firings as well as undeserved promotions.  
• Major problems with sexual harrassment allegations, no overtime compensation, managerial bullying, and the murky truth about what Meero actually sells vs what is advertised.

If you weren’t a male or sleeping with someone in leadership you were often dismissed and treated like trash. There were more sexual harassment and rape accusations in the HQ in France than I’ve heard of in any other place to date. I heard the US HQ also had allegations but were constantly dismissed. There is the infamous story about how in France, the CEO shut down a question an employee had about a rape allegation during an all hands. In the US the office was lucky if there even was an all-hands - leadership constantly rescheduled the meetings to avoid any difficult questions/topics. Leadership acts like a bunch of boys that peaked in high school who will not grow up and use investors money for their own private vacations and drug abuse. If you are a talented, competent, natural leader, I recommend looking elsewhere because the people here will make sure to set you up for failure as they all lack self confidence and would rather promote or keep their favorites in power. It was frowned upon to even consider having a life outside of work and people (ESPECIALLY LEADERSHIP) would make fun of you if you weren’t belligerently drunk at the happy hours. A lot of male managers would sleep with the same girls and pass them around like a toy- mind you, most of these men are married with kids. Management were all professional gaslighters and manipulators- so many people in the company had anxiety about coming in to work. The sales team in the US is constantly having their compensation agreements redone so that the company does not have to pay them out what they owe them (BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO MONEY) and the targets were impossible to reach. There was never any actual training set in place. In the US, they refused to hire an HR rep and the employees that fought for it either got in trouble or got fired. When Covid started, the CEO sent out a mass email to all employees telling them not to worry about anything as the company had enough money to sustain for years to come and the very next day the company ended up furloughing and firing a bunch of people. The manager of the US office once said in a virtual all hands that they were going to let go of some of the furloughed employees because “they were getting too comfortable with doing nothing and receiving unemployment money” DESPICABLE! At one point they also told the rest of the employees during a virtual all hands that if you got sick (COVID related) that you were required to take 2 weeks of vacation but there was no guarantee for you to have a job when you came back. THIS IS ILLEGAL, and they were trying to do it to an employee at the time. The only reason leadership backed down from this idea was because there were a lot of employees challenging them during an all-hands.  And don’t even get me started on how they run the business….there are a lot of people that work there that actually care about the product and the photographers they work with. But the company is constantly chasing money and desperate to get clients that they agree to getting paid low contract rates and then in turn ask the delivery team to sell the photographers on an idea of a $20 rate for ridiculous deliverables and crazy delivery times. Management, instead of bringing teams together, causes so much divide between teams with their own constant mistakes and blaming it on their team leads. Genuinely, the biggest problem here are all of the people that have decision making power. You all should really reconsider your strategy and clean out house if you want your brand to be taken seriously or people to even want to work for you, and also learn to treat your employees with respect."

54,Meero,Great place to grow,2020-12-04,5.0,People Team Member,"Meero gave me the opportunity to take on projects with a great deal of autonomy after joining with little experience. I enjoyed being part of a fast-growing company and obtaining an understanding of how a business operates cross-functionally. I was able to work on multiple teams in my time at Meero and develop new skills along the way, not something that can always be said outside of the tech space. The office itself was very diverse and each employee brought their own personality and skill set to the table, coming from various industries. The employees at Meero were always the biggest pro for me. As the office grew I was provided tools and platforms to help with efficiency and I was able to speak to management if I had any questions or ideas.","I found that although Meero is a startup, certain processes took longer than expected to be approved, changed, or considered. This can push timelines back and be inconvenient for employee retention, company growth and keeping up with new markets/competitors. There were some growing pains that could have been helped by a bit more transparency. As a young office growing quickly, it would have been nice to have some structure to the more basic aspects of the business, rather than needing to implement them later on."

71,Meero,Horrifying,2020-06-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"With the exception of leadership, it's a really fun, young and diverse staff that speak a ton of languages. You will meet some really interesting people. The parties are fun if you like to drink","Literally everything.
- Leadership is just friends of the CEO. They are unqualified.
- No one knows what they're doing, and this will probably get you fired. Few people in lead positions have any actual experience or training for their role. The ones that do usually quit, or get fired if they don't go along with management's harebrained ideas/sleep with someone in mgmt/ask too many questions.
- Sexual harassment is a MAJOR issue, and two employees have been accused of rape. Do yourself a favor and translate the French reviews. The CEO knows. He doesn't really care.
- You're looked down on if you don't work late. Management frequently gives speeches about working an extra 10-15 hours a week.
- The benefits are a joke. You have to earn vacation, then get in trouble if you go on vacation. Actually taking time off is frowned upon.
- The sales team needs a complete overhaul. People in the sales department get fired constantly. They get scared when they know leadership is coming from France because they know someone will get let go. Commissions are now called bonuses so that leadership doesn't have to pay them to sales if they don't want to. 
- Client success team is burnt out; they can't keep up with all the mistakes the company makes
- Photo editing team isn't allowed to work from home, so nobody is allowed to work from home. People come in sick a lot because the leave policy is so bad, and because you are shamed if you take time off.
- Operations team is always trying to make up for all the lies the sales team is told to tell clients
- People get fired for not having enough ""Meero spirit""
- Snacks are kept in a locked closet and distributed occasionally, leading people to hoard. Just offer snacks or don't, or pay people enough to buy their own snacks and pay their rent at the same time."
72,Meero,Positive review are highly suspect.,2020-05-31,1.0,Sales,"International company - interesting to see big daily brand names as customers, or soon to be ex-customers","- They seem to get a batch of positive reviews within a few days (pressured by management to post them) then a constant stream of bad reviews. I guess its needed or their rating will probably be at 1 star. 
- Pay is way below average
- Commission structure is not defined, its dependent on the mood of the bosses. I'm not kidding, your commissions payout rules will vary month to month.
- The worst is the management team. Management is hired or placed into position without any prior experience or training. Just because they were a good sales person for 6 months they place them as team managers. 
- Culture is horrible, managment uses guilt, condescending language
- Time off is highly discouraged, people get told off for taking time off
- You ""have"" to work way past your hours"

They just so happen to have unfortunately joined the wrong company.","After more than a year’s presence in the North American market, Meero has yet to figure out how to retain both clients as well as talent. Meero operates without an emphasis on transparency, which leads to steep client drop-offs and low employee morale. There is absolutely no opportunity for employee development. The average age of a manager in the NYC office (24 years old) speaks volumes as to the kind of frat culture that Meero strives to maintain. Both the C-suite and GM of the NYC office refuse to bring on in-house HR, for obvious reasons. Meero upholds a toxic culture and workplace environment. Any constructive feedback is taken negatively and denied by management. By no means would this be an acceptable place to work, whether you are at the start or further along your career. Avoid as a vendor and employer at all costs."

Working at Meero is a great experience! We get the chance to work with every team. There is an incentive to take over projects in a proactive and independent way. Teamwork is key at Meero.

Close to home if you live in the city.","This company is a complete scam. To begin with, the employees are not familiarized with photography or the technology behind. They run an unethical business and it's beginning to get worse. One of our best employee's recently left and managements has not handled it professionally. A lot of people are leaving left and right.

For the longest they refused to have an HR department (in which I'm sure we won't have anytime soon). They have Talent acquisition and Office Management act as HR employees. These individuals rather spent their time building relationships in the office and can't be trusted to handle sensitive issues. 

It's become a fraternity house. Employee's are playing beer pong every other week inside the office. 

 This is a company in which I cannot wait to leave. Please save yourselves the trouble and find a company that is REPUTABLE and that values employees. 

My advice to the company is to dissolve the NYC office and start from scratch with brand new and dedicated management."
