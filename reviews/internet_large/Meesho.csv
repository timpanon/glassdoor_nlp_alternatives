4. HR is coming up with various policies and investing a lot of time to make Meesho an employee centric workplace
5. Good learning as you would get a chance to work on things from scratch","1. Stressful work environment
2. HR is trying really hard to turn Meesho into a people centric workplace and coming up with fancy leave policies. They don't understand that if people take a leave on a certain day then they have to make up for it by working twice as hard the following day and hence, many people don't feel comfortable taking those leaves. They should rather solve for this. I think they lack 'problem first mindset'.
3. HR will constantly reach out to you to write positive reviews on glassdoor.
4. Salaries are lower for older employees whereas new hires on the same post are given much better compensation. This is unfair to the people who started working with you when the company wasn't as big as it is today.
5. Most managers are rude and insensitive towards their reportees which is the primary reason for the stressful work environment. New people hired at senior levels are much better as they have experience and patience to lead large teams whereas many senior members who have been with the company from the beginning don't have relevant experience and lack empathy for others.
6. If you join this company then don't trust your manager's word as they would promise you hikes but during appraisals they would flip"

But not worth it.","Definitely THE worst work culture and environment I have ever seen across 4-5 companies I have worked at. There is a fundamental problem at an org level. There are no checks and balances in place to ensure that things are kept professional. If you join, be ready to play the game for survival. Political and a non-transparent culture. Work life balance is very poor and you will be thrashed publicly even after putting in a lot of work over small things. Function leaders have no clear vision or value addition to provide, they will just dump work on you and bash you till you get it done. Everyone gets super hyper whenever there is a meeting with the CEO and the whole org seems to thrive on a ‘fear culture’ which percolates downwards. HR does not know how to improve things or handle such situations."
108,Meesho,Not a great place,2021-08-06,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are a few smart people at higher levels
Funding wise, things look good, and they also buy back ESOPs, so that's great.","Their motto of speed over accuracy is taken a little too far and many decisions are taken too quickly without evaluating basics. Once the team works on everything, things are changed again. And again. And again. 

Some people in the top management are rude and have egos.

I joined remotely in the pandemic and no one ever helped me when I had questions. Manager would say ask the team, but team would never respond to messages or calls. Manager doesn't do anything about this. 

Whatsapp groups keep buzzing from 7-8 am till 2am sometimes because someone is awake in the morning, someone late night. This makes it difficult to cut off from work and have some peace of mind. 

Work comes in very late. Some meetings also happen very late, like 11.30pm, midnight etc and then new work is assigned, which you are expected to complete by the next day. If there is a review the next day, data still keeps coming at midnight and you are expected to finish it off before morning. Which means you don't sleep. 

Its officially 5 days, but if they ask you to work on weekends or be available for meetings, saying no would be frowned upon. You are expected to be available at any time or any day. No respect for your time or personal space. 

Remote onboarding was absolutely poor. Hence it was very difficult to pick up things when no one would help you with doubts. And you are yelled at for not understanding a certain thing when you never got the answer for it. 

All said, there were some teams which were not as unhappy. Probably has a lot to do with the manager and team as well. Not sure on this though."

To get there, you have to make sure you are constantly reaching one level higher. How about 10 levels? 10x is the mantra at Meesho, and the same goes for your personal growth when you work here.Having worked at brands and agencies before, it's important to find a brand you can align your values with. Quite often, values become made-up corporate terms with nothing to show for. But, not here. The concept of Blitzscaling, Speed over Perfection or 10x Growth - are all values I always wanted to see in myself, and Meesho's aren't very different.It's always great to be part of market disruptors. Take on challenges your friends and market experts think aren't possible.For an agency person who is looking for a brand to switch to, take my advice and try a brand like Meesho where you have a bigger goal to align yourself with. Like enabling small business owners or empowering housewives turned entrepreneurs.",The pressure of blitz scaling can have consequences.

Unethical management - people are fired without much thought (this used to happen even before the pandemic). There is a serious problem in the way hiring is done. Proper expectations are not set during the hiring process, no proper onboarding is done once you are hired. You will be tossed around and expected to figure everything on your own. Till the time you try to figure things out you will be bashed in all of the team meetings. You will be in constant fear of getting fired at any given day, and you will be ultimately fired or given a role that is so unsuitable to you that you resign on you own.
2. Hostile work environment - doesn't matter if you are performing well, senior management will be hostile towards you. This happens across all orgs - Tech, Product, Finance, Growth, F&E. Makes you wonder if this is a clear direction from the founders to the senior management.
3. No credibility of senior management. You will not be able to trust the words of the senior management once you understand the unethical nature of the company.

CEO proudly announces this in front of every new joinee. he thinks it is a great thing to do - build a company by lying.

that dishonesty and lying defines the company. ceo  talks about transforming the life of housewife, like he is some angel from heaven. but the company dont have any ethical, moral standard. the founder (handsome guy who is boss,  cto is spineless) is a psychopath with a very charming personality, women always blush in front of him, but he dont care even a bit for people . he treats even  senior management people badly. and they cant open their mouth.  they are either pathetic and cant get job or are paid like crazy or pray to become rich by pampering this psycho. and the housewife? he brings them to big costly hotels, gives some prizes, pressures them to say sweet things, and behave s like he is god for them. but ask him to spend 200m funding in own logistics to help these housewifes with reselling. no, no. no money for that. money is for wasting on those five star hotels. is it surprising that he cant pay his employees in 2 weeks of lockdown and fires them after promising no firing. corona can come and go but company has hit its limit. it will not grow and ceo has no vision. he just changes planning every week and makes everyone crazy.  doesnt look like he ever did an actual job.

i am still here coz i don't want to switch quickly. now corona. but who knows. he again says no more layoff. but i am hearing that now tech team will also be fired.  good. tech team is pathetic.  no respect for good tech people. pathetic code.  good people leave this  company. useless people get promotion by flattery.

No design thinking, no innovation and absolutely no ethics. They will treat non IIT guys like useless trash. It is their culture.

Rude behavior with girls, personal life is ruined. 
None of your work will be appreciated but Your manager will the credit for your inputs in front of Higher authorities. 
Few ACM Thinks themselves as they have best knowledge in the system. But trust me they are the worst. 
And I would like to escalate the quality of products sold are not worth buying they are the worst in Beauty and Electronics. 
If you buy beauty products they are not Derma tested,

- No streamlined work. They expect you to perform without giving you any initial training.
- Arrogant freshers from so called IITs will act like bosses and treat you with disrespect.

- BEST suited for IITIAN.","This is a huge list to talk about

- No value for employees as they see employees as sheep.

- They hire and fire people as per their mood. YES, forget job security there is no Job stability. The attrition is over 70%. This happens across all functions. Be careful, even if they offer you a better salary, you can still get fired in a week's time or whenever someone's mood is not good. This is very normal.

- Very toxic work culture. Even if you are exceptionally performing well then also your scope of growth is limited because they hire folks from IIT (usually freshers) to manage you. Your words have lesser say. Senior team has extreme biases towards IIT graduates and rest they don't even consider that other the college did exist.

- Long working hours + you work on Saturdays & Sundays (sometimes).

- Zero perks or benefits for the employees.

- here is one more catch, if you have been hired for a certain role and In a months time you see in your salary slip getting changed from head to manager, don't be surprised. This is also normal. They demote you anytime.

- Before joining this firm do consult with people working there or ex employees. You'll get the gist.

- once you are in the system you'll always think when will I get fired. Applies to all the functions.

- 70% of the review written here were forced written from employees."
