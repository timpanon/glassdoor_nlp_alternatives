Only Study Managers, COMs and CRAs have career paths. 
You need to be a Director or VP ‘favorite’ to be considered for opportunities to grow or promotions. 
Positions are created only for the favorites or for certain ethnic backgrounds. 
Only favorites are rewarded. 
Multiple systems are used, systems don’t talk to each other. 
CRMs are expected to manage projects, go to sites to do CRA work, conduct quality visits, evaluation visits and initiation visits. Also, CRMs are expected to volunteer in company initiatives. CRMs do the job for 2-3 people but are only paid for 1 person. 
CRMs have to do what directors, CRAs and Study Managers don’t want to do. 
CRMs have to complete multiple trackers because other people can’t run reports from the systems. 
No support from Monitoring Management. If there are issues with CRAs you are expected to call the line manager to address the situation. CRAs are protected by their managers even those who don’t perform. CRMs are told to be careful with CRAs as the company is struggling with CRAs leaving the organization. 
Salary is not aligned with inflation, other companies are offering more.
The vendor (CRO) manages the sponsor.

There’s a lot of layers and stakeholders. Which makes for a conservative and risk-averse environment. That doesn’t mean that risk is intolerable — you just better have everything figured out before you move everything along with you.

It was discouraging to see great colleagues’ talent go unused and their drive to impact patients be neglected. Conversations in the labs rarely touched on scientific topics as people bided their time before the commute home, meetings focused on box-checking exercises to fulfill year-end goals, and managers closed their office doors to read the news and trade stocks.

Phony reasons why publications are pushed back (Merck' agenda for postdocs: patent first, then publish... How's that supposed to work?)
Was part of a department where the majority of employees were laid off or managed out of the company (department was eventually closed). Hence, terrible atmosphere within the department.
Basically no one in the lab to work you in or support you.
After months of work and once you have great data, supervisor takes data and runs off to the boss to present work as his/her own.
More than 90% of postdocs from my year eventually left the company.

- UNETHICAL RESEARCH PRACTICES: they hire postdocs on the promise that the postdoc research is ""pre-proprietary"", meaning postdocs can publish their work (given that this is literally called a postdoc program, basically you whether care about publishing and accept half the salary of an employee and do more work than others, or you just go for the full salary and chill at Merck when postdocs do the research and you put your name on the paper because you can), however when results are obtained they will bake all sorts of distorted and lousy justifications why they won't allow you to publish your work. In my case I developed a mathematical model for protein aggregation based on the level-set formalism, even though there is literally not a single data point involved that was proprietary to Merck (all existing in published papers) my manager blocked me from publishing it on the grounds that this model belongs to Merck! When I quit from the miserable postdoc program with this guy, he is trying to publish my model with other ""co-authors"" and without me! This is called ""Ghost-writing"" and is unethical in academic systems. Yes I had written a draft for the paper too, and that's what they are stealing by putting their names on it. 

2- Lack of computational resources: their so-called ""HPC"" cluster is composed of ~7 GPUs, remember that in computational chemistry this is what a research lab in a typical University has in it's possession. At Merck, that's all they got!

3- Lack of computational scientists: what I learned was Merck is simply filled and governed by experimentalists. A director once was saying how they don't see computational work to contribute, but just a PR gesture for the outsiders."

First line management (Directors) are more or less ineffective. They have too many direct reports, and their seldom interaction with them leads to them being out of touch and disconnected from the lab workers. This further leads to year-end reviews that honestly look like they're just guessing.

Employees who want to advance to executive levels need to work with their management to be assigned to initiatives early on to have an eventual shot at at an exec level promotion. If management does not offer such opportunities after a significant period of time (despite very positive yearly reviews) its a nuanced way of conveying that you can still have a satisfying career but not as an executive.

3. access to providers is 4x harder than it was 10 years ago, and 
4. the med-legal red tape just keeps getting deeper.

This unfortunately results in many people who have not learned new skills and seem to be unmotivated to change themselves or their workstreams, which resulted in industry best-practices not being followed. It honestly felt like people at Merck operated in a bubble that was 15 years behind in digital marketing (saying this even taking into consideration legal pharma issues).

I found it was nearly impossible to move anything forward in an environment where there is so much bureaucracy, hierarchy, politics, and sensitivity. Co-workers often seemed to justify their jobs by strangle-holding their workstreams instead of collaborating openly and without ego.

It often feels like everyone is trying as hard as possible to not do anything, but still trying to appear as if they are doing something. The feeling of obfuscation is overwhelming.

The physical building culture is also not ideal - in an era where many offices are going remote, the Merck UG campus building remains something straight out of Office Space."

1305,Merck,7 Years at Merck,2019-07-13,3.0,Senior Engineer,"A lot of opportunity -  I'm a chemical engineer in manufacturing. I've been fortunate enough to work on 5 unique processes in 7 years (both locally and internationally), and learn from some very bright people. 

Competitive salaries and  benefits, retirement retirement benefit specifically is better than competitive. The 401k would be decent on its own, and there is a pension on top of it.

Work-life balance is great in some departments

Ethical culture. Focus on serving patients (at least in manufacturing - I'm not in the rooms where they decide what we're going to charge for our products).","VERY VERY bureaucratic. Not sure why senior management thinks that the solution to every problem is  to create a new system with a complex approval process. And this bureaucratic culture is not just related to regulatory compliance (where bureaucracy is a given) . In at least one case there is a business approval process you need to follow before you are allowed to move on and then follow the compliance approval process (which includes another business approval). The bureaucracy permeates every aspect of live at Merck. 

A very conservative company. The first , second, and third instincts are to do it the way we've always done it. I don't think Merck is a place to go if you want to trail blaze. In most aspects of science and technology, Merck is 5-10 years behind. For example we just figured out monoclonal antibodies a few years ago (while everyone else was adopting them in the 90's).

Very silo-ed company. Different organizations are evaluated against very different criteria. Different departments all have their own agendas. It makes forming truly collaborative and cross functional teams difficult.

Work-life balance is not always great. I listed this as a pro too as it very's by department. I've had 4 distinct rolls at the company.  2 were predominantly low stress with roughly 40hr work weeks. The other 2 were much worse. Under 50hrs was a good week, 60+ was frequent. Pressure from management can become intense, and when projects are managed badly the first thing to get sacrificed is always the private lives and well being of those at the bottom of the org structure. The sacrifice is not always rewarded either.  

There is a bit of perverse incentive in the way the company handles it's best employees. When you are identified as an ambitions and talented employee you are usually sent off to work on projects that have fallen behind - the idea being you can ride over the hill on a white horse and save the project. The problem is that those projects usually fall behind because they have bad management and bad cultures (i.e. not because of problems one person can step in fix no matter how talented they are), or just because they're ""behind"" goals that were never realistic in the first place. Being sent off to those projects is not exactly a reward worth working hard for.

Top down decision making, thus decision makers are out of touch with the the actual consequences of their decision (a problem that I'm sure most large companies have)

Merck has the most ridiculous year end performance reviews ever. You get stacked ranked no matter how well you did. Some people had great sales numbers but poor rankings because their manager didn't like them. Overall, a lot of politics involved with the reviews.

Very heavily conservative and class focused, i.e. if you are in a certain pay grade, your engagement is expected to stay within that level, and is looked upon negatively, very negatively if you try to step out of your tier, until you have been duly knighted to speak to anyone in a leadership role.  Also, despite allowing employees community time, they are  intentional about not being visible as Merck; they support no local causes in the communities they work and serve.  Employee involvement in outside organizations is not to be shared in office, even though certain leadership members hawk Girl Scout cookies on site so that his/her team can show their appropriate support and purchase them.   They are not employee communication focused; management says what you should tell, and ask about.

Merck is new to oncology and the middle managers don't understand the complexity of oncology trials. I was assigned to so many sites and different protocols, that it was hard to keep up, even if with working 60-80  hours a week. I worried about the quality of the research, as systems were very old and the way of conducting the research was old as well. Sites I took over from other CRAs had huge data backlog. Instead of managing the sites and doing quality research, I was reviewing data from the past months and was resolving old issues. I brought this to the attention of my manager, and what bothered me the most was indifference. The supervisor of the managers had the same attitude and during the calls was more concerned about keeping the agenda than answering questions from the CRAs.

1635,Merck,Enter at your own risk- Merck Durham Site,2018-01-29,2.0,Senior Specialist,This site prides itself on empowering its employees and giving them the opportunity to participate in the process of remediating issues. The site is also good with allowing internal employees to readily transfer into different positions which allows the employee to get more work experience in different aspects of business. The company also has pretty awesome benefits but they could be a little cheaper. Working with other employees has been the best part about working at this company for me.,"Merck means Metrics is the ongoing joke at work. This company has so many metrics that are not value-added but every employee, manager, assoc. director, etc is pressured to hit. This company values hitting these metrics and getting results over the value of their employees. Many employees and managers are doing the work of two to three employees because this site run so lean and will not approve the additional headcount needed to get the job done right first time.  So most of the time you spend your time remediating issues that could have been avoided had they taking the right amount of time and had the correct amount of resources to do it right first time instead of trying to hit metrics.

1900,Merck,Avoid Procurement,2017-04-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,There are always plenty of job openings,Management starting at the CPO all the way down does not value any employee under them.  The weekly emails of coworkers resigning made accomplishing anything nearly impossible.  Because of the constant churn directors typically have less than 5 years experience which becomes very obvious.
1901,Merck,A heaven of bureaucratic corporate bs,2017-04-13,2.0,Software Developer,"If you're persistent and patient enough to go through a ton of corporate bs you can get some perks like going to a conference.
Otherwise, there are some other small benefits like a corporate mobile plan or public transport commute reimbursement, but that's about it.","Unfortunately, there are a lot of things that make this place very depressing to deal with.

Starting with the benefits - even some small things you get have a catch. Like, if you connect your phone to their network they are able to see what you do with your smartphone, what you have there and where you are at any time.

The 'free fruits in the kitchen' benefit is a joke in reality. This company makes billions and yet they provide fresh fruits only once a week, one basket of the cheapest ones (apples and bananas usually) which goes away in a matter of seconds literally. And that's it for the week.

When you get hired they're trying to lower your salary claiming that you always get bonuses at the end of the year, which basically like 100% of your month salary. In reality they give bonuses solely based on their sympathy or office backroom deals, despite the fact if your actual performance is great or not. You can be a hard worker achieving all of your goals, but still will get nothing at the end of the year. 

Salaries are not that high as well comparing to the current market salaries, they will bargain for every $50 in your paycheque, while wasting a shit-ton of money on managers' travels and other corporate bs.

It doesn't matter how hard you work, the only thing matters is how hard you socialize with your managers and make an appearance like you really care about all this corporate stuff that don't matter. There are so many managers in this company nobody needs it's ridiculous. And most of them don't even know what they're doing, most of the people don't even understand why some people are here and what are their roles. All these fancy scrum masters and such, doing nothing but empty talks about 'agile processes', while being utterly useless to the team. It's a joke.

And let me tell you about the meetings. The average amount of meetings is about 3-4 hours a day. Sometimes it's several hours straight until you're totally exhausted and have a headache, it's ridiculous. The same talks over and over again, while nothing really changes at all. Just corporate crap. 

There are lots of people in the company doing nothing. You send requests to HR, managers and so on and they never reply or reply with some useless words in a week, or confirm your request and then do the opposite of what you asked from them. It's very frustrating really. So many parasites.

And the amount of bureaucracy is ridiculous. Whatever you're trying to achieve, be sure there is a policy for it. And just to be sure that you know all of them there is a thing called e-learning with dozens of courses you have to go through every month, spending a lot of time on it. You have to go through the whole bunch of processes, requests and papers to do a simple thing. 

Considering the fact it's a pharmaceutical company treating cancer and things like that, one might think you'd get to work on some really meaningful stuff, that one can make a difference. In reality you're stuck participating in a company bureaucracy by making apps for inside use, for managers and such.  

I'm actually happy to be done with this company."

However once you looking into each of their benefits you quickly realize they have these sneaky little policies to offset them.  Take for instance they offer life insurance but it ends when you turn 65.  Than their Long term disability plan is a welfare funded plan so anything you collect on LTD you have to pay the company back entirely for the amount.  They have gotten working women awards but I have no idea how as 400 female employees have a class action lawsuit for discriminating and not paying them the same as their male peers.  Their benefits appear to be good but look into each and you will quickly find that they are some of the worst out there.  A very sneaky and unethical company.

In addition, being a manager at Merck means absolutely nothing, which is definitely not the norm - usually, going somewhere and being a manager has a certain power and responsibility with it, but at Merck it just means you're expected to work 16 hours/day, and whatever weekend you're needed, and be grateful.

Diversity in color only and not in new or innovative ideas.  Company actions does not match it's mission statement.  This is a busy-work organization that will spend millions on an idea for different process managements to then dump them in less than a year.  Promotions are usually done by ""pass the trash"", meaning the people no one wants in their organizations get promoted just to get rid of them from their department.  The results of this are having the worst quality people with the least to offer being the company ""leaders"".  I watched them fire their best and most productive people year after year.  If you had high sales achievement, you could bet you would be the next person fired...I mean only if you were not a protected class. Protected class=unethical actions allowed, but I guess that's true in all companies.  It got to the point at Merck if you were still employed there it meant you were incompetent.

Flexible schedule for unexpected life events (depending on your supervisor).  Mine is good.
Job Security.  Plenty of work and more coming.  Seems to be very stable right now (2016).
Very good group of worker is the Quality Department.  Good people.
New department leadership that seem to have things moving in the right direction.
Positive outlook on future opportunities and movement within Merck-Wilson.  Not right now though.
The year end bonus is very consistent as long as you don't get in the bottom range of the peers for the year end review.  You know what you will get for the most part.","At this time, there is not a lot of opportunity for advancement within Merck-Wilson.  It's looking better but not there.  Often management will hire from outside when there are capable and qualified internal candidates.

Medical benefits have taken a huge decline over the last 2 years.  The employee cost continues to rise as well as deductibles while the benefits and coverage are much less.

Prescription drug coverage also have declined over the past several years.  Same as above.

Year end raises are typically around 2% at best for employee that meet expectations.  Some will get up to 4.5% if they are top performers but that is a very few number of people.

The year end bonus is consistent as stated above, but even if you have a very good year the individual contributor effect on the bonus is small.  Meaning that you will receive the close to your median bonus no matter how you perform.  Unless you are a top performer.  That seems to make a substantial difference.  Note that top performers are very few.

The end of year review is on a bell curve.  Meaning that if there are 2 top performers in your level, then there have to be 2 bottom performers (even if the 2 put in the bottom did a good job).  This makes no sense to me and demoralizes the workforce to a point.

In the past, Merck wanted to be head and shoulders above the other companies in the area as far as pay and benefits.  Now they seem happy with status quo and have reduced benefits and target salaries to be in the 50th percentile.   

There is a tremendous workload for the number of employees in the Quality department.  It is often very difficult to get it all done in a day or work week.  This could be looked at as job security or not..  Note that this has gotten better over the last year.

Addition to above note.  Note that many of the employees are salaried and work unpaid overtime to get the work complete.  Note that this is still an issue but it has also gotten much better.  Two years ago it was out of hand."

I received the middle grade in the bonuses which is fine, but the fact that my reviews were not from a wide variety of people is pathetic.

2516,Merck,So Much Potential...,2015-08-17,1.0,Quality Specialist,"Merck is such a massive beast of a company with many brilliant minds. They offer competitive pay, but recently that comes with a price. The folk at the West  Point site characteristics range, but most are very professional even within the union. If you are at the manager-director level there are many areas for career advancement/lateral movement.","As I mentioned Merck is a massive beast, when it comes to communication or changes you are met with stubborn heads. There is a direct disconnection between what occurs on the shop floor and the directing level (some areas managerial level). Unless there is a FDA or a post inspection observation, there is a low change of change being implemented; and if it is implemented it's a painfully long poorly communicated process. 
Due to lay offs the work environment has become pretty aggressive within the past 2-3 years. 
Not much opportunity for forward career growth
Most Worker come in, do their time and leave; very little unity or outside work inclusion. I've been told, in the past this was very different. People would be so close to their coworkers they'd be at each others weddings. 
When I first started at Merck, the work flexibility was second to none. When it snowed my manager would recommend to work from home. Only one year later that changed dramatically, as I was so overwhelmed with work, I would miss family events, planned events on late week days, and even Dr appointments purposely scheduled very late in the day. If you have no children and are just breaking into the biotech world this is great place to gain experience, skills and networking."

I worked at a small site where there was much innovative science and collaboration.,Continual re-organization and lay-offs prevent innovative work from being done.

It is not clear how Merck intends to generate a healthy product pipeline with such erratic decision making over the last 7 years.  The talent pool has been gutted through layoffs and brain drain (voluntary separations), processes were compromised through outsourcing to unproven CROs and decisions on feeding projects into pre-clinical research space have been stifled by the over-abundance of caution.  In such risk-averse corporate culture, Merck would be well served to keep selling Coppertone as they are incapable of long-term commitment to investing in bringing new drugs on the market.  Ironically, Merck divested themselves of the consumer products division, reportedly just to get some cash flow.  Bad outlook."

2919,Merck,Low morale and unpredictable work environment,2014-09-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Flexible work arrangements including telecommuting options.,"The culture does not inspire morale nor loyalty. Example, the performance evaluation program (determines next year's pay increases and bonuses) would be comparable to gladiators in a ring. Whoever is left standing is the victor.  Those who are perceived to have the most value are rewarded according to a differentiation scale which managers/directors have to battle it out in a differentiation meeting. Example 25% of employees will be received high rating, 50% receive average, and 25% receive low rating.  Employees could be rated in the lowest 5-10% performance category even though they met all their performance goals and objectives because there is a limited number of positions available to fit in the higher categories.  

The company conducts annual employee surveys where the employees give their opinion and feed back on management, their perception of the company, how they feel about their work environment etc.  The final overall company rating is linked to employee compensation.  Basically, if employees give a 75% rating then they get 75% of the target bonus. If the rating is 25%, then they get 25% of their target bonus. The better rating you give, the more of the target bonus is given. The worse the rating, the less the target bonus is given. 

Unprofessional behavior by some managers and directors such as belittling and yelling at their subordinates in front of other colleagues is looked over. This is largely due that there is no longer a visible HR presence. In past years, HR was a building away. Now, you have to call a toll free number to reach a benefit service center to discuss HR matters.  The other pathway is to express your concerns about your management thru 360 feedback on your management.  It does not appear to lead to resolution but only more resentment/passive aggressive retaliation when the manager or director reads the feedback."

The mission is one about the patients. The company may be heading in a good direction.

The 401K match is a nice perk, though there are better matches at other pharma companies. Tuition reimbursement, while not as good as it once was, is still available.","The leadership in this company is virtually non-existent. Merck strives to push their leadership behaviors, though the company consists of lackluster managers rather than actual leaders. Low-level managers (As. Director/ Director) demonstrate a facade to their management to try and assert their 'worth', yet, do not produce positive results.

Morale is incredibly low due to the poor leadership and the restructuring process. Merck is doing nothing to try and keep high performers. Members of high performing teams are not recognized because those who are favored by management are given the credit and promoted without a second thought. 

Promotions were said to be on 'hold', yet, those who have managers willing to fight for them are compensated fairly. Managers are very blatant about blocking you from moving onto other jobs within the company. These are the same managers that breech confidentiality without a blink of an eye.

Merck is putting all of their eggs in two baskets with a couple late phase drugs. Even with a successful launch of both, the outlook for this company isn't good. Do we really think morale will turnaround and Merck will compensate their employees fairly once they start making their money back? Good luck everyone."

Now you will meet your friends for life there, and you will meet some of the most horrible human being alive there. This is your typical corporate America, where they hire in numbers and layoffs in numbers. in recent years there have been many layoffs, and there are always high turn over rates. When I was there, my department could not keep people long enough. We were always training new people, ALWAYS. We were under staffed and there were plenty of over time. Now due to cut backs, my old co-workers tell me that they are still understaffed but over worked on their shift, overtime has been cut, and so has supervisors.
It was hard to move around to new jobs and opportunities. Some of the smartest people that I knew never got promoted or change roles because of job freezes and blocking movements. I hated every day that I was there during my last 2 years. I hated my department management because they hired pretty much baby-sitters who knew nothing about the process, my associate director got his job because he was buddies (boys club) with the other guys running the show in Rota, I hated the union group there because I was always peered pressure to never complain to HR about how other union employees with more seniority was treating me. One incident, a more senior employee said during shift change that I it does not matter if I'm pregnant, I am getting paid so I should be lifting heavy cans just like her. It's not her fault that I'm pregnant and that I shouldn't be treated with special treatment. I reported it to HR as a harassment. The next day, several union along with the shop Stewart told me to re-track my claim or else the next time i need the union to back me, I will be on my own.
Since I was low seniority at one point, I was drafted to work double shift. there were many times when I raised the issue that I it's not safe to let me know at least a shift ahead of mine that I have to work a double. The resolution was to under staff the shift. My friend, after being drafted to work double shifts every day from 3 month (like 7 days a week for 12 weeks) was so tired, she fell asleep in the break room and got discipline for that. I couldn't stay one day because there was no one to take care of my kids at home. When I came in the next day I was disciplined for leaving. 
There is a well define line about how the union and company people were treated. Company employees got support for health and medical life. Union employees were told to go home without pay or take a vacation day if they can't work. Several times management would bring us their left overs to eat."
2974,Merck,Too Many Good People Quit or are Walked Out.,2014-08-13,3.0,Manufacturing Supervisor/Facilitator,Enjoyed the feeling that I was part of such an important process (Pediatric Vaccines Production).,"Back-stabbing constant, too much focus on LGBT safety (we are professionals, your personal sexual preference has no place being discussed at work) with ""safe zones"" marked by green triangle with pink circle stickers...  Diversity is a wonderful thing, now let's get over making such a big deal of it and do our job.  
Locked in Supervisor position with no advancement for multiple years, all while being a highly rated, dependable and competent Supervisor.  trained ""new"" Supervisors that were given higher salary and better title, all while I was given a low performance rating (and new hires you are training are rated at the top tier of the same scale I was rated against)...  In 6 years, went through three Area Heads, (this in itself kept most in our department from getting promoted), while competing and stable positioned Area Head lead departments within our same building had promoted most of their staff over the same period.  Third Area Head was my undoing...  He hired replacement supervisors on all shifts that we (supervisors that were stuck in this department during a job freeze over three years) spent time training, while being told by one of them (a bratty silver spoon kid fresh out of college with an attitude) that the new Area Heads' goal is to have only one supervisor per shift (In a department that filled over a billion dollars of marketable product per year)...  My comment with this severe overworked and understaffed ethic was that I just hope I am not the ""lucky one"" left.  Saw many good Supervisors quit or were let go after being overworked to the point of making a crucial mistake...  In which as a Supervisor, there is no mercy from above.  On the contrary, if you are a union employee, there is a culture of forgiveness, even after multiple gross acts of negligence."

I am thrilled to be gone.  Competitive, back stabbing colleagues is common place and almost encouraged by the management.    It is their policy to use a bell shaped curve to distribute salary.  After layoffs of the non-performers, the only thing left was the cream of the crop.  However, they are still forced into a bell shaped curve.

Inclusion efforts are always overshodowed by the underlying and overbearing need to accomplish results at any cost. Many people have been overworked and enundated with tasks beyond their job descriptions in the effort to do more with less. 

Merck is not in its ""golden age"" right now, but I believe that in the coming years they will cycle back around to being a company that people are excited to work for again.

The CEO is a great guy from what I can tell in a few brief presentations, but there are numerous challenges to the company.  If you're a female or a minority this is the place for you - they aggressively hire and try to promote minorities and females (on the other hand, if you're a white male competing against a minority female for a job and she's qualified you won't have a chance of winning the promotion).","After being named a top place to work in the 1990s with well-respected management Merck & Co., Inc. has gradually descended to consistently producing mediocre financial results with seemingly never-ending mass layoffs - while also being shackled by one legal issue after another.  People in this industry love litigation, so everything about this industry involves awareness of countless state and federal laws.  Along with the lackluster financial results, the corporate culture has taken a beating.  Unfortunately, it's become a routine expectation for a wave of layoffs to occur every 18-24 months which impairs employee loyalty.  Consequently, I'd estimate at least 50% of employees are looking around for other opportunities.  I'd only consider working at Merck if you're absolutely passionate about a particular job opportunity here or just want ""Merck"" on your resume.  Bear in mind it's a tenuous employment situation at this company probably for at least the next 2-3 years and you could be let go any given November in a layoff for no particular reason."

There was a lot of trust built in, in that regard - it's likely there were some who took advantage of that, but for the most part employees respect and honor that, and let their performance and contributions speak for them. 

I loved my coworkers - they made the often late nights, early mornings, and weekends very enjoyable. Looking back, I can truly say that Merck hired the best and brightest. Top talent in the industry. 

Being as mature as it is, Merck has well-developed processes that are (for the most part) logical, clearly defined, and well-controlled.","Pay did not match the hours, responsibilities, or, most importantly, contributions. ""Rigid"" pay scales, with huge ($40k) ranges, meant that someone who fulfilled the requirements of their job was getting paid the same amount, and if they had a couple more years experience, significantly more, than a younger colleague of the same level who consistently went above and beyond their duties and responsibilities. 

Advancement - stagnant for years on end. You will take on more responsilibities, which are phrased to you to make them sound like an honor or a privilege, but in reality management is slowly just transforming you into doing the work of 4 people for the price of 1. 

In the nearly 4 years I was there, I saw 3 reorganizations and had 3 different bosses, and saw numerous layoffs. Culture steadily become more high-stress, anxiety-driven, as a result."

- Some Directors have favorites and they do not see the potential in people. They have to start thinking about people as potential contributors to the company at different levels and not just their group of 6-10 employees.
- It is very difficult, if not impossible to move up in the company without a PhD. People have been in the same roles for 8 years.

Good compensation
Great use of social media to share technical and business practice information, which  improves morale and connectivity between isolated groups across sites, states, the world. 
Has many employees who like an intellectual challenge and desire to support the mission of improving human health, (although there are many who like paychecks and supporting their large suburban mini-mansion mortgages more).
Access to online resources for personal development.","Emotionally charged, competitive environment. Especially in 2013 and going into 2014, this is a sad, stressful place. How to manage the bitterness if hard times keep coming. Keeping an eye on the opportunity of 'a new Merck' will be your only carrot unless you have that rare excellent manager who is able to both handle his/her 1,000 responsibilities AND be a superhero mentor and coach.  Lower level staff are more commonly competitive among each other instead of supportive.
The thinning of management levels and reduction of support organizations led to a lot of stress, and likely not any improvement in efficiency/productivity. Poorly executed third party outsourcing with people unskilled in the continuous management of the newly developed business processes that were put in place once the initiation project team disappeared. 
Merck is (though shrinking) such a large organization. Its nearly impossible to steer the ship. So many fragmentation of lines of responsibility. There is a well planned process for moving a molecule from research/discovery through development and commercialization. All other interfaces and business processes in support of this primary process remain ad hoc, poorly developed, having been subject to too many changes over the years and not well respected or understood by those who identify themselves to be directly in the process of 'supporting the pipeline'. Still waiting on C-levels to understand this. 
 In the West Point and possibly New Jersey sites, some longterm (15 years+) employees cant be brought to stop mourning the 'good old days.' They demonstrate this with great love of their old bureaucratic ways and resistance to any improvement. I get it that there has been great change, and that regulated groups in particular need to have some rigidity in their processes to ensure compliance. However, an attitude of being closed minded to gathering and addressing staff/partner group pain-points and answering proposals with ""well, back in 1980...""  is completely insufferable, and was entirely too common even in early 2013. I wonder if Merck's big employee cuts 2013-2014 has addressed this. 

Too many poorly educated, uncertified quality (regulatory) and safety staff.
Bad rewards and competition program completely out of alignment with what is needed to support collaboration, courage, and candor."

People rotate brands every few years or so - Associate Product Managers rotate every 12-18months, Product Managers and higher rotate less frequently. 

Lots of opportunities to take ownership of your brand early on. Nice work environment. Fun people. Great benefits (free merck prescription drugs), profit sharing, bonuses. Free product in product closets. On-site gym with low membership costs.","The brands are big and well-funded, but there aren't many of them and they aren't particularly diverse. 

A lot of the brands are regulated by the FDA because they are used to treat different things (allergies, fungus, warts, foot pain etc). 

Navigating the legal review process (for marketing assets) at Merck has to be one of the most frustrating things that i've ever dealt with in life. The legal review team is much smaller than it needs to be and some of the people on the team are not as good at their jobs as they need to be. Very frustrating - especially when you're working with time sensitive projects (need to get coupon out the door yesterday, legal review team is booked solid for the next 3 weeks).

Promotion from Associate to full Product Manager takes longer than it does at other CPGs. Expect to be an APM for 3 years before getting promoted. Some people get promoted faster, but as promotions are a function of business need and not entitlements for a job well done, you're gonna wait. 

Saw a few people get blindsided by negative feedback and let go. That sucked. These were nice people who worked hard, not slackers. Seems like some people got the short end of the political stick. Don't assume that everything is going well just because they appear to be. Ask for feedback on an ongoing basis.

The Consumer Care/OTC division of merck is very small when compared with other parts of the business. This doesn't mean that Merck doesn't invest in the consumer division, but it means that other parts of the business are much larger and they make a much larger contribution to the bottom line. When it comes to Merck making investments for growth, Consumer Care won't get as much attention as the Rx business.

Summit is not easily accessible by mass transit if you want to live in NYC. There is a shuttle that leaves from Newark and goes to Summit - a good number of people take this.

Driving to NJ by car in the morning isn't that bad, driving back to NYC in the afternoon/evening can be very frustrating because of the unpredictability of the traffic (sometimes terrible, sometimes really terrible)."

It was made very obvious that the sales force was meant to stay in the field, and it is extremely difficult to advance out of the field.  Any aspiration to move into corporate is akin to climbing Everest.  

I can honestly say that I was expected to be in the field (calling on doctors) from 8:30-5:00 with no lunch hour (and that usually went through to dinner if that was when I could see the doctor in his office) and then come home to do an hour and a half of work--at the very least.  I was expected to do work on the weekends as well.  Much of this could be attributed to my manager, but this was the culture of the company at the time.  I pulled 60-70 hour weeks (working time) all the time and was physically exhausted.  We went to work in the snow, ice, hurricanes, you name it-it didn't matter if the ""schools were closed.""

2.  Prevailing stated attitude that every employee is ""responsible for their own career"" and then have to run things by management just to POST for a job.
3.  Old technology - very old
4.  Management is protected like they are infallible.  Many of the managers are misplaced and only swallow the corporate jargon.  They are maintainers not innovators or even motivators. 
5.  Communication is weak.  Management claims transparency and then lays off entire departments.  Needs to improve. 
6.  Culture of reprisal.  Merck claims to encourage, ""Courage and Candor,"" but employees are told on a regular basis that how they communicate is disfavored.  Only serves to have a chilling effect on ""courage and candor.""
7.  Learn that quality of work and performance reviews is not how to get ahead EARLY.  Get plugged in, have lunch with many different people, have many different mentors, if permitted get on as many different projects as you can.  Being intelligent, hard-working, and ambitious is not enough.  You also must be best-friends with hiring managers to advance."

The culture in the Charlotte, NC Shared Business Services location is young, hip and generally fun. The location on Microsoft Campus comes with perks such as access to free Coca-Cola products and a cafeteria.","Working at a large company such as Merck comes with the risks of dealing with corporate politics. I learned very quickly that it's WHO you know that gets you places, and even that doesn't always help. Some managers were slimy and only looked out for their best interests, while smiling in your face. It is also very difficult to be hired at Merck unless you come in as a contractor, at least in the Charlotte, NC location. It can take a minimum of 1 year as a contractor to be hired permanently.

since the site i work at is not in the US or Europe, and there's relatively few large employers here, this is one of the few big fish in a rather desolate sea.

Safety is a big priortiy, and everyone's safety concious","-Corperate strategies rarely make it to the 'shop floor' and if they do, they don't have buy in from middle management, creating haphazard at best initaves that are doomed to fail.

-Lack of transparancy in pay reviews and obvious favortism to others, getting double diget increases for gound level work, because they've been given the opportunity to 'expand' within thier roles, while others not only are just forgotten, but are 'squeezed' call it efficency drives but trying to get more from staff without investing more resoucres, ie time/support from other teams upstream/downstream- it is IMPOSSIBLE to achive 'at standard' when the bar is already set higher for you than others, let alone 'excellence'  

-High staff turn over rate, especially those that aren't 'trapped' by morgages or are highly mobile staff.

-Poor staff moral accross the site. The majority of people are downtrodden, and are ground down like the nib of a pencil that you are still trying to use-depite it being too small. Forget about the employee engagement survey the results of the higher corperates iniatives don't reach the ground floor

-Little cross team on the job training - There are limited opportunties to learn new skills.

Site head of quality operations stood in a cross-functional meeting and announced that he doesn't care how many 483s the company gets, as long as they save money.
