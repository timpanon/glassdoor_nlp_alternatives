3,Modsy,Flexible,2022-03-15,5.0,Remote Designer,It is an awesome job! I am a mom and this job gives me the flexibility of being a mom while still following my passion and career in design. I love that I don't have to do the same design style over and over again... one day I'm doing mid century modern next a boho chic. I love having the ability of pushing myself as a designer while helping others.,If you don't take criticism well or are open to becoming a better designer and person it may not be the job for you. You must be open to working on your weaknesses.
4,Modsy,Dream Job,2022-03-14,5.0,Designer,"Obviously, working from home and all that entails: no traffic, no gas usage, don’t have to leave my pets alone, etc. Modsy is great with their training, their communication, their metrics are fair and necessary for quality of work, I get to do what I love and get paid for it, great bonuses for efficiency, awesome Customer Service. They say that if you do what you love you’ll never work a day in your life and I’m living it! Modsy runs a tight ship and you have to be motivated and dedicated. I love it!","Learning takes effort, but if I can do it anyone can. You just need to be organized."
5,Modsy,Worst employer ever!,2022-03-14,1.0,Design Specialist,Work from home. There really are none.,Modsy is fast food interior design. There are too many platforms to learn in the 2 week training before being thrown into working with clients. Modsy requires employees to deceive clients into believing the first 2 design options created for a room was done by their dedicated Design Specialist (DS) but they actually are done by an initial designer and they are usually not to the client’s liking. Then additional design revisions can be handed off to another DS but emails to the client indicate that all along it’s the same person. The designs whipped out (because of stress to do 20 designs a day) are terrible. As a DS I wrote more emails than designing since that is what the company looks at to determine productivity. As well as how much furniture is sold and no client wanted to order a sofa or chair they hadn’t seen or sat in. It truly was the worst job ever!
6,Modsy,Awesome company!,2022-03-08,5.0,Interior Designer,"I like everything about Modsy! Their designs, brands, and employees.",No con's just tedious work!
7,Modsy,Terrible Company,2022-02-15,1.0,Interior Designer,Only pro is the ability to work from home...but you can find that all over the place now.,"You are hired as independent contractors and receive zero benefits. 
They changed their payment structure for the third time in a year. Each restructure gets worse. Now you only get paid for initial designs, any additional work you do is unpaid and unable to be billed for. Seems illegal.
Your weekly ""goals"" or items you have to hit each week are fairly difficult and require a lot of additional time. You can be fired at any moment for not reaching these weekly goals.

Constant pressure to push Modsy furniture. 

I could go on and on with how bad this company has gotten. In a company wide meeting all designers were accused of rigging the system and stealing money from Modsy. That's when I had enough."

16,Modsy,"Modsy This, Modsy That",2022-01-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. I love how flexible Modsy is. Especially if you’re just starting out as a designer and you’re not sure where you want to live or what area of design you want to work on. Designing can be done anywhere with Modsy.
2. There’s such an array of design styles you encounter weekly, so you have a chance to really find your niche, your favorite, your thing. 
3. Even though it’s a remote company, you still have access to your coworkers, so there’s never a shortage of inspiration, learning, or idea-sharing.
4. I love how inclusive and diverse Modsy is. And trust me, I look at the “Our Team” pages on design firm websites all the time and they usually all look the same, so disappointing. So I absolutely LOVE that Modsy appreciates and strives for different perspectives.
5. Your hard work doesn’t go unnoticed. Yes, there’s a base pay and some may not think it’s that great, but you do make bonuses based on what your clients purchase. Plus there’s career advancement. Supervisors, and your peers, see how hard you work, they see your style and your skill, and they let you know, and vice versa. And there are Luxe-Flex, Luxe, Renovation, and Real Estate teams you can move into.
6. There’s always training.","1. There’s always training. As soon as you get comfortable with something, it changes and you have to learn how to do it differently. I get it, they’re trying to streamline and find what works best, but at the same time, it really hurts the designers that have developed a groove and a system for doing things, and then we have to adjust to something that didn’t need to be changed to begin with.
2. It can sometimes feel hard to express your thoughts or desire for something to change to make it easier on us. I’ve noticed that when I used to try and explain something that was problematic, I would get these responses that seemed like they just regurgitated it from a pre-made FAQ sheet. Very annoying, so I stopped speaking up. 
3. Modsy is very fast-paced. It can be overwhelming sometimes, especially at the beginning. And for me, someone that overthinks and likes to really put thought and personalization into a design, it got frustrating…quickly. Things became overdue before I even touched them and when I tried to mention it or get help…refer to Con #2. It sometimes felt like I was on a hamster wheel. 
4. Customer ratings. But that’s more of a people error. Some people are just jerks and will only comment/rate something they didn’t like. Mind you, they receive two designs, but if they only negatively rate the one they didn’t like and not the one that they did like, you look like a bad designer, and that can hurt your feelings if you’re on the sensitive side, like myself."

- The growing frequency of sudden exits from long-term employees.
- Processes and guidelines change frequently, but communication and documentation does not keep pace.
- Pay tends to be on the lower end versus comparable positions at other companies.
- Overall feeling of startup instability"
21,Modsy,Start Up Culture,2021-11-30,1.0,Design Specialist,Being remote was amazing. So heart-centered on the outside.,"Never seen so much hiring and firing so fast! This doesnt fit with the BS-ey ""culture"""
22,Modsy,Had high hopes that were crushed,2021-11-29,3.0,Design Specialist,Remote work / my team was super dynamic and supportive,"The company is not for the customer experience or the creativity of the designer. Design quality is bad and they only care about turning extremely average designs around as quickly as possible to make a quick buck. Processes/programs always changing, which is fine, but it also meant that the expectations of the designers changed DAILY."
23,Modsy,Great for young professionals who want to gain a lot of experience,2021-11-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Modsy is a true start up in the sense that things move quickly and it's all hands on deck. In my experience, this is great for people just starting out in their careers as you can get a lot of experience and work on projects that you might not be able to at other more established companies. Great for people who want to learn a lot fast but you have to be ok with a bit of a grind and moving quickly.","Just as you have the opportunity to work on a lot of new things, those things will stick with you through your career at Modsy. I've been there multiple years and am still responsible for some of the things I was doing early on because there's no one else to give them too.

Also, in order to advance you pretty much have to become a manager, so if people managing isn't for you that could be frustrating."
24,Modsy,"Pass on this place, avoid the trauma",2021-11-22,1.0,Designer,"Current employees: Reach out to your most recent co worker, we're organizing to make things better! Modsy is the DEFINITION of TOXIC WORKPLACE. Everyone I know who has worked there has some horror story about leadership or their pay being messed up. This company will literally steal from you, will never pay fairly and doesn't care if there are harmful things happening in the workplace. They're trying to be some scammy chain design service but they are nasty people that just want to make money off the hard work of good people and lie until you catch on.","Leadership lies frequently

They have NO interest in you as a human being

They are looking for the most guillable people to exploit"
25,Modsy,Meh,2021-11-16,2.0,Designer,Position is Remote and easy assistance,Too much work and poor management
26,Modsy,Not all its cracked up to be.  Fast food of interior design.,2021-11-08,2.0,Designer,The program they utilize is great and cutting edge. Diverse staff.,"The training is tedious and exhausting. If they hired actual professionals instead of stay at home moms who like to decorate they wouldn't have to spend so much time on explaining to their ""designers"" what a floor plan is. Its techincally still a start up so its understandable that they are still working out the kinks, however they amount of work they keep adding and expecting you to complete is outrageous. They use a points system to qualify your hours. If you don't meet the points you can't log the hours regardless of if you worked all week. You spend 24/7 working just to make ends meet. The output expectation is insane. They want you to spend 45 mins on a design and expect it to get 5 stars from customers. But when you've literally spent LESS THAN AN HOUR on a job there is no thought put into that. I've seen and been reassigned customers from other designers and there are designs going out that I would be EMBARRASSED to send. There is no vetting of who they hire. There is a clear line where some have at least some actual design experience and others who have absolutely no clue what they're doing but they're logging the points. They can get away with it because the renderings are ""pretty"" but when you start to really look at some of the spaces they're pretty bad. The program is great and is amazing but learning it, it is a skill you will never use outside of Modsy. Its honestly a waste for any one who wants to pursue a real career in design. The ""skills"" learned here are not practical or useful in real world scenarios. They micro manage everything you do, every message you send and every phone call you take. Every time they roll out a new update its listed as a ""time saving"" update and they expect you to take less time to create a well thought out design. Its honestly unsustainable and the turnover must be insane. But everyone is contracted so its probably no sweat off their backs. Also they have this star rating system where customer can rate their designs to ""give you an idea of how you're doing"" when in truth its a means to eliminate the people who perhaps didn't quite get the design right. You get customers who abuse this not knowing that it affects your ""score"" as a ""designer"". Then you have people who love their designs and don't rate at all. Its flawed. Everything is ratings and numbers based."
27,Modsy,Great company,2021-10-31,4.0,Interior Designer,"The software is incredible - it creates such realistic renders of the clients space. The team is amazing - with channels of support and help when you need it. There’s a lot of changes happening as the company is still young, but I enjoy they’re always continuing to grow and improve.",When comparing pay to some job titles it’s a little sad. $17 an hour plus very little commission and no benefits. I feel my work and reviews should earn me a lot more.

29,Modsy,Flexibility; Self-Management is KEY,2021-09-22,4.0,Remote Interior Stylist,"Flexible times and ability to work from home, even outside of pandemic this was true. I feel like I play the SIMs and get paid, designing client homes. Use Slack to connect. You get beautiful renders for your portfolio.","Sometimes feels like micromanagement, since they can't see you working you have to supply a lot of documentation but if you do this yourself and supply ahead of time it doesn't feel so bad. The availability to move around in the company is cool too, but feels really hard to move from one group to another, again since everything is so isolated. The render system/program they use is not used by anyone else, therefore it doesn't help you become better at universal programs so you can't apply outside of the company with years of experience in a certain program."
30,Modsy,Fast paced,2021-09-05,3.0,Stylist,Make your own hours. Flexible. Nice people to work with.,Super fast paced. I felt like I needed to just get the rooms done instead of putting in my actually eye for design. Always changing

In my experience management is very helpful and willing to do what they can to help you succeed. It has been a great work from home job with flexible hours. I have been with the company for three years, starting out as an independent contractor and I recently got promoted to a full time employee. I never thought I would make a career here, but it has been a great experience! The pay could be a bit better, but the great employee benefits help make up for it.","Sometimes the workload is a bit much, but it’s manageable.

35,Modsy,You'll get out what you put in...,2021-07-27,5.0,Designer,"I started at Modsy as a career pivot from a related profession to pursue my dreams of being an interior designer. What began as a part-time remote position (which was absolutely perfect with having small children at home) kept growing for me into a series of promotions and raises. Hundreds of designs in at this point, and I feel so confident in the skillset and knowledge I've acquired from my time with Modsy. 

The ability to make a positive change in someone's surroundings and see their vision through - to the ultimate goal of making Modsy Magic - is a sense of fulfillment that is not lost on me. 

It took some time and sweat equity at the start, but if you work hard and are passionate about the company's mission, then you will certainly go far!","The workload can be intense at times, and pay/ PTO accrual could be better."

Excellent coworkers! Everyone is so much fun to work with, even the leads.

As this is a start-up, things are always being updated so you need to be able to adjust to new changes but if you can it's great to work for!","Very few opportunities for other positions if you don't live in a W2 state.

Upper management who don't work on designs or with customers seems to decide what's the proper compensation for the work we do. The upper management only works with algorithms and ""ideal"" customers unaware that the actual humans we work with don't act as they expect so it takes longer."

You will be confronted with nuanced and novel challenges every day, which makes the job exciting. 
Senior leadership at Modsy tends to be more experienced and structured than at other startups I have worked with or consulted for. 
The company has a culture of being open to unusual career trajectories and some of our most successful people started in very different roles. Regardless of in which role you start, if you perform well you can develop into a whatever profile best suits you.
Modsy's culture is very supportive and probably a little less aggressive and more measured than most successful startups. Though work is intense, you can carve out good work life balance and this is generally respected.","You need to be up for the startup rollercoaster ride.

47,Modsy,Not for you if you want time to work on designs.,2021-04-28,1.0,Remote Designer,"remote, creative freedom (to an extend, depends on client)","-Not enough time to do our jobs! 
-Designers are expected to complete 2 designs, with renderings, and a little note in under 1.5 hours. only 30 mins for revisions. 
-You will get penalized if you go over that. It just isn't reasonable if you want to do a good job (or respect the field and yourself as a designer). 
-EVERYTHING is monitored, so there is CONSTANT micromanaging. 
-They do not care about the actual designs. Just how many clients you go through in a week. 
-THEY DO NOT PAY YOU FOR TRAINING if you don't stay within the unreasonable 1.5 hour limit for work. (8 full days of training, mind you. then 4 WEEKS of a probationary period where they make you change the angle of pillows multiple times instead of giving actual design feedback.) 
-They will hire anyone, train you, but if you don't meet the unrealistic standards it is shown - publicly. They show performance ratings weekly to everyone. 
-I started full time and went part time, but was expected to complete the same amount of work with half as much time. 

If you are a designer, do not work here if you want to use your mind in any kind of creative way. 

Only work here if you are okay with shutting your brain off, using their 3D program which in theory is great, but is designed to have you select from a small group of items. I can't spend time looking for specific furniture that I want. It has to be under specific categories - which are also confusing. Clients understand ""rustic"". They don't need to know if they are: rustic warmth, rustic traveller, industrial rustic, modern rustic...etc. It confuses them, and limits products we can select. 

Clients also have too much freedom . The flat rate price is soooooo low. and designers are paid ONLY $17 with NO benefits. But a client is allowed to get as many revisions as they like (i've seen some with 30+ designers...) 

I personally, was. very excited to have a job that gave me some creative freedom and flexibility. I enjoyed my time with clients, but the actual work process was anxiety inducing and quite irritating. How many times can I adjust the angle of pillows on a sofa!! people DO NOT notice that! (they will literally check the angle degrees) Instead, it messed with my mental health and general wellbeing."
48,Modsy,Low pay and no job security,2021-04-26,1.0,Interior Designer,Nothing I can think of.,"1. Their job advertisements make it look like you can charge hourly but that is misleading. You get paid $51 for a project which includes video call with customer, emails, unlimited messaging and two sets of layouts and two designs. People will go around their entire room during video calls and have a long list of things they want you to do. Customers need to understand that for $50 a pop that the designer is getting paid, an instagram worthy space is not happening.
2) Commission is really low, if you get paid at all. 0.5% or 0.7% for their own line of products. That is seriously underpaying designers given their profit margin for their own products.
3) They overhire and then fire. There is no job security. Every few months they find new ways to cut designer pay and make timelines by which you need to hand in work shorter. It is very demotivating to work here and you constantly feel taken advantage of."

The transparency and open communication have grown over the last year, and the innovation and creativity of the team is unmatched.","There is room to grow in the way that we look at total compensation, although the benefits package is generous. We work hard and there is always a lot to do, so its important that each employee knows they are valued."

Reality is it's the complete opposite. Rooms take forever (if you care about your job and want to produce quality work) and you end up making no money. Plus, the founder/owner and all her immediate team members in management are HORRIBLE people. You'll be sorry if you work here, I'm telling you. Don't do it."

65,Modsy,Your degree means nothing here.,2021-01-02,2.0,Stylist,"work from home position, great power points available to learn the job quickly","I worked for Modsy for a year and when I began it was like a dream job because it was super flexible and the pay per room felt worth it. About 4 months in, constant changes started happening. They had us sign 3 different contracts in less than a years time and each contract demanded more work load, less flexibility, and way less pay. Management would hold online zoom meetings prior to these drastic contract changes ,but would literally ignore the concerns and questions of everyone in the chat. 

In my last month there, this position went from working whatever schedule I wanted with a requirement of 15 minimum hours a week to a pay cut of $10 per room and a minimum of 30 hours per week. 

Because of the large pay cut, management starting hosting zoom meetings to learn how to ""design faster."" They suggested things like copying rooms (piece by piece) off Pinterest. They suggested not thinking about your designs, just selecting whatever and fast. I started feeling like a robot who tried to whip up styled rooms as fast as I could get a decent pay. This was insulting to someone who has a degree in interior design because this is not true design."

73,Modsy,Amazing Company!,2020-09-25,5.0,Designer,"I've worked at Modsy for almost a year now and I love it. I love the work that I do for our clients and the amazing software Modsy has created for us to do that work. I love that it's a company that cares for their customers, but also cares for their employees. Our CEO booked time with each and every one of us to hear how we're doing and to see how Modsy can improve. I've never heard of a CEO do such a thing. 

It is still a start up, and start up life is always changing and transitioning which I also enjoy. I love that if they see a process or software could be better, they improve it. They're always looking for ways to be better, and I appreciate that. 

I truly feel blessed to work here! I do work that I enjoy, have the best co workers, work for an amazing company, and do this all from the comfort of my home. For me, it doesn't get better than that.","Some may view the constant changes as a con. We can do one thing one way for 2 months, and then it's changed to something different the next month, and then changed again. I personally don't mind it because I know they're changing things to create better systems for us and our customers. The only way we can improve is by making changes and adjustments. So it may be considered a con to some, but it's a necessary con that eventually leads to a pro."
74,Modsy,Great place to work if you're a self-starter who wants room to grow,2020-09-22,5.0,Manager,"Work with beautiful images. This company is all about interior design, so the projects you work on are based in amazing visuals. It's really fun to get to be so creative at work.

Room to grow. Modsy is a great place for people who love a challenge. Because the company is so young there's space for entry-level employees to move up the ranks and take on opportunities you likely wouldn't be able to at more established companies.

Great remote culture. Modsy's always had a good remote employee culture, but now with COVID and the whole company going remote it has gotten even better. You really feel like you know the people you're working with and everyone cares so mcuh.","The company makes a lot of changes that can be difficult to keep up with. These changes aren't always communicated by the leadership team in the best way, so I've often found myself in stressful situations making updates quickly that feel like they could have been avoided if people communicated better.

Product runs the show. It can be difficult working on another team here because the product team tends to drive the growth and holds the keys on a lot of initiatives."
75,Modsy,Amazing learning and growth opportunities,2020-09-17,5.0,Design Specialist,"Working for Modsy has been such an amazing learning opportunity in so many different ways. As a Design Specialist I have worked with people all over the country from all walks of life including style, budget and life styles. Being able to work with such a wide range of customers has allowed me to grow not only as a designer but also as a customer service rep helping to troubleshoot along the way. 

Being an employee at a start up does have its ups and downs but overall it really pushes you to get involved with the company and become invested in its growth. Upper management does a great job bringing everybody along and really encourages employees to ask questions and to stay curious.",Cons can really relate back to Modsy being a newer company as there are lots of unknowns. Being a remote employee can lead to challenges as changes happen often and quickly. This can often feel a bit overwhelming at times when lots of things are changing around you.

There have been many mountains that we've had to climb together and many challenges along the way, but the opportunities that I have been afforded within my role at Modsy have truly allowed me to grow in a personal and professional capacity. The company as a whole is filled with wonderful, kind people and I have never felt more trusted or encouraged to continue expanding my skill set. Things have been constantly in flux as Modsy refines it's service, but if you are adaptable to change and willing to put in the hard work there is a lot of upside to working here.","Piecemeal processes on the backend were commonplace when I began my role, but have been significantly improved during my time here. Compensation and review structure could use some work."
78,Modsy,"An intricate challenge of design, tech, and retail",2020-08-18,4.0,Business Operations Analyst,"Everything at Modsy is constantly growing. It's an exciting time in the company to identify new opportunities, build new things, refine processes, and collaborate with other teams. Inevitably, this means a lot of change - for the team that you're in, as well as how you collaborate with other teams or tools. If you have the drive to keep great documentation and communication, then Modsy is an amazing company to be a part of. It's been a lot to keep up with, but I've experienced so much within my first year. I've really enjoyed and appreciated my time at Modsy.","Lots of ""tribal knowledge"" - things that are not fully documented or visible, and only passed through word of mouth. This pervades our data, our work processes, and our tools. A lot of time and energy is spent with, ""Do you know who knows ____?"". Of course, this is amplified in the startup world with constant change. 

To be fair, this has been getting much better recently as our work has gone online and we are all in constant communication."
79,Modsy,Great Company if You Want Growth and Love a Challenge,2020-08-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"In a little over a year working for Modsy, I have gone from an entry-level position in the customer success department to securing a rewarding role in the company's marketing team. I'm very grateful for the opportunities I've been given and feel that a lot of the progress I've made at the company is due to leadership taking an active interest in employee development. 

I understand that Modsy, like all companies, has room for improvement (both internally and externally). Because Modsy is a tech start-up, there are frequent changes to operations that can feel daunting. I know that this kind of fluid professional environment isn't for everyone. If you are like me and enjoy a challenge, a company like Modsy can be an excellent opportunity to grow and develop your career path. I also think the frequent changes at the company makes leadership more receptive to suggestions than other companies. I've never worked for another organization where those in charge were so responsive to employee feedback at the ground level.

Overall, I'm happy to be at Modsy and I would suggest the company to anyone looking for a career in tech, design, or marketing.","Modsy is very data analytics heavy, i.e. if you want to get something done you have to be able to prove its merit by backing it up with a lot of empirical information. This can feel taxing and dispassionate at times but the research mostly pays off and makes for a better product. There are also a lot of moving pieces and rapid change at Modsy these aspects can make your workload feel daunting or confusing but if you can stick with it you’ll be rewarded."

There is a high level of taking on responsibility and a strong desire to create a solid company for all to work at. Seeing a bigger picture makes the company challenges the perfect motivation to invest time into the company.  Not to mention, the stocks and health benefits are awesome.","Change is constant and a challenge if you are not open to this fast-paced, tech-world environment.

Modsy wants to deliver the best design/customer experience for anyone who uses their services and works hard to do so. Even during this time period of working virtually across the board, the Modsy family has gotten closer, people have stepped up and created programs to help diversity and inclusion not only in our company but in the community around us which shows that leadership supports their teams.","Constant change, and job security struggles.

-if you love interior design, this is great for you. It's fun!","As other reviews have said, they over hired. Then in the beginning of 2020, introduced a pretty significant pay cut. A lot of people threatened to leave. I remember them holding a meeting explaining the vision for the company as more people were leaving. I understand that this is a start up and believed in the company's mission so I didn't complain and was willing to stay and work hard. 

Well next thing I know I'm getting laid off, despite having just been promoted 2 weeks before, and despite meeting and exceeding the requirements to maintain employment. I had been working for then part time for 5 months while working another job. I gradually lessened my hours at that job to eventually work full time for modsy, thinking as long as I met the requirements, my job is secure (silly me). 
 Long story short, you can give your all to this company, roll with the changes and still be kicked to the curb without a second thought. Think hard before applying and have a back up plan."

You learn so much and so many chances for growth. I\ve been at Modsy for 3 years now, I started working for them as a contractor at 20 hours a week, and have worked my way up now through 4 promotions. It's been hard work, but I've grown so much as a professional and individual.","Being at a startup, things change constantly, so you need to be able to adapt.

87,Modsy,Hire to fire ( layoffs),2020-06-08,1.0,Design Specialist,Working from home was the only Pro part,As being a startup company the change is constant. At first it seemed nice and energetic but with time it started getting worst. Interior designer were changed to more of a customer service category with just asking few project related questions and then passing the project over to contractors and not touching the design at all and just passing on information. They had some target to meet and for that they had crazy hiring spree and then OOPS! The company figured out we did something wrong in hiring and now we gotta layoff. They randomly laid off people one fine morning and said there won't be any further just to find out within a month there was another and after a month one more.

So maybe this isn't a pro.,"Initially, staying at home seemed like the best thing ever. However, it is really lonely because you don't interact with real people and since you stay at home you don't see anything on the drive to work and such. 

My advice is to make sure you see yourself in this world of working full time from a laptop and a headset inside your house."

Creative and fun work.,"This is a start-up company!** I view this as a pro but clearly, from other reviews, this can be seen as a con. So let me explain... You have to know what you are signing up for when you join a start-up. Creating a business is HARD. Growing a new business during a pandemic is EVEN HARDER.  I love my job and I commend this company and its founder on having big dreams and working toward making them a reality. Layoffs happen in any company, but especially in a start-up while the company is finding its footing and even more especially during very very hard worldly times.

92,Modsy,Unreliable,2020-04-02,1.0,Stylist,Working from home. Flexibility of hours. Nice colleagues.,"Working for Modsy is very unreliable unless you’re higher up in the rankings. They hire too many people upfront to have to downsize more than once and then having to cut pay by almost 50%. You usually don’t know what is going on within the company until right when it’s happening. There are ridiculous expectations when it comes to styling, reducing the quality of rooms and the overall happiness of employees. They consider you part time, but when you’re fighting for rooms that you barely get paid for you might as well be unemployed. There seems to be no appreciation for people who keep rooms moving, only those that are higher up on the totem pole. I see a lot of people saying “don’t sell yourself short” for working at Modsy; it’s very true. They cut the pay, the hours, the appreciation, the hope of the lowest common denominator when they should get it just as much as the next guy earning a salary with benefits. We stay through the stress, the worry, the constant changes, the terrible pay to do what we love - we get nothing..just a thanks and goodbye."
93,Modsy,Run away! The amount they pay should be illegal,2020-04-01,1.0,Stylist,"Designing is fun, fellow stylists are good people","I'm gonna be upfront with this. As of April 6, 2020, Classic stylists will be paid as little as $18.75 for a room. THAT IS FOR TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DESIGNS, people. They say this can be done in 90 minutes but many if not most stylists will tell you they spend hours to create quality work.  And then there are redesigns -- which will pay as little as $1. Yes, you read that right. $1 for redesigning a room the fifth time (because the customer asked for it!), even if you have to start the room over from scratch. YOU ARE WORTH MORE THAN THIS. Do not even consider working here. Designing is fun. Being paid less than the Federal Minimum Wage is not.

If you are considering a contract job, be aware this is what the contractors get paid too, and they get NO BENEFITS and have to pay self-employment tax besides. 

Throughput requirements keep going up, ability to ""work when you like"" is now restricted because of this. Design quality dropping due to massive push for speed.  If stylists get faster, pay is cut so that no one can make any more money. They do not respect employees, as demonstrated by the new commission plan they are talking up:  .5% --that's POINT five %... and the rate goes down each time the customer asks for changes to the room. The client has to buy $5000 with no redesigns for us to get $25 whole dollars in commissions. Really? That is supposed to make us feel good about the job?

You cannot rely on the job because they do frequent layoffs now, as well. Don't quit your day job!"

It’s started out as my dream job. I was originally a Stylist (contractor) moving up quickly through the company and then I was offered the opportunity to apply for a Full Time W-2 position and quickly Modsy’s true colors emerged...  
As a Design Specialist I was the top seller and featured twice in front of the company (once right before I got laid off). I was continually encouraged by leadership that I had leadership potential within the company.","January 2020 came over half or team was laid off! I made it through that time. Soon after the layoffs were PROMISED BY THE CEO that OUR TEAM WOULD BE THE LAST TO SEE ANOTHER LAYOFF!! 

Changes came, QUICKLY! I easily adapted! Was praised by leadership! Ideas that I mentioned months prior we implemented and are being used! 
Took on unhappy clients and was presented in front of the company for a second time... I thought, “No way I am being laid off!” I WAS WRONG! Here we go! I sit 2 weeks later my husband is having to work 2 jobs to keep up with the bills because we had a steady income with just me! Now that is all gone! I have never been so betrayed in my life by a company!

This company is a bit all over the place and more unstable than I initially thought. Modsy's projections have been WAY off in what they have said and what actually happens. It is almost like they don't have anyone helping them with their business ventures and projections; if they do then that is pretty sad. It feels like they pull their ideas out of a hat and go...""yep this seems like it'll work"".  The ""higher up's"" (CEO and those immediately below) have absolutely no idea what it is like to be an Initial Stylist, a Design Specialist, or anything else. They force change upon you when they have no clue if it'll work or not--because they've never been in your role.

There are so many cons to this job where do I even begin. This job may be for you if:  want to have an unstable job and never know if a layoff is around the corner, you like to be reinsured on a daily basis that the company ""leads by the heart"" and  you're told you're doing so well daily to only be told a week later they overhired once again and need to lay even more people off...like you, you like to see your supervisors and leads get demoted right in front of your eyes because they need to restucture, save money, and resize the team, you like to be told the company hasn't been profitable in the 4 years they've been around, you like to work for a CEO who just went through one huge layoff and pretty much just ignored the second huge layoff other then an email that basically said ""stuff happens"", you like to hear about pay cuts in different departments because the company needs to be in money saving mode...but you're expected to put out the same quality in even less time, you like to feel like your trust and morale is up and down constantly, you like to see your coworkers feel like crap and your team feel tense all the time due to the constant workflow changes, you like to be told that they'll have your review removed if THEY feel it isn't true, you like things to change week by week because someone at the top who has never done your job thought it was a brilliant idea, you like to be blinded by more and more people leaving around you because they're seeing the light about the company and getting out before it is too late. 

There have been so many warning signs that this company is on the downward. I just kind of ignored it because I thought it was part of the growing pains of a start-up company...it is clear now it is not. I kinda feel bad for the people that will remain in this company after these layoffs. What it would feel like to go to work on a daily basis with everyone's trust out the door and morale at an all-time low. You may have been able to build back your employee's trust/morale after the first large layoff, but after the second large layoff...why would anyone trust you now?"

The work is problem solving by nature.,"I’m so confused where to even begin. It felt a little like a socialist system where they tell you all good things when in reality things are pretty terrible. I had top ratings and was loving my job. We hear all the news of tons of volume to come and how the company is doing amazing. I received an email out of the blue saying they had “over-hired” and therefore needed to let some people go and gave a 2 week termination notice. The notice was appreciated because many colleagues before me were laid off with no notice at all - however they can’t explain why. Just that they are a “start-up” who made bad hiring decisions? It’s a terrible excuse. Why in the world would you hire a few hundred people to pay off 3/4 of them within 3 to 6 months??? 

They simply do not care about you. I know you think I’m just mad because I’m losing my job - but honestly I hope this review makes someone stop and think before investing themselves. They organized this 2020 Modsy Meet Up where all the remote workers could get together to socialize.... Everyone was invited and encouraged to go. Many people from out of state bought plane tickets and made travel plans. 2 weeks before the event they cancelled it and said “oh we didn’t realize we couldn’t afford this”. Are those the kind of people you want to entrust your income with?"

Good chances to learn and further improve your work.,"Management came off as insincere and spent a large majority of company meeting time patting everyone, and themselves, on the back which ultimately always came off as extremely gratuitous.  If you want to work as a designer you only have one job you can stay in while at the company. There is no design jobs at a higher level as everything above the starting ‘Design Specialist’ title is either a supervisor or management role. Even before the end I felt that there was nowhere I would want to move up to at Modsy. Also doesn’t help when you are being told how great everything is going the day before a major company wide lay-off happens."

To put in perspective: one company wide video meeting was run by a lead who also worked remotely and conducted the meeting while they folded clothes at a laundry mat. Professional much? 
Here’s what I did: worked my designs, did major follow up with over a caseload of 40+ clients, phone consultations, data input of client wants and needs, averaged a minimum of 5 designs or more per day, obtained a 4.59 star rating with clients, SOLD their product... BUT WAS LET GO just 3 days after having a stellar review by my supervisor. 
There was no warnings whatsoever which leaves you wondering what you could have done right or did wrong. This review isn’t out of spite, it’s about trying to save the next future employer of 3 or so months of their life. I get that startups have their ups and downs but it just seems that they are doing everything they can to make the company appear to be desirable before going public, AT ANY COST.
It’s a total shame cause they have the building blocks to be a great work environment: the design program is great and makes beautiful renders but the company fundamentals don’t match that beauty.  I would be terrified to work there now as they restructured so much aka did a major layoff. 
At some point this whole company will be autonomous, the way we got laid off was by a manager who seemed like a robot herself so guess the company is almost there."
105,Modsy,Do not trust what you hear,2020-01-13,1.0,Design Specialist,Working remotely is good but it is not as flexible as you would think.,"Very little pay with long hours of  working with no pay, they are not very honest with their employees and their customers. They make employees to leave good reviews to raise their overall ratings. If you are thinking about joining Modsy know that you might not get a chance to say goodbye to your colleagues because you get discarded so easily and quickly with no respect. They hire you and lead to believe you are to stay and 3 month later they say"" we over-hired and we are letting %30 of workforce go"". I would invest my time and skills somewhere else."
106,Modsy,This company is a SHAM. BEWARE!!!,2020-01-11,1.0,Stylist,All pros are gone. They are desperate and are stepping on the hands of their designers to get there.,"This company is desperate and is cutting employee pay by 25%. Please read that again. 

They are cutting our pay drastically, demanding increased workloads with new contracts they just sprung on us, and did a mass firing last week with no explanation. To be clear, conditions and pay were shameful to begin with. Many of us only tolerated it because we truly love the work that we do, like most artists and creators. 

As designers we have been hired because we have degrees in this field -- and we are being paid LESS than minimum wage. I have truly been shocked by how little the company values employees. Employees who are extremely talented and have worked incredibly hard to create beautiful designs that people love. Quality is already staring to decrease, and will only decrease further with the number of people who don't sign the new contracts, and those who do but rightfully struggle to meet these absurd demands."
107,Modsy,"Great as of Dec 2019, Terrible as of Jan 2020",2020-01-10,1.0,Design Specialist,"Most of the pros have changed since the big round of layoffs and restructuring a few days ago, but the community was always a plus.","However, given the callous way they handled suddenly terminating a large amount of people with absolutely no warning,  it's difficult to believe that anything coming from the management is trustworthy.  For months it's been nothing but good news at our growth and production, which prompted many people to really buy in to the company and put that much more into it.  

A lot of personal effort outside of my normal role requirements were put in, and I maintained a  100% 5-star rating with great reviews and feedback from my clients...but none of that matters at all since they'll just drop you at any given time, even the day after giving you great feedback.   

There was a huge push for feedback and ideas just prior to this large layoff, so they'll squeeze out anything positive you have to offer with the intent to use it knowing you won't be there.  That's at best a distasteful, if not downright despicable practice from a company that people believed in."
108,Modsy,If you’re reading this it’s too late..,2020-01-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Working from home full time,"Low pay, stressful environment that’s ever changing, the designs didn’t matter, it was about making a sale.  They over hire every year just to fire people within 6 months.  Don’t trust them at all! They told us to write good reviews to cover up the bad ones.  Fair warning!"
109,Modsy,It's a risk working for a start-up,2020-01-10,1.0,Design Stylist,bonuses were easy to get,"They hired over 150 employees in the Fall 2019. Laid off half of them in Jan 8, 2020. They strategically implemented a marketing plan to gain hundreds of clients and sales for the fall and hired designers, only to lay them off once sales declined.  They knew what they were doing.  They knew they couldn't keep the sales up through winter. Why hire so many employees? We can't even collect unemployment because it's less than 3 months. I  just $15,000 in sales last week. I made over $20,000 in one week in November. I was always in the top 5 designers in my team in sales and they still laid me off."
110,Modsy,Beware,2020-01-10,1.0,Remote,The remote jobs can be flexible,"You or someone you know may be laid off 
Employees are just viewed as numbers"
111,Modsy,If you want to work for a company that hires you for only 3 months! go ahead and apply!,2020-01-09,2.0,Design Specialist,"Get to work from home!!!
Design cool 3D max interiors","I made high numbers since the day I started with this company, at some point I was #1 for 3 weeks. Just to find out I would be laid off within 3 months. Long story short, Do not go with the idea, that by making numbers for them, you have the chance of staying with the company, they WILL let you go after 3 months!  It takes 2 weeks for them to hire you, and they lie to you by letting you know that its a big growing company, and theirs many ways of growing!!   seriously this job is a joke!"
112,Modsy,"Modsy used to be an incredibly fun, sportive and positive environment",2020-01-09,2.0,Channel Moderator,"working from home, flexible scheduling, design work is fun","Where do I begin...I was terminated yesterday 1/8/20 after working for Modsy for a year with zero notice and was given no explanation as to why I was let go. I pressed my manager for any explanation as to why I was being terminated because I was truly blindsided and she was so cold, with a rehearsed line about how she could not give me any information as to why they made this difficult decision. In what world does your employer terminate you without any warning, any prior write ups or notifications and for no reason? It broke my heart and I am devastated. I worked Holidays and weekend for this company (I was legitimately working this year on xmas) sacrificed time with my daughter to clime the ranks and stayed up until 1 or 2 in the morning for months trying to produce enough volume in work to make decent money. There is no loyalty within this company and they will just throw you away like trash when they are done with you. The sad thing is when I started Modsy I was so blown away by how fun, positive and supportive this company was, I genuinely loved Modsy. But things started to change over the summer when new, outside management was hired. The atmosphere became much more negative and more of a place when it felt like a sweat shop where stylists were expected to turn out rooms as fast as they possibly could because we were so busy and had more work than we could handle. 
I started out as a remote stylist making $30 per project which was incredibly low pay (and they just lowered the pay this week) but I stuck it out through the lack of work and low pay and worked my way up to a premium and then platinum stylist to make a whopping $40 per project. And eventually received a full time, hourly position. I loved being able to work from home as I have a 2 year old and loved the flexibility in scheduling. Modsy sells you on the fact that you can complete a project in 2 hours so if you are a premium or platinum stylist you are making $20 an hour...well not really. Modsy asks a lot from their stylists and the customers come with a very detailed and extremely long list of wants and needs so the average project takes more like 4 hours to complete. So its more like $10 an hour which is still okay since you get to work from the comfort of your own home and you deal with your ""bosses"" via internet messaging . If you are able to work 14-16 hours a day and sustain that lifestyle you can make decent pay by sheer volume. Bottom line is Modsy has changed into a company that does not value their employees and pays you far less than what you are worth. Work ebbs and flows, sometimes it is extremely slow and we call it the hunger games and other times we are so busy and backlogged that we cant keep up."
113,Modsy,Modsy is a 1 out of 10  They pushed employees to increase glassdoor score! Look back a few months & see for yourself!,2020-01-09,1.0,Customer Service Representative,There is only one thing that is ability to come into the office & at times work remotely.  Although the pay is super super low for Portland/SF Bay area. Not to mention I found out a guy was making way more than me for the same job. Same experience! Yeah that .80 to a dollar saying is true at Modsy. What happened to we have a bunch of women on our board of directors? We are pro woman? NOT! It looks like they don't really care about the women who aren't directors.,"They will hire you tell you that they do everything from a place of love. They believe in work life balance. Put on a great front to the public as all inclusive loving company shoot even their company logo has a heart w/rainbows on it.  Then when they decide profits aren't big enough for their private investors to go public they'll call you in to a meeting to say ""well we're sorry, but we can't keep you guys around anymore. After this meeting every account you have will be disconnected, and you will receive your last paycheck in the mail. "" WTF? Not even able to retrieve any emails? I had important work information that I will need in the future? Not even a chance for a generic bye to my dear coworkers. WOW! SHAME ON YOU MODSY YOU FOOLED US ALL INTO YOUR SCHEME! I will forever suggest people to shop w/Havenly we all know their business is way better organized with much better designers. Havenly is the real deal not pretending to be something they're not. In life be the real you everyone is already taken! Advice to Modsy don't bite off more than you can chew. Can't you see you affected so many people with your greedy decisions. To tell us that we were profitable & growing and then letting us all go? WHAT? I am going to see to it that everyone knows what a sham of a company you are. I gave my all  to your company only for you to tell us we were nothing. All you care about is going public. Yeah thanks for not letting us keep our stock options too. You guys are the devil in disguise.  I hope the $ you saved is worth your reputation. Just so you know a reputation is something that even money can't buy."
114,Modsy,Don’t drink the Kool-Aid,2020-01-09,1.0,Design Specialist,"Working from home
Fun program","I had a bad feeling a few days ago when I got a meeting event on my calendar with management that had a hidden guest list and discovered that dozens of my coworkers also got these ominous events in their calendars. I joked with them that it was a “group firing”, which in hindsight I realize was my gut telling me I was right all along. I absolutely loved and adored my Modsy family, and we were close and could joke like that. A group firing? That would be a sick joke. With everything this company gives you- sending you computer equipment, benefits, and the most insane two week training learning their proprietary software and ridiculous number of various platforms to run their business, it seems asinine that they would do this. 

The Jan 8 review that compares what they did to us yesterday to Black Mirror hit the nail RIGHT on the head. After talking to others who were also laid off we realized this is a pattern with this company’s very short 5 year history and other startups in general like gaming companies who hire a ton of talent and work them to the bone, then lay them off after they get what they want out of them. It is clear to me now this is exactly what happened here.  I even asked in my interview with them three months ago about the negative reviews I read here and they told me this was just disgruntled employees hired very early on in the company when the company was still figuring things out. 

Yesterday, they laid off almost a 1/4 of their most customer- facing team and blamed this “unfortunate event” on over-hiring and not performing as well as they planned. Ironically the higher ups who delivered this script-read news in a series of video conference sessions throughout the morning have been with Modsy even less time than us, and came to Modsy from another well-known start up company. I wonder if they too felt that Modsy would be their fresh start and new beginning and will soon be in our shoes. 

 In the last few weeks, they sent us surveys and multiple feedback questionnaires gathering information from us while  praising us for our fantastic hard work and talking about our bright future of Modsy. 

I don’t buy for one second that this was an oversight in planning and accidental. I knew when they hired on so many that they would be losing some of those just hired on, but I just assumed those would be people who couldn’t handle the workload and pressure. I worked 60+ hours a week for the first 8 weeks I worked here because I was invested in the future of this company and thought they truly appreciated the talent and passionate designers they hired and believed them when they told me I was “doing an amazing job!”Any feedback I received was always constructive and made me feel valuable and I felt so lucky to be a part of this company. 
You hear about layoffs in the news and they always talk about the numbers of people let go, but until it happens to you you don’t truly know what it means to be laid off. It is one thing to let go of those who really aren’t contributing to the success of the business, or those who aren’t invested in the company’s future. They just used us to make new training programs, improve their systems and software and did so while smiling pretending we were valued and appreciated and then turned all of our lives upside down yesterday."
115,Modsy,Fun work but very robotic company,2020-01-09,2.0,Design Specialist,"Working from home was a plus since I have a newborn. Also it was fun designing rooms on their 3D platform which is awesome, almost feels like playing a game of Sims.","I just got laid off yesterday (1/8/2020) after only just completing my training about a month ago (I was hired 2 months ago). I also made a $13,000 sale for them within the last month. The whole processes of the company felt very monotone and robotic, even the lay off process. There was a video conference call between the managers (who read off a script) and all employees who were getting laid off and in the middle of the video chat, we all got disconnected and locked out from all our Modsy accounts. We were not given a chance to even complete any work on that day, or even send a goodbye message to any co-workers. It would have been nice to get a little more than a 5 second notice. It was very odd and felt a little bit like an episode of The Black Mirror. They expect you to use automated emails to customers in each stage of the design process which also felt very robotic and repetitive."
116,Modsy,Love this company! They just fired 35 of us today with no warning whatsoever!,2020-01-08,1.0,Design Specialist,"Working remote was nice, I suppose, but only if you’re super social.","Wow... what an utter joke. I don’t know what I was expecting from a start-up, but just an inkling of professionalism would’ve been nice. The entirety of the training process was a joke, with no guidance whatsoever. Instead of hands-on instruction, we were all expected to sit through glorified slideshows, full of outdated information and typos. Every day, we were given conflicting information on company processes, design standards, and more. Some of us didn’t even get supervisors until months into employment after we’d already been given real, actual clients to interface with and design for. So during that entire time, no feedback or advice from a supervisor was ever provided. Was I doing well? Who knows?? Some of us were being told that we were doing well, at least performance-wise, only to be told during our termination call that the company looked at a variety of different factors, including company engagement. So??? Doesn’t matter if you did well if you didn’t make friends with your coworkers and post in the #random channel every day."

118,Modsy,Not great,2019-12-26,1.0,Design Specialist,Work from home/remote in design,Extremely high expectations for very little pay.  They expect professional designs and pay designers less than a Starbucks Barista makes.  Most of management has zero design experience or professionalism.

I feel more encouraged and supported here over when I was working at an actual office.","Really steep learning curve at the beginning and it's hard to not to receive in-person training when you have a million questions about the different platforms used. It's a 2-4 week confusing and stressful period, but once you get a good grasp on everything it becomes second nature. It's also hard to remove yourself from work at the end of the day or days off. It's tempting to open emails and check on projects even if you're not clocked in, but maybe that's just me!"

Training and Certification process is very well organized and educational.,"The position is remote. So there is no scope for interaction or collaboration with actual physical people. Part-time work ends up taking most of the day and almost 7 days a week. After one's tireless efforts to showcase the best rooms, one gets  paid peanuts (only up to $30/room). 1 room includes 2 designs which take up anywhere between 2-4 hrs once you get better at your styling speed. Without any background in interior design, it could take up to 2 months to just get comfortable enough with the software to be able to complete 3 rooms in a day for you to get a decent enough pay of up to $90+ Even then you may feel like your handyman is earning more than you are."

I used to work in a design studio for many years and taking this position, working from home, has been AMAZING for our family. I can pick the kids up from school and be home with them on days off! There is also lots of room to grow in the company and different stylist positions you can work towards!",Sometimes projects take longer than expected due to things out of your control but on the flip side sometimes projects don’t take as long as expected :)
157,Modsy,"Underpaid, Undervalued, Underhanded, Unhappy",2019-05-21,1.0,Design Specialist,None to recall at this time.,"Modsy will change your compensation at ANY moment without notice (yes, as a regular full-time employee). While I worked here, the wages of Design Specialists were cut by 35% casually during a weekly meeting. This left many employees financially insecure and in need of taking out loans to pay their bills. 

You will be paid whatever you settle on during your interview. As close friends, we all realized we were all paid drastically different wages - ranging from $16-$23 an hour for the same exact position. Modsy will lowball you if you let them.

On my final paycheck, Modsy retracted my previous raises and did not pay me for 8 hours of labor. I had to call this out and have a revised paycheck sent to me without apology or accountability from them."

I love how styling is done remotely and it allows me to EASILY balance work with my schedule!,I wish there was an east cost HQ!
159,Modsy,Great with slow periods,2019-02-27,4.0,Remote Stylist,"Friendly environment, fulluling work, community, convenience, great job when there is work to do",Slow periods where there is little to no work
160,Modsy,Great company,2019-02-08,4.0,Stylist,Everyone is very very nice and accommodating,Many positions are remote and so communication (and even projects) are done online. It only sucks if there's a bad storm and/or you are experiencing some type of internet issue. It's imperative that you have a string connection to work effectively here.
161,Modsy,stay away,2019-02-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- awesome open office space in SOMA
- weekly happy hours with team","- no transparency from management
- product constantly pivots
- loss of focus on mission - Not trying to innovate or change the advertising/marketing landscape anymore
- extremely HIGH employee churn
- lack of real product development - mostly focusing on which clients yell the loudest
- employees aren't appreciated - when they're let go or leave, they're asked to vacate immediately
- hiring spurts - a group of new people will start around the same time, realize its not working, then slowly quit/be let go
- below market pay
- extremely imbalanced and unreasonable work hours (even for a startup)"
162,Modsy,Very Little Work To Go Around- Only Get Paid For Rooms YOU aqcuire,2019-02-01,2.0,Remote Stylist,You get to work remotely from your computer at home,"There's very little work to go around in this company as  a stylist. As a stylist you design rooms, however rooms are thrown out to a public dashboard where you compete with hundreds of other stylists to grab it for yourself to style. And you only get paid per room that you style. A room that is placed in the dashboard for the stylists to grab lasts about 3.5 seconds for you to grab it for yourself. The company adds on tons of new stylists every month so competition never lightens up. Only apply to this job if you have time to sit down and stare at your computer the entire day crossing your fingers the whole day that you'll not only be glancing at your screen when a room shows up but that you'll also be able to tap into your inner speed demon to grab it before any other stylist grabs it. I don't understand why they don't just hire a smaller group of full time stylists who can be guaranteed steady work, there are tons of people passionate about this line of work to be willing to do it."
163,Modsy,What a joke,2019-01-30,1.0,Remote Stylist,"You can work from home and there is a flexible schedule. Even though you are designing for Modsy and therefore required to stick to their design aesthetic and only used prefered retailers, etc. it is still fun in theory to work on the rooms, get to know what is offered from different retailers, see other's homes, etc. That's about where it stops being interesting.","They pay you by the room. Fine, except there is SO much time involved in doing the ridiculous communicating they expect, sitting around waiting for this work. Just to get the work, they expect you to sit around, staring at the computer and the system they use to send out the projects. That's all on your dime. There could be better systems, but they don't really care to develop anything else.

Communication is a nightmare. Talking to any of the leads or managers feels like talking to a brick wall or a robot. You only communicate online, so I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they are just copying and pasting stuff all the time. They basically only give the same answers to different questions all the time, I am not sure they read through questions before giving feedback. It's all the same sort of platitudes all the time, without giving any real thought to improving the system. Its been okay for me, but I don't rely on it in any way and I haven't been able to pick up any work for more than a month."
164,Modsy,"Undervalued, underpaid",2019-01-25,1.0,Stylist,"Work from home
Set your own hours","First I want to say that it seems that many of the reviews that were written in this same light, have been deleted with only the positive ones remaining for the most part. It is also 100% clear that the last positive review left on Feb 1 was written my someone at headquarters in an attempt to combat the true reviews.
Stylists are way underpaid and undervalued. I couldn't agree more with everything that the reviewer on December 20th ""Make this a Hobby, Not a Job"" said. She/he was spot on in every regard. I honestly have no idea how they keep stylist for more than 4-6 months. The hiring process is very misleading."
