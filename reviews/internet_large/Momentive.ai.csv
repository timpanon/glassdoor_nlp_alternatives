3,Momentive.ai,Cant go wrong,2022-04-06,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Amazing place to work, the culture is unreal and the support is even more unbelievable. From the moment I was hired I was waiting to see the real business side but this company has not surprised me with anything. They remain to care about employees and the people they hire are also great individuals who support one another. Honestly this is the best place i have ever worked... and the best place i may ever work.","A lot of change but there needs to be change to be competitive, also I was there through the rebranding."

10,Momentive.ai,Sales org is toxic,2022-03-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,- Good benefits and 401k matching,"- Sales leadership does not care about you as a person. They look at you as a number and that's it. 
- Turnover is incredibly high for BDRs and AEs.
- Base pay is awful for BDRs; also now they base a portion of quota on whether or not an AE can close a deal so it's out of your hands.
- Culture is toxic overall, there's no cohesiveness whatsoever. Everyone is only about themselves and don't actually care about working as a team.
- I personally went through a mental health crisis and was swept under a rug. Job duties were decreased without any heads up or explanation."
11,Momentive.ai,"Great place to work overall, some areas to improve on",2022-03-10,4.0,Senior Product Designer,"- A lot of great people

- Misalignment on priorities and resourcing due to the current siloed nature of the business.

13,Momentive.ai,"Great brand, horrible pay, churn and burn shop. Not many people hitting quota.",2022-03-05,2.0,Account Executive,"The people and culture are top notch. Product is a decent competitor in the marketplace depending on what you're selling and what vertical.

You won't get fired if you miss quota. Direct management is very supportive. 

Great diversity initiative.","Turnover is HUGE. In the last 6 months, the turnover in the sales org has been huge. When you see 1/4 of the sales staff leave within 2 years, it sets off alarm bells. 

The sales staff is paid about ~70% of market and management will entice you with 4x accelerators after you hit quota. This sounds amazing, but <10% of people hit quota and most of the people don't make OTE.

The products need way more R+D into it to remain competitive in the CX landscape. Discounts are usually the way most deals are won. 

Quota is always changing and there's a different initiative each week.

Training is from the 90's with Sandler and needs to adapt.

Executive leadership seems more like a figurehead and isn't very transparent with what's happening in the day-to-day. Example being with the failed Zendesk acquisition.

Promotions are very bureaucratic with set timelines as opposed to merit."

16,Momentive.ai,Talent is leaving due to pay,2022-02-25,3.0,Account Executive,"Amazing Culture, everyone is motivated and supportive.",The pay is below standard.

18,Momentive.ai,Leadership cares about the employees.,2022-02-15,4.0,Engineering Manager,"Good people, good benefits, mature operation","Strategic mishaps at the executive strategy level and less than stellar growth means some of the best people have left. However, its a really pleasant place to work, just maybe not a rocketship."
19,Momentive.ai,Stay away from this churn and burn dumpster fire,2022-02-15,1.0,Sales Manager,Brand looks good on your resume but keep reading.,"HR always fires people at the end of the month which means no healthcare benefits. 

Employees can access customer data at any given time. Like the work they're doing with the software.

Sr Management bashes anyone that leaves and will twist the truth to prevent employees from reaching out. Should have believed you D.H.

The turnover rate is crazy high! Maybe due to low pay, frequent quota structure changes, and an uber-liberal culture that's shoved down your throat. Pretty liberal myself, but this is weird.

Recruiting staff will pressure you to hire anyone with a pulse. You are pressured to move forward with someone because they are a ""diversity hire."" HR does not see a problem with this. 

Promotes DEI culture but pays women way less. My base was 22k more than my female counterpart J.S.

Company signed up to deliver a large revenue number but won't be able to meet it without continuously hiring employees or outsourcing their work. This puts a strain on middle-management who will always have new ppl they'll need to train as they miss their number.

Less than 5% of ppl will hit their quota. Facts. Probably due to bad onboarding, training from the 90's, inconsistent GTM strategies, lack of direction, poor execution, spray and pray approach etc.

CRM is a data nightmare. Just no.

I can go on."

The sales team is collaborative and supportive of each other, which is a departure from the cutthroat teams found in most enterprise software companies.","They don’t know how to help their AEs achieve quota. They make major changes almost every quarter, making it difficult to achieve momentum in a repeatable process. Sales management openly gaslighted the sales team, making it seem like it was our performance that was preventing us from reaching quota when in fact it’s the system they created. Had $100k in open oops transferred to other AEs in the middle of actively considering a proposal. Didn’t make any sense other than to impact my ability to reach quota.

- 'Kind' culture
- Some amazing, smart and supportive colleagues
- Lots of ownership & accountability

An overall amazing place to be if you are looking to work in a calm, flexible environment and do not value leading, or improving the product.","- Leadership and constant pivoting of strategy
- Quick fixes rather than long term visions
- Design does not have an equal voice & does not hold a seat in horizon (C-suite)
- Boring product. Selling the same offering in different ways and calling them a portfolio of products.
- Mostly sales focused positioning without much product development to support the claims. Multi-user products are NOT products, just marketed as such.
- Real growth pains to evolve as an org and an enterprise product
- Limited career advancement & opportunities"
41,Momentive.ai,Great place to work!,2021-11-02,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Great culture, everyone is nice and willing to help each other. Very good life work balance!",Business outlook is not great.
42,Momentive.ai,Great Company and Culture,2021-10-31,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Momentive (formally SurveyMonkey) is an amazing company to work for. The people here are friendly and the culture is refreshing due to all the support you have. I was hired a year ago during the pandemic and worked remotely, but I still felt like I was supported with all the internal tools we had. 

I worked in sales, which consist mainly of younger people (ages 24-32). The synergy wasn't really an issue because everyone was doing their own thing but still always loved to share their wins or answer any questions on Slack. Managers were young, caring, and very supportive for their team. I didn't feel afraid to ask a question because I knew I was in good hands. Overall, I enjoyed my time working at Momentive and it was mainly because of my team members.","-Boring product. Momentive offers several solutions; however let's be real, they're all just surveys. It's hard to get excited about a product that isn't something someone can be too passionate about.
-Its a sales role. No one really likes being a BDR or be in sales other than the money. Your success measure is based on how many opportunities are flipped, not by a set pipeline goal. If you're into cranking phone calls and shooting emails like every sales role, then this is a great position. 
I will be mindful because the company did rebrand so there is a lot of changes that happened since the last time I worked here.

-Pay could be better. For such a large and well-known company, the pay is really low. To share without going too deep, most BDRs on the team make around 58ish K with a 30% compensation if you hit quota. A lot of people that left and also why I did as well was because I wanted a role that would pay me more."

They were nice pre-pandemic, when it was just important to get your job done and try to grow in your role. Now, that people have to navigate random school closings, depression from being at home, and the onslaught of The Great Resignation, and they are still nice, which translates to being supportive. People approach problems in a ""how can I help you"" sort of way.

Momentive is sitting on huge market potential. Every organization in the world is looking for ways to capture and analyze opinion data. Momentive, who used to be SurveyMonkey, has 20 years of history in this space. They have the best handle on how customers use their products and what they need in terms of ease-of-use. They have the right leadership in place to capitalize on their history in the space.

Instead they just want to hire consultants to figure out how to price things, spend money on name changes and acquisitions instead of doing the actual hard work needed to make SurveyMonkey successful. The amount of turnover on the sales team is pathetic to say the least, and scary for anyone who currently works there, especially if they are younger in their careers. I would be quite weary of joining the sales org and would ask questions around: why so much turnover (even though the CEO tries to spin it into other companies will always want to hire good people, hence the losses, but that simply isn't true) I would also ask about reps hitting their quotas (bc no one is) and also why they haven't made any changes to upper management in 4+ years, especially when there haven't been any significant progresses made to the team. (and if you need any proof, just look at the stock price over last few years)"

97,Momentive.ai,Too corporate,2021-07-26,2.0,Software Developer,"- awesome benefits 
- ok salaries, stock options
- very good vacation policy and work-life balance
- location
- some nice people to work with","- slow corporate turnaround speed is a killer. Simple problems became huge. It is impossible to be productive when you need to go through tons of useless software integrations or steps to solve simple 5 minute issues (for example when your computer is locked out);

- smart, but disorganized people, because top management and ""leadership"" doesn't know what they want. They often change plans half way in and there's no transparency between them and people on the lower level of hierarchy. You can experience the real corporate separation between managers and non-managers here and fear to raise concerns or ideas;

- too much bureaucracy and fake principles. I've been with the company for more than 7 years and saw how innovative, free, fun and friendly work environment became the salvage for corporate policies and modern local trends where people are judged not by the work they do and how they do it, but by other trendy social media qualities;

- engineers are not respected here; 

- insane amount of meetings;

- majority of meetings are useless because people cannot agree on things or discussing things that should have been decided on day one. Other departments have a lot of meetings too;

- leadership (directors, top managers) do not meet to discuss the business/decisions with their subordinates unless they are managers too;

- managers are busy with meetings every day, where they try to decide ""something"", while keeping people who actually have the product/technical knowledge away from discussion. Reason is simple - self recognition and less resistance. It is easier to use engineers as coding only workforce, while satisfying the need of leadership for quick solutions. That's why senior engineers are leaving and inters are popular here. It is easier to control them because they lack experience in the field and deep product knowledge, it is cheaper and it is also good for company's social media reputation. No one cares about the product quality and customers. At the end, it is all about getting a bigger bonus and title for the managers and leadership;

- constant layoffs (so called ""re-orgs""). This is the fancy way of firing people who have their own opinion and do not agree to sacrifice ""security/architecture/product quality/customer satisfaction/UX"" in favor of a quick solutions to squeeze more money from customers;

- disrespectful and defiant layoff/firing (""re-org"") process. The way they let people go - oh boy... It is worst experience ever. It happened to my colleague. They treated him like a criminal, didn't allow to say goodbye, just threw a person to the street even though it was just a layoff. It is not standalone case, other people and teams were let go the exact same way. Some were let go after 10+ years of service and were treated as trash on the ""re-org"" day as well;

- huge cross-team communication problems. Each team consider themselves as standalone entity with their own goals, rules and ""religion"". There's no effective collaboration. You cannot come to a solution together and always have to fight and compromise to make investors happy. No lng-term vision from technical and product standpoint. Technical specifications are ignored, product specifications are outdated before they even finished. It is normal for managers to ask for tech specs without product specs;

- lots of positions moved to Canada and Europe. Meetings at 7-8am in the morning are considered normal in some teams;

- lots of managers of managers. Lots of useless director positions that only suck money from the company's budget, enforcing ""re-orgs"" every year;

- huge churn / turnover. 85% of people who built the company left since 2016;
 
- majority of PMs do not know what they are doing. Lots of projects are dead 
born. Company investing millions of dollars and years of work while projects undergo the same path;

- 24/7 on call policy for every engineer, one week per month (varies by team). If you like to be woken up at 4am when the server is down (because infrastructure /devOps team didn't do their job) welcome to the company. Going to Tahoe for a weekend? You must take your laptop with you in case something breaks while you having a day off. It is easier for a company to hire two new directors of ""something"" than a team that handles night/weekends shifts as their main job (like it is suppose to be). They do not pay extra for it, they do not ask you for your permission. You just have to do it. Some engineers left because of that; 

- not easy to switch a team. Easier to leave the company;

- technical leadership cannot come up with coding practices and development standards for years. Constant code base re-factoring and no technical vision making this ""beast"" hard to support or understand;

- if you are an engineer you are enforced to participate at hackathons;

- if you intern, please stay away. From technical standpoint you will not learn anything here. If you want to learn corporate politics - you are in the right place."

108,Momentive.ai,"Poor pay, terrible role",2021-06-30,2.0,Implementation Specialist,Company offers lots of PTO in pursuit of work-life balance.,"- Taking time off is one of the most stressful things you can do. There is no redundancy built into the role, so if you take time off your projects grind to a halt and clients become very upset. Ultimately, this means you have to work dozens of hours of unpaid overtime on either side of any vacation to accommodate it. 

- Having ""happy"" clients is the only thing managers care about. Working efficiently, doing good work, providing value, etc. are all totally irrelevant. 

- If clients are unhappy, managers will bend over backwards to throw their employee under the bus regardless of the quality of the work. Meanwhile, if employees cut corners or do terrible work but clients don't notice and report that they are happy, managers turn a blind eye. Your manager never has your back.

- As long as clients are unhappy, they will receive unlimited free stuff (labour, upgrades, training, etc). Managers will never say no. Customers who fly off the handle can email Zander directly, and he will get involved and make sure that this unsustainable cycle continues rather than supporting his employees.

- The implicit expectation on the team is that everyone work hundreds of hours of unpaid overtime every year. If employee's can't account for every minute of every workday in a week, they are immediately hassled by their manager.

- Pay is terrible and nowhere close to industry standard. By the time you factor in unpaid overtime, you're only getting a few dollars above minimum wage.

- Employee feedback is consistently ignored by upper management. Exit interviews are a formality and it's made clear your voice isn't valued."

Diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as mental health are high priorities. Leadership is transparent, approachable, and encouraging. I actually feel inspired to work hard and a real emotional investment in the company I work for for the first time. SurveyMonkey is people-centric, they put their customers and employees at the center of every business decision, and I couldn't be more impressed with how they've handled working/return to work during COVID. I've referred multiple people and could go on all day.","The only con I can think of would be that the sales team can be hierarchical. There are some phenomenal key accounts AEs, but a handful of them tend to stick up their nose or ignore the SDRs/BDRs who are trying to build pipeline for them altogether. This happens on just about any enterprise sales team anywhere, but frustrating nonetheless."

176,Momentive.ai,They care about you,2021-01-14,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"One of the best companies I worked for. Management cares about the people and you can see that in a lot of things, small and big. 
For example, they're handling the Covid crisis like a champ: home office stipends, extra days off for people that need it, mental support in various ways and generally acknowledging that this can be a hard time and that that's ok. Also things like 4 weeks bereavement leave, 16 weeks of parental leave (mom and dad), even support for IVF treatment... they care.

Compensation is fair, especially if you take into consideration stocks. Work is interesting, great colleagues (bad behaved people are not tolerated), good work/life balance.","The occasional ""logic"" of an enterprise like installing a virus scanner on developer machines that constantly takes 25% of CPU power and refusing to come back on that decision even though it's impacting a lot of people's daily work severely."

Everyone in my team shows up with kindness, respect and gratitude for each other which makes working here such a pleasure. People are generous with their help and there is harmony. We're all tasked with identifying what we can do better as a company and be service orientated. We're free to do the right things and learn from any mistakes if we try new approaches to issues. The real pro for me is the people, everyone is committed to making others feel good about their work and gain the expertise needed in their sector to grow.
We are spoilt rotten with different mindful events, yoga, fitness classes, concerts etc, we work hard but also play hard. 
In SurveyMonkey, we don't just talk about Diversity and Inclusion, we have a task force that helps and guides us in our awareness of injustices. 
This is hands down the best company I have ever worked in.","As a global company, it's challenging at times to collaborate with people in different time zones, but you get this in any international organisation.

This makes it an engaging place to work, with lots of good projects and growth opportunities. The company puts a tremendous emphasis on its employees' wellbeing, always making sure that the work/life balance is reasonable and manageable. One of its primary goals is that every employee feels respected and included. Its Diversity and Inclusion mandate at all level of management is impressive. The HR benefits are top-notch for employees here in Canada, with 4 weeks vacation time and generous WFH stipends and fitness membership reimbursement.","With such rapid growth and expansion comes challenges, especially in when everyone is working from home. Some of what made SurveyMonkey a special place to work with food, snacks, on-site exercise room, games room is all inaccessible. The temporary WFH setup makes for a different experience, but I'm sure all companies are going through the same issues."

231,Momentive.ai,Still Here 5 Years Later!,2020-12-16,4.0,Customer Success Manager,"SurveyMonkey has an incredible culture which is the primary reason I've stayed here years after I thought I would have moved on to another company. 

- True work/life balance. While there is some flexibility in hours to accommodate for having a global team across time zones , I generally never have to work on 
weekends or outside 7am-6pm on weekdays.

- Awesome customers! As a CSM I work with enterprise customers every day and every single one is a delight to work with. Our product provides real value to our customers and we have been able to weather COVID's economic crisis quite well because of it. 

- Commitment to enablement and career growth - the Customer Success department in particular has had some amazing enablement and development trainings over the past year. I have been in the CSM role for a few years now, and I am still learning a ton and growing in the role, and I see years more of opportunity for growth. 

- Clear expectations for promotion consideration (even if promotions seems to happen at a very slow pace) 

- True commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, way beyond the lip service of other tech companies","- Pay is average to below average for the CS org, and I know I could make more money if I went elsewhere. So far, the culture and work life balance is valuable enough to trade off for this, but other employees may feel differently. 

- Promotion cycles - While promotion expectations are very clear in CS, promotions happen at a glacial pace, only 2x a year,  and are very competitive. You generally have to be performing consistently at the next level for 6+ months before you're even considered for a promotion. This can lead to feelings of being underpaid for the value you bring to the company.  

- Managers can make or break your experience - there's both incredibly inspiring 
managers here, and some (as in all organizations) who are not as strong. Turnover seems to be correlated to your manager rather than company culture as a whole."
232,Momentive.ai,SurveyMonkey really stepped up,2020-12-16,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"- Unmatched benefits (16 weeks paternity leave, 401k matching, ESPP, etc.)

233,Momentive.ai,Welcoming environment with the best people you'll ever work with,2020-12-16,5.0,Customer Operations Manager,"- I tell everyone that the best part of my job is working with engaged, friendly, funny, and caring people. I've met some of my closest friends working here over the last 8 years. 
- A low pressure environment to grow your career. There's incredible appetite from both employees and management for mentorship and learning/knowledge sharing opportunities. 
- Work/Life balance. I've never been stressed by the amount of work assigned. There have been challenging projects, but they are always completed without needing to sacrifice additional time out of my day. 
- Great benefits and flexibility 
- Fun and meaningful products/customers. I don't feel complicated about the product I'm working on - this can often be a hard thing to balance when working in the tech industry.",- Now that we are a much larger public company there is less transparency around how the business is actually doing.
234,Momentive.ai,A workplace that truly cares about its people and its impact!,2020-12-16,5.0,Product Manager,"SurveyMonkey's culture is unparalleled. Many companies out there just say empty words about how they care about their people, but SurveyMonkey really shows up for its people. Let me count the ways:
- They pay very fairly 
- The work/life balance is fantastic
- There are no big egos in leadership. They're all genuinely good people who are looking out for the team.
- Employees are given autonomy in their roles
- People feel safe to bring their authentic selves to work
- They are really invested in social impact and in DEI initiatives 

I started this job fully remote due to COVID-19, and I still feel fully embraced and supported in the role, which is really a testament to how SurveyMonkey has built an inclusive culture and puts its people first.","There are none that I can speak of beyond the difficulties of working from home and being remote with teammates that you haven't met yet, but there is not much that SurveyMonkey can do about that until it is safe for us to return to the office."
235,Momentive.ai,Moved up from BDR to AE!,2020-12-16,5.0,Account Executive,SurveyMonkey has great leadership that works hands-on with the sales team but also gives us space to execute. When I started as a BDR all team members were super helpful to get me started and as I looked to apply for the AE role all team members above me were very open to giving advice and the best way to get repaired for the new role. There is a great work-life balance culture that prides on letting its employees to be family first.,Being in sales can always be a little stressful and there is some pressure put on to execute to meet numbers.
236,Momentive.ai,SVMK is a great place to work!,2020-12-16,5.0,Recruiter,"It's been said many times, but the people are incredible and feel like family. The leadership team is very transparent and I've been impressed with how they have led us through this year of uncertainty. SVMK puts their employees first, and have been supportive and flexible with us as we adapt to working remotely, distant learning and take care of family members. I couldn't be more proud to work here!",None! It's a great place to work

promotions based on effort & dedication to the role, 
VERY flexible PTO,
Lots of mental health/physical health support & benefits,

240,Momentive.ai,Really Welcoming Place to Work!,2020-12-04,5.0,Software Engineer,"The culture at the company is really well balanced. People work hard and help each other, but there's also a strong precedent for getting involved in non-work capacities. Employee resource groups do a lot of great work and there are always events to attend that range from employee concerts to seminars to interviews with experts from various fields. Professionally there's also lot of room for growth and tons of support when picking up new skills.",Starting during a pandemic means no access to the office cafeteria or other in-office perks.
241,Momentive.ai,One of the best companies in my career,2020-12-04,5.0,Sales Enablement Program Manager,"SurveyMonkey stands for integrity, inclusion, diversity, trust, and collaboration. It provides the benefits of a company 10X it's size with the scrappiness of a startup (my area of the company); the best of both worlds. The people are smart, dedicated, and know how to have fun.",There are still growing pains and they are being addressed.
242,Momentive.ai,"Toxic Culture, Firing AEs in January '21",2020-12-03,1.0,Account Executive,"-The company culture is great unless you're in sales.
-The HQ in San Mateo is incredible and, before COVID, provided free breakfast and lunch Mon-Thurs.
-They've managed to attract a lot of top sales talent.
-They have a lot of perks and benefits.","-Salary and OTE is well below market.
-60+ hour work weeks with hardly any days off (don't be fooled by unlimited PTO).
-Hitting quota buys you nothing; you will continue to be told that you're not doing enough.
-Very few people even make OTE because leadership is gutting and cutting the ""Enterprise"" products.
-Management is extremely inexperienced, and almost all of them create a toxic, stressed out work environment.
-Management and Leadership are callous, unsupportive tyrants who never stop squeezing AEs.
- Management rolls out new time-wasting tasks and new reasons for meetings every week, so the amount of time you have to actually sell is minuscule.
- Close to zero inbound leads.
-BDRs get almost no training except for what you give them as an AE. So you have to train your BDRs, have as much daily outbounding activity in Salesforce as a BDR, generate your own pipeline, and somehow close business all at the same time.
-Zero chance you'll be allowed to decide how to do your job, even if you're successful.
-Management guilts AEs who need a day off.
-The closing process is so slow, redundant, and frustrating that it sometimes takes over a week of an AE babysitting Legal, RevOps, Finance, and Leadership to close a deal.
-Many AEs who've been in sales for most of their careers are saying that they're considering trying to do something outside of sales when they leave SurveyMonkey. We're all so traumatized by the horrific culture at SurveyMonkey that it's hard to remember what it was like to have a normal, successful sales job somewhere else.
-The CEO and other top leaders are focused on trying to appear politically correct while still treating their sales reps like slaves. It's a farce."
243,Momentive.ai,Leadership cares about employees,2020-12-03,4.0,People Team Member,"The benefits are great, the people are great, the product is well-used, and the senior leadership (executive team) has shown they really care about their employees. The covid-19 response has been great, and the company's support for the black community during the turmoil of racial injustice and murders in the black community in the US has been more than expected.","When you get to first-level management, there can be some inexperience that causes senior talent (at least in the people team) to leave since they don't have a clear path to growth or clear developmental opportunities."

246,Momentive.ai,Exceptional company wot work with!,2020-11-24,5.0,Engineering Manager,"SurveyMonkey really cares about their employee and society. During the pandemic, employees get additional days off for recharge, and wfh stipend for stuffs like keyboards, monitors, or even childcare. We have built surveys and deliver AI-powed insights to better understand the impact of covid-19 and racism, such as tracking people's symptoms, and thoughts on back to school/work. The company also has sth called surveymonkey for good, sm4g for short. This is dedicated to collaborate with charity organizations to contribute to diversity, equality, and inclusion for our community.",I have got the support I need and do not really have any cons on top of my mind.
247,Momentive.ai,Fantastic place to build a career!,2020-11-18,5.0,Engineering Manager,"- Nurturing and positive work culture, with realistic expectations, a lot of room for mistakes and learning and a culture of honesty and transparency.
- The leadership of the company has strong values, and it shows in the way the company cares for their employees. It makes me feel proud to work for SurveyMonkey, in a way I've never felt at another company.
- A lot of cutting edge technology and large-scale architectural problems to work with, in a place where they're not 100% set in stone, so there's a lot of leeway to learn, improve and continue to push it forward.
- Managers are given a lot of tools to help the team, and significant training to improve their leadership.
- Compensation is very competitive, and they offer a lot of perks.
- Career progression is pretty clear an straightforward.","- The products are, to be very honest, boring to work with. While the technical problems are exciting and challenging, it's still not exactly an inspiring product to work with.
- The bar for getting a promotion, albeit clear, is pretty high at the more senior levels, which makes progression feel slow and sometimes unrewarding.
- IT security likes to treat highly-paid software engineers like college students. I mean, forcing developers to work under a proxy with whitelisted sites is pretty silly, and ends up forcing folks to work on their personal computers."
248,Momentive.ai,"Act like they care, but they don't really.",2020-11-17,2.0,Marketing,"Fun company, great perks. Trying to compete in the CX space.",They function as a 100 year old corporation as opposed to the young tech company they are. Backwards policies.

252,Momentive.ai,Good company overall but changed a lot in the past years,2020-11-03,3.0,Customer Success Manager,"Overall a good company, nice culture, friendly coworkers and the offices were nice. They handled the Covid-19 situation quite well and I feel some of the senior leadership is very human and empathetic towards employees. There are some really good initiatives overall in terms of pay equality, D&I, volunteering, donation matching, etc. I initially really loved working there as it was a nice tech environment but on a human scale, with great team members. Everyone is approachable and there's always something going on! It's a good place for a first employment within an interesting industry and a place where you can really be yourself. It's what you'd expect from a tech company!","The company changed a lot over time especially since the acquisition and I feel it's not always for the best. SurveyMonkey has lost some of its earlier small and friendly atmosphere and has been focusing a lot more on revenue/cost-cutting lately. Pay is rather low and not evaluated per location, which isn't fair as some cities have higher costs of living (some NGOs offer much better salaries for similar levels of experience and salary is below average for CS roles) and with Covid, some of the benefits they promoted the most during recruitment got stripped off (which leads to a significant ""pay cut""). Pay has also never been re-evaluated for inflation over the years. The company overall is a nice place to work with great initiatives, but when you look at the department level, then it can be a hit or miss. The first department I worked with had amazing managers and directors that made me feel I belonged in a family and really had our backs. 

In Customer Success though, there's a lot of micro-management and no room for creativity. Everything that you do is scrutinized by your line manager and department directors (who are installing that micro-management/overly controlling mentality below them). The senior leadership in Success is amongst the most controlling I've seen and it just trickles down to line managers and CSMs. Your emails and calls are read and listened to and rated on a weekly basis, you have to jot down every single email you sent (on top of them being recorded) and there's regular critique around everything you do - which is exhausting mentally. It does not foster a positive and friendly environment where one wants to grow and contribute to but rather leads to fatigue and disengagement. A lot of meetings , tasks and 1:1s are very infantilizing and solely focused on $ and number of emails/calls rather than mentorship. In the end it feels like you're more hired to do admin work than use your skills and intelligence. Some of their processes are really inefficient, working and updating manually a number of documents and platforms with the same information, it makes no sense and is taking valuable time off from completing more meaningful work. The justifications they want CSMs to give to customers for price increases or big changes show that some members from management have never worked directly with customers or simply lack empathy. Some other departments in the company are very different though, it all comes down to the department Director/leadership. There is quite some turnover in Success, maybe this should be taken as a sign...

The company is very US-focused and still struggling with it's international outreach, whether it be meeting times, product, employee inclusion or growth. International growth still needs a lot of work and US leadership needs to understand growing outside of the US is not simply replicating US policies and approach in another language."

There is an enormous focus on education and growth – we are spoiled for learning opportunities, even in rough times throughout COVID. While at SurveyMonkey, I've had the opportunity to learn from people who are generous with their time, incredibly intelligent, and very kind, and have seen the direct impact of my growth in the form of role changes, compensation increases, and more. The benefits are excellent (missing the food in-office, plus beautiful views of Portland), but most of all, I wouldn't trade the care of our community for anything. It feels good to work for a company that is focused on making the world a better place – with its products, the way it treats its employees, and the stances it takes in making tech more inclusive and accessible to all groups. Love SurveyMonkey!","Pay is lower than similar roles, with ""excellent benefits"" making up for lower pay.

Good compensation and work from home stipend","Sometimes spend is more important than quality

Some of the middle management lack the necessary skills and experience to lead their teams

There's a disconnect and lack of alignment between teams who interact with the customer at different touchpoints

Surprising lack of technical knowledge about integration products

Recruiting process is long and inefficient and often results in new hires who lack the necessary tech skills for their role (this is also due to how the hiring managers approach their decision making)

The company lacks an educational assistance or professional development program 

Benefits sound good on paper like responsible pto - except this is subject to Manager Approval so the access to pto will vary depending which team you are on and on your manager's approach. Not having a baseline for this creates an inconsistent employee experience."

- Gorgeous offices and work spaces","- Your experience at SM will be defined by the team you join, how much you play into the politics game, and how well your executive leaders get along with other executives. 
- Promotions (at least within the customer success org) are heavily based on favoritism/being overly friendly with CS exec leadership and there are no rubrics for individual growth plans regarding title changes, raises, and overall growth in your role. Your manager will say they have no say in how the department lead distributes their yearly raise allowance, leaving you with no chance to grow via your work outputs, unless you play the company politics game instead
- Very low pay for the tech industry, with the excuse of using all the perks as part of your total comp package.

This is a place of high opportunity if you're willing to reach for it. Always a lot of work and never quite enough people. If you'd like to grab a new project or develop an idea with your bandwidth, you very often can and it's a great way to grow.","SurveyMonkey has been around for 20 years and in those two decades has accumulated tech and design debt. It's being worked on, but can feel limiting if you work in these fields.

366,Momentive.ai,I love working here,2019-10-14,5.0,QA Automation Engineer,"The work life balance here is incredible. I feel valued as a person instead of just an employee. Unlimited PTO that actually means it. I never feel guilty taking time off. 
Free lunch, snacks, and even a beer fridge. 
Fun team building events. Opportunities to volunteer in the local community. 
Exciting work. Lots of room to grow. Great mix of start up zest with real company finances. 
Sense of ownership in work.  Lots of responsibility.","Pay is a little low. 401k program is lackluster. 
But the other benefits make up for it in my mind. 
It can be difficult to work with other teams, especially those in different states and with different priorities."

368,Momentive.ai,Best company I've ever worked for,2019-10-11,5.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"Before I joined SurveyMonkey I was thinking of having to leave tech. Most companies claim to have great work/life balance, but once you get there you find out that it isn't true. But then I joined SurveyMonkey and my outlook has changed completely. I didn't know there was a tech company out there that treated people with respect, invested in their growth.

- Benefits are insane. I'm sure they rival 99% of companies out there.

- Work/life balance is the real deal. Prioritizing health is in our company's values and it isn't just lip service.

- Leadership is professional, transparent, warm, and friendly. They definitely make an effort to get to know folks. No orders from ivory towers here. Zander and the leadership team are class acts!

- No drama! I've never worked at a place with so little gossip, politics, or BS to deal with.",Some legacy code exists but there are active efforts to upgrade older codebases.

Leadership is incredibly approachable. Managers are trained on how to have career conversations so employee growth is a priority. Perks and benefits are top notch.","Base compensation. It's always high for new hires, but salary increases over the years are not enough to keep up with price of living increases or inflation.

* The company's strategic plan has improved and we are executing on it well.
* Work/life balance is second to none; ingrained in the company culture.","* Sometimes we're too ambitious with company-wide initiatives, especially when we try to accomplish too much at once."
383,Momentive.ai,Great place to work,2019-10-02,5.0,Product Manager,"There are many positive aspects of working here. The most important one for me when I joined was the work life balance. Of course, we all have the occasional intense project timelines (which I believe is good to have), but the every day normal number of hours is healthy and manageable.

SurveyMonkey has an ambitious growth goal and has created a clear strategy on how to achieve it. The focus on investing in the right projects are well explained and defined. Overall, I believe all employees understand how they are contributing to the growth and health of the company. The key messages are delivered live (over VC) by the CEO, projecting a sense of togetherness and common goals.

Being in Product Management, it is important for me to work for a company who takes this role seriously. I have seen too many companies where the Product Management team reports into the VP of Engineering, which always creates frustrations and issues. SurveyMonkey does it right, where the PM team is an equal to Development, and both have a C-suite roles, reporting into the same person. Excellent.

Cross-functional teams work well together, the Program Management Office is the glue that helps organize teams and coordination of effort. There are of course the occasional difference of opinions, but ultimately teams collaborate well.

Another important point to note is SurveyMonkey's stance on social issues. From equal pay, gay rights, women in the workplace, diversity and inclusion and many more. I love the fact that more than 50% of the employees are female, as well as in our Executive roles.

Food, snacks are awesome. The downtown office location in Ottawa is great and easy to get to with public transport. The office equipment (chairs, desks, TVs, VC equipment) are top notch and modern. The health and benefits package are generous and on par with other large organization in the area.","Ottawa being a remote office does create some limitations. For example, we are three hours ahead of San Mateo, creating only a relatively small overlap in working hours with our colleagues there. Jumping on late meetings is a bit of a pain, but thankfully it doesn't happen too frequently. 

The Ottawa office only has a handful of products and is heavily weighted towards Engineering and CustOps/Sales. This creates a bit of a limitation in terms of career advancement for Product Managers in Ottawa."

* Work/Life balance is something the company takes at heart","* Engineering work is not (at least from what I have seen) extremely interesting / challenging
* No movement before 1 year.  Don't come here expecting anything to happen fast.
* Growth past senior levels seems to be massively complicated with no real roadmap"
385,Momentive.ai,"Acts big, still small enough to be agile & friendly",2019-09-30,5.0,Senior Manager,"SurveyMonkey is in that sweet spot of a company that offers technology, customer service, perks and benefits like a much larger Silicon Valley-based company, but is still small enough to be nimble, where you know most people's names and can make a direct impact to the bottom line where everyone matters.  Our culture is exceptionally inclusive, the leadership truly cares about workers at all levels, and we have a chance to do good for the world at large, servicing everyone from non-profits to enterprise customers.  We're eager to make a difference within our company and communities.",Typical hyper-growth growing pains are present.  Reimagining how to do our best work at scale while still maintaining the human element in everything we do is a constant push and pull.

* Tons of opportunities to stretch and grow your career
* Leadership is transparent as possible about decisions and upcoming changes
* A ton of market opportunity in the industry and a company that is not afraid to grow into it
* A diverse and engaged workforce
* Coworkers are smart and motivated, and push you to do better work
* Employees who go outside their ""swimlanes"" to fix problems they see are enabled and celebrated
* Company is still small enough that one person can make a big difference
* Good feedback loops for all employees -- it's a rewarding place if you have a growth mindset","There are some people who see problems as opportunities and get excited at the prospect of improving their tools, processes, or the business itself. There are other people who find those problems incredibly frustrating, and are happiest when they can work efficiently within their silo. The former do very well at SurveyMonkey -- there is constant change, and people are asked to stretch, take on new responsibilities, and fix the problems they see. The latter find SurveyMonkey a difficult place to work.

If you are the type of person who likes a static environment with few challenges outside of your core job function, you will likely be very unhappy here."

- some nice other victims","If some of the reviews make SurveyMonkey sound like a techno shan-gri-la and too good to be true then you are right. It is too good to be true. SurveyMonkey management are extremely concerned about image. So much so that they value that image more than they value walking-the-talk. SurveyMonkey is an organization with a management that does not care about its own people and the HR department knows this to the point that its pointless to even bother engaging them when you learn that their ""values"" are only a recruiting ploy. Y'all teach values in management class and then their leadership do the exact opposite. The organizational leadership is rotten or incompetent to the core  with politics or incompetence that politics is the only real game in town. The politics in the organization is so inbred that the only work that can be done are patches on patches. Bullies and harassment, silos and hiring friends to create you own organization. Its a mess. 

Save yourself, don't waste your time.

Hopefully HR will be smart enough to not respond to this because we know you don't or cannot do anything other than offer ""thoughts and prayers""."

Once you get promoted to a certain level, we are encouraged to delegate most of our work down which allows for plenty of time to spend with your family. SurveyMonkey's compensation is generous.","While there is a ""take 4"" program, I was never allowed to take it.  The CEO is not a critical thinker. He needs to pause to strategize and plan for the long term future of company. Sales leadership is questionable but making progress. SurveyMonkey spends too much time focused on D&I programs, benefits, and leave policies rather than executing the business."

In that time, I've been able to rise vertically quite quickly as opportunities have opened for me both within my organization as well as outside of it and even at other office locations. 

Despite the fact that we were several hundred employees when I started and are now well over 1,000, I feel as though my opinion matters. Measuring my impact has been fairly easy, as it's hard not to have a ripple effect if you excel in your role. 

Overall, I've been really happy and even in the most competitive market it's been hard to find a more enticing opportunity elsewhere.",There's constant change and so the demands of management roles often fluctuate.

415,Momentive.ai,"Great co-workers, poor sales leadership, culture of secrecy",2019-07-10,1.0,Account Executive,"I was recruited to SurveyMonkey ahead of the IPO to help form the Enterprise Team.  Product is actually solid and engineering has made strides to make it an enterprise-grade solution that large businesses feel has value.  Can still be a very hard sell when trying to move to businesses from a cheap, self-serve license to an Enterprise license at 3x the cost with relatively few end-user feature additions, but you can get it done selling on security alone.

- Trying to build a culture of inclusivity and curiosity - mostly seminars, employee resource groups are supported.

- Yes, the food is good.  Cheers to the chef and his team.","- Toxic sales leadership:  constant attrition and dismissals had the sales floor on edge during my entire time there
- Lack of transparency from sales leadership around decisions that effect quotas, compensation and overall day to day happiness
- Undue for stress for account executives.  I had never worked at a place where the phrase ""you should feel like you are 100k in debt and your lights and water are going to be turned off.  That's how you should come to work and grind every day.""  That is an actual phrase used by sales leadership many (many) times in pipeline meetings.  I was shocked.

Most of the people that leave for similar roles to the other companies get 50% + their salaries. 
-No matter how hard you try and study- moving to a different role is pure luck. Often, instead of promoting you for your hard work and dedication, they would hire a new person from outside. These things demotivate a lot.
-Very different standards. They celebrate everything, except Christmas (correct: Winter Holiday). Especially in US offices. I've heard stories about how people were reported to HR for having different Christmas attributes. 
-The first two years were fun. But then they started putting politics everywhere. You'd have big screens (in DUBLIN office) showing US President's approval rates. Which politician said what and so on. Of course, it all goes one way and only one opinion is welcomed. NO POLITICS at work is preferred (at least in the offices outside of the US)."

The diversity of our team means always new perspectives to explore, new strategies to implement, and perpetual growth and forward movement. In a tech company I often see a predominant focus on engineering and product teams, but as a CSM I find that my voice is heard in the broader company, and that every department is valued and highly regarded.  We provide solutions to customers that solve real-world problems and provide real-world data. Beyond that, the company focuses on a vast number of initiatives from D&I efforts, to health & safety, to lunch & learns, fitness clubs, and beyond.","As an employee here I am always challenged to grow.  It can be tough to always focus on this forward momentum.  This is not the place to work for people looking for just a ""job"" - here, the role you play really becomes part of who you are."
429,Momentive.ai,Fantastic place to work,2019-05-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This company has definitely had some growing pains over the years, but is constantly trying to improve itself.  There are probably three main things that make it such a great company to work for:

1) The people.  It really makes a huge difference coming to work when the people around you are so great to work with.  There is a general positive and collaborative attitude that really goes a long way.

2) Learning and improvement.  There is always something new to work on and learn here, and although the trend towards improved processes and tools is not always up and to the right, in general we are continually getting better.

3) The opportunities.  If you are a self-starter, love finding solutions to problems and not being confined to your lane - this is a great place to be.  I love that I've been able to take on all kinds of interesting problems that did not directly relate to my team or role and that the company is still small enough that individuals can have outsize impact.","Some of the process improvements have been net-negative at first, requiring course correction that could have been avoided.

As a whole, SurveyMonkey truly cares about its employees, and makes an actual effort for equity and inclusion.  Pay is average if you just look at salary, but the great benefits (equity, meals 8 times a week, commuter benefit, gym benefit) make up for it!","As others have said, growing pains as the company gets larger, cross functional teams are more siloed than in the past.

Some of my best friends were made at SurveyMonkey. Truly excellent benefits. Fantastic work-life balance. I had a great journey at SurveyMonkey and I'm super glad I worked there for as long as I did.,"Especially for those going through the Customer Service route, upward mobility can be really tough. There's a path for moving directly up the Customer Service path, but if you are interested in other departments, like development, survey research, or basically anything non-sales related, there is essentially no support. And even when you do pursue and obtain qualifications on your own time, the company will typically fill any openings from outside.

I also worry about some business decisions. Sometimes I think we pour our hearts and souls into products that are characterized as being innovative, but really are probably useless. The company doesn't like to admit failure or learn from their mistakes when it comes to new products, or even adapt quickly."

The leadership team is top notch and filled with execs who have been there and done that. You can feel the energy in the halls and at lunch when the cafe fills up. There is plenty of communication from the top through all hands, town halls and regular org email updates. 

The product is fun and everyone uses it so you can tell you're making an impact. The teams are still small but the number of teams has grown tremendously. There is a lot of opportunity to work across several teams in all corners of the company.

Leadership is very accessible and does live up to the company values. The talk is backed up.",A few of the strategic decisions have been terrible and short-sighted. Upward mobility is limited as people tend to stay a while. Budgets have tightened since going public. Comp is middle of the road. The company does try to make up for it in benefits and perks though.

This is especially true if the manager is relatively inexperienced in managing people. Management also seems to make hasty and life altering decisions without any input from the rest of the team.

- Small-company feel: Everyone knows each other by first name, and are always ready to sit down and share a meal
- Make a difference: Everyone is encouraged to work on the important challenges and showcase their work

 SurveyMonkey is unique in that it combines the energy and ability to make an impact of a startup (its still fairly small from an employee standpoint) with the stability and financial security of a market-leading profitable company.

-The business is 20 years old, yet there are a lot of promising opportunities being pursued to drive continued growth
-A very fun, kind, and smart set of colleagues to collaborate with. The people here are really special, and the vast majority care a lot about each other and their work

There are a lot of technologies we are shifting too. 
* Caution: if you land at SurveyMonkey early in your career, you may think that the grass may be greener elsewhere and end up leaving SurveyMonkey prematurely. Resist this temptation. It's a red herring!

SurveyMonkey is a fairly well-known brand. It's not strange to see a story in the national news and be able to honestly say: ""I worked on that!""

Other reviews are not lying about the free meals. Nobody has mentioned that the meals are prepared by an excellent on-site chef with a full staff, with a decent array of options to support many diets.

The commitment to diversity is real. This is an especially good place to start if you are a woman and/or a minority trying to break into software development or product management.

No brogrammers. The engineering culture is basically the opposite of Uber. Nearly everyone is intelligent, friendly, and helpful in person.","Full-time engineers are treated like minor royalty. Others face a tougher time.

Lots of legacy code and tech debt left over from various initiatives. Cross-team communication withered away to almost nothing after a few key leaders left, and many teams tend to see messaging as a nuisance, not a tool.

Training and documentation for internal tools is nearly nonexistent, and support for internal tools is stretched thin at the best of times. Be prepared to spend days diving source code and begging for help from old-timers when you need to bring up a development environment just to start working."

Every 6-12 months the company over invests in a new strategy, throws everything at it and when it doesn't immediately produce 50 point margins, abandons it. And, it abandons you too. Lay offs are common. So, if you're 25 and just out of college and you want to work in a fun office for a year or two before you're inevitably laid off, this is the place for you. If you fall outside that box, and have any obligations (mortgage, spouse, etc.) look elsewhere. There's no lateral/upward move available either."

They pay fairly ok, and benefits are above average too. 

Offices are great and new location on the way looks super cool too.

They are a well-known logo although still perceived as a “throw away” purchase but people do know you.

It is a good place to learn the ropes for a low to medium Lead Gen and Inside Sales person – you’ll work with a good team, learn good some techniques and then when you want to move up and regularly sell $50K - $150K+ deals then you look elsewhere. 

It’s an awesome low-medium product for low-medium career stage sales people.","Little to no chance of moving up the chain from where you are hired and within 18 months you’ll be managed by a new hire to the company. Wherever you start, unless it’s is a low level newbie type job, then that is where you will stay.

Get some experienced leaders – it was mentioned before but some of the senior staff have little prior experience running a sales team in the business space.

Hanging on to the “disruptive” tag when it is actually a race to the bottom to be the lower end of the research space. No big logo firms view SurveyMonkey as strategic to their growth (sure the companies who cannot afford the A-players do but given the choice for truly important research then they would rather have the full service companies and instead use SurveyMonkey as a point vendor only for the quick and dirty pieces of work [which they actually do really well]). Being faster and easier AKA cheap and quick.

It is generally never straight forward to put a slightly complicated deal together, so many things do not deliver or need constant project management.

It’s a business geared towards an inside team of lower order value experienced sales people just how many people are regularly closing deals over $100K?"

Hiring the outgoing CEO raised a lot of eyebrows and his 5 month tenure is proof in the pudding.  Did you really think an HP exec was capable of accelerating a mid-stage startup?

Strategy lacks clear vision and overall, the sales team is quite literally treated like an afterthought. Be prepared to feel like your department is at the very bottom of the totem pole

Laughable presidents club - an extra day of SKO? Really? The sad part is that this was the 2nd year that they committed this type of atrocity.

The responsible PTO policy (unlimited!) and benefits are amazing. You can tell from how employees are treated that the company is doing really well, and that's a great feeling.","As a small company we seem to run a bit lean, which is challenging. There's not much ability to delegate when needed, and sometimes due to lack of resources (mostly staff) it's a challenge to get the things you feel are a priority, to be seen and treated as such by others.

The sales cycles are quick(2 weeks) and the best part about this product is it's not a one and done product. Once you get your foot in the door with a company you can continue to sell them the same product over and over again.

Salary and Comp plan are on the higher end of competitive for the area and the company is Pre-IPO so you can get some equity. The territories are cut as fair as I have seen them for any company I have worked for. I would not say their are ""haves and have nots"" here. Each territory seems to be fairly equal.

Benefits are great, unlimited PTO(within reason), catered lunch twice a week and as many snacks and drinks available as you can wrap your head around. This is one of the nicest offices I have ever seen period. Modern but comfortable. The game room is great but the real prize is the roof deck. Right in downtown Palo Alto so the weather is great and with WiFi access on the roof it's great to be able to catch some sun while you do your job.

All in all the company treats you like an adult. No one is breathing down your neck and micromanaging you. They expect you to know how to sell and get the job done.","Because the Audience team is still a ""startup within a startup"" there are some growing pains due to lack of head count. Having a sales team is new to the company and they are learning as they go so the processes are in a constant flux and on outside the box deals it can be harder to get the deal done internally than externally.

Despite lots of improvements, legacy architecture and codebase can create headaches"

Centrally located office, plenty of small perks.","Absolutely no opportunity for professional advancement from the customer support team, no matter how much ambition you show. Too much corporate double-speak from upper management."

619,Momentive.ai,Best culture I have seen at a company without sacrificing professionalism,2011-11-17,5.0,Software Engineer,"The people. The food. The pay.  The opportunities.

The monkey has a very chill environment.  The company has acquired three companies over the past couple years, the biggest of which was Wufoo.  One of the things that made the Wufoo acquisition so seamless was that the teams get along so well.  

There is also a great snack bar at each office, and there is usually a well catered meal once a week with plenty of left overs that last a couple extra days, and a catered brunch/breakfast one morning a week.

The company also has a very stable and impressive revenue while remaining relatively small (~100 people in 2011).  This allows the company to offer very competitive salaries.

Finally, the company is re-envisioning every product from the ground up to use modern web technologies with better interaction, so it is a perfect place to get a great experience using new technologies while also maintaining the product's scalability for use by millions of users.  In addition, many completely new features are being added to the product, if you're more interested in breaking into new products.

For those who are technical - SurveyMonkey operates on a .NET framework, but the architecture is migrating to Python and Pyramid.  The Python engineers there are top notch, so it's a great place to work if you are interested in getting Python experience, especially in a web environment.  There is also a TON of front end work to be done, especially javascript, and the front end team is also very talented and includes the creator of css-tricks.com (originally from Wufoo).","They are still organizing a system for defining the job hierarchy and advancement.  At this point, management is pretty horizontal there, which personally I love, but for those that like roles to be more concretely defined, it might not be your cup of tea"
