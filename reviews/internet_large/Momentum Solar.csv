The expected schedule is 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. This is unsustainable and most specialist don’t last long enough to ever see install commissions. This company will do all they can to keep from paying you out, yet promise you the American dream as far as pay goes."
111,Momentum Solar,Avoid this company like the plague,2022-01-03,1.0,Solar Specialist,"- generally friendly coworkers, but most of them will leave anyways","- you’re selling a product that doesn’t benefit the customer. By the end of my first month doing sales, I knew that I was lying to our customers every time I gave the pitch, and it felt too immoral. Unless you’re the kind of salesperson that can continuously screw people over and remain unconcerned about it, this isn’t for you.
- salary is basically nonexistent. They pay $500/week, so after taxes that’s around $450 or less. Each week you’ll be driving between 40 minutes-2 hours to get to an appointment, 6 (sometimes 7) days per week without compensation for gas or tolls. My average day consisted of driving somewhere between 4 and 9 hours.
- most of their “hot leads” are dead ends. The majority of appointments that I went to (after driving usually an hour or more) were people who weren’t home and wouldn’t answer their phone, people that already canceled or rescheduled their appointment, and those that didn’t actually qualify due to credit score, tree shading, or zoning. Have fun driving for 8 hours when you may not even get your foot into any of the houses they send you to.
- they tell you that your earning potential is really high when it isn’t. They pay 8 cents per kw, when the industry standard is 25-30. This may not sound like a lot, but it adds up to thousands of lost dollars. They also continuously tell you to “just be patient” for your first sale commissions to be processed and that it only takes two weeks, but what they don’t tell you is that it can take up to several. You can’t exactly be patient when you can’t pay your bills on their “salary”. And since the salary basically just pays for your gas and tolls, most of my coworkers were forced to quit within the first several weeks because they couldn’t pay their bills.
- In my first 4 weeks, I witnessed my training class of 9 drop to 5. By the time I quit, there were two others remaining. As of now, there is one left. I witnessed over a dozen people either quit or get fired while I was there, including my trainer and the state manager within 3 weeks of starting my job. There are about 3 employees in the jersey offices that have been with the company for over a year—so much for retention of talent."

Since the company refuses to hire- will often make its employees work several full time jobs to cover those who have separated, while expecting to maintain everything at 200% productivity
The company also has a ""policy"" to not pay out PTO that was earned while employed
The company discourages the use of earned time off, because you have to maintain the work level even if you take a day off.
The company encourages a ""why wait"" policy as in why wait to do the work when you can do it right now- work overtime to get it done as fast as possible but has made it a policy to not pay overtime
Managers often employ the tactic to move employees to salary to avoid paying overtime, so the employees can work as much as they want.

14 hour days, 6 days a week burned me out. Managers refusing to give time off for doctors appointments. 

The company misrepresented the earning potential. They say on average you’ll make $80K. I’m making 26K without a single commission in over 60 days. 

Sales are almost impossible. I’ve made 7 sales in two months, 60% of them cancelled. Customers who do want solar often don’t qualify because of bad credit. 

Management cost me sales. Rude and SUPER pushy sales management has pissed off my customers and got me kicked out of houses. 

The company is unethical. They charge $4.25 per kilowatt hour when the average system costs $2.6 per kilowatt hour. That’s almost double. 

Please, don’t assume you’re unique. This sales job and company are unorganized and unethical. 

I’ve had 5 managers since I started. The guy who hired me was fired for sexual harassment.

I guess it can vary from office to office but the culture in the Houston office while I was there was very inconsistent. A revolving door none the likes I’ve ever seen before. I started in March of 2021, and by July of the same year, I was the longest tenured employee in my office. To me, it seems company wide that whole business model is riding the hot naive rookie hand and giving a select few veterans what they want to stay, if they make it that long. For someone with no industry experience it seems like a place you can make a lot of money, but for an industry veteran, the pay structure if I could sum it up in one word… disrespectful.

245,Momentum Solar,BAIT AND SWITCH,2021-06-02,1.0,Solar Specialist,Lots of time to listen to your favorite podcasts while you spend hours driving very far away from your area,"Basically everything about this company is a con. I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews on glassdoor before accepting the position. What a tremendous waste of 6 months. The ""sign-on bonus"" that they advertise is not real. They do not give you a sign-on bonus. They offer a performance based incentive that equals out to around $10,000, but here's the catch; it's unattainable. Not one person received it during my time there. It's fake and I wish someone had told me that before I joined the company because I was really banking on that. They give preference to certain employees.  Momentum's management is full of arrogant, slimy  salesmen that give the rest of us a bad name. I left as soon as I found another job. Take my advice. Move along. Save yourself the headache and find a different position. Momentum does not hire people that they care to keep around. The business model is a scam and they do not live up to the promises they make in the ridiculous script. I could go on for hours about how awful this place is. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. OH YEAH I ALMOST FORGOT, they have yet to pay me the rest of my commission and it has been 6+ weeks since my last day. This company is dishonest and they treat their employees and customers like trash. You've been warned."

277,Momentum Solar,Stay Far Away,2021-05-19,1.0,Solar Consultant,They set your appointments for you,Nothing that they say is true in training except the set appointments for you. Even then the appointments aren’t strong and their is really no help. High pressure sales tactics. On top of that they say we try not to send you out of your area but I’ve been here for 3 months and have only had 3 appointments in my area I’ve been sent to Anywhere from an hour to 2 and a half hours away with no warning or consideration for my time. And most of the time they weren’t confirmed appointments so I’d drive all the way to an apt and they’d already cancelled or just wouldn’t be there. I’ll tell you this. There’s certain people this office gravitates to if you know what I mean. I’m not saying the whole company is like this but the Austin Office definitely needs some work.

280,Momentum Solar,NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED,2021-05-18,2.0,Solar Specialist,"The staff and the people that you meet are pretty cool. When come the other solar specialist, you meet people who are motivated and are straight up hustlers.","There is probably going to be 5 star review right after this saying how great the job is but it is made by either a computer or by the company. The money is over blown. I have personally had 3 projects installed and still have received not received commission for my work. You make about a $1000 (before taxes) for two weeks of work and you work 6 days a week. Oh yeah and your on the clock for almost 12 hours a day. I thought it was pretty chill in the beginning until they start sending you to appointments that are an hour and half away and it’s a no show or better yet cancelled on the drive there and your about 5 minutes away from the appointment. They also do not compensate for gas so take that out of your $1000. And your making about $880 ( before taxes) for two weeks of work. You better have money stashed away for maintenance because while working there I caught two flats and I only worked for the company for 3 months, will not be compensated for that either. Social life forget about it. Also it’s also high pressure sales so if you don’t sell get ready to get your job threatened. Also food for thought nobody is experienced. To give an idea I worked in Pennsylvania and my manager was only with the company for a year and he was the manager of an entire state of PA and managing almost 30 Reps, and he lived in NY. It might sound good but when you start looking into the financials and how utility companies operate each state is different and think about any job and career a year of experience is not nearly enough experience to lead an entire team. I say this type of job is for somebody who is desperate, but certainly not a long term play. Be very wary and carefully read the reviews, the signs are there to watch out."

If you are willing to sacrifice work life balance, you can make decent money.","Sales reps are expected to be on call 6-7 days a week from 8am-9pm and they don't really care about drive time. You typically get a text 2-3 hours before an appointment with an address and you HAVE to show up at that time and you aren't able to make contact with the customer first.

You're also expected to be a scripted sales person and pressure home owners into making a decision on the spot. if you don't they will provide you with fewer and lower quality leads.

And will threaten your job constantly.,The company is a scam company. They lie about everything. From the amount of installs to the longevity of the company. They mark up solar an obscene amount and get new reps to lie to customers because they don’t know any better. Momentum regularly does not pay their reps. They lie and feed you a pipe dream that is not achievable for 99% of the office. What they will do is have you drive at least 2 hours away from any of your appointments for an unconfirmed appointment because they do not care about their reps they care about their bottom line. Their pay of 8 cents is a joke when compared to the rest of the industry.  They turn and burn reps is insane. Their office in Tampa does not have a rep that’s been with the company longer than a year should tell you everything you need to know. It will cost you about $20-$30 a day driving around to go to unconfirmed appointments. They also show extreme favoritism to the point it will make you feel discriminated against. Good luck receiving your check and what you are supposed to get paid because you won’t. Their are much better sales organization that build you into better people like Power Home Remodeling Group or if you want to be in Solar look at solar bear. This company is terrible.

396,Momentum Solar,Shocked this company still has 4 stars,2021-03-19,1.0,Sales Team Leader,It’s possible to have a run of really high commission checks.,"Anything you make they can claw back when jobs cancel (which is more than 50% for top performers.) So a top performer can end up literally in debt to the company. 

They say they have the best quality appointments and that they spend $700 qualifying appointments. This is a lie and I know it from a management level. They may spend that much by the time the top appointments close, but they have no problem sending sales reps 3 hours away for an unconfirmed, unqualified appointment. From the company’s perspective they have nothing to lose because they don’t reimburse for travel expenses and they don’t pay reps for their time if they don’t close an appt or if the client is a no show. It is not uncommon for a rep to be on the road for 14 hours and never sit with a homeowner. From a management posture I was tricked into convincing a low performing rep to come in on his one day off (you work 6 days a week) and drive 2 hours to a no show appointment. 


They routinely encourage veteran reps to lie about what they’re making to newer staff to “keep morale up.” I have caught managers and coworkers lying about what they drive and where they live to sell a dream to commission only staff. One trainer has even used a prop paycheck to convince new hires they made $60,000 in a two week cycle. It’s fake! Suggestions for improvement are treated like complaints and people with suggestions are trouble makers.

LIED TO HOMEOWNERS. This is common place since you only get one shot to close and are penalized if you don’t. Sales reps and managers openly discuss methods of getting clients to sign without reading paperwork. Lies about the process and the company are literally part of the script. 

There is an always be closing culture where even if you close 10
Appointments in a row, if you don’t close your next appointment they’ll start giving you the unqualified appts until you earn your way back to the top. That included appts where the client wants to reschedule and sign at a later date. This is considered a “no sale” and treated like a failure.

50 for any other further out
You can set 8-15 a week but only 1 or 2 will sit.

Work from 9-6 with an hour unpaid lunch.
Lots of cold to warm calling, lots of hang ups but you can relax at your home. 
Training was sufficient. 1 and a half weeks then onto the phones.
Base pay could be better though","Base pay is only 11 an hour

580,Momentum Solar,Cold calling,2020-11-25,1.0,Call Center Representative,I enjoy the opportunity to promote solar power and help the environment.,They lied from day one and told us we weren’t cold calling. The individuals you call are cold calls plain and simple!

587,Momentum Solar,Terrible company taking advantage of blue collar workers,2020-11-13,1.0,Field/Outdoor Sales and Marketing,There are absolutely no pros whatsoever.,"They hired me under the premise of being an appointment setter in the office. But they changed it it up so that I was a door to door salesperson with the same minimum wage and no commissions. Every week they changed from having to need a certain amount of APPOINTMENTS to then CONFIRMED APPOINTMENTS to then SIT DOWN AAPOINTMENTS  THEN SALES. If anyone didn't meet these ever changing quotas then they would be immediately fired.  Since there is no clock in/out system if an employee was even 2 min late they would get a written warning, and if that happened more than once they would be terminated. 
They would have female employees out alone late at night with no backup, going into the sketchiest neighborhoods. There was also a work culture of very disrespectful behavior and words towards female employees. A coworker requested time off due to COVID and was immediately fired without any recourse.
Anyone who wasn't management was basically being taken advantage of when it came to their time, money, and skillset. 

Save yourself and stay away from this awful company."

It is a different type of work and not traditional. Work from home as a base, some times very relaxed. Typically meeting really nice homeowners who care about bettering their future and the environment. For people people who have sales experience and been successful, and those who don’t have a family or hobby, this will be a perfect fit so you can be devoted to the success that can be! Training teaches you a lot about solar! Tons of upward movement available IF you drink the “Kool-aid” and be a company sucker at all hours (think helping mentor after 10 pm on Zoom.)","Seems to be a company culture of quick to fire and super sales pressure. Expected to be connected to your texts and WhatsAp all day, no response in 15 minutes could mean termination. Cannot plan anything since it is an “on call” position from 8:30 am to 9 pm, or you need to request time off from scheduling. Do expect to work late late frequently. Do expect to have to drive 80+ miles to an appointment and have it cancel. This may be once a week or more. No pay for phone usage or car usage is wrong because you will put 1000 miles a week on your vehicle. Because it is a stop sell, there is a lot of deals that you lose so I am not sure where they get the 6 figure commission number from."

642,Momentum Solar,Not worth the time or effort put in.,2020-07-11,2.0,Solar Consultant,"Product they have you selling is a seemingly great product. In theory their commission structure could pay well, but it's dependant on how much solar paneling can be put into a client's roof, which is out of your control.","When you are first hired on they have you come to the nearest large scale office for orientation and training for a week and a half (for me was in the next state over ~70 hour drive) and will pay for a hotel. However they trick you by your first night having you stay in a nice hotel room, but then book you in the cheapest hotel possible for the rest of the nights.

When trainers were asked about any reimbursement for food or if there was a daily allowance for such, person asking was laughed at by the trainer. So if you don't have any money to buy food when you go for training make sure you bring some.

For training you spend most of it trying to memorize and recite a 4-5 page script that you will go rattle off a bunch of extra info to the eventually clients, including parts about boasting awards that people will not care about.

You're always on the clock from early morning to evening, you just wait at home and will receive a text and email about an appointment you have to go to about 2-3 hours ahead of time, so you will have a tough time trying to make plans. And even then an appointment could end up being a waste if the customer can not afford it, doesn't pass a credit check, or if the customer who is supposed to confirm the appointment before it's assigned to anyone doesn't answer the door or is not home. If you are not busy with appointments you are (while not obligated) expected to go door to door for sales.

You are told during interviews, orientation, and training that you will be given at least 10-15 appointments a week. However in my experience I got about 2 appointments in the month I worked there. When talked to management about the issue I was told I don't have the drive for the position and was fired over the phone. I kept in contact with some of the people in my original training group and a lot of them seemed to have the same or similar experience.

All in all, it seems to be a company that promises a lot but once it comes down to it starts to feel less like a stable job but instead just a few steps above pyramid scheme in just how shady their practices feel."

It's easy to work from home in this job with just a good internet connection and a dedicated office space (distraction free). They hand out time and OT like it's nothing. Base pay is $10/hr +commissions. Not hard to get into OT every week.,"98% of your day will be cold-calling people to convince them to meet in person with a Solar Rep. It will be advertised that you just need to hit some basic goals to do well (set 4-5 appts a day, half of those should be same day or next day) but the leads are crap and are annoyed that you keep calling. Commonly calling 300-600 leads a day. Every couple of weeks the schedule changes abruptly and teams are shuffled around meaning you have a new supervisor and may be working different hours or days. YOU WILL BE 'REQUIRED' TO WORK ON DAYS THAT YOU ARE SCHEDULED OFF AT THE END OF EACH MONTH. They will say that they need a big push to finish the month out strong and say we need everyone in on [day that was your only day off]. But again, see above about plentiful OT. 

SUPERVISORS ACTIVELY ENCOURAGE YOU TO LIE TO CUSTOMERS about having representatives in their area as well as how much they would be saving with our solar systems. 
YOU ONLY GET PAID COMMISSIONS ON APPOINTMENTS THAT SIT. Appointments may not qualify or other Momentum staff may reschedule them or the home owner may cancel at any time including at the door.

664,Momentum Solar,Don't even think about working here,2020-04-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Not much good to say about it,"Let me be brief- but very clear about what you can expect from working here:

- The culture is TOXIC
- expect to work every day of the week. ESPECIALLY weekends. You won't have a life on Fridays, saturdays, and sundays. They say they give you a day off, but your manager will guilt you into working on your day off.
- during the week, you are working from 9a to 9p or later. You WILL burn out.
-memorizing a script which does a very poor job of getting customers attention (no, they don't want to hear about the ceo, cfo, and cro and their entire life story)
- take a look at the CEO's instagram- there have been customers who have looked him up, just for me to be caught off guard with an upset client that scrapped the deal saying they would never buy from a company who has someone like that leading the company. You're gonna work your life away this guy, and get hardly anything in return.
- Your manager will harass you during appointments and push you to close deals that may not be in the best interest of the customer. The company has no idea how severe the backlash is going to be if they keep this up.
-They send better appointments to their favorite reps. Expect to have a lot of Customer No shows, credit fails, and homes that are a bad fit for solar.
- By the way, did I mention the harassing messages and emails from management? It's a problem, and they are lucky that they aren't in huge legal trouble as a result.
- They push you to sell systems regardless of the offset size. they say ""any solar is better than no solar"". It's just not the case. Customers will be stuck with a bill that significantly increases their power costs, and YOU will be the one they call and complain to, regardless of how much you explain how it works. If you're in the appointment and don't close the deal, you'll be reprimanded by your manager for not closing the deal. And then you'll be sent to poor opportunities.
-The turnover is insane. Like something I've never seen before. You'll be burned out by the management, pushy sales tactics that they force you to implement.

I'm going to repeat this- the way Managers and Executives treat their sales reps and employees is straight up harassment. It's only a matter of time before they wind up in lawsuits and a crumbling workforce for the way they treat their people.

If you value your time, career, and personal life, you won't work for Momentum."
665,Momentum Solar,The worse job I have ever worked for and I have been in sales for 11 years. If I could put negative stars I would.,2020-03-14,1.0,Solar Specialist,If you love being harassed by other employees that have been there longer and not making money and not get your last paycheck when you give them your oficial 2 week notice than yes these are the pros,"Poor management.
Pay structure is looking for how to pay you less for your work.
Bad training.
When you leave because it's not working out because they will take leads away from you to choke you out they won't even give you what they legally owe you so your in double trouble.
They promise 1 to 3 leads a day. It's a lie.
They send you to appointments that all that person wants is to sue momentum because she was on a do not call list and momentum won't stop calling them so you will deal with this and more.
Managers will take you off leads for anything and one of those things is you have to write a good review here to be put on leads again so that how they get good reviews."

Every once in a while bonuses are offered by completing so many jobs for the month. You are split into crews with a foreman and generally form a strong bond with your crew and make friends. It is very easy to move up in the ranks (installer, roof lead, foreman) quickly if you are a hard worker at this company.",Very time consuming and it can be very fast paced with a high pressure to complete a new job every single day.

671,Momentum Solar,be ready,2020-02-12,2.0,Solar Specialist,You can make money. There are two or three people making great money. Everyone else makes bare minimum.,"pay structure is horrible. You basically owe the company money every time you have a slow two weeks.. which happens. you get decent leads, top performers get the best. You work on call for 8am-9am. Nothing is anyones fault other than your own.  You should expect to work 6-7 days a week and get scolded over everything that is out of your control.  its commission only but you get a base pay of $500 per week that just gets deducted out of your ""bank"" so if you don't make a sale in two weeks because they only give you 6 leads MAYBE... probably less, you are already starting in the negatives. they don't give very many appointments right out of training so unless you have a large family that you will sell solar too, you are asking to be frustrated."

I was asked to do things of questionable legality such as manipulate customer signatures and back date documents. Perfection is expected with little training. No matter how intelligent or hard-working you are, you will be condescended to by unstable, aggressive, and inexperienced management. Employees are afraid to stand up for themselves as the company takes great pride in their right to fire at will.
This is not a place to learn, grow, or develop a career, those that are moving up quickly do so because so many people get fired and quit. 
Management is entitled and ignorant. Extremely unprofessional environment with vulgar music and language, marijuana, tobacco, and alcohol use on premises. This seems to create an image of a laid back, carefree environment but only in specific moments. If you respond in kind to this environment (late or make a mistake) you will be reprimanded and have your job threatened, no matter how much overtime you are putting in or records you are breaking for the company.

Corporate keeps sending down messages on how they want us heading back to the warehouse at 5 PM to be home by dinner, but that just doesnt happen in the field.   

Corporate says that if we see lightning ANYWHERE to get off roof and wait 30 minutes with no lightning to get back up.  BUT, we have to finish the job that day.  BUT, we need to pack up (can take upwards of an hour) and leave the job by 5 PM.  BUT, we can't get back on the roof until 30 minutes after lightning.  BUT, we have to finish that day.  See the pattern?  All this with understaffed crew because people were fed up with nonsense and quit or got fired for stupid reasons.

They also treat sales like disposable peons.  They use them as free lead generators while the managers are the ones who go back for the second meetings to close the deals and they cut the sales guys out of the comission.  They also require them  to use their own vehicles.  (They owe a good friend of mine ofer $15K in commission and haven't paid him)"

My bosses give me the tools I need to be successful and value my opinion on things. I learn from them and get better everyday. 

Best thing is the pay and people. Senior VP of call center is a no nonsense guy, cares about us and is very dedicated.

If you are good at your job and determined, you can make good money while helping the environment with green energy and saving homeowners money.   I managed to pay off a lot of debt by being successful here and it turned my life around.

As for the company, Momentum really is the fastest growing solar company in the nation right now, so there are new positions opening up all the time.  You can move up if you prove yourself to be an asset.  They are careful about who they try to sell to as well.  The homeowner has to be a good fit to save money by going solar or they won't consider them as a prospective customer.  This can make it hard to get sales sometimes because they disqualify so many prospective customers, but it's the responsible way to market.","We call it the ""solar coaster."" There are a lot of ups and downs.  One week you are doing really well, the next is a struggle.  The reality is, many people also just won't have what it takes to be successful here.  It takes a special breed to last as a lead generator going door to door because it can be very draining, both physically and mentally.  It is simultaneously one of the easiest jobs and hardest.

The biggest con though is that there is a 6 day week workweek and upper management is very inflexible about it.  Expect work to become your life and to have no time or energy for anything else in your life.  Senior management is completely cold about it.  ""Go work somewhere else"" is what they will tell you if you express concern about it."

They do not care where you live, they will staff you anywhere and expect you to drive there. Sometimes its paid, and sometimes it isn't. They advertise this position for 20/hour and when you go for your interview you can choose 15/hour plus commission, but they assure you, you will make so much commission and it will end up being more than 20. Totally false. I highly doubt they would even let you ""choose"" 20/hour, thats just to get you in the door, another lie. Events were mostly god awful boring and people are not making leads or sales. They say they reimburse you for lunch on a 8 hour shift- and when you submit your receipt, surprise! They don't ""in this case."" Of course. I was also told when I started that I could work a certain number of hours per week, and they later rescinded that and said if I didn't open up my availability completely then they would fire me, knowing that I have a full time job and cannot do that. They also don't put alot of thought into which events they book- many times I worked several hour events and nobody staffed there got a single lead all day (Lacrosse tournament...?) Events are way overstaffed, they would have up to 4 people working 1 table for no discernable reason (awkward.) Hey, thats fine, but dont make the same mistake for the same event all weekend. You also have to heckle people at street fairs and pressure the other vendors to go solar in their personal homes- hopefully you're into that."
