I learned a ton, and went from being that person who didn’t know what an IRA is to being a dedicated buy-and-hold investor.","Editorial doesn’t pay enough, especially when you’re constantly exposed to people who have built wealth doing all kinds of other things. I personally left bc I can make a lot more money working on other content products that don’t require 1500-2500 words output a day.

the Recruitment process

- The interview process was well thought out and accommodated my schedule.

19,Motley Fool,Working here is like a dream,2021-08-23,5.0,SEO Content Strategist,"WFH options
Open communication from management
Excellent health insurance
Competitive salary
Incredible investing education. Seriously floored by how much I’ve accumulated simply by learning at work and using my employee benefit of access to premium services.
Great coworkers (Our hiring process is not easy—and Fools collectively benefit from that, as we are surrounded by people who really want to be here.)
CEO Tom Gardner is not only brilliant and forward-thinking, but he is a sincerely kind, caring person who is passionate about making others’ lives better. True servant leader. (And I’d say the exact same thing for co-founder David Gardner—I love David’s mentality of “investing for the world you want to see.”)","We are, at the time of this review, not as diverse as we need to be. (The company is currently hard at work to create more diversity and foster inclusion among Fools. Unfortunately there’s no magical overnight remedy, but during the time I have been here, there has been a consistent and significant focus on making improvements on this front.)"
20,Motley Fool,Employees are treated like royalty,2021-06-28,5.0,Managing Editor,"I feel like an abused puppy finally finding her forever home. I am blown away by how generous and supportive the company is to its employees. The compensation is great, but it's more than that: unlimited vacation time, flexible scheduling, programs for mental health and wellness, reimbursement for health and wellness, incredible insurance and dental, a system for rewarding coworkers, and just overall an encouraging and supportive environment. I didn't know it was possible for a big company to treat its employees so well, and it kind of has me waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm sure I'll be introduced to the head of the department for clubbing baby seals any day now.","Things move incredibly fast. A tool that was standard practice when I was hired, is now being phased out less than 6 months later. There's always something going on, and if you can't keep up with the pace in which decisions are made, you'll get left in the dust."
21,Motley Fool,Great benefits if you can maintain toxic positivity,2021-06-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The benefits are SOLID. If you have kids, need physical therapy, and appreciate the gift of company stock. There is an environment conducive to learning new skills if you mingle well with the right people at the right moment. There is flexibility to try different tasks, which can lead to shifting positions in new departments. If you are someone who thrives on pivoting to implement changes, you will not be bored. Mix with the right people, and you can find opportunities to switch departments.","If you decide to take one of the opportunities to work with a different department, be prepared to work on your normal full-time job and the additional tasks without any firm commitment to a position elsewhere. If you do receive a desired promotion, you may later be handed another ‘promotion’ into a new position where they simply need bodies. It may not be the best fit for you, and it is tricky to decline such moves.

The culture that initially functioned to serve a much smaller company. Activities were designed to foster a sense of knowing everyone at the company, including activities (frequently alcohol centered) offering a somewhat casual, even party-like atmosphere in the office. 

Unfortunately, the bedrock of the company culture and the way it is implemented is frequently seeded with toxic positivity. Newly promoted management is given little to no training for functioning with direct reports, and as a result there are near constant issues with communication throughout the company. Accountability for anyone in higher management is also extremely difficult to obtain. 

The primary company messaging is convoluted, as employees are told loudly to express ideas and come forward about any issues without worry of job loss. However it is not unprecedented to arrive back at work post leave and find that the job once held has changed or simply no longer exists. Again, this is tricky to resolve short of simply complying with the change. 

The benefit of developing friendships that with the hiring of many interesting people is much tricker to maintain. Since the pandemic hit, the company has transitioned to an almost entirely digital presence. Many of the touted culture benefits are lost in the process. 

All of that said, if you keep your head down, you can enjoy nice healthcare, gain some new skills and financial knowledge, and meet some cool people. Be guarded with any feelings of discontent."
22,Motley Fool,Culture unlike any other company,2021-06-01,5.0,SEO Content Strategist,"The Fool really tries to walk the walk when it comes to company culture, more so than any other company I've ever worked for. Benefits are incredible and there is an emphasis on bringing your whole self to work everyone. Plus, you've got autonomy to work on what you're passionate about.","You might get whiplash from all the pivoting, and while the autonomy can be a good thing, it also can lead to a bunch of people working on stuff in silos and not really connecting the dots."

Beyond the countless benefits offered to us (incredible health insurance plan, pet insurance, access to mental health resources, wellness reimbursements, unlimited PTO, $1,000 to put into your brokerage account when you start, company equity, etc.) there is so much to say about the care our leaders and people team have for the rest of the company.

We're surveyed several times a year about our happiness and professional satisfaction. We're encouraged to get to know others at the company in whatever ways we can and management has done an incredible job of making this possible during Covid. 

I plan to stay here for as long as possible. If you're wondering if everything you read online about TMF's culture is true, I can assure you, it is. It's been so life-changing to work here.","Sometimes, things are so laid back that important work gets pushed to the side. But other than that, none."

They work hard to ensure that they know the levels of employee satisfaction, and putting forward improvements as a result. This applies to benefits, working conditions, your work environment, all the facets of work. They also believe that it is important to have a good work-life balance.

I got hired during the pandemic - the company really tries hard to make everyone feel included, even new employees, and constantly puts together virtual events to share internal news, chat with your fellow employees and develop the company culture. We had a cooking class last Friday afternoon.","There's no bonus program based on performance, if that is what you like. Instead, additional compensation is given equally to all permanent employees, in the form of shares.

This organization is very flat, people love to work here and therefore sometimes there aren't clear paths for progression - make sure you figure out what you want your career progression to be - they will help facilitate your progression, but you need to put the work in to get there. You might need to work on your own time to acquire new skills for the position you are targeting, and perhaps assist that other team with some additional work - but this is all voluntary, and its main goal is so you can get that new role."

With other reviews, frequent pros include great people, amazing perks and benefits, and flexible work hours. And it's all true! But did you know that there is a Slack channel with an amateur meteorologist who updates Fools on the weather? Or that we were one of the first companies to go fully virtual in early March 2020 and our People and Tech teams worked hard to make sure we had what we need to work remotely? To this day, Fools work tirelessly to make sure we are staying connected in fun, engaging ways. Or that we have monthly company-wide huddles where Fool leaders review our business numbers and priorities? In those same meetings, there's an open Q&A where anyone can ask any question anonymously or not. 

Everywhere you turn, there's another reason why the Fool is a wonderful place to work.","We aren't the best at saying no, so Fools might end up taking on more than they can handle at times. In addition, it can be tough to turn off work, especially with remote working. These cons are not specific to the Fool though."
34,Motley Fool,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G culture with tech perks,2021-03-10,5.0,Money Manager,"Motley at heart! The Fool embraces DEI at its core. it has a vibe of anti-corporate, anti-boring, anti-drama to it. People (aka Fools) are super bright and brilliant at what they do, yet are truly down-to-earth and collaborative. Usually, the Fools were already successful in their fields in the corporate world. They intentionally chose to come to a less corporate, happier environment at the MF. The company is focused and invests in its culture and employees. The perks are really generous, and are meant to help the Fools become smarter, happier and richer. Thus, people stay with the company for a very long time (more than 10+ years), which is rare these days. The hiring process is generally quite thorough and long, which helps them vet and hire the right folks who work well together and get along nicely.","This employer is definitely not for every employee.

Although it doesn't always get everything right (pretty sure no company does), leadership definitely does legitimately try, and listens, which are very positive attributes.

•	Transparent: Since the beginning of the COVID-19, leadership has given regular updates and kept employees in the know about what is happening and have done a great job of transitioning us into a full remote company. 

•	Community: The Fool is place where you will be challenged and encouraged to be a continued learner.

Even when I first started, people looked to me for advice and suggestions which made me feel immediately like a valued member of the team. Leadership does a great job of informing the company of changes and priorities, so we all know where to best focus our efforts. 

As far as work culture goes, I haven't experienced anything that comes close. Teams go out of their way every day to recognize the successes of others, events are hosted to foster collaboration across business lines, and I'm still learning about new perks/benefits regularly. The insurance is incredible and my boss encourages us to take advantage of the flexible work options/no vacation policy. ""Fun"" as a core value is actually taken seriously.

We work for a great cause, making the world Smarter, Happier and Richer.

- It is hard to get a role here... vacancies are limited because no one seems to leave! Thankfully we’re growing and this opens new roles. If you get the chance to work here I suggest you grab it with both hands.

- If you want a structured career plan this isn’t the place for you.

Amazing people, great perks, flexible schedule, unlimited vacation, great health insurance, awesome outings that facilitate bonding with coworkers. All the surface level things that make people happy and actually enjoy going into the office.","After you've been there for around a year, you start to see how things really work. Once people hit the ~5 year mark, it's almost like they have tenure. It doesn't matter how bad they mess up, how negative of an influence they are, or even how much HR recognizes it; they're protected, promoted, and given too much power. These people rarely leave on their own, which means their roles are never vacant. I've seen so many people held captive because of the possibility of a role they want opening up. What's worse is people who are insanely qualified with multiple masters degrees, designations, certifications, etc. are stuck in roles meant for recent grads until they realize they're worth more or until they're pushed out (which seems to be the Fool way).  I wholeheartedly believe Tom and David care about every employee, but I don't think any complaints of this nature ever reach them."

Despite wellness programs and benefits that compensate up to $75 for gym memberships a month, all the free food adds up if you are not careful. Also, it takes a while to be hired.

61,Motley Fool,"Great place, but not perfect",2018-12-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Employees have  a voice.  Leadership cares and is accessible.  Relatively common for people to ""change careers"" without leaving the company.   Company is constantly exploring new opportunities and ideas.  Great benefits.","It's all the cons that are the flip side of the pro's:  Can be frustrating to express your strong views and not have them embraced  (try pleasing hundreds of people at once).   There are more ""guidelines"" than rules, and that flexibility can create confusion at times.   Would be a difficult place for someone who prefers a lot of structure, direction and clear advancement path.   The great benefits and overall environment can lead to a sense of entitlement among more tenured employees.  Turnover is really, really low, which means company growth carries a larger burden for creating advancement opportunities."
62,Motley Fool,"Another self-reported ""fun"" place that oversells its benefits",2018-09-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Casual, both in dress and general manner. They also splurge on office chairs.","The entire company relies only on its marketing, and so marketing is all that matters. Despite our obnoxious, predatory ads that are just barely legal in the ways words and promises are twisted, the managers still tout our company's ""Golden Rule"" of fairness and transparency.

The offices are located in one of the most expensive cities in the US to live, and yet you aren't paid a wage that allows you to actually live in or near the place we work.

All of this while top execs have multiple homes in DC/NYC and other cities, who are so monumentally wealthy it's immoral.

The Fool uses one of those open floor plan office lay outs, which means that no one has any personal space or privacy, and the entire office gets LOUD. 

You're better off paying out of pocket than trying to deal with the insurance plan they offer, also. It's cheap for a reason. 

If a company doesn't even invest in the well being of its own employees and customers, then they're obviously only concerned with their bottom line."
63,Motley Fool,Best Place I've Ever Worked,2018-09-07,5.0,Software Engineer,"You hear people all the time who say it's their dream to work at the Motley Fool. Everything you hear about progressive companies -- unlimited PTO, flexible work hours, trust in their employees, great culture, autonomy, great people, etc. -- happens at the Fool. Over the past 7 years, I've worked at 3 other companies before coming to the Fool. I am being honest when I say that the Motley Fool is the best place I have ever worked for, or could even imagine working for. In the DC area, I knew the hip, flexible startup culture with flat management where employees are given free reign was hard to come by. I always thought I would end up in a corporate, soul-sucking govt. job. After looking into the Fool and seeing why they won Glassdoor's ""Best Company to Work For"" in 2014 and 2015, I knew I was onto something. When I received an offer from Motley, I had 4 other offers on the table, however the choice of Motley over the others was a no-brainer. 

I love what I do. I am basically making apps that help people around the world invest better. I mean how much more of an impact could I have? There's no real supervision or micromanagement, the Fool just trusts you. There's no clocking in, or boss ensuring you're being productive. If you need a nap, go take a nap in the nap room. Sometimes I even crack the laptop open at night or during odd hours to voluntarily finish an idea I had earlier in the day. This is how a job should be -- trust the employees, give them freedom and flexibility, and they will do so much more because the *want to work* and believe in your mission. It sounds counterintuitive, especially around DC, but it works and it's how you attract the best and brightest talent.","The only con I have heard of, and I have not been here long enough to experience it myself, is that the trajectory at the Motley Fool tends to plateau after many years (I'm talking about 7-10 years). The reason people have left is because they felt that their careers have stagnated, despite the perks, freedom, etc., and the wanted to try something different -- i.e. they get the 7-year itch. 

Another con is that the hiring process also takes long, and it's hard to get into the Fool. It took 2 months between when I first applied to when I received a phone call for an interview. I had to turn down another offer while waiting for the Fool to get back to me. If you are good at what you do, however, then don't fret. I think it's worth the wait. If you're a developer, make sure you can make a web app."

Everyone shares the same goals and supports one another toward achievement.   When there is disagreement it comes from the right place and with the right outcome in mind.    The work is forever challenging and available.",There are so many great benefits and a lot of autonomy to set your own path.  Some people can lose their way and forget how good they have it.   Even the best culture over time can be taken for granted.
75,Motley Fool,Solid place to work but be aware of what you're getting into,2017-06-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The Motley Fool is very trusting of its employees. The top perk is the flexible work schedule and unlimited vacation. The Fool encourages you to use these and there's no shaming of people who take vacation (given that you're not abusing the unlimited part). I think the average employee probably takes somewhere between three to five weeks of guilt-free vacation a year. And if you need to work from home for whatever reason, it's very easy to do and not feel like you're letting people down. This is particularly great for picking up the kids, having home repairs done, going to the doctor, etc. 

The people at the Fool are genuinely nice. I've worked with and in different groups at the Fool, and this is universally true. Employees are friendly and deeply caring about the company and their co-workers. I've worked at several other places in my career and this is not something you find everywhere. 

There are more pros about working at the Motley Fool (pizza day, cake day, intramural sports, a yearly company retreat, the occasional mariachi band marching through the office), but these are really the top two great things.","For as many wonderful things the Fool has going for it, there are just as many frustrating aspects. For starters, the company continues to beat its chest regarding compensation, benefits, and culture. Some of these things are worth bragging about, but compensation is not one. The company claims to benchmark comp and will pay at least at the median, but this just isn't true for the average employee. I've found salaries to be consistently under market, even when you incorporate benefits. 

Secondly, the Fool claims to be a meritocracy, but being close with the Gardners is far more important than skill or acumen. There is also a strong ""yes man"" bias. Raising differing points of view from what management, especially the Gardners, want to hear will get you no where, even if it's the truth. I've seen many careers stagnate or even regress once someone broke from the party line. Don't be mistaken, this company is very much run and controlled by Tom and David. 

The Fool has a lot of young workers. I'm not referring to those kids right out of college, but rather people under 50. That makes promotions and advancements very hard to come by. You see people moving laterally in the company rather than upward. That's okay, but don't expect to have a career schedule here. It can also make getting raises difficult because title and role changes don't come very often. Even more aggravating is the Fool's backward policy of not giving a raise when you do finally receive a promotion! For a company that shouts from the mountain tops that it values its employees, sometimes it really feels like you're fighting tooth and nail for everything that has a dollar sign attached to it.

Lastly, be prepared for changes on company strategy. It happens all the time. Although we preach taking the long-term view, sometimes it feels like we're fickle in our own company's goals. I've seen ideas for the business bubble up, ultimately die, only to reappear again a year down the road. Only this time it's somehow different. It can feel like we don't give a strategy enough time to actually take hold and produce results before we're worried about the next issue and are changing course. I think some more steady-handed leadership could be good for the business."

We Fools, as we are proud to call ourselves, live and breath our culture--you may call it drinking the Kool-Aid--but I would simply respond that, when something is as good as our culture, you can't help but wish that everyone could experience it.","During my entire time at the company, the Fool has been very consistent in hiring the intelligent, capable people that make it such a wonderful place to work. However, in a company that is staying relatively the same size, there are simply not enough challenging, career-advancing opportunities for all those intelligent, capable people. That said, the company discourages turnover, exacerbating a problem it created in the first place. There are other minor issues potential applications should be aware of, which I am sure are addressed in other reviews. That said, I believe most fall under the ""No Place is Perfect for Everyone"" doctrine."

Work / life balance not bad.,"Much mob mentality, clique-y, you are either in or out, better hope you are in the in-group, or you will be on your way out. Not much personal space, everyone in each other's business. There is pressure to do and say certain things in order to appease the top people. Many colleagues have border-line ADD, hard to focus, distracting in the office. Performance subjective, depending on who happens to be rating you. No clear path of advancement and salary increases never discussed. Be wary of asking for too much as it can be seen as rocking the boat."
91,Motley Fool,"Investment Team Lacks Diversity, Team Leads Reluctant to Hear New Ideas",2016-02-26,2.0,Investment Analyst,"Compared to traditional finance companies, the Fool is a low key place to work. No need to dress up or wear a tie. Everyone, even the CIO, has a cubby and is seated in pods of four. Great to bounce around ideas and hear what's happening in other parts of the floor. There are usually weekly meetings and assignments are distributed on a timely basis. 

Most reviews here mention benefits, like organized trips and concerts, but most people on the investment team tends to be less social.","I came to the Fool under the impression that it runs like a startup, where new ideas are accepted and everyone is encouraged to participate. In reality, the Fool runs like a big company, no different than your typical Wall Street company. It's very hierarchical and you don't get much say especially if you are new. 

To stay afloat, you need to put your head down and do what your manager tells you to do. Be prepared to have managers way younger than you. They may not know what they talking about, investment-wise, but they'll have seniority over you, because they've been at the Fool longer. 

The investment team lacks diversity -- there are very few women and employees of color. Many of its new hires tends to be mainstream rejects. In other words, if you don't fit the traditional mold (college + MBA + work experience), the Fool will likely hire you. 

Everything at the Fool is about doing it the ""Fool-ish"" way and God forbid you come in to the company with previous experience, especially Wall Street experience, you'll be shunned and ostracized. The Fool prides itself as being anti-Wall Street, so definitely don't flaunt your past experiences or expertise. No matter your background, when you enter the Fool, you start from ground zero and must work your way up. Unfortunately, it's very hard, because performance isn't based on merit, but on how effective you are at sucking up to the right people. 

If you are new at the company, definitely don't speak up and voice your ideas, unless you want a target on your back. There is a strong sense of unspoken rule that seniority (or length of time at the Fool) dictates whether you make a good investor. 

Management will say that the company turnover rate is low, but the reality is they just don't count many of the folks who left within a year. For an investment analyst, the pay is very low especially compared to the market average. It's a comfortable job with great hours, but other than that, I wouldn't consider this a great investment company."
92,Motley Fool,I Still Can't Believe This Place Exists,2016-02-19,5.0,IT Support,"The employees are treated like adults, the benefits are amazing, and the facilities are awesome.

Move fast and break things? Why? Slow down and think. Don't try so hard to keep up with the latest trends. Keep changing your CIO every couple years, really? Some bad decisions have driven out good people. Way too cultish with too much emphasis and being a 'Fool Fit'.

The fast-paced environment is not designed nor should it wear you down. The unlimited paid time off policy has never been an issue when I wanted or needed to take time to slow down (either a day or weeks at a time). All of that aside, I have grown professionally within this year at an exponential rate in comparison to previous work environments. From opportunities made available (but not forced upon me) and my colleagues that happily mentor at the drop of a hat, I cannot imagine building my career anywhere else at this point.","If you are a stickler for structure, I could imagine some stressful days and situations here. Answers are out there, but make sure you do your part to ask the questions to the right people."

The benefits at the Fool are simply amazing. Unlimited vacation pay. Unlimited sick pay. Flexible work outs. Outstanding health insurance with no deductibles and $2 premiums. Great 401k match. Stock grants. Pay for your cell phone. Wear whatever you want. The list goes on and on. 

The people here are amazing, too. It's the main reason I'm here. They're fun, collaborative, and hard working. The office environment doesn't feel like work. It's like a college study room with fun people doing their best, but not taking themselves too seriously in the process. No one feels the need to sit at their desk and look busy, aimlessly poking at spreadsheets to create the impression that you're adding value. If you're done with your work, people talk, joke, have a good time, or go home early and spend time with their family. Very few other work places will put up with this. 

Most importantly, all of these benefits are not accidents. They are put in place by a management team who truly cares about every employee and wants everyone to succeed. No company gets everything right, and the Fool is pretty good at admitting when it made a mistake and trying earnestly to fix it. But everything is relative. Compared with other organizations, the Fool is truly one of the best places to work in America. 

I could not imagine working anywhere else, and I hope I never will.",I miss cake day.
96,Motley Fool,"Great Company, Great Mission",2015-12-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are many reasons that I chose to work for the Motley Fool over other opportunities.  First is the mission of the company - to help the world invest, better.  That mission statement is not just something written down somewhere, it truly is the guiding light for all that we do.  The next thing that attracted me to the company are the people.  Across the board, the people here are friendly, helpful, but most importantly excellent at what they do.  I feel I have the opportunity to learn something new every day simply because of the level of talent at this company.  And the last thing I'll highlight are the benefits.  There are great financial benefits, but what differentiates the Fool are the non-financial benefits.  A comprehensive health and wellness program, company outings, flexible work hours and unlimited vacation...It has helped re-introduce a strong work/life balance into my family.","The Motley Fool has the ability to act very quickly on new ideas, and occasionally does.  The more input they can gather from the teams involved before moving forward, the more successful they will be.  I guess that can be defined as a ""process"" issue."

I'm sure the company has changed a lot since the ""beginning,"" but I'm also sure there are a lot of things the company is doing better now than it was then that longer-tenured employees don't remember.

99,Motley Fool,Passionate and collaborative Fools who support each other,2015-11-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"A casual dress code and the flexibility to work on couches, chaises, or treadmills around the office are just pixels on the Fool's monitor of perks. The unlimited vacation, health and wellness initiatives, free swag (apparel, foods, etc.), and epic company events are more key elements of the Fool's continually growing list of benefits.

What keeps the Fool at the top is our people. Fools care about each other. We listen to each other, work together well, and want to see each other succeed. We're passionate about helping each other learn from mistakes and develop into better workers each day. If you want to learn something, you just have to ask. There are so many communication tools to choose from if you want to reach someone. 

In addition to the perks and people, the location is beautiful. Our building has wide, open windows and the space is open and collaborative. Old Town Alexandria has great food, easy access to the metro, and with our patio facing the Masonic Temple, the view is always a grand one.","We move fast, and sometimes that means we break things along the way. There are so many different projects and ideas being tested around the office, and it's up to you to make sure you stay on top of the updates.

If you need a clear career path or thrive on job titles, you won't be happy at the Fool. While there are  teams of Fools happy to help and guide you, your career path is ultimately up to you. It's not uncommon for a Fool to work on 10+ different teams in 10 years. Speaking of teams, they change often, and you have to be able to roll with the frequent changes. Flexibility and adaptability are musts, or you'll find yourself lost in the sea of fast-paced Foolishness."
100,Motley Fool,I can't imagine an employer that works harder to get it right.,2015-11-07,5.0,Fool Wealth Team,"As many reviewers have stated, the best thing about The Fool is the people.  It is a privilege to get to work with people that genuinely care  about their quality of work, the people around them, the brand, and the impact they are having on customers' lives.  No place to work is perfect.  But there is a genuine care at all levels of the company that we keep working to get it right, and that alone makes it a wonderful place to work.","The business is ambitious.  That is hardly a con, but when ambitious goals meet ""can do"" people - they push for results, and they push hard.  It becomes critical to make sure the brand does not become damaged during that process."

+ Employer matching 401k, good health benefits

+ Nice people

+ TMF's game room used to be utilized by it's employees rather than just a nostalgic relic from a time that has long past. The game room now mainly serves as a go-to spot for PR photos that are to be included in newspapers or really any trendy DC magazine that outlines ""Great Company Benefits/Perks""

+ The walls are colourful (Whoa, just like Google!), and everyone has $650 Herman Miller chairs, ironically though they aren't much more comfortable than a traditional $50 chair. After all, you know what they say ""A Fool™ and their money soon part""

+ We have an entire unused 2nd floor (another boondoggle) that can be used for drinking parties or tag","Those who can ""see"" what has happened at The Motley Fool over the past couple years are NOT pleased, but we are not alone and we are also not a small minority.

Employees are generally good at putting on their ""Happy Face"" though. As previous reviews have stated, if you don't assimilate than you will have someone (typically a manager, or their manager) talking to you about your behaviour and lack of perceived ""Foolishness"" (cult-speak for fitting in and not ""rocking the boat"")

Many veteran ex-Fools painfully saw the rapid decline from the fun, collaborative, organic and free-flowing workplace, where it was understood that as long as you got your work done - you were free to be, now transformed into a place where only the chosen ones participate in that experience. Those days of equality are gone except for Chosen Ones: the Yes-Men, the Fantasy/Sports Enthusiasts and the in-crowd PartyCrew® all seem to have free rein to do whatever they please while others are held to an unclear litany of constantly morphing standards.

Not to be misunderstood, EVERYONE is meticulously graded on multiple levels, scoring rubrics, metrics and tests. You will be analyzed and charted by a group of (?) not really sure...peers, superiors, managers? However, in the end it is all fairly irrelevant considering like other reviews on here have explicitly stated, it seems to be a select few people gathered in a room agreeing on who they like or dislike.

Walking into the Fool anymore feels like one signed up for a clinical trial where they'll be monitored and charted, rather than the highly touted transparent workplace that TMF was once known for. The only thing missing is wires and monitors hooked up to employees reading their heart rates, blood pressure and stress levels. The Motley Fool is using an overreaching system in order to place it's employees into groups. Every metric seems to have been taken care of and is scored in a rigid, cold and non-transparent system that attempts to place employees into categories instead of looking at their actual work output, and to be honest, it feels more like segregation.

Enough of this, let us work - judge us on our work and not our networking/beer-drinking abilities. It is tiring and demotivating.

Many long-time and valuable veteran Fools have already left the company recently, and now we can all see why. I guess they too saw the writing on the wall.

At The Motley Fool, it is perceived that there is a select group in the company that can do no wrong: take 2 hour alcohol lunches, watch sports, Netflix and play video games with no supervision, all while others are working around-the-clock worried about losing their jobs without even participating in any of these activities.

It is a vast understatement to say that this has created a resentment from many employees toward the ""untouchables"" who seem to do as they please.

How are some people failing to meet goals by astoundingly embarrassing percentage points (Think: actual final numbers = less than 1/3 of projected numbers) and being rewarded, while others who do not participate in the ""bread and circus"" activities are constantly having the bar raised for them causing burnout? Either make it fair for all or get rid of the ""perks"" and increase the pay, half of us don't even get to use the perks."
104,Motley Fool,How The Mighty Have Fallen,2015-10-06,3.0,,"Largely a supportive organization, The Motley Fool offers fairly generous terms for compensation and an ability to be independent. Communication up the chain is possible, though it becomes more difficult the higher you ascend.","What was once a great organization to work for and with has now become a good one. As the co-founders have removed themselves further from the day-to-day operations and placed others in charge, those running the show now have no sense of the original mission. A favored few are rewarded while the great mass of contributions from outside are ignored."
105,Motley Fool,Time for a wake up call.,2015-10-01,1.0,,The foundation of the company has good intensions and its top leader is inspiring and has a great vision. Although sometimes misdirected.,"It is so sad to see The Fool blindly moving into the future with zero idea of how its employees are really feeling. Many of the negative reviews are very true and the positive ones are often written by the People Team who take turns writing reviews and encourage its team members to write whenever possible. The leadership is hidden from the true reality of the company by the lies and misdirects of a small group of people. Again mainly on the People Team. 

Energy at times is extremely high, collaborative, and truly a great place to work. Those “times” are often when the company knows a survey will be going out or during times of potential mutiny. Not sustainable.

Other times days are filled with management plotting which employees they like the best, which ones will stick around in the tough times, and who doesn’t rock the boat. Rocking the boat can be anything from suggesting an idea that goes against what a “top performer” is planning. Even if it is in the very best intention. Assuming a leadership role on a team when the team leader is too busy playing video games to lead the team. Being so overworked that you decline to play said video game.  (working hard and with your head down is considered “not-Foolish” and is graded negatively by leadership).

I hope the Fool has a awakening and realizes what is happening right in front of them."
106,Motley Fool,A Playground In So Many Ways,2015-09-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The flexibility and autonomy are truly amazing when compared with the standard 9-5. Fringe benefits, like metro allowance, access to financial planning and theoretically unlimited vacation time are big bonuses. 

If you are ok flying under the radar and are more concerned with quality of life than advancement/accomplishment, many of the cons likely won't bother you.","The company offers such amazing fringe benefits because it's cheaper than competing with other companies on salary. Depending on your department, you will likely earn a fraction of the market rate, particularly if you work in tech or investing. Despite repeated initiatives to make compensation more transparent, few understand how the process works, who you can talk to or who makes the decision. 

Further, the company has very little discipline about developing and managing people -- despite high profile coaching initiatives. The majority of senior managers are long-tenured employees who joined the company during its startup stage. Few have worked in traditional settings, let alone have management training. In general, the company's expectations for employees are incredibly inconsistent and unclear, if they exist at all. 

There's no clear career path and managers aren't required to have set metrics for subordinates. This leads to an unhealthy focus on politics.  The org chart is a mess, and the company has devolved into a series of fiefdoms. Authority rests with whomever can get the founders most excited in a given week, and this leads to a game of ""who can build the biggest sand castle."" Moonshots are a dime a dozen, and the company seems far more enthused by shiny ideas than execution.  

All in, the Fool talks the talk of an employee-focused company without actually walking the walk. The company makes a show of window-dressing with fringe benefits but falls down on meeting core needs like fair compensation, sensitive management and clear career opportunities."

And it's not smarts in a silo -- some techs I've worked with have had brilliant business ideas, investment folks have come up with amazing tech solutions, etc. And everyone in the building truly believe in our mission: to help the world invest better.","Is the Fool perfect? Nope. In our efforts to win (competitive is a core value), people sometimes focus too much on achieving short-term objectives, which I think can be antithetical to the advice we give on buying and holding stocks for the long term. But in general, Fools want to do the right thing, and everyone has a forum to point out when we do something that doesn't make us proud."
108,Motley Fool,Glassdoor rating is misleading,2015-09-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You will love working here for about a year… maybe longer if you drink the koolaid. Lots of perks like commuting subsidy, free office spinning/yoga/kettlebell classes, tons of booze all the time (sorry AAers), flex working depending on what dept. you are in, free books, tickets to Nats games, free financial classes. Still a hand full of smart/fun/kind people at the co. Try to hang w/them and keep your head down and don’t rock the boat and you will be ok.","Hard to know where to start…. a lot of lip service paid to being a self motiveated self starter, but that is because managers here lack of any real management training/experience. Mostly everyone spends a lot of time trying to CYA and put on a happy face so they dont become a target.
As other reviews state, you have to be nimble… translation: Be able to follow schizo biz decisions and people running around trying to deliver on “whatever the CEO is hot on right now.” 
Popularity contests, self promotion, being a dude (like “dude” who can hang with the bros) are how you get ahead. If you are good at your job better pray that your manager is one of the “in” crowd and is actually asked for their opinion about you. Otherwise it is all based on whatever general impression about 5 people at the company have on you when they sit down to rate everyone at the company. (Ignore the hype about all the new ‘tools” they are building/trying to sell to other co.s to unleash talent. Even managers say that its more harmful than helpful.)
The creepy cultish “people team” really does take note of who attends company events and participates in things like corhnole and ping pong tournaments. Seriously. Besides being kindergarten cops there other job is to keep top management from knowing how low morale really is."
109,Motley Fool,Not what it used to be,2015-09-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The benefits and flexibility are great and lots are different than other companies. Alcohol flows freely and partying is viewed as a collaborative tool, so if you're a big drinker you will fit right in. Sometimes the great benefits are kind of a smoke and mirrors thing since the company tends to pay under market rates for many employees, but there are bonuses that can make up some of the difference.","The company was once a revolutionary, creative, and highly intellectual workplace, but most of the people who made it that way seem to have been pushed to the corner or pushed out. These days ""innovation"" has morphed into a “freewheeling” atmosphere that really just feels like a frat house or a high school clique. As other reviews have stated, there is a constant state of flux. But it goes way beyond making employees more innovative, and instead can be confusing to the point of paralyzing and pointless. Eventually people realize the strategy is that there is no real strategy. It’s hard to work on projects that turn out to be whims that nobody ends up caring about even though there was supposedly excitement about them from the top. Some high-profile whims become major business mistakes, a lot of them have to do with chasing short-term goals or things that have nothing to do with the core business. Too much base marketing (our customers hate it too and find it embarrassing), but that ship has sailed and the brand is in many ways tarnished beyond repair. Also, despite the “transparency” buzzword, the truth is that most people don’t know why some employees are viewed as “top performers” and promoted and others are demoted or even let go which makes people spend more time “networking” and being political with each other than being productive. Definitions of success and failure seem like who’s popular or now and has infused the office with a toxic ""every man for himself"" atmosphere. Speaking of men, it’s also not an easy place for females to succeed, period. There’s also a massive HR team that despite (hopefully) good intentions isn’t really effective, and other employees seem to be judged much more harshly about success or failure than that team is. There are lots of miserable people at the company right now, so things are going down a bad road."

120,Motley Fool,The Best Place You'll Ever Work - Seriously,2014-12-11,5.0,Project Manager,"A reviewer inferred that one could work anywhere else with the same or similar benefits. I thought about this comment a lot and realized that this is impossible. I've been at the Fool for over 3 years and can honestly say it's the best company I've ever worked for. I've never be in such a professional (I use this term loosely - the better word would be ""Foolish"") environment where people actually care about each other.  

Leadership works hard to make sure that everyone is happy and fulfilled. They'll fund a Starbucks gift card if you take a ""Fool"" out that you don't know; teams are celebrated when they do a good job; you can order FREE (!!) books about whatever you want to read; there are monthly cake and pizza days and weekly free healthy snacks...many of our office perks also include subsidized monthly mani/pedis, bi-weekly masseuses, and an in-house Wellness Fool that teaches classes like yoga and kettlebells. The flexible schedule is also a really great benefit. It's nice to not be so worried about doctor's appointments, etc. 

I see this year's hiring boost as a really great thing. Others may be pessimistic about so much growth, but the talent here is incredible if you look around. There's tons of opportunity in the future for both employees and the business to thrive.","Sometimes I'm unable to unplug from the office. Even though I may be out, I can't go long before I feel like I should check my messages. Many Fools work long hours, but I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. When you love your job, you feel more attracted to projects and motivated about work. You can really see this passion here.

Communication isn't always clear. A lot of decisions seem quickly acted upon, when maybe they should just be better explained. 

I enjoy the open office plan but don't love the frequent office-moves - this is just a personal pet peeve. Teams relocate every 6 months. It can be hard to keep up, so successful employees have to be quick on their toes."

Working groups share ideas but are not interdependent. Furthermore, they still help each other but their focus is on individual results, goals and accountability. This type of practice is conducive to employees becoming part of an out-group.  It's clear, at most times, who the favorites are.

128,Motley Fool,Great place to work – but not for everyone,2014-10-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I think it’s important to remember that no work environment is perfect for everyone. I have worked at The Motley Fool for more than a decade and here are the reasons I still love it here.  

Amazing People – The people that I work with are some of the smartest, kindest and most dedicated I’ve ever met.  In my work and even casual conversations I’m challenged and stimulated.  Generally people that are jerks don’t last long around here because it’s just so counter to the culture.

Constant Learning – The posts here have focused around the “lack of career path.”  This is really by design and I love it.  The Fool is constantly trying to align talent of the individual with the needs of the business.  For me that has lead me to jobs I would have never imagined and given me opportunities to learn and grow beyond my wildest dreams.  I assumed when I started here that I would be in marketing for the rest of my life, but I’ve now done product strategy, customer service, human resources, and tech strategy.  I look at my career now and think I can learn or do anything and my skill sets are so broad that I can speak across several different levels of any organization and connect business initiatives across departments

I can be myself – I bring 100% of me to work every day. ""Me"" is hard working and analytical, but also a little kooky, nerdy, silly.  I’ve had jobs that I felt like I was leaving a part of myself at the door and that I was slowly become someone else that was hard and jaded.  I don't feel that here.  I can joke and play and still be taken seriously on a professional level too.

Transparency – I love knowing how we are doing and how my job feeds into that.  Everyone is encouraged to know the top and bottom line of the company, how our business model works and how their job fits into the company's long and short term plans.  In previous jobs I’ve had no idea we were doing poorly until layoffs were announced or no idea that we were doing well until some people got big bonuses – but not everyone.  I love that our bonus structure is the same for everyone and if we do well everyone does well, and if we are in trouble everyone pulls together to cut costs.

Fun – I’m encouraged to have fun in my work and if I’m not having fun I’m encouraged to fix that.","Here are reasons you’ll be frustrated if you decide to work here and it's the wrong fit.

Speed – Things move fast ALL THE TIME.  We are a performance culture.  I like the challenge of that but if you think this is a “great culture” where work/life balance means that you don’t work hard, you’ll be disappointed.  It is flexible and there is a lot of fun, but there is always a lot to do.

Change – I guess this goes with speed, but when something’s not working we change it.  If we find a better way next week we change it again.  This might lead to new jobs, new roles, new bosses, new initiatives frequently.  I find that stimulating, but for some people it feels a little chaotic.  If the seems energizing to you will like it here.  If not you'll be confused and frustrated frequently.

Communication – With so much change and speed it’s hard to keep everyone informed about everything all the time.  You have to be proactive and build networks within the company to keep up to date.  But this is encouraged and I don’t ever feel like information is intentionally left out – only that it hasn’t caught up to the official channels.

Career Path – You never know exactly what your next step is around here, but that doesn’t mean that you don’t have opportunities.  You won’t grow from representative to manager to VP to SVP to Chief something, but my experience is that I’ve seen consistent opportunities to learn, grow, and develop  - and although a little confusing on paper, my career and skill sets have consistently grown along with my compensation."
129,Motley Fool,"A good place to work with a good CEO, but don't expect to be highly rewarded.",2014-10-01,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"One of the best things about the Motley Fool is that you are given a great deal of autonomy if you do your job well. Don't want to come in on Wednesdays? Whatever. So long as you continue to perform at a high level, the company does not care what you do. If you are interested, it is encouraged to go bug other departments to get a better idea of how the business as a whole works.

Your role at the Fool will be mostly what you make of it, and there is no real reason you can't switch roles once you get in the door. This happens pretty frequently, so if you want to try out new things, there's really nothing in the way except whether you're bold enough to talk to people in other departments that you may not know very well. Be respectful of others and most will be willing to help you out. You can learn a lot this way.

There are a lot of smart people at this company, and contrary to some recent reviews, I'd say the CEO definitely falls in that camp. Although he is eccentric, he has created a lot of value for the company during his tenure. And why wouldn't he? He is a co-founder of the company and has a vested stake in its success.

The benefits are wonderful, and the pay is good enough to get by if you don't have an excessive lifestyle or a lot of kids. It won't make you rich unless you reach the higher levels of the company.","Remember how I talked about autonomy, and how no one cares what you do? That cuts both ways. If you come here expecting to be rewarded for high performance beyond the nice work-life balance, you're going to get frustrated very quickly. I know multiple people who now phone it in because they weren't recognized for putting in tremendous efforts for the company over long periods of time.

The company likes to hold itself out as a meritocracy, and although some departments are more meritocratic than others, at the company's core it is largely a seniority based system. Many departments don't have objective ways of evaluating employees. 

There is a periodic evaluation of every employee of the company under a gimmicky review system, but even those who administer it admit that it is mostly subjective. A lot of it boils down to whether the ""movers and shakers"" in your department like you or not."

I have never worked with such passionate people in my life.",We don't celebrate the work across teams enough. Our investor team is incredible. Our member/customer services efforts are extreme. I've seen careers changed overnight by connections with career coaches on our people team. Some of the innovations on tap from product and tech teams are profound. There's such a massive serious of efforts being made -- this shouldn't be taken for granted. We need to celebrate our successes more.
131,Motley Fool,An amazing place to start a career,2014-09-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at The Motley Fool is nothing short of amazing. They truly stand behind their employees and continuously exceed my expectations! There are monthly activities ranging from happy hours to ski trips, and perks/benefits that touch on almost anyone's lifestyle. Even though I can get a massage, personal training session, ping pong game, order any book I want, nap, play an electric drum set, and start my day around 10:00am, the best part about the company are the other Fools I work with. I can't wait to see what the future brings for me and this company!",Cake day makes sticking to my diet very difficult
132,Motley Fool,Best place I've ever worked!,2014-09-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Coming to work every day you are surrounded by incredibly brilliant and inspired people! Fools genuinely believe in our mission and it is evident in everything they do - from being encouraged to raise questions to meeting our members we're all in it to win it! Being encouraged to experiment and try new things is so refreshing to see in the working world. The benefits are out of this world and tailored to all kinds of people - a great wellness program, free books, speaker series, classes and continuous education, clubs for everyone, a recognition program that is peer to peer, and so many events for everyone - they're unreal.",The Fool is a very fast paced environment which may not be for everyone but it wouldn't be where it is today if it weren't.
133,Motley Fool,"Great people, good ideas, poor execution, weak leadership.",2014-09-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The Fool houses some of the brightest, most talented people with whom I've ever worked. The employees truly aspire to greatness, and I've never been a part of a team that didn't collaborate effectively and from which I didn't learn tremendously.

The company does not have clear career paths, and I consider that a major plus. If you are curious and driven, you can develop a variety of skills and sculpt nearly any role you can think of for yourself within the business.

The benefits, mentioned in many reviews, are certainly wonderful. For smart, hard-working people (including many Fool employees), though, such benefits have become commoditized. Nearly any company I'd consider working for has comparable benefits. They are not the draw.","The leadership team oscillates between providing a top-down vision for the company and empowering teams to craft a strategy of their own. Either approach is valid, but oscillating between the two is dangerous, demoralizing, and ineffective. It is difficult to maintain a sense of ownership over your work when its direction -- and your role in shaping it -- frequently change.

Foolish leaders have a strong case of ""not invented here"" syndrome, which manifests itself in both new product ideas (partnerships, in which we'd give up some control, are anathema) and how we allocate people. Our executive team seems to believe that, for any possible new business or project on which we embark, we already have within the company the ideal set of employees for it. Promoting from within, when the desired skill set is available, is surely preferable -- but when the desired skill set is not, top-tier companies go out and hire the best. This TMF does not."
134,Motley Fool,"The greatest company to work for, surrounded by passionate people",2014-09-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's not a huge coincidence that you're seeing 'people' or 'co-workers' often on the Pros list. The Fool is filled with intelligent, engaged, passionate, and kind people. People actually care about you, which is a nice environment in which to be. It's not hard to turn to someone and ask for help. In fact, collaboration is encouraged and rewarded! What a great segue into the benefits, which are just incredible. From free books to unlimited vacation, it's almost unbelievable, but believe it. An internal rewards system allows us to send 'Gold' to someone for a job well done, and we can redeem this Gold for awesome things. With Learning From Franklin, we can attend talks and interact with some of the greatest minds in America. Health and Wellness is also a huge deal. There are free fitness classes, free healthy foods, massages, an awesome Health and Wellness coordinator, and more!  The casual dress code,  the open office space, the nerf guns lying around, the Pros list goes on and on. And if you've got new ideas, the People team is there to hear it. Whether it's about your position in the company or what you'd like to see at your desk, everyone just works hard to keep the Fool a great place to work.","In the office, you absolutely have to be able to adapt and adapt quickly. The company is constantly changing, growing, and sometimes, this is awesome. Other times it means that you have to completely switch gears and start working on a completely new project. If you're uncomfortable with constant changes, you'll definitely find yourself struggling."

If you're in an administrative, tech-support, or HR role this is a great place to work because you'll be relatively over compensated and you'll be valued.","If you like working toward a longterm vision or developing a career, this is not the right place for you. Expect to ""reorg'd"" often and without input even if you are leading a team. Most leaders spend most of their emotional energy ""protecting"",  ""blocking"", or ""shielding"" their direct reports from the vacillating whims of a passionate and disconnected CEO and leadership team.   Your 1st year here will be amazing, but disillusionment follows as you climb the ranks.  Most managers joke that they won't have a team or job to return to after they take vacation --better monitor email at night and when away."

The mission at The Motley Fool is to help the world invest -- better and everyone in the company knows it and is completely committed to it. Every day, you don't feel like you're just going to do any normal job with people you don't really like; you feel like you're part of something bigger and your co-workers are some of your best friends.","If you need to have stability in your job and workplace environment, then TMF may not be for you. The company moves incredibly fast with new initiatives and strategies and people are expected to adjust just as quickly. You could have a few different jobs at TMF within the first couple years of working there. So, if you really thrive off of stability, you may struggle at TMF."

The company encourages a casual, fun-first atmosphere. Freedom to chase down your own ideas and initiatives.","The culture here is cult-ish, and if you show anything less than undying love for all things 'Fool,' you are met with the antithesis of what the company claims to represent. Though the Motley Fool encourages a wide range of opinions, it is not the case if you are an employee. You must bow down to the chosen darlings and blindly champion the rhetoric they consistently ooze. Egos are a problem here, and management seems to support it fully.

The purpose is at the core, and it's supported by an amazing culture that helps employees be productive and engaged. Yes, everything you've read about the culture is true!","There can be times when a hasty change in plans leads teams to quickly re-form to attack the situation. That's why many of the desks are on wheels. If you're flexible, this works out fine. Also, if you want a linear career path with clean and tidy lines from one role to the next, that management philosophy is not embraced here.

The executive team does things right, not only for employees but also members, and the people that work at The Fool are all extremely smart, kind, and entrepreneurial. Of course all of the perks and the work life balance is great, but that doesn't hold a candle to doing what you love with a group of people you love and moving together toward a mission you believe in.

I've learned about and started to invest with the guidance if TMF, and always feel comfortable asking questions and seeking advice if need be. I'm consistently surprised by the generosity of the company.  I feel grateful every day that this company had changed me for the better- financially and otherwise. The emphasis on health and wellness has led me to incorporate even more healthful measures into my life. I love my colleagues and feel valued and respected at work. Through various programs, the company encourages reading and life long learning. Employees are treated like adults, given freedom with their schedules, and encouraged to determine their own job descriptions based on their skills and preferences. I've never worked anywhere where the morale was so high.",Sometimes the environment can be disruptive or chaotic.

148,Motley Fool,Needs to improve overall employee satisfaction and morale,2014-01-19,2.0,Professional,"During the honeymoon period (first 2 months of starting the position), everything is wonderful. They bend over backwards to help you, and most of all they talk up how great Motley Fool is to work for, and how fortunate you are for them to have chosen you to be with them. It makes you feel very special to be the ""chosen one"".","After about 2 months to a year, you start to realize who you are truly working for. The managers personalities finally reveal themselves and the culture creeps up on you. Unfortunately, it wasn't positive for me. Since the culture is ""play as much as you like"", and the desks with no cubicle walls to separate you from hundreds of others, you begin to realize how unprofessional this place really is. It was like a huge playground, with very poor management emotional intelligence (speaking of my three direct managers). Absolutely zero privacy, and every single phone call to your spouse, doctor and friend, was overheard by 10's of people, including your strange managers, who then all asked you about what you talked about on the phone with your spouse and doctor! I was horrified each time. When I was working on certain projects and needed a few others to complete their part of the project in order for me to continue on with my portion of the project, those other people were consistently no were to be found. Where were they each time I went look for them? In the game room, or ""running late"" for work. Sometimes they showed up at 1pm, sometimes at 11am. No one knew. It was especially frustrating for a professional like myself. I could go on about all of the problems with this company, but there isn't enough time and space. They desperately want you to believe it's the best company to work for (and continually tell you that while you work there) but in reality, it was the one of the worst. (I found it disturbing to have been told repeatedly that I'm ""...lucky to have been chosen to work at the Motley Fool,"" etc., etc.) 
I quickly severed my employment with the Mostly Fool when I found an established professional company to work for. I'm still working for the same established professional company to this day. ""Professional"" makes all the difference."

Very flexible work schedules when needed, and especially accommodating to workaholics that keep odd days/hours :)  Why bring your own paddle?  That is a pro and a con, but I'll put it here.  It is both very easy to settle in and at most move about sideways, but if you are a 10X'er and willing to put yourself out there and be flexible with what you can/will do, opportunities abound - but it is more in your hands than anyone else's to make something substantial happen.","Chain of command is dynamic, which makes cultivating and advancing ideas sometimes challenging.

I left over 10 years ago and still correspond with many of the Fools I worked with.  I found it to be more than a job or part of my career.  Working at The Fool, was a way of life.  I was saddened to leave when I did, but the company treated me with nothing but the utmost respect as I exited.  

I went to work in traditional Corporate America subsequent to leaving the Fool.  I have found my experience to be quite different.  Dealing with the corporate hierarchy was a challenge after being so spoiled.","At the time, the business was disorganized.  It lacked the necessary rigor to be a successful business e.g. no budgets, a lack of integration between teams.  My understanding is that the organization is much more focused now and has matured.

Compensation at the time was also a struggle. The Fool was not a market leader and employees sacrificed financial compensation for other factors.  This could be a long term challenge."

You will meet fantastic people, learn about the world of finance from a Foolish perspective, and never want your summer to end.","At times, the company could be a bit disorganized and hectic, but you get used to it."
177,Motley Fool,The Motley Fool is the bee's knees,2012-09-30,5.0,Software Developer,"-It is awesome to work with so many extremely smart and talented people. A benefit of this is the tremendous amount of trust and mutual respect among coworkers. 
-We have an incredible mission that is easy to be passionate about and it makes the work we do seem very noble and righteous.
-Our benefits listed on our culture blog pretty much speak for themselves...unlimited PTO, flexible work schedule, in-office massuise and chiropractor, and so many other things make working here a blast.","-It is easy to gain weight from all of the free food/drinks. Be wary of the ""foolish 15"". 
-Sometimes there are way too many fun things going on during periods of time when we are really busy and it activates my FOMO and stresses me out. 
-I sometimes wonder why I'm being paid, because I have so much fun at work.
-There really isn't a very obvious or defined career path for people to take in order to get themselves promoted and moving up the corporate ladder. Everyone recognizes this though, so I assume we are working hard to fix it in some foolish and clever way."

179,Motley Fool,I found a family here.,2012-06-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great collegial atmosphere. Top-notch workplace from a full-life perspective. People here care about the mission, the challenge, and each other. The atmosphere is laid back, but the people always strive to improve.","Sometimes the office can get a little chaotic, and communication in the office could be improved. Org changes tend to happen quickly, and can sometimes be a surprise."
180,Motley Fool,One of the best places to work in the United States today,2012-05-11,5.0,,"*unlimited upside for the business
*a ""Foolish"" management culture which is about servant leadership
*still early on and still a small company
*Fast Company articles about collaboration and games at the company, the internal university, unlimited vacation policy, etc. are external validations of long-held internal policies","*frequent job changes -- don't come in thinking your job description is inscribed in stone -- you likely will be doing more than you thought, or different stuff
*company expects employees to be self-accountable and take ownership of what they're doing -- this won't work for everyone"
181,Motley Fool,A great place to work if you are passionate about serious investing,2012-02-14,5.0,,"This is the type of place you are  proud to work in.  The culture promotes integrity, hardwork, and has a real sense of humor. There are many perks-- too many to list-- that make this a really great place.  We have speaker series  (top authors, managers, and investors visit us at least weekly), clubs, free gym memberships, healthy snacks, occassional lunches, etc.",Pay is not as good as most other investment shops. People are moved around a lot-- physically and from assignment to assignment.
182,Motley Fool,"Wonderful mission, values and principles",2012-01-18,5.0,,"A mission-driven small company with founders leading the way in an inspiring, true way. I love that we are trying to help people and doing it in a different way. The culture is second to none.","At an inflection point of becoming a large company with new opportunities and a small company comfortable in our own skin. The challenges and open atmosphere, open book policies aren't for everyone. I love it but others may not."
183,Motley Fool,You should start figuring out how to work here,2011-07-30,5.0,Intern,"Fun, challenging, morally impeccable, 100% transparent management, free food, game room, unlimited vacation, encourages learning/development, fun people, oh, and FUN!","Given how talented you will become at what you do, you could make more money somewhere else."
184,Motley Fool,Nicest people you'll ever work with,2011-02-04,4.0,,"I left a large company with better pay to come here because this is one of the few companies that doesn't count on annual layoffs to balance its books. What I noticed right away is how open senior management are with the staff. Once a month we huddle with the CEO and the CFO and get a complete status on the health of our company. Their honesty is astounding. The year I joined, times were a little lean, but rather than lay people off, they instituted a temporary salary freeze and postponed their very generous 401K contributions for a year. At the end of the year. they paid BACK the 401k contributions and gave everyone a 7% bonus! 

My co-workers are also very honest and not at all competitive. I always believed that what makes a company great is the willingness of employees to not just do their own job well, but to help others do their jobs well too. No one grills you over your mistakes, and no one ever feels threatened.

Stuff flows from the top-down in any organization, so the respect that the guys at the top show us trickles down to all levels, and between departments. Support staff can't do enough to help. Our tech teams are top-notch, not hacks.

The Fools tries really hard to be inclusive, always dreaming up clubs for employees to join. There's a strong gaming culture here (ping pong and video), but if that's not your thing, there's also a book club and a knitting circle! These things take place during business hours too, just like the fitness classes.

It's not a shtick. This place is the real deal.","If you don't live in the immediate area, commuting can be a bear. That said, no one cares if you flex your hours around the morning and evening rush-hours. Salaries could also be a lot more commensurate with experience. Healthcare and 401k benefits make up for most of it though, and they try hard to help with metro and parking expenses."
185,Motley Fool,The type of company you can see yourself staying with for the long term.,2010-10-15,5.0,,"The best parts of working for The Motley Fool are the great people you work with and the amazing culture and benefits, and what rocks is those ""Pros"" all applies to every employee in every position.","There are admirable efforts to be focused and organized, but when a bit of chaos is part of your corporate identity things are just going to be at times somewhat chaotic."
186,Motley Fool,"All in All, I'd Rather be a Fool",2010-10-15,5.0,,"Motivated, youthful organization with a mission that changes thousands of lives every day. Pride of mission is just as important as pride in a job well done. Thanks to solid leadership, the company is well-positioned and riding high in its sector, with increasing prospects while its competition withers.",HQ is inside the beltway. Sometimes people make fun of our hats. People outside the finance and investing arena make fun of our name (but those inside fear and respect us.)
187,Motley Fool,Awesome place to work. I actually look forward to Mondays.,2010-10-14,5.0,,"The Fool is an amazingly fun and supportive workplace. It's a luxury to work there with benefits like healthy free food, massages, and company-sponsored events. Moreover, the atmosphere is friendly, supportive and collegial. The office politics, territoriality and siloing people complain about at other companies are rare or nonexistent at the Fool.

Some of the other reviewers have complained about the lack of a career path and they may have a point. However, the company does offer training both with its excellent internal ""university"" and by paying for employees to attend conferences. The managers in the different departments are very approachable and people are encouraged to be familiar with all aspects of the business.

Lastly, the flexible hours and ""unlimited"" vacation are icing on the cake.","The instructions say I have to write 20 words so, if I wanted to be nit-picky I'd echo the career path comments with the caveat that one of the obstacles is that people stay with the company so long that there are rarely openings in the upper echelons. Having said that, people are regularly given opportunities to contribute in ways perhaps unrelated to their ""day jobs"" if they want to."
188,Motley Fool,Great place and Smart people,2010-10-14,5.0,,The office provides the best environment. I have worked for another company who adopted a fun environment but the motley fool's much better.,The company is small and there is no clear guidelines to start or shift career from technical position into the management.
189,Motley Fool,More fun than anywhere else I've worked.,2010-10-06,5.0,,"Hands down the most functional organization I've ever worked for. Nearly everyone is on the ball, good-humored, has an excellent sense of what's truly important, and leaves their personal axes-to-grind outside the office. The benefits and compensation are more than generous, my colleagues are a pleasure to work with, and leadership does a great job listening to and encouraging the rank and file.","As others have said, there's no clear path for advancement in many areas of the company. When a post comes open, there are a surplus of talented, qualified, experienced people to fill it. The company and its leaders admirably do what they can to help, but it can still be slightly frustrating."
