3,Myntra,Below par salaries,2022-04-06,4.0,Business Analyst,"Good Work culture, Good work for a BA",Salaries are way below industry standards.
4,Myntra,Good place to learn key skills in eCommerce industry.,2022-04-04,5.0,Senior Manager,"Myntra attracts some of the best talents in the country. You get to work with innovative, bright minds.

Comparatively flat org structure, allowing one to lead a function, team independently at the early stage of your career.

You get to hone your data analytics skills at Myntra as many of the strategic and day to day decision making happens based on data. Helps gain valuable data analytical skills.","Recently many top positions are getting filled by direct recruitment from Flipkart. This inhibits the growth aspirations of Myntra old timers. Also, the open culture has changed to become more bureaucratic in recent months."

- Employee care","- No dignity for manager 
- Employees have upper hand over manager

Good no of leaves and additional paid wellness leaves.","Top management are leaving and work culture is changing drastically. 
Before there was a clean plan on which direction we are going but now there are new plans kicks in all the time.

You will not have any clear idea on what you will be working on next month or what you will learn. Some work will be thrown to you at the last moment and you have to just get it done. No matter if you learn something or not. 

Managers are only concerned about thir OKR and work. They doesnt care about you or your health or mental conditions. Same goes for HR. You will see hardly one interaction with HR. Some people doesnt even get to know who is their HR also. 
HR doesnt help you in any case. If you say something you will see the consequences. 

Good luck."

The marketing head (still there) lacks maturity and work ethics and cultivates unhealthy environment. No matter how much or effective your effort, you will always be made to feel inadequate while credit for the work taken away. I will not recommend joining the marketing team, if you do, you’ll soon start planning to leave. Google “Negging” and you will get the gist. The whole department is empty because of one person."

Individual contributors are good people at Myntra.
Not much pros in terms of WFH scenario.","Full of micromanagement which flows from top management till the Manager level.
No complaints would be listened and you'd be told to listen and work as said because ""afterall he/she is your manager"".
Full blame games and few teams have totally incapable managers who only product toxic culture. 
Pulse surveys, Manager effectiveness ratings are regularly taken in the company but the results are not reviewed and acted upon.
Not recommended at all to join Storefront Team.
Managers produce toxic work environment by micromanagement and blaming strategies.
People at IC level are staying forcibly and not happily.

294,Myntra,Toxic work culture - An absolutely loathsome company to work for.,2021-03-16,1.0,Analyst,"Myntra as a company is generally over-hyped to be this heavenly place to work. Its glowing image is nothing but a myth. I was super excited when I got the opportunity to work there and refused other offers to work there. The interview process itself was long drawn out and took forever – I was stood up by the interviewers multiple times, it took 2 months to conduct four rounds of interviews, nothing was organized properly. I should’ve paid heed to these warning signals, but the halo surrounding Myntra blurred out all these red flags. As a result, I suffered and I was out in a year.

Pros:
1)	Myntra has the best-in-class HR policies. They give a lot of employee perks and they have possibly the best diversity and inclusion policy in India. (This exists mostly on paper only though - there is not really any diversity at the company.)
2)	You can learn a lot in a short span. With the pace of things, you wouldn’t have a choice.
3)	Clarity about covid work situation. They kept us clearly informed about when (if at all) we were expected to return to office.

Not much else, really. I had think to think really hard to come up with some pros.","Sigh. Where do I begin? I am scarred for life, having worked here. It has affected me a lot - physically and mentally. I'll probably need therapy just to get over these years I've worked at Myntra. So much unnecessary stress is piled on top of employees. It is an organization run not by principles but according to the haphazard whims of those who manage.

1)	Work life balance. NIGHTMARE. Forget your personal life. Welcome to non-stop mental stress. Signing up to work here means they expect you to slave away 24 x 7 x 365. They do not care if it’s Diwali, they do not care if you’re getting married, they do not care if you were working away continuously for the past 10 days. If they call you, you are expected to work. There is absolutely no respect for personal boundaries. Nobody bats an eyelid before calling you to assign work on a Saturday night. Since everyone plays along with it, you would seem weird if you push back. Some people positively enjoy this sort of lifelessness and it baffles me. The work might not even be that important, the work could have been structured better during the weekdays by your manager – but nope. You will be forced to pay for the inefficiencies of your manager. You are supposed to proud of this inefficiency and call it “hard work”. Everything depends on the whim on your manager and if he decides to pursue some obscure number on a weekend, bid bye-bye to your weekend plans (Most of these managers don’t seem to have any personal lives or marriages or families to care for, so it’s very common to notice people replying to mails at 3 AM or midnight). There is no organization-wide structure to ensure work life balance. This became especially worse during covid, but it was egregious to begin with. The HR team sends out many mails about mental health blah blah blah but if they actually cared about it, they would do something about it.

2)	Work delegation – There is no proper organized structure in place to balance work flows. You can get work anywhere, everywhere. There are no proper meetings to discuss WIP. There will be random mails, random pings on hangouts, random messages on WhatsApp, everywhere. There is no proper use of any ticketing tool or something like Microsoft Teams to manage work. Everything here is so haphazard. The worst part of working here is knowing that your WhatsApp will never be yours again. You will never look forward to messaging friends there anymore. Every time you open it with dread wondering if any work is going to drop your way, on top of an already tall pile of WIP. Doesn’t matter if it is a holiday or you are on vacation you can never be peaceful with these stupid work WhatsApp groups forever buzzing. You can mute them, but there’s no way to make them go away forever unless you exit them. It is an absolute mess and nobody wants to think about the right way to do it. They just like being chaotic and revel in their lack of organization. (Pro tip – if you are planning to join Myntra, get a separate sim card just for your work WhatsApp so that you have the ability to switch off outside of working hours. Trust me, you will not regret it.)

3)	There is no clear vision, at least in the team I was a part of. Everything was a temporary fix. We weren’t allowed proper deadlines to do things the right way, to ensure that they would be stable in the long run. There will be an impossible deadline of 3 days for a work that would rightly require 7. As they believe in temporary wins over long-term stability, getting work done only gets infinitely complex in the long run. Everyone only cares about pandering to their manager and appeasing them. These high-level managers have no idea regarding the infrastructural constraints or the current workload and they just want their work completed. At any point of time, any analyst/associate would have to deal with some 4-5 people like this.

4)	Rude managers – The managers (at least in my team) got away with a lot of behaviour which would be considered unacceptable in other, proper organizations. They are casually rude to employees and have no qualms whatsoever about their attitudes. The employees would be criticized for not managing their work load properly when it was the incompetence of the manager that landed them there in the first place.

5)	The data infrastructure at Myntra is ridiculous. The databases are super slow and not at all suited for use at a large scale. This would lead to a lot of report failures, for which again the analysts would be blamed.

6)	Communication etiquette is completely missing, especially among the people in the Operations side of things. They have no decency, they show no courtesy and they make work requests as if you exist solely to serve their needs.

7) Bro culture is the norm. At least in supply chain teams. It is the substitute for actual professionalism."

388,Myntra,Great place to work,2020-11-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Excellent work culture and good management,Excellently perfect place to explore and work
389,Myntra,Not a core product org anymore | Service based work  - Average to bad work | Low to Average pay,2020-11-13,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"All the below pros are for top 10 % of the core product teams.
- Some SSEs and SEs here are very mature, managerially and technically. It is a delight working with these folks. You only find such people in top companies.
Culture 

- Culture here is amazing. Peers are amazing.
- 360 feedback is anonymous and saves you from petty politics to an extent.
- Ivy league attitude is something that is prevelant here with a handful of people and you can witness this in the right teams. You will be working SSEs and SEs who are strong architecturally and have exceptional coding style. ( Not the average setting in the company though )
- They make sure that they understand and take care if you are in a non-work setting. There are caveats to this.
- There are handful of core product teams and if you get into one of these, you are set for 2-3 years, maybe more.
- Some managers and peers have the potential here to become lifelong friends and wellwishers. One can find such people and reach out to people within to seek such connections.
- Growth comes with networking and understanding the business. Seeking out connections and making yourself known will definitely give you a lot of benefits in an org like Myntra. But check out the cons for the current practical situation.
- If you are married with kids and need a chill life with okay work. This place is for you.","Work Quality
- Work here is quite bad. Techonology stack is also not upto date. 
- Cosmetic changes and product calls. No big projects in most of the teams.
- If you spend a year in some teams which are practically service based with code base in maintenance ( 80 % of the teams are) you will be outdated and have difficulty coming upto industry standards.
- Sale times , Load Tests have a lot of learning, but it turns out that this learning lasts upto two sales. Post this learning is essentially nil. Same process repeats and is hectic mostly.
- Freshers here do not understand the depth of bad, average work here. They will realise it when they spend a couple of years and try to move on.

People
- Average talent. Political mindset.
- Freshers are from tier 1 colleges and might earn more than most senior folks. Average talent. Nothing exceptional on an average. 
- People with loud boisterous persona are mistaken to perform and do well in meetings and design discussions. This is something I have distinctly noticed across peers since the time I worked here.

Team
- Make sure you negotiate and know before hand which team you are getting into. Or they might put you into a very basic role. The complexity of the interview rounds cannot be equated to the work you get.
- Lot of attrition in the leadership. Make sure you meet / speak to team members and ask about day to day work and glimpse of roadmaps. Some teams do not have any product work and are mostly service based.


Salary
- If you are from a tier 3 college and are currently in a lower payscale. Makes sure you negotiate hard or your compensation will be lower than most freshers in the comany, ( Some SSEs with 3+ experience in product based companies joining as laterals earn lesser than most freshers in terms of stocks and fixed pay ). Negotiate thorougly !!

Leadership
- One of the worst companies to work for if you are in the wrong team. 
- Some promotions here are political. Team Leads and Managers are naive technically, maybe new to the org and bully you into doing things, show low EQ and low empathy. 
- A lot of attrition in leadership, hence naive SSEs are promoted to Tech Leads due to lack of available leadership as a result of attrition.
- Oldies ( 3+ ) vs Newbies ( 1+ years) politics is prevelant and toxic. Oldies will make sure that the work you get is limited and growth / visibility is low. They form closed circles and let out only certian information so as to control the work that reaches you and hence control growth.

Conclusion
- If you get an offer here. Understand the depth of the role and expectations and the managers/ team leads you are going to work with.
- Try to negotiate another offer and move on. 
- If you do however get into a good team , make sure the managers are oldies in Myntra and not new to the org."

No growth after a period of time, people are good but if sometime you have done one mistake/stood up for yourself they all will always tag you on that basis. Lost my confidence in working here. I don't think there is a value for your hard work, you have to really be around your seniors and be nice all the time than only people will see you.

427,Myntra,Bittersweet experience as with anything in life,2020-08-29,5.0,Software Architect,"Myntra is great place to work if your interests align with fashion e-commerce industry [... formerly driven through technological initiatives and governed by insightful data, again, powered by technological lens]. No other fashion e-commerce company comes close to providing the kind of customer experiences Myntra has to offer. At least in India, Myntra is still, the leader in the industry. 

People: 
There are some truly passionate and driven personnel in operations and product management team. They truly embody the vision and set themselves up for aggressive targets and goals to aim for and achieve. And achieve they did! I take pride in working with some great hard working and loyal people. 

Process: 
Some of the empowered management team have been successful in wooing people, keeping them motivated and engaged in their vision to continue to excel, bring stability to bottom line metrics while expanding top line metrics. The process, although fluid, is a reflection of true leadership qualities some managers exhibit. It has helped in times of dire circumstances, people came out strong and by extension, company did well to battle uncertainties. 

Employment benefits: 
At Myntra it's a long-standing tradition to be employee centric and strives to keep it that way. However, covid-19 driven BCP made life hell for majority of the teams and more details in Cons section of this review.","L-team: 
Through all the town-hall (all hands meeting) sessions, it has become clear that Myntra's leadership team is a proxy team and bunch of figureheads to echo and promptly follow Flipkart execs to drive the company forward. This has been a gamble because Myntra as a brand has come to existence and is common household name without much or any interventions from Flipkart thus far. The incumbent line up and their action plan have not yielded any tangible results in the last couple of years, perhaps one can only hope they don't screw up customer experience, the one thing that differentiates Myntra from the competition.

Technology and engineering: 
The decision making lies with handful of engineers/techies which makes it a: hit or miss, with respect to software adoption and operational excellence. Good engineers and engineering leaders have long exited after they took Myntra from 0 to what it is known for today in India. The former leaders are the reason why we're all reaping benefits today. Myntra is moving towards a software service consultant model with product and operations. This is dramatically opposite from tech driven internet marketplace company to operations focused software development. The incumbent tech management are facilitators of this paradigm shift, sitting on large amounts of unvested restricted Flipkart stocks waiting to cash out. This is a ""con"" or ""demerit"" point for me. Sorry.

Renege on employee benefits: 
n-Covid-19 pandemic shook the company real good. Top line statements such as ""we're in good hands"" converted to ""at least we keep jobs"", but leadership team weren't willing to admit that Flipkart weren't extending support. Basic home office setup wasn't provisioned, even though there officially was a ""compensation hike"" but it was so insignificant, it felt like it was a front to retain key personnel from looking for greener pasture. 

Well, none of these deter or faze me as I quit leaving behind a legacy and a stint I thoroughly enjoyed solving problems to elevate Myntra as a leader in e-commerce fashion platform in India."

Most senior and key positions were filled by friends and trusted people of people from senior management. 
Rampantly hierarchical. Not a day will go by when you wont hear the word ""leaders"" multiple times. 
Excessive micromanagement. VPs in the company when faced with a biz issue will first try to find whose fault it was. 
You can forget about meritocracy. if you are not in the good books, you can work as hard you want for nothing in return. 
Parking reservation. Cant believe this happens. CEO obviously can park anywhere. 
Arrogant leadership. 
its a company where for every 1 person that does any useful work, 5 people are there to manage him, trying to find fault. 
Managers not competent in their domain. Most of them are there coz they were close friend or a trusted colleague in senior management. 
usless hr initiatives just for PR. 
the lowermost in the hierarchy work but celebration and parties are for ""management only""
if you can show that you are doing a lot without actually doing any work and have no interest in any sort of learning, go ahead and join the company. All the good feedback is prior to the recent management shift."

3. Great facilities at work","1. Gruelling working hours. People in Operations and Finance slog like anything. Don't be surprised if you are sending mails at 2-3am.

2. Processes are broken, but worst not much efforts goes into fixing it. People surprisingly enjoy doing manual work!

3. Tools used are from stone age. You'd be aghast to see data management systems for a company that prides in itself as one of the biggy of the Ecommerce world. You'd lose it the moment you work with systems like UDP, DDP, Lala.

4. Vendor experience with Myntra has been going on a downhill. Lot of brute force is used in negotiations

5. Disparity in pay. You are surrounded by folks from premier B-schools like ISBs IIMs XLRIs. However, of you're not from A-grade B-school then you'd be disappointed as well as surprised to see the gap in pay, irrespective of your skills, efforts and the result.

6. Huge attrition. Quite surprising to see even the leadership team is unstable, with so many exiting. And then you ask what was the point of hiring from so many from the IIMs ISBs. Ask any ex-Myntra (including me) and they would give you enough points to not go back

7. Less interactions. People just mind their work. There's not much of peer interactions or with seniors. Being in Category my manager would highly discuss or spend time on performances, challenges, or my roadmap. Designation is just for the namesake here. Career focus is given least importance."

Not a single profit growth has happened and just they are blaming those who are not close to new Flipkart guys for it. Technology leaders were worst already with Yahoo like culture. Just suck up to CEO, don't worry about ground and create hierarchy. These Yahoo fellows shut every tech company they touch. They started one Palo Alto centre for ai, then shut it, after saying that ai only sold the brands. If ai sold, why you will shut it? Who will kill the golden goose?
4..lot of attrition currently. I turned down one offer two month back and I'm full of regrets now. Everyone is leaving because although they will say that Flipkart and myntra are not merging, they are, and there is no structure to the merger also.

2. The politics and favoritism can be seen in every aspect , including promotions and hikes. 

3. The QA organisation especially is majorly affected with almost all the Senior Managers leaving the organisation in the last few months. 

4. There seems to be clear lack of vision and leadership among the Senior leaders in the QA organisation.

5. You can't voice your ideas and opinions with the leaders. You just need to follow their direction without questioning them even if you don't like the ideas.

6. So apart from little bit of technical work, you also need to be political and manipulative to grow in this organisation.

725,Myntra,One of the dream companies to work with at the moment,2017-12-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. Culture is flexible, and can be set by individual team appropriately per its needs, as long as the product roadmap is honoured, management do not intervene. This in essence helps foster creativity within bounds. 

2. People who can prove themselves with architecture proposals to architects and get a buy-in from all stakeholders, will get total autonomy in execution. Very empowering. This naturally creates an illusion of favouritism for those who don't work but desire equal recognition. Naturally you see them whining here with bad review and feedback. 

3. Reaching a suitable work and personal life balance is very personal. You and your manager are going to wanna work things out, as each of us have different needs and different commitments.

4. Generally employee friendly policies (this is my 7th company and have worked in different type of companies.., viz., ITES, SaaS product, tangible product, Manufacturing and retail, BFSI) and Myntra is one of the few companies that respects its employees' more than all my previous archaic and oligarch type work culture. 

5. Rewards and recognition is pretty straightforward, you get recognised for what you do and you are invisible if you keep expecting things to fall on your lap. It's a dog eat dog world, if you think you're entitled to good project work, good hike, good this, good that.., sorry but the competition is too high for your ""entitled"" self to find a place here. I personally don't like to work with people who expect things from company without working for it. 

6. Meetups, hangouts, and other employee gathering events have beverages that no other company sponsor. This is for those who are expecting ""wow"" factor.","1. As company scales up and scales out, some decisions may or may not be ""liked"" be everyone. In a democratic setting, the minority group will also get the short end of things. I think they should respect we have democratic setting in the first place, else no one will have a choice.

2. People coming from different company background expect different things, and the freedom I mentioned in Pros become apparent, these new people tend to misuse it. That's why managers curtail such nuisance and people become upset. So if we focus on our tasks and not bother about our neighbours, we're spared the bad rating.

3. Somehow, long vacations are allowed here and it's difficult to work with short staffed team with high priority deliverables."

2. Work is good in some teams.","Myntra's hiring bar is relatively low. You'll see a lot of people who are a level or two below their counterparts in similar companies. How do such people survive here? Politics. Myntra's is highly political. The mgmt is completely unaware of the concept of meritocracy.  A good project is coming up? It will always go to your EM/Tech Lead's pet, irrespective of their abilities. Same with promotions.
MICROMANAGEMENT is the mantra here, especially in SCM. EMs contribute almost nothing here - apart from doing what their boss tells them and create JIRA tickets. EMs in turn, expect the same dumbness from devs. Your PM & Tech Lead will do the project design (Devs are usually a minor part of design discussions). A dev is expected to only 'code' and contribute nothing else.  If you make suggestions or question anything, they'll hold grudges and screw you during performance review.  Hence, learning curve is not good.
Wanna get promoted? Befriend your higher ups and have a loud, boisterous persona. The mgmt will fall for it, since they don't have the technical knowledge/ability to filter out fakers from performers. People who actually contribute are ignored. There are many avg developers among those  who get promoted here. Every influential person here has their own coterie and only those in that coterie can grow.
Advice to jobseekers:
The company's success is coz of the Product team. Tech mgmt is a joke. Many experienced people who joined the tech team in the past year or so, have left. The only ppl who like it here are freshers who know nothing abt the outside world but love the free booze on offer. If you get an offer here, use it to negotiate better offers elsewhere. Myntra isn't for enthusiatic tech people and it doesn't seem like they care about the deteriorating work culture."

800,Myntra,"Good Intentions, Bad Execution, Worst Leadership",2017-03-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Most of the people here want to do good
Funding seems to be coming back
Salaries in the tech team is above market average","Culture here is very different from product focused companies that I have worked before. Most of the decisions are taken by business teams and tech is a support function. This is because the tech leadership is not delivering on their job. Some of them (eg: SCM engineering leads) do not even understand their job. The leaders need to understand that they need to take care of the people & the business and let the engg take care of the code. There is too much micro management now. 
The product managers are only ok ok.. they are more like tech leads. Good thing is that they listen to the engg complaints and most of them understand the engg details. However, that makes my job less challenging as they end up telling me how to build a feature. Often I dont read the PRD as I want to think independently. PMs usually are not aware of the business results and justification for a feature.. most of it is done by the business teams. PMs interfere too much in technical details.
In terms of tech, it is too easy.. just write into db, read from db, write into db, make some small calculations etc.. very monotonous. Also, the product managers and top engineers end up doing the high level design.. so very little involvement of mid level engg in design work. 
Recently, the engg are spending more time in ""planning"" and ""estimating"" than writing code. I have sat through very very long meetings with no useful outcome for me, the company or anyone else. Top management is making us do their job. 
Most of the people are looking out for jobs and not committed to the firm. This makes the culture very bad. But it is difficult to get good salaries in this market and people are frustrated"

Everyone is insecure about their position and want to surround themselves only with their boot-lickers. Others will get screwed.
Performance review is mostly based on your relationship with your bosses.They usually decide what rating to give first and then come up with justifications, rather than the other way around. 
They value Presentation  skills more than technical skills. Good engineers stay away."

work can be interesting if you are in the right team","- talent and work isnt recognised..pedigree and perception is
- people who dont know anything about the role are in senior positions and they are not able to give any direction.
 - if you want to get promoted you have to be really loud and boisterous and not good at your work
- goal posts keep changing without any information and thats used against you in the appraisal
there are too many people doing similar work and that breeds insecurity and political environment within team"
810,Myntra,Most incompetent leaders ever,2017-02-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Market is not aware of the internal condition.. so its still not so difficult to find a job outside.
Also, I am now out of this hell.. thats the best thing!","1. Leadership: The CPO is extremely abrasive to the juniors and a great boot licker to the CEO. I have not known anyone at that level who is so hated by the people. The CTO is a great politician. I heard he is trying to get the the CPO fired. I wish him good luck with that. 

2. Product managers: They are not half as data driven as some of the other firms. In my team, we often worked on idiotic projects because someone higher up had a hunch and the product team (completely spineless) did not fight back. This wastes a lot of our productive time on stupid features that add no value to us / the firm. In some of the other teams, the PMs are good.

3. Engg Practices: These guys are extremely immature. There are not enough testing environments to do parallel testing and they talk about developing artificial intelligence. I find it funny that such unintelligent people dream of building intelligent systems.

4. Too much favoritism: The seniors have picked their favs and the rest just dont matter. I will strongly advise anyone considering a move to Myntra to not go there unless you are out of a job and od not have any other option. As long as you have any other option, do not join myntra.. you can find people who have recently left the firm on networking sites and ask them about their experience and reasons for leaving. Do good amount of research before you join myntra. I suggest you take an offer from myntra and use it to negotiate better offers with other people."

2. Free food
3. Good place to learn office politics
4. If you are someone who is good at self-publicity, irrespective of your tech skills, this is the perfect place for you.","1. Many teams here have saturated. Work atmosphere has become highly political in the past year or so. Your growth depends on your ability to show-off and befriend Managers/TLs.
2. Some of the Managers & TLs aren't very good and survive by having a good rapport with their bosses and pulling others down.
3. High attrition over the last year or so. Maybe coz the company has recently embraced micro-management which is advocated by the top brass rather publicly. My team felt more like working in a factory rather than a tech company.
4. Performance reviews/promotions aren't usually performance based and depends more on your ability to warm up to your bosses.
5. Post the mgmt change, old timers in the company have become insecure and wield their influence to screw new comers behind their backs, in order to hold onto their positions. Lots of new joinees have left the company in the past year.
6. Discussing your concerns with managers, will backfire at you as they don't like their ways being questioned. So its better to leave than try to find a solution."
814,Myntra,Worst tech leadership,2017-01-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,there are some competent people still in the firm,"Tech team is a family affair now. The leaders are completely incapable of doing their job and are only interested in politics and boot licking. The CPO is an arrogant, autocratic person who does not even understand the basics of web services. There are much more competent people reporting to him, who can do his job better. 

I have worked in various firms before this and I must say I am not used to seeing such a boot-licker of a person at leadership position. Moreover, I believe he himself is insecure about his job as he has not been able to contribute anything significant.

The only reason the CPO has this job could be because he is brother in law of an extremely senior and well respected person. The business teams push us around like anything and sometimes even the engineers push us around for no reason. The CPO is incapable of asking the right questions to get to the bottom of the issue."

Show off is a must at every level, the more you ""talk the walk"" the more you are respected.
People looking for great tech, be assured it is not a tech startup.
Heavy on management, my manager, then his manager, then his, everyone tried to manage me at some point.
Very competitive environment with continuous tracking, so one could end up at the bottom of the curve, even while performing at his/her peak.
There may be lots of verbal and written appreciation throughout year but appraisal could show a different picture.
End of career at TL level for most, very rare to get promoted after this level.
Same people( mostly old timers ) can be seen promoted often. Highly likely if you team has a a promotion fox, you won't be promoted ever in that team."

Happening place, one can really learn on what not to do by staying here.","The company is still unsure of what they are, highly likely they will end up not what they are today.
Goal posts are changed without informing you and the relocated goal will be used as a weapon against you in the appraisals, they have picked up bits and pieces ""mostly anti employee"" of appraisal process from big established companies of 10x size and try to force fit into a small unstructured organization.

Very odd hierarchy levels in tech, anybody  reports to anyone, and both won't have a clue what other is doing or was doing or why they are reporting to X person. Higher management is mostly redundant, just dragging only enough for stocks to vest ( and yes they won't allow new comers to grow due to same reason )
Myntra culture is a word can only be seen on walls as colorful posters.
Appraisal process in short: Crying baby get all the milk.
Lots of micromanagement on the upper level, managers are dummies and are expected to be so.
There is no corporate feel, all one can see is someone trying to fix a broken piece, everything is short sighted, quirky startup like fix and get claps and applause.
People on CTO/VP/Architect positions are not encouraging enough, each of them are 3-4 levels down when compared to same people in really great companies witnessed.
Lots of cross communication, CTO/CPO will answer food, travel queries, HR/people related questions and some employees do enjoy asking irrelevant questions again and again.
They don't know basic  difference between 360 degree feedback and a 360 degree review process."
