People here are professional but certainly not cold.  

NTT Europe spends over $2bn annually on R&D. That’s more than many well-known ICT businesses turnover in a year.   They invest in developing our solutions which is admirable, however what is more important is that they invest in people.

242,NTT Corporation,Inefficient Tax Department with Outdated Processes - You Will Be Miserable!,2018-05-17,1.0,Senior Tax Analyst,There are no pros in working in the Tax Department. The work is done inefficiently and the department is not saving the company money because of their processes and procedures.,"Tax department is not diverse. Being innovative and finding new ways to complete processes are ‎not valued. ‎It’s the same “we’ve done it this way, there’s no reason to change” mentality. ‎

There’s ‎always drama with the managers. They are all very petty, unprofessional, ‎not helpful, and ‎they will exclude you from team meetings and lunches if you don’t gossip or ‎chat about pointless ‎issues with them. They sit in their offices with their doors closed ‎and refused to answer ‎questions. One manager is known for yelling at her coworkers. ‎

Management will review your work and accuse you of making mistakes, but if you call them out ‎on the mistakes they made, then they become very combative.‎

Also, the tax department is treated like a cost center. The company can make the decision to ‎relocate tax or outsource the department anytime.‎
Overall, if you’re ‎looking to grow in your tax career, this is not the place for you, especially if ‎you’ve worked hard ‎to get your CPA license. There are other companies out there that will be a ‎better fit, with better ‎management and leadership. 

The job description for Senior Tax Analyst is ‎not true! You will not be doing any of those things, as far as working with ASC 740..You will be ‎doing random stuff like submitting property tax payments and copying and pasting info in excel. ‎Managers loves to hoard all the work relating to ASC 740.‎

Management seems horribly disconnected from the challenges Reps face on a daily basis.  Much of this comes from half of the decisions being made outside the country.

Price for service is way above market rate, although you can discount, your commission will suffer disproportionately to the internal arbitrary price matrix that management comes up with each year.  

Wholesale IP industry sees 15-25% price compression each year, however nothing is being done to provide alternate products to sell, and quota is not being changed.  Effectively a 20% quota increase each year, and 20% less commission in return for working harder."

315,NTT Corporation,Senior Manager,2017-05-18,3.0,,Things are getting better with all acquisitions.,Sometime it feels like regular staffing company.
316,NTT Corporation,Global Account Manager - Global IP Network (GIN),2017-05-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Excellent benefits, 401k plan match is very good. Generous expense accounts (especially for the VPs).

For those new to sales, there is a clear path to advancement to a strategic account manager job if you put in a year making cold calls as an inside sales rep.","Limited IP Network footprint, unrealistic quotas.

The Global Account Manager role is a very difficult job since you are selling a commodity product at a premium price, within a relatively small addressable market (30-40 data centers). Additionally, once you make a sale you typically have to immediately transition the account to the account management team who is responsible for growing the account.

Unfortunately by not being a facilities-based provider in the US (or any place other than Japan) the cost to lease 100G waves makes it very difficult to justify expanding the IP network footprint to new markets, so the reps have to keep fishing out of the same pond.

The deal approval process and working with NTT Europe and NTT Japan slows down and complicates the sales process.  In order to get a competitive quote it can take a week to get VP approval.

Finally, the IP transit market is changing rapidly.  Amazon and other cloud providers are a huge competitive threat.  Also, what used to be the largest transit customers (cable TV, gaming, content customers) are peering directly with each other to save on costs and for better performance.  This makes it very difficult to find a quota busting prospect."
317,NTT Corporation,Account Manager - Sales,2017-05-17,5.0,Account Manager,"- Customers LOVE the service, so reps are never dealing with post sale issues that are common at other telcos.  
- Management involved in sales: If you get a nibble from a big fish, the entire company from Ops to the CEO will jump into help you win a deal.
- Travel: Great T&E policy: encouraged to fly to the customer and wine and dine 'em to close the business.
- Great company culture: work hard, play harder. More startup/family feel than large telco.
- Solid comp plan.
- Autonomy: flexible work hours, just get your work done. 
- Lots of upward mobility: 90% of the managers were promoted internally
- Assigned Inside Sales Rep to schedule your meetings",- Working with international affiliates can slow down deals sometimes
318,NTT Corporation,Inside Sales Rep,2017-05-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Potential for growth, several tools provided to prospect and research prospects, great reputation within the industry - not your average cold call, training and continued education/exercises once a month, fun contests, team lunches, annual trip (all expenses paid) and great working relationships within team and with the outside sales reps",None really. Things are always refining and improving. Management seems interested in giving their reps the keys to be successful and removing roadblocks.
319,NTT Corporation,"Don't take a chance with oakton, if u want grow in u r career.",2017-05-12,3.0,Associate Consultant,1) Work life balance is good and u will get ur salary on time.,"1) Dirty politics  and ego in management and as well as in team leads
2) some managers does not how to speak with colleagues. They think that people  working here are just like slaves and they are selling their self respect with money
3) In terms of working hours, suppose let us consider 8 hours per day.There would be minimum 5 hours of meeting. I don't know what is use of meetings, if we don't know what's going on and why it is going on
4) cross domain change :- Higher management  randomly  changes the people domain. A strong advice to management that please don't change the domain, with out taking the concern of a person . Because some people in oakton working with passion, not for the money. 
5) No development work at all. Oakton maintaining people just because of billing purpose. I strongly suggest for the new joining ones that go with oakton if want to retire ur career or want to do job for namesake  
6)  basically when I joined at oakton,  it was product based company with 3.7 rating in glassdoor with full of products and projects. Now it became service based company with 2.3 rating in glassdoor with no projects and products. So every one can understand situation in oakton. 
7) Finally  caste feeling :- if ur caste belongs to ur manager caste or some one who is in higher management level, u will get ur bonus and hike. If not life sucks here. I strong recommend check ur caste before joining here. If ur in higher caste level go with oakton because  u will get hikes,  recognise letters and bonus even if u don't do any work at all."

On day one I was barely welcomed as a new employee. On days one and two the computer at my desk was not working properly. I spent two hours with a tech person in DC/Virginia on the phone., who was unable to troubleshoot the problem. (NTTA is a tech company). The sole person - at the next cube - who was there to train me on their complex systems and procedures was disinterested, unprofessional and was put out to proactively assist me. She was most unpleasant and insular. I sent an email to HR in NYC re: the computer problem and the lack of training. How were my legitimate concerns addressed? On day three I was summoned into the office of a most unpleasant woman (with whom I'd had no previous interaction) who informed me I was being discharged. She offered no explanation other than saying,  ""it's not a good fit."" When I asked for an reason she literally laughed in my face and said, smugly, ""Colorado is an 'at will' employment state. We don't have to give you an explanation."" When I questioned that, she said, rudely, ""I'm not going to debate this with you. Just leave.""

People not in management positions in this company are treated like garbage, and that is perfectly okay with the senior management staff. Personal grudges are valid reasons for firing employees, and your perceptual value at the company is based upon how friendly you are able to make yourself to your management team. Many of them are very politically conservative, and they don't have any problem letting you know that they don't like you if you are not. Employees who have very bad attitudes and ways of treating other people there are constantly rewarded and promoted.

I recommend staying far, far away from this company. It will likely get liquidated or otherwise dismantled by NTT at some point and I honestly don't know what that will entail.

- Being billable obsesses everyone instead of crucial questions like ""Am I serving my client successfully? How can I do even more?""
- Personal development is not encouraged, neither innovation.

469,NTT Corporation,Be mindful of what you are getting into with this company..,2015-09-18,1.0,Information Security Analyst,"A great place to get started and learn when getting your feet wet in information security. If you have never learned about different security technologies, you will get spun up quick and learn some practical real world applications.","Middle management uses a totalitarian and bullying form of leadership. There is a lot of nepotism and cronyism within the work environment.  There is a very big and demanding push on customer service. Enough that it is pretty much beat into your head regardless of the situation. The management does not have an issue with public shaming of employees (Mind that this is mostly for the security analysts who work in both physical SOC's). At the time they would use what was called a coaching observation sheet, an excel spreadsheet that was available on the network drive for ANYONE to view. The list was mostly filled with complaints about errors that analysts made during the course of work. Very rarely, there was ever any compliments for a job well done. This practice which good in theory, is something that should be done specifically between the employee and supervisor during performance reviews. This is something that should not be publicly addressed. When you were on the sheet for an error, you always had to defend your position and regardless of whether you were right or wrong, an email had to be sent to management to say ...like a four year old.... ""I promise not to do this again because......""

Advancing within the company is again based upon who you know and how well you can get in with management, it has been said (to me), ""I'll show you who to schmooz with to get ahead."" Advancement should be based on merit and how well you do your job, not how well you can ingratiate yourself to management. There are a lot of MSSP's within the security realm, all of them have there ups and downs, but Solutionary has more negatives than they do positives."

The company has taken to revamping several major issues to catch up with the growth as they were missed initially.","Growing pains, this is normal with any company. Those who can't see that are blinded by their own greed. Pittsburgh is a happy place. Omaha is more dramatic and seem to bring pressure onto themselves.

480,NTT Corporation,An Oakton Canberra review,2015-07-20,1.0,Senior Consultant,There used to be a lot of Pros working for Oakton. Now there are none.,No real HR at all. Any issues are treated by Management as not serious unless it impacts your ability to bring them $. Only interested in $ and not employee satisfaction. Use employees until they are drained of all energy and fed up. Do not pay a fair wage. Incompetant group steering at all levels. Constant revolving door of staff. Arrogant and out of touch CEO. Senior Managers on Huge Salaries with massive bonuses while the people bringing them in the work wages are kept as low as possible. Driven by profit margins and not customer satisfaction.

Operationally they are keeping things together by overworking the staff and a mix of rubber bands and chewing gum.

In some case employees are asked or encouraged to fabricate answers for clients or auditors.

The culture is one of fear and nepotism emanating from the CEO & COO.  

Pay is far below average.  $35,000 for an information security analyst.  

Work life balance is for the most part horrible.  If management sees an opportunity to take advantage they will not hesitate."
507,NTT Corporation,Fast Paced and Fun,2014-08-19,4.0,Director,"Solutionary is growing explosively as well as being recently acquired by NTT opening even more venues of growth in all product lines.  This makes it a very exciting place to work. It is fast paced and the hours can be long, but the opportunity is unlimited.  I found the Executive Team to be talented, but also willing to listen to new ideas and support action to implement those ideas.  

I have read many of the reviews on here and I think that they show that some of the folks haven't experienced many other companies.  This is not a place to go to punch a clock 9-5.   I have worked in those environments including a Fortune 500 Financial Company.  The difference between those companies and Solutionary is that at Solutionary, you can expand your horizons and take on as much responsibility as you can handle. I think it is that pace that has led to some negative reviews.  People often say they want to go to an entrepreneurial company, not realizing what they will find in a company that is growing very quickly.   You have to want to thrive in that environment.  

Another thing that I thought was a plus in this company is that, in companies that are growing, mistakes are made.  You are perfecting process and technology and like anything, it won't always be right the first time.  I felt that although, like every company, there was some emotional and heated moments, the Executive Team was very nurturing and forward looking in those times.  In a large company,  most large outages lead to someone being fired or demoted.  I think if folks understood that, they would appreciate the Executive engagement more than they do today.

Folks are given plenty of chances and even allowed to migrate from vertical to vertical to find the spot that best suits them.  Solutionary is hiring the person and their talent and will allow that person to grow their skills.  We had folks go from IT to Sales and vice versa.  Overall I'm not sure what else you could ask for as far as opportunity and advancement.

This company promotes from within with very few outside additions.  There have been some external hires lately, but that is to fill skill sets that don't exist in the company currently, so no one is being passed over.","Of course in smaller companies the hours can be long sometimes as everyone is wearing more than one hat.  I say that just shows the opportunity to be promoted.  Many of the mid level managers of the company started as entry level personnel and over the years were promoted due to their talent. 

I do think that the Executive Team is overly generous in giving folks the benefit of the doubt.  That shows how great a family feel there is at the company, but long term that does not build a strong team.  As the Peter Principle states,  folks can rise to a point, beyond which they are not going to be successful.  I think this is a case of hearts in the right place, maybe not getting the needed results.

Again when I hear folks complain about this, they should look in the mirror and see how many times someone has mentored and helped them overcome and obstacle that might have had a different result at another company.  We have all needed a second chance or some mentoring in our careers."
