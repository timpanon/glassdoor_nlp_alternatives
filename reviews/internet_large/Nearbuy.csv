They were mercilessly asked to vacate right away 
(Ackonwledging that Funding was raised, These employees were given benefits monetarily while leaving however managers who were spared showed no support or atleast real support. )

You cannot look up to any managers and wish or  aspire to learn anything from them .
The work environment is very negative, There are employees who do nothing and have been retained however performing candidates who have spent a good number of years have been asked to go because they did their job well and stayed loyal to the company. (The best incentive for any employee)

The CEO Only gets Melodramatic after all this and has hence showed the real face of nearbuys policy that loyalty is of no value in this company and that you are expandable at any moment.

There is a Transparency in the system.Respect, Ownership & Performance","Some of the mistakes were made in the past - blind faith on employees, Over recruitment, not an optimum utilization of  funds"
173,Nearbuy,A Lot Happening Here,2017-01-31,4.0,,"- Management Hierarchy is good. Anyone from anywhere can pick up the phone and dial anyone from the directors. Approachable which builds trust. 
- Lots of learning here if you know how to figure that out. Way too many projects keep starting, new feature launches happening, sales hackathons, etc. Learning here is more macro-level and should you see things that way, you will learn how various processes and teams get things moving. Good place to learn organized execution if you wish to start something of your own.
- Transparency. You want to know something, you will almost always get a transparent answer (depending on the sensitivity of the subject).","- Delays happen a lot. Things don't move as fast as you expect them to. Some features which were supposed to be rolled out in November are still pending because they went down on the priority level. Projects and plans get shelved sometimes without explanations. This can't necessarily be called a con since this is a necessary evil for startups and bidding firms. Business tides change fast and so does the steering but why this is important to point out is that it affects people. Not everyone is able to align with delays and change in plans quickly. Can this be avoided? Yes, with regular and sufficient expectation setting. 
- Expectation Setting doesn't exist here. Nobody will set your expectations right which leads to disgruntled employees. Expectations around career growth, personal growth, stability, security, workload, turbulence, etc needs to be set during joining and from then on periodically so that the company can separate the wheat from the chaff. Not everyone is built to work crazy hours and not everyone can take startup pressure. Frequent Expectation setting will set this right. 
- Stagnant Career Growth - No IJPs, no new positions come up. People who've been here from the last 3-5 years haven't moved up or even sideways (different parallel roles). Since the current hiring situation outside isn't good, attrition is under control. The moment the hiring situation gets better, we may witness an exodus - good employees who've been stagnant for years."

- Most of the people who were any good left a few years ago (when it was still a part of Groupon) from what I have heard from the old-timers. The company is now a pale comparison of what it used to be."
190,Nearbuy,A sad experience,2016-11-10,1.0,Marketing Consultant,"Nice Gurgaon office, Nice company logo, Gave mac for all employees.","1.Senior management has no clue on what's the right thing to do. CEO just talks and does nothing.  And honestly am not sure why he is a part of every advertisement (Youtube video) like the Mom's day wala and recently the Diwali video. He should be looking after bigger and better things and leave this to the Marketing team, Right? 

2. Don't give senseless sales target. If there has been no marketing spend , don't increase the sales target as well. Out of thin air nobody can bring in a 20% jump month on month. At nearbuy no matter what every month the targets increase by 20% with 0 marketing spend. 

3. Don't threaten employees by threatening them to fire. And now you don't even have to threaten because people are leaving on their own.

4. For your mistakes you fired quit a lot of people in the month of Jan-Feb. If you talk so much out moral responsibility , Being accountable for and performance and all that, the senior management should have stepped down.

192,Nearbuy,An organisation that challenges you to raise the bar higher each day!,2016-11-03,5.0,Project Management Associate,"Some of the most compelling reasons to work at nearbuy include:

1. Core tenets of the organisation's work culture: Respect, Ownership & Performance drive the work at the organisation. Everyone, starting with the CEO, believe in clear communication & transparency, which makes the environment extremely healthy to work in. 

2. Quality of the work and long term vision: Considering that the organisation is young, there's insane amounts of energy in the office each day. People are actually driven towards solving business problems (both long and short term) and are given a free hand at devising their own methods of arriving at solutions. The vision to create the one-stop marketplace for offline services in the online world is something that challenges people everyday and forces them to raise the bar.

3. Office: Extremely spacious and lively office space in Gurgaon - has amenities / infrastructure that very few can boast of. Ensures that the employee is comfortable during work hours and provides individuals with a lot of personal space to be productive. 

4. Co-founders: The promoting team of the organisation are rockstars...always upbeat, extremely kind and welcoming of suggestions, they are the ones who walk the talk and truly lead by example. One of the main reasons why the open work culture bodes well at nearbuy is because of the attitude of the co-founders.",There aren't any downsides to working here

Career Opportunities - If you work hard, are ambitious and have the potential to scale up in your role nearbuy provides enough and more opportunities for career development. It is not only limited to one's current function but employees are also given a fair chance to transition within functions if they have the required skill and interest. 

Work Life Balance/ Personal Commitments - The management is very understanding and encourages fair treatment of both professional and personal commitments if the job role allows for flexibility at a given point in time. As a first hand experience I received more than thoughtful consideration on my health concerns or when I had to work from another location due to personal commitments and my manager helped me charting out a plan to manage my responsibilities at work and at home.
