6,Netcore Cloud,Bullys. More people resign than join.,2022-03-06,1.0,Digital Marketer,Programs centered around the greatness of management.,"I, and my entire team experienced high levels of bullying  by the management. The people working: management or experienced members of staff, refuse to show basic levels of professionalism. I have been made to answer calls at odd hours, made to work on public holidays, and at multiple times made to feel incapable to accept a low payscale.

Off lately, people are resigning, and the people who stick with Netcore, are either responsible for showing 0%  professional concern for young talent or are victims of bullying.

All said, their business partners are slowly waking up to the operations of this organisation – make profit off cheap labour.

Embarrassing."

A human company to work and management takes care of employees.","Lot of internal politics in few teams. Company is growing and adapting new processes implemented but still micromanagent done by owners.
All teams are understaffed making team members to stretch more."
13,Netcore Cloud,NA,2022-02-14,4.0,Software Engineer,A good versatile technology stack and always giving freedom to explore and try new things,"Since its a small organisation, senior folks are a bit overloaded as well so new joiners learning curve is difficult as very few people get time to help those out."

4. Timely salary","So far I have observed that this company has almost zero medical benefits for the employees. My previous company used to reimburse my parents and my medical costs like visiting doctors, cost of medicines, cost of medical tests, etc. at actuals, there was no upper limit."
16,Netcore Cloud,Need Improvement in Work Culture,2022-02-11,3.0,Enterprise Sales,"- Improving and investing a lot on products 
- expanding their workforce across the world","- Not investing in culture as they are approaching towards IPO, they are very aggresive 
- No Clarity on incentives 
- Family run business"
17,Netcore Cloud,Truly a thug company !!!! don't deserve to call it a great place to work,2022-02-11,1.0,Software Engineer,"- on time salary, hardly any delay (Big Plus)
- good product exposure
- team members are supportive
- lot to learn for freshers and juniors
- testing team is good and hardworking, good scope for testers
- supportive senior HR, admin staff, few good leaders and project managers
- work from home option","I have been part of the company from good amount of time and seen all possible aspects and i can say that joining Netcore is one my biggest of my career. 

- pathetic senior management team, they work the way sales want them to work. don't even know what they are doing and where they are going. poor project planning. they plan projects only to please the sales and business team to become good in-front of them. mistake starts from this planning itself.

- no work life balance and employees are mentally forced to work for hours and hours even in late nights and weekends as well, that too without compensation. 

New Joiners beware - If you are one of them who plan their weekends with family and friends, do not join netcore. your family time is not important for them. if you are looking for a company to find work life balance, stay away from this company. 

- senior management is ready to invest any amount to get the work done from outside developers(vendors), but can not give good increment to their own employees who work for them day and night. the saddest part of engg team is they value everyone else but not their own employees who work from them day and nights. favorable ones get the increments and hardworkers and contributor have to beg, beg and beg. Ultimately leads to resignations. 

- senior management people do not have the ethics to behave to their employees, they feel like employees are their servant. try to show that they are humble and helpful but when situation comes we see their actual faces. They expect people to be available 24*7. Humbleness is just to showcase senior HR members. 

- pathetic infra team, no proper monitoring, none of the work gets done in time, very lazy to respond

- some of the leads working here do not have even proper knowledge and unmanaged specially in backend engineering. complete mismanagement. no appreciation from leads, but when any thing goes wrong they never miss to blame. poor people management skills. Always look for the change for passing their mistakes to others. I feel bad for poor project managers most of time they have to suffer. 

- poor training and on-boarding for new people

- no proper vision what they want to develop and how they want to develop. their architects are not capable to plan a robust solution. always like to play directly in live environment.

- entire show is run by old people who stayed in the company from last many years, they don't consider any new employee equal to them.

- many of employees complains about poor performance evaluation - if senior management do not like anyone, he/she will never become performer. performers are only those employees who please them and work as per their instruction. if anyone try to negate them, their bad period starts from there.

- so many resignations in last 1 year, yet not opening their eyes.

- force employees to post welcome posts for their new employees and like and share the companies post in linkedIn."
18,Netcore Cloud,Good,2022-01-31,4.0,Associate Data Scientist,Good team and learning experience,Not a lot of employee-related bonus like diwali gift/ new year gift/ bonus etc.

23,Netcore Cloud,Not a great place to work !,2022-01-07,1.0,Assistant Manager,nothing good so far in the org,A lot of things which cannot be shared on glassdoor
24,Netcore Cloud,Beware entrepreneurs,2022-01-05,1.0,Vice President Engineering,None I can think of,"My company was acquired by Netcore in 2019. The company might be ok for normal employees, but entrepreneurs - failed or successful should definitely forego the option of working for Netcore.
6 of the 7 co-founders I know whose companies were acquired by Netcore in last 2 years have left, even at the cost of giving up large sums of cash and equity. All of them had contracts where they either had to work for Netcore for 3-4 years after acquisition or forego the acquisition value left.
The reason was simple - it was insulting and career destroying both as a shareholder and an employee to work here. The insults which unfortunately some workers have to bear to make their ends meet, but no entrepreneur will ever bear. 
For the shareholder - the organisation is family run, not professionally run. The top management is inept, arrogant and dishonest. They employ sneaky tactics to rob the minority shareholders. For two years when I was an employee and a shareholder at Netcore, there was not a single management update, no AGM or EGM I was invited to, flouting all the norms laid down my the MCA. 
At the time of acquisition the share value of our company was halved with the claim that they fix their share value also at half of true value. However after acquisition the management pumped in large sums of money as investment into the company at this halved value, thus unfairly and illegally diluting the minority shareholders.
For employees - You are at the whims and fancies of top management. They may take a liking to you and you might reach middle management ( top is exclusively reserved for the family members ) and get decently paid , or they may not and you will be humiliated, degraded and will eventually leave or get fired. It will not depend on your performance at all. Your colleagues will be mostly dimwits as smart ones will surely leave. So if you want to play dice with your career, you may try."

27,Netcore Cloud,Good For Starting up - Need to be more tech friendly company than sales friendly.,2021-12-10,2.0,Senior Engineer,"1) Environment between managers and peers
2) Work From Home options
3) Permanent remote work options
4) Started to get better in terms of work life balance","1) Company not ready to spend on upgrading technology
2) Company not ready to spend on keeping good employees, rather buy other 
 companies to fulfill agenda , than keep old employees and pay them market 
 competetive salaries
3) All features in the product are not always made based on immediate 
 business values.
4) Product lacks vision, especially techno vision- looks always at competitors 
 and tries to see what they have and what we can make."

I like to appericiate they are very good in Harassing  their employees - mentally and financially. Please beware before you are accepting the offer from them. They don't  deliver as per the promise specially variables and incentives.","No personal life, pathetic product with paid ratings, most insensitive team, zero support in covid to their employees, even company grown during covid but zero increment to most of the team members. Best place if you want to experience micro management and politics. Most unstable product with zero retention rate. They are number one at linkedin so don't follow linkedin as they forced all the employees to put the positive content on social media platforms."

36,Netcore Cloud,Some changes are hurting the company,2021-11-10,2.0,Software Engineer,"1. Salary on time.
2. Remote work","1. With the constant change in managment strategy, people end up taking responsibilites for everything. 
2. Developers are overworked, ending up working 14 hours everyday. Which in turn made the good people leave the company
3. No one actually communicates the problems, but keep covering up, no idea of where the product actually is."
37,Netcore Cloud,Pretty decent place to work and learn,2021-11-10,4.0,Content Marketing Manager,"Love the ethical values of the company. Netcore has always been an employee-friendly company and thinks about employee benefits.

Treated employees well during the pandemic. Not even a single layoff. 

The work-life balance is great.

You are paid decent, not so great though.","Many times your efforts and contribution is ignored by the management.

They couldn't slow down their attrition and many amazing people left the company coz their efforts were ignored. 

Management seems to be a bit biased towards some of their favorites. They need to be a bit more professional in this aspect."
38,Netcore Cloud,Micromanagement at its best,2021-10-22,1.0,Customer Success Manager,Nothing to be honest as they preach a lot but it is all in the air,"Endless calls, micromanagement, no trust, pathetic work culture, no proper processes."

41,Netcore Cloud,"Writing for 2 yrs. For engineers, it's nothing but a nightmare. Literally the company does not care about employees.",2021-10-07,1.0,Software Engineer,"Started WFH model because of pandemic.
Will get to learn Linux commands as you are devops, developer, support, etc.
Always keep clients happy over employees mental health.
Internet cable reimbursement upto Rs. 600 (Pros)","Too much responsibility. Literally you have to forget about your outside life and even weekends.

24/7 working culture. They will call you at night also to fix the bug for client.

Literally have to ask for leave for weekends.
Stressful environment.

Management just need to achieve deadlines, if somehow missed for valid reason then you are working late nights and early mornings.

They show that they care about employees, but believe me its just a Joker's mask.

Didn't found any cultural events and if there is any then because of work you will not able to attend it.

No courses available for engineers. Only account and sales courses.

They don't invest in technology or even servers because of which developer have to manage disk and memory issues at any time(24/7).

Vacation/weekend without work for atleast 3-4 hours is just a dream.

You have to carry your laptop wherever you are going for daily adhoc tasks."
42,Netcore Cloud,Supportive towards their employees,2021-09-24,5.0,Senior Associate,Have learnt many things at Netcore it has always supported us to grow in our career and treated us like family.Ideas and thoughts are always encouraged.Good place to work ......,Nothing as such to mention

47,Netcore Cloud,Good for learning and refactoring,2021-09-05,4.0,Assistant Manager,"- The company is in transition face, so you will get opportunities to make the product better.
- Good supportive team
- I worked with multiple managers, some managers are really good at defending their team and providing opportunities.
- HR tries to make the environment better
- If you are under a good manager, you will get good hikes.","- Delivery is more important than code quality, making it difficult to scale later. Recently, the company mandated writing unit test cases and code reviews. 
- Due to the complex nature of the product, it is very difficult to debug issues. You will spend most of the time testing and debugging issues, working more hours to get it ready for release.
- Your quarterly performance is in the hands of the manager rather than the work you did, also depends on business value. If you worked very hard on one feature, but it didn't have much business value, then the rating will be different.
- Sometimes, you have to work on multiple things parallelly, making you work long hours and even on weekends.
- For some teams, the discussions or scrum are too long with a team of 10+ members. On average, it is 1 hr 30min every day. I believe it is wasting of time.
- Too much micromanagement in some teams, like fill multiple sheets for the daily tasks on an hourly basis, update Jira, explain in the scrum.
- It is very sales-centric than developer friendly.
- KRAs are not properly defined which makes assessment very subjective"

- HR take efforts to make the working environment good.
- Salary on time","- Makes developer work more than 16 hrs because the requirement keeps changing. And they cannot push back deadlines because that will make them look bad, so it is all on the developer. You will burn out.
- When you have a product with so many flaws, you instead of fixing them, keep adding more features. Atleast fix them before anyone raises an issue. People wait till a ticket is raised to fix the problem because problem solving is not the part of PI.
- No one can be honest, the upper management thinks everything works fine because the people who are supposed to tell them that's wrong, spend their time thinking of excuse."

- Unnecessarily deliberately targeting on very minor things:

For example, exceeding 5 minutes time in tea break or breaking washroom timing etc., you get penalize by adding half day leave. You are penalized by adding one day leave if total time sums 15 minutes in a month.
