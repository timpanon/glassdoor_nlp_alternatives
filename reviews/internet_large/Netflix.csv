39,Netflix,"A good company, but no work-life balance",2022-03-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Amazing culture: really strong principles and clear cut beliefs. For the most part, they walk it like they talk it. 
- Very diverse. As a POC in the corporate world I feel very comfortable working here. Lots of focus on inclusion.
- Obviously all of the big time perks: shuttles to work, yummy breakfast and lunch in beautiful cafeterias, snacks coffee and drinks galore, beautiful office spaces. 
-Generous PTO (hourly they offered me 35 days, salaried I believe is unlimited?) but you don’t ever get to use it
-Everyone is so so nice. Probably the nicest company and group of people I've ever worked with. 
-Pay is top of market, I never thought I'd earn this salary without going back to school and getting a higher degree / extra certification.
-When you work with Netflix you are considered the ""best of the best"" and that's why they pay you top of market. Well I've worked with some people that are not the best, it's like every other workplace - you have your top performers and the people that are just coasting by and hoping no one will notice until they get keeper tested and let go. I do respect and enjoy working with the ones that take their job seriously. 
- Every tech tool at your disposal.","Even though working at Netflix seems like a dream I carefully considered whether I should work here as I have not had good experiences at big corporations. I looked at Glassdoor reviews a lot and feel like everyone is being very vague. Here are the cons: 
- No work life balance. No one has any boundaries. Weekends, emails at 12am, same-day requests, tight turnaround deadlines, outrageous requests for the simplest things. You've got slacks, Gchats, emails, Google Meet requests coming at you at all hours of the day. No one respects anyone's time. You need to be ""on"" 24/7 and monitoring your phone or computer 12+ hours a day.
- Most departments are understaffed. Too much work and not enough coverage. And when there's lots of work, even on the weekends that means you are working 6-7 days a week, easily over 40 hours a week. 
- Part of Netflix culture is not being afraid of failure. However you are set up for failure often. A secret, underlying piece of culture is saying yes to everything, even when you don't have the resources to see the job through to completion. When I say resources, I'm not talking about money. Netflix is not low on, and is not afraid to spend, money. Which is great because sometimes it takes money to get things done. I'm talking about human resources - labor time. See aforementioned most departments are understaffed. Somehow there are a lot of directors, managers and Execs though, but again those are not the people implementing ideas therefore the realistic man-hours to put into a project are not there. 
- You can tell this is the case across the board because when I email people in other departments I often don't get a reply until WEEKS later. Everyone is buried and can't get to anything in a timely manner. 
- They say ""we need to pivot"" and ""things move fast here"" but that is because strategy, logistics, and realistic timelines are not considered. They say yes to everything and take on an overwhelming amount of work without any consideration of whether enough man hours can be put into the project, thus a lot of things fail or get abandoned. Of course things move fast, when you say yes to everything and take it on without stopping to plan things. And then when something is not working they tell you ""pivot"" but the reason it's not working is because no one took the time to plan things out in the first place. This part of Netflix culture is not working. 
-You get the feeling of quantity over quality because of the above.
-For such a big, well known company, for the reasons stated above there are a lot of surprise realizations that no one has their stuff together, even managers. It feels like working for a startup. It feels like you have to re-invent the wheel every single day because of all of the above, and it is simply exhausting.
-I cry like 2-3 times a week from feeling overwhelmed and exhausted.
-You will never get to use your PTO and this is a “global company” that doesn’t recognize any holidays therefore your PTO package doesn’t include holidays off automatically and people will still send you work over the holidays."

Working with the best of the best in the industry.","Pockets of poor leadership throughout the company with little accountability. Accountability tends to flow downward; the ""keeper test"" is used by bad managers as an opportunity to manage people out if they're not interested in improving performance.

- Every IC is the same title so you can be in a room with folks who have been at the company for 10-15 years, or are giants in the industry, and your voice is heard at the same pitch as theirs.
- Fantastic engineering culture so, along with outputting good work, you also get to learn the right and wrong way to solve a problem.
- Data drives features and everything is A/B tested, so you know why your feature made it out or didn't.
- One of the best compensation in the Valley with an unheard of compensation strategy (personal top of market is the most rational way to pay people for their work).
- Expense whatever you need to help you do your job better, as long as you're practicing responsibility.
- Brand recognition","- Ecosystem is massive so it's hard to know how to do everything.
- Little documentation so it's hard to know how something works adhoc (you have to go to the team and ask questions).
- Because everyone is at the same title, growth is horizontal (you will build skills but not climb the ladder). You need to work with your manager to draw a goal plan.
- Outside perspective of Netflix culture is that it's ""cutthroat""; which is not the right word. It's ""lean"" - meaning there isn't room for folks to coast. Folks do get let go, but I have yet to see/hear an invalid reasons for them to be let go."

- The best culture you'll find out in the market
- Unlimited holidays, paid Uber for commute, loads of company events with perks and vouchers for employees to enjoy
- Lots of freedom to do your best work, while also giving you the trust and responsibility to make the decisions
- No ""we're a family"" motos. You and your peers are accountable for their mistakes and you're expected to act as a world-class professional and to encourage that in your peers as well. You're paid a top salary, so it's expected for you to be your best version.
- Awesome product, coworkers, perks, pay and work style
- Flat software engineering roles. No principals, no staff, no mediors or juniors. All engineers are hired as Senior Software Engineers and expected to have the maturity of one.","- Engineering is still not so big in Amsterdam. LG and LA are still the main hubs and this means working on very awkward hours in order to participate in engineering events.
- Salaries are much bigger than many other companies in NL and very comfortable, but still considerably lower than what your peers are making in the US, in a magnitude of 3x~4x times lower
- Very few opportunities for software engineers in Europe to move teams and work on other challenges. Managers are still trying to figure out how to deal with the 9 hours difference in timezone and how to make the experience reliable and sustainable. A lot to improve here."

283,Netflix,Tread Carefully,2021-04-26,2.0,Director,"- Pay. Unequivocally the best in town. Full stop. 
- Travel & Expense Policy. Nowhere else will you be allowed to effectively do whatever you want, with limited oversight and an occasional audit. Need to fly business? Book business. Need to stay in a swanky hotel. Stay in said swanky hotel. Just don't abuse it.
- Uber/Shuttles. Pre-Pandemic, of course, the company Uber account to/from work is a nice touch, though it's not great they add it to your taxable income without telling you about it. They also have shuttles all over LA to pick you up and drive you to and fro.
- Family Planning allowance. Real big high five for the $75k contribution to family planning, fertility, what have you.","- So. Many. Feelings. Good lord, be adults and do some actual work.
- Meeting-heavy culture. Every 30min chunk of your day will be full and you will get nothing done. Prepare to turn on and work late once you've eaten dinner or your kids go to bed. They know it and do nothing about it.
- Work life balance. You have no life anymore, there is only Netflix.
- Reorganizations are constant. If you want a comfortable existence in your role this is not the place for you.
- Leadership changes are constant. Since senior leadership does very little in the day to day work of building campaigns or managing talent, they make their hay moving people around the chess board like little pawns to justify their existence and politicking to get Ted's ear. It's gross, and the string of senior marketing departures validates its grossness. 
- Content is king. The Content Org that is. They can spend 20billion to make content, while Marketing panhandles on the side of the 101 for loose change to cut trailers, execute photo shoots, or do anything innovative. 
- Campaigns are teeny tiny. Unless you're a Ryan Reynolds movie, Stranger Things, or Bridgerton, you aren't getting a campaign; more a loose collection of assets geared toward keeping your talent happy. So if you're looking to build big, integrated, global campaigns, this likely isn't the place for you. Which is hard because...
- Ted promises talent a lot! So the Content and Marketing teams are between a rock and a hard place, as no one wants to tell them they aren't getting real campaigns, only token media spends and creative budgets.
- God help you if you work on a Season 2 or Sequel+. You're working with pocket lint and thoughts and prayers for resources. 
- The Culture. For a company famous for its Culture Deck, they've really let it fall by the wayside in most departments. Gone is critical, real time feedback. Gone is the pro sports team mentality. Gone is any real sense of Risk Taking or Innovation. It also is whatever anyone in Senior Leadership or HR says that it is to achieve whatever reorg or budget shortfall that's coming.
- There's no upward mobility and very little that goes into training/development. Raises are non-existent unless you go get an offer from elsewhere, in which case you're playing Russian Roulette with the ""Keeper Test."" 
- Redundancy. There are 6, maybe 7 departments that output creative? It's inefficient and it causes a ton of duplicative work."

This is a place for cold hearted managers with little experience in leadership. The policy of “unlimited time off” equates to “no time off” as any form of vacation comes down to the whim of your manager. Best of luck trying to convince any manager here to let you take time off. You’ll be working 24/7, with no work-life balance. I wasn’t even able to take long term maternity leave, as my boss explicitly said that if I took that much time off, I’d be lucky if my job was still here when I came back.

Netflix does not provide opportunities for professional development to all employees. Only a select few get approval. The D&I initiatives are watered down. That team is focused on its individual, personal endeavors and private businesses instead of Netflix."

It takes time for the glow to wear off, and then you realise the conmen out to play the system, and the politics masked behind ""feedback"" and ""sports team"" culture. People are fired not for performance, but because of internal power struggles. As an I/C, it becomes very demoralising because there is not much you can do to change it, or protect the good leaders or managers.

Also, there is little to no career growth/mentorship. You are hired for one thing, and paid well for it, but you will only do that one thing until you leave.

Diversity and inclusion is a farce, and focused on US definitions of what D&I should be. In the other offices in Asia or Europe, D&I is virtually non-existent and local representation and leadership is not protected or appreciated. As far as the company is concerned, Americans can do it all, in every country and industry. Caucasians are hired and promoted above people of colour, even in countries where they are the minority."

They are, almost to a person, ethical and collaborative, intelligent and helpful without the attitude and condescension that has come to epitomize the valley. They built this amazing platform that has redefined entertainment.","The company has a blind spot when it comes to racism by its senior leaders, who are directors and up, especially in the legal and PR teams. The public revelation of a leader who was not fired even after using the ""n word"" is not an aberration but part of a pattern. These problems are non-existent in the diverse engineering org, but prevalent in non-technical teams that are fairly monochromatic."
431,Netflix,Different company than in the past,2020-11-22,3.0,Corporate,"1. Top pay
2. Exciting company doing great things
3. Smart people","1. Definitely a culture of fear. People are let go constantly if they're not performing. The company is very open about this part of their culture, so just know what you're getting in to.
2. Company used to have a very strong culture (read their culture memo). That culture has evolved and, in the opinion of many people who've been there for a while, eroded. People regularly ignore key principles of the culture. Part of it is due to the company's rapid growth. Netflix with 8000 employees is very different from Netflix with 1000 employees 6-7 years ago. That level of rapid growth seriously diluted the culture.
3. Much less freedom & responsibility than in the past. Becoming more bureaucratic and political.
4. Much less forthright and candid from management. For example, management recently got rid of the 5% free options. Management framed it as more choice for employees (as the 5% free options were converted to cash salary, which employees can then allocate to options if they want), but as the comp philosophy of top of market typically didn't take into account the 5% free options, employees viewed this move as management disingenuously reducing salaries by 5%.
5. because there are so many more employees, career growth is much more limited (just a natural consequence of greater number of employees, more niche roles, etc.)."

468,Netflix,Amazing...and you will drown in work.,2020-09-22,3.0,Marketing,"- Amazing colleagues - hard working, smart, supportive
- Strong brand and fantastic content creators, Netflix truly lives and breathes entertainment
- Constantly striving to improve the way we work, extremely agile work environment
- Generous - high monthly salary, good bonuses (option program) and pension, maternity/paternity support, 'unlimited' days off, free food/drink at the office and much more","- Extremely competitive environment due to everyone being an overachiever. Work is never ending - 24/7 - on weekends, public holidays, during your vacation. I received emails from my manager on New Years eve with an expectation for me to respond.
- Unlimited days off sound great, but when you go on vacation you need to be ready to work. Every. Single. Day. Nobody will take over your work or help offload when you are gone, it's up to you to make your work happen. Since I started 2 years ago I have checked my email every, single day. Including on my sisters wedding. 
- At any moment you can be given a new position at the office, that you might not want or need, but it's part of the constant change that is Netflix. If you don't accept it, your services are on longer needed.
-...or even worse, you will be laid off. I've seen amazing people being let go because their manager didn't feel they were 'engaged enough' - as in, they wanted a life, disagreed one too many times or the reasoning was even more vague.
- It feels like most that work here just go with the flow. If they keep their job one more month, great, if not...well they made some money and it looks good on their CV. 
- Generally you don't have any work stability and you need to be ready for that i.e. never knowing whether you will have a job in 3 months or not. 
- Maternity/paternity leave for a year never happens - if you get 2-4 months without having to worry about your job then that's fantastic. 
- If you have a family, and children, have a good long think about what matters in life before accepting the offer. I am 'lucky' to not to have kids, just a very supportive partner, and I still feel like the worst person ever at least 1-2 days per week (as I just always cancel outings with my partner and/or friends because of work). I see parents struggling weighing the glossy work that is Netflix vs their love for their children vs being able to buy that fancy bag or car. It's heartbreaking at times."

I was let go due to another persons screw up - workforce management changed my schedule to come in half an hour earlier but the employee helping me didnt confirm and another employee that took that over (because the first employee was off) finished updating my schedule however they changed it to come in an hour earlier I wasnt able to check because you arent allowed to access your work email at home. I showed up at the time i thought i was scheduled and noticed my time card was messed up. I reached out to my manager and she told me not to worry about it and everything was fine. I show up the following week and get fired in front of my entire team... She handed me a box and told me i was 30 minutes late and thats unacceptable. They fire people in front of their entire team all the time it is so messed up and embarrassing.

Whether you are an assistant giving feedback to a director or the other way around , everyone is more or else walking on egg shells. 

Very little training and everyone expects you to be a top performer. There is the expression “drinking from the fire hose” , literally blasting you with information everyday. I was expected to support a director running a 15 person team perfectly after 1 week of questionable training. 

Also the hiring process was deceiving - they promised a great role with salary which has different benefits than hourly employees , then proceeded to demand references including my employer at the time BEFORE sending me their offer. I had to basically announce I was leaving to my former boss of over 2 years (with no choice) before even having an offer letter and they then had the audacity to reduce my role and benefits to an hourly role with brief apology.

Indoctrination into a culture that is focused on intimidation and unattainable aspirations. The company grew so quickly that right-fit managers for a startup are now managing large numbers of people and they are incompetent. Due to this incompetence, the culture has become cut-throat where many people have been rapidly fired without justification. Often it’s political because their management fears the person being fired would replace them. Management is dishonest about the “transparency” of salaries and raises where favorites are rewarded rather than those who actually perform. The higher people are in levels of management, the greater the pressure to give up all personal life including family and children. Successful executives are dysfunctional with no personal lives. The culture memo or “deck” is a deceitful document now. It’s become weaponized and is used to humiliate people and fire them. There is no warning before being fired. It’s a surprise process where people are often told they are no longer employed and told to leave the building immediately. Management then communicates a fabricated version widespread to many employees by email or meetings, often stating that there were repeated coaching and warnings. There is none."

Some people are not accustomed to handling this kind of constant, direct honesty.'

They also do not keep dead weight. If you are not succeeding, they will tell you, and they will give you the tools you need to improve. If you cannot improve, and they've invested too much in trying to get you to where you need to be, then they will find someone else.

565,Netflix,Be prepared for abusive directors and young untrained individuals.,2019-09-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Salary, benefits, stock options, ownership.","Netflix as a company constantly says it is a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion, and do not tolerate “brilliant jerks”, or bullies. Unfortunately this is something that they talk about very often but when situations arises, they would often side with the individual of higher rank. 

In my 2 years at Netflix, I’ve noticed that you don’t have to be the brightest and smartest person in the room to excel in this company, you just have to be the loudest, and made your presence known in meetings especially the high visibility ones. 

Directors are often bullies and brilliant jerks, somethings sans brilliant - they are great at politicking and making themselves sound and look good. 

The director I am working for for example, often makes me solve director level problems. When guidance is needed the answer we get very often is “not my problem”. However if the problem was successfully solved, they would be quick to claim the credit for it as the inspiration that lead the team to the breakthrough. 

Netflix encourages weekly 1:1s with your cross functional partners and direct managers/directors, and encourages free sharing of ideas and respectful feedback during these sessions. My director however for example would use these sessions to threaten the staff, if too many questions were asked, they would be threatened with termination. 

Another issue is Netflix loves hiring very young professionals either fresh out of school or individuals on the second job. Hiring of dynamic individuals is great, however it is essential to provide young individuals with the necessary coaching to set them up for success especially when working in a high performance environment where once needs to excel and be able to separate professional and personal feelings. No coaching is provided for these young professionally immature individuals, on top of that they pay them a lot of money that probably warrants more than 10 years of experience. What happens is that these young individuals develop an inflated ego, play politics, gossip, and take everything too personally. The lack of coaching and allowing them to run amok, results in a very apparent bullying millennial mean girls/boys culture. 

HR is very aware of these problems but employees are often told that they are working on it, but nothing ever gets done. In fact, employees have stopped going to HR for any work issues, because more than often HR would side with the upper management, brand the victimized employee a “trouble employee” and eventually they will be let go. And the reason given to the entire office for their dismissal is that they are no longer excelling in their work, which most of the time is completely false. It’s almost always politics and power play involved.

I have witness this happen to many times to so many of my brilliant, hardworking and true stunning colleagues. A few of these unfortunate colleagues were also told by HR upon being let go that even though they are aware of what is happening, their hands are tied and they should just treat it as they are collateral damage. 

How much you get paid also depends on who you know, and how much you know how to “charm” your bosses and the leadership team. I know of managers who are getting paid 3 x more than directors, because they are great with charming their bosses. How they determine how much each person gets paid, does not depend on experience, skill. It depends on friendships, and how well you sell yourself. 

The money and benefits are great, but they also come at a very high cost. If you feel you are able to tolerate such an abusive environment, then this is the company for you."

Back to back calls on busy days, you won’t have time to take a breath and have a sip of water
If you’re late too many times, you’re fired
On coachings with your team leader you’ll hear only about areas where you need to improve, there’s a lot of pressure. They want you to be perfect 
They keep telling you that feedback is important and they care about it but at the end they don’t do anything with it 

Don’t get sick, don’t go on sick leave (psychical either mental sickness) otherwise your contract won’t get renewed. They will take care of you during your sick leave, arrange a reintegration plan, support you and tell you how good you’re doing and when your contract is about to end they won’t renew it. They will lie to you that your performance (you can check your performance yourself) was not good enough and let you go or even tell you that they cannot risk you’ll get sick again. They won’t even explain what exactly went wrong in your performance. They will offer you recommendations for future employers and even help with finding jobs. And they will add more to it, for example that you’re complaining about being scheduled for only late shifts. We have a special swap market for shifts since so many people are not happy with their schedules. 
Since Netflix switched to Majorel in April, a lot has changed. They are checking the average time of your calls and how many customers have called back after they contacted you. 
Basically, Netflix doesn’t like sick people, they don’t accept mentally ill. You need to be healthy, not complaining and always on time. Otherwise they’ll tell you you don’t fit."

In other words, if a manager decides that a particular report is no longer a ""star,"" he or she will get a package.

a) It hard to find ""stunning collages"" because hiring is broken. If you are good at talking, and repeating culture jargon in the interview, you can easily get it. You can look in LinkedIn to see the qualification, background and education level of our engineers. Many engineers here are from bodyshop Indian IT firms (the likes of Infosys, TCS etc), who came onsite and simply switched to Netflix - because they can TALK. 

b) Informed captions (mostly managers) are technically incompetent and has no clue on making any informed data driven decisions. Decisions are heavily driven by politics. 

c) The whole push of open and honest feedback is just a sham to make things look good. Providing critical feedback is impossible here, as it mostly backfires and results into getting fired. So people just keep providing rosy feedback. 

d) If you were hired into a bad team or don't like the work, it is very very hard to switch teams. Even if some other manager is willing to take you in their team, the current manager usually retaliates by triggering keeper test and you get fired. Essentially your manager tells the new hiring manager that this person was bad performer so switching team to not get fired. 

e) There is no career growth for ICs here, everyone has the same title and level. However, on management there is clear growth path - double standards."

Also, no background check or drug screening.  So if you’re into your substances, you won’t be alone.  There are no performance criteria or reviews.  Sounds good.  However, makes it hard to know where you stand with them.  Everyone is in fear of losing their jobs.  

The pay is good.  They have to pay higher to keep up with their employee turnover problem.  Benefits are OK.  Paid parental leave is great.  You only have to be employed for a short time and are eligible for months of paid leave, when you or your spouse has a baby.  Work a month, get paid for four—a pretty good deal.  They make a big deal out of the free coffee, green bananas and trail mix.  They supply free toilet paper, too.","Don’t let the name on the building fool you.  The SLC call center is not like the Netflix you see on TV or in the media.  It’s just a call center with a fancy name.  When looking at reviews, you will want to distinguish between the corporate side of the business (Streaming, Production, Los Gatos, L.A.) and the SLC customer service facility.  The customer service division is the stepchild of Netflix.  The pay is different, benefits different, policies different, culture different and management way-different.  

You hear a lot about Netflix culture, values and diversity.  Don’t mistake corporate’s PR for what’s going on in SLC.  SLC has their own set of rules.  All of the decision-makers are young, macho, wanna-be hipster, white men.  They are very good at playing the game.  Do it their way or get out. If you can get along with them, you may have a chance to hang around a while and put the fancy name on your resume.  If you’re not one of them, there’s not much advancement opportunity.  Netflix CS employees are disposable.  Lots of turnover.  Because people get sick of the ‘we’re Netflix and you should just be happy to work for us’ ego-crap or are fired for not fitting into the cult-ure."

Take the good salary with the risk it gives. You will be let go, it's just a matter of when.

Work life balance is a joke at times but it depends on team and manager. You can't have great work life balance for long since either your manager will be let go or you will be let go for not working harder.

They have a nap room and a game room that you can use at any time. They provide trail mix, fresh fruit, coffee, hot chocolate. They also have a cafe and a small market on site.","There is so much about this company that is just terrible. The HR pays zero mind to privacy and gives personal health information to other employees. Their attendance policy is an absolute joke as is their ridiculous policy about pens in the workplace. You can’t have pens. Or markers. Crayons. Paint. Absolutely nothing you could write on or with. They also attempt to pos-pos their problems away. No matter what the issue or how frustrated their employees get they will never be understanding. They will simply try and talk you into feeling differently and call it “being positive”. Their system for handling escalations is a complete mess. Hope you don’t mind having your already irate customers (because at netflix it is always the internet’s or manufacturer’s problem) on hold for 15-20 minutes at a time while the poor CSR2’s try and handle a billion newbie questions, hundreds of tickets for errors and taking supervisor calls. Crazy to witness. You switch managers ALL the time. I had six in the year I worked there. And there is no such thing as burned out at Netflix. They push their employees relentlessly and brag about meeting a set of core values, but they prove those values wrong every day. I nearly walked out so many times because I was so unhappy there."

You get a voucher for your Netflix account.","The employee surveillance is beyond good and evil: there is a camera every couple of meters and you get an electronic key that you have to use where ever you go, so every movement you make is tracked. Although Netflix advertises itself as a company where you are encouraged to take responsibility and be innovative, there is actually no trust whatsoever that they put in you. You can only grow in this company if you sacrifice your dignity and act only in the companies interest. There is an atmosphere created that doesn't allow you to be direct and open. You can give feedback, but don't expect that anything will happen or change to your benefit. You'll be told ""That was great feedback, thank you!"" and then they keep following the companies agenda again. There is no transparency from the top to the bottom and decisions are often made with no consideration of the preferences of the employees. You will be expected to work different shifts and on weekends and you will see your weekend days being cut off when the schedule changes at the end of the month, so be prepared to work more than 5 days in a row without compensation for the weekenddays they have stolen from you. You pretty much don't have a life anymore. If you face sexual harassment or verbal abuse from the customers over the phone, which happens almost every day at least once, you may get 5 minutes to calm down, but there is no help provided for your mental health. You really start feeling like you're not a human being but only a number that has to be optimized. Most important thing if you consider working there: Check the work law of the country so you know your rights. 
Netflix seems to work a lot on their reputation but what they do inside the company is a shame."

Their policy of fail well means you can make a mistake once. not twice. Terminations are frequent, and abrupt. In the last 6-8 months they have termed 3 supervisors, and about 15-18 people. There is a higher than average rate of churn here.

While they pay high wages, and provide low cost benefits this is done as a way to make everyone replaceable. It makes it easy to attract new employees.

640,Netflix,"Great company, with some growing pains",2018-10-29,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"When they say that Netflix chooses stunning colleagues, they are not kidding: I am constantly impressed with the smart, thoughtful people I work with on a daily basis. I love the company's focus on Inclusion & Diversity (and, I honestly notice it often, by looking around the room and seeing faces like mine in every meeting), and I am continually impressed at how the company adheres to these principles. The transparency is usually great, and it's fun to be a part of an exciting, growing company. The salary is exceptional, and the benefits are also excellent (note: hourly employees get slightly less in terms of benefits, but it's still great). 

There's a lot of freedom here to set your schedule and work around personal commitments if you need to (e.g. my kid has a doctor's appointment, I will be WFH, etc.), as well as to make decisions that benefit the company, your team, etc.  

The culture deck is intimidating when you first read it, but I have found that it's pretty right on - there are some things that I think are not adhered to quite as often as it says, but overall, it's on point.","Work life balance is a thing, but I do think a lot of it is how well you defend your boundaries - I work a couple of hours of OT a week, and I am generally ""on call"" in the sense that I will check my email after hours, but I am not expected to work at off hours - in fact, my manager specifically tells me to wait until I am back at work to complete things. I do think upper management works very long hours, and that can lead to burn-out. The flip side of this is that there is a lot of flexibility to take vacation/personal time, and people trust you if you need to take some time for doctor's appointments, stuff for your kids, WFH, etc. 

The firing culture doesn't seem to touch ICs as much as it does management. It is scary sometimes to see those messages come through, but the leaders do try to set context and make themselves available for comments, questions, concerns, etc. 

I do think the whole concept of good ideas coming from anywhere is true to some extent, but it definitely depends on the team and the leader to whom you are pitching things. You have to be smart about choosing the right time/people. 

The onboarding/training needs a lot of work. Not having a solid training for new hires was stressful and alienating. I spent the first few months wondering if I had made the right choice by coming here, but I am a year in, and feeling much more comfortable. They say it takes about 3 months to feel like you are not drowning, and 6 months to feel like you understand everything - that feels pretty accurate to me."

- Such a great service
- Hope","I have been working for a year at Netflix.

I've seen what was supposed to be very mature people, sharing absolutely almost no contact that anyone would qualify as ""human"".
Sure, that sounds hyperbolic, let me develop (and maybe cherry-pick a little).

Have you heard about our culture? The one about giving candid feedback? - I have seen people complaining of behavior they literally demonstrated themselves in the following days.
But I have also seen these feedbacks resulting in tears both in the eyes of HR persons or fellow engineers. How human does that sound?

Have you heard about our culture? The one about not tolerating brilliant jerks? I have nonetheless seen angriness and frustration, expressed in private, public and meeting. People rejecting new ideas by default, like, any ideas they wouldn't have worked themselves on for days wouldn't count. Even if those ideas are from the best examples in the industry or academics. How many publications/contributions have you seen from Netflix to computer science in general? How does it compare against any other company of that size in the Bay Area? Can you imagine either the real insecurity (x)or the lack of innovation that could lead to this situation?

Except for a few managers, directors or VPs feeling free enough to behave at work in the same way than how they live, almost every engineer I have been interacting with, have shared as little as possible about their private life.
The rare exceptions of interpersonal exchange ends up around some sort of competitive behavior: Who is the most geeky, sportive, owns the fastest car/biggest house/visited the strangest place.

I've heard workaholic people complaining about ambitious peers who were over-managing, over-working to get even more work to do after. I feel like we're past workaholism at this point.

Maybe there are a lot of shy people! Maybe there is a culture of fear, not only of being fired, but also a fear of interacting with people going to be fired.
Maybe it's all in my head, maybe people giving 5 stars to their experience here don't care the human aspect of a company. And maybe they're right.

What about your crush, your fears, your desires for the future, your appetite for life? I've been blessed to work in enough large companies to know that the behavior that I'm seeing in Netflix is not a healthy one. I've also been lucky enough to work in other industries more socializing than tech and I can tell that Netflix has a lot to do on that side, and off-sites or team meeting won't solve that problem.

I am afraid about the tragic, but inevitable consequences of the ways people operate in this company: I guess that the day the worst will happen, it will be addressed in an impersonal memo by Reed; followed-up by 1 or 2 reminders during offsites. Possibly commented by HR in a Q&A document. And move on. This company seems as reactive in its management of people as it is proactive in its business operations.

I still work at Netflix though, not only for the paycheck, but because I hope. I hope it will change. The needed change can't happen from a candid feedback, a Q&A, or  only from inside.
Change has to come from everyone, including people who take time to read comments like this one. Netflix has so many good people and offers such a great service.

As a curious Netflix employee reading this review: think about your past, isn't there a big human thing that you would love to feel again in your current company that you've felt in the past?

As a candidate: think about what would be a good question to ask to that HR partner once your package is almost here to be offered to you, think about that comment you make at the end of an interview when you're being asked by an engineer: ""Do you have any question for me?""
What Netflix needs is an inception, something that anyone and everyone would think about after leaving the call or the room they were sharing with you.
Ask yourself, and then the others, the question you should ask if you think you want to spend a good amount of your life and energy in the place you're applying for.

- Will I learn and contribute to the knowledge of other's? Even outside the company?
- Will I see emotional responses from my peers? Will that be for other reasons than being fired or bluntly criticized?
- Will I find a friendly environment that will nurture my appetite for life?
- What is the amount of emotional interaction (celebrating, sharing, playing) to expect from a company whose service is the best to ""entertain""?
- Do androids dream of electric sheep?"

Everyone's awesome to work with, but outside of getting things done, it can be hard to feel a real sense of camaraderie. I think this is a by-product of having a culture of ""Freedom & Responsibility"", wherein the company isn't forcing initiatives and events and whatnot upon you, so if you want to do something with your team, it's really in your (and your team's) hands to get it done.

* Since there's no strongly enforced standardization of technology stacks, they can be very disparate from team to team, which can lead to duplicate efforts, or implementations that are too tightly coupled to its use case, making it hard to reuse much of what exists.

-What's even better - each team can use their own tech, whatever is the latest a greatest to solve a particular problem

The tech is your standard microservices architecture, and everything gets open-sourced, with a blog post and a nice conference talk. Eventually these projects wither because no one maintains them, and sometimes they don't even solve very effectively the problems they tout, but it's good PR for the engineers and 'leaders'.

Culture of fear is real. My manager was toxic, he loved to talk about diversity even though he was the biggest mansplainer in the room. My interview was interesting, it was a monologue of his rather unique theories of engineering management, most of which was a bunch of gibberish culled from the culture deck. When I got there I found him to be a pretty ineffective manager. He didn't have any engineering vision, no idea of strategy, and wasn't technical. If you get into an interview room and the manager spends 45 mins talking about himself, that's probably a sign to run!

Pick and choose what team you join. You can have either a pretty cool time with some smart folks, or have to deal with narcissists who believe their own PR.

Everytime I run into a Netflixer- they've either 1) just been fired or 2) tell me stories about the people in common we know who've been fired."

Netflix recently turned up on the volume for english call, which caused multiple lines to sit in not stop queue since the agents also need to take care of their native language - So agents sits in back-to-back calls, switching between english and their native language.
In perspective, when you get an angry/mad costumer and the call ends, their is no break what so ever, to get over the mad costumer, you just get a new call from another ""happy Netflix costumer"".

2. You can’t get up and use the bathroom. Your breaks and lunches can be moved around (if approved by WFM) so they tell you to move your break up so you can get up and use the bathroom. You literally have to fill out HR accommodation forms to have certain privileges such as bathroom use. 
3. You had an emergency? If you have the emergency hours to cover it, GREAT! But if you don’t, expect to be put on probation or fired the next time you walk in. They expect you to PTO 24 hours before and it’s like they wanted you to anticipate the emergency 24 hours before. 
4. Coaching is a joke. Literally the sups ask us what WE want to work on. What we thought of our own performance and place those ideas into our action plan. My question is, aren’t the sups suppose to know the problems? Aren’t they suppose to be the ones prepared for the meeting and have a course of action? It feels like I’m doing their job and they just say “great idea let me write this down and submit it!” They will ALWAYS tell you what you are doing wrong but unless upper management makes a comment about moral being down, they will never compliment you.  
5. Utah is a right to work state. In plain English it means the company doesn’t need to have a reason to fire you, hence why a lot of other big companies place their call centers here.

They are an accurate cross-section of experiences that show the reality of working at Netflix and how entirely it depends on your manager, or who gets fired or promoted and suddenly becomes your manager. You will have zero life outside of work, and even if you are someone who could never imagine being considered anything other than a top performer, let alone getting fired, recognize that you--yes, you--will very likely be let go abruptly within your first year--sometimes in a matter of weeks--with no opportunity to improve, at the sole discretion of your manager, who him/herself may or may not be competent or honest. Be sure that you can afford to live in whichever very expensive city you are relocating to with no income, and are willing to explain a firing in your next job search. Political backstabbing is the order of the day. The meeting culture is horrendous and symptomatic of an organization that is growing too rapidly and clutching desperately to a culture that doesn't scale. Ask anyone who has been at Netflix in a leadership or cross-functional position and they will tell you that they spend their entire day in meetings, and then spend all of their nights and weekends at home trying to actually get work done. And finally, if you do survive beyond the first year, don't expect pay progression. They will happily offer you more than whatever you are getting in your current position to bring you in, and then leave your pay stagnant for years if you were already ""over market."""

The base pay is very attractive. While it ends up being pretty equal to other companies' total comp, it is enticing to get it up front in your base pay. No guessing on how the company will perform. But understand it is iffy as to whether you will make much more beyond your initial offer.

- Interesting challenges
They really are willing to challenge the status quo and test new ideas. Things are not always arrived at efficiently, but it is great to see innovation throughout the company and not just in tech groups.

Amazing maternity leave but I had to pay quite a bit out-of-pocket for decent family health benefits, bizarre stock option plan, weak vision/dental

- The culture of fear is real in some groups
This is because it depends on your leader.  Some leaders manage up well and hide their incompetence by constantly changing their staff. I was the 3 leader of my team in a 4-year period. Also leadership does not enforce the same ""stunning colleague"" standards for non-critical orgs. 

- HR is fairly ineffective (except staffing is great)
HRBPs enable incompetent leaders because they are dependent on them. If a leader gains new teams then typically the HR person gets bigger scope as well. If the business leader doesn't ""connect"" well with their HRBP, you are likely to see the HRBP get a ""generous severance package.""

- Your job can change fast, both good and bad
Be prepared that you can gain new teams and responsibilities quickly, but you can also go from being stunning to out the door in a matter of weeks. I think people get the high standards communication really well from the culture deck, but the speed with which your personal circumstances will change can be shockingly fast."

One who never led bigger teams before, he said inappropriate/unprofessional things all the time (mind you, Netflix is supposed to hire only experienced people).

The other one  was a macho, drinking type. He always favored the ones who went out with him drinking. If you were not into drinking/socializing/alpha male communication style - too bad!

Could also mean that you work there for 2.5 years like my coworker and never get to have a weekend day off. 
In training they told us over and over again that top performers were promoted within 3 to 6 months but there have literally been no opportunities. They said numbers didn't matter, they promised unlimited time off, and a whole host of other perks. That has all been blatantly false, the entire job is a numbers game, you sit glued to your desk waiting for a coaching or meeting to break up the nightmare of the day but those keep getting pushed off to the future, which never happens. Unlimited time off was taken away, and you could be fired for a whole host of silly reasons, I myself have seen multiple coworkers walked off the floor for minor infractions, and the new policy of only 3 tardies (which could be 1 minute late) per YEAR is punitive.

I mean, look at how long it took them to change the logo and get some design standards going.  Design often times felt like a luxury than a necessity and there was a bit too much dependency on A/B testing to make decisions.  I swear, I heard ""have we A/B tested this yet?"" in my dreams.  A few times, I would point out that the results of the A/B test resulted in bad design solutions.  It just seemed like upper management didn't understand design.  As long as people are watching content and streaming patterns are on the up, then don't rock the boat.  Also, watch out for those who play politics, sometimes the drama that plays out on projects or team dynamics is just unreal and some people just want to be the hero and get Reed Hasting's blessing.

I was hired under a manager who convinced me to join Netflix (I had 24 emails from that person persuading me).

He will talk to all my co-workers and inform them if he is cancelling one on ones, for me he wont do anything and just disappear. He 
will constantly irritate me saying how good he was when he joined. He will always shout at me and try to ignore my opinions on any damn technical stuff. I was totally terrified of him and knew that he will make sure that I fail. He tried all he could.   He gave me two projects and one project scope kept changing and changing. Still i tried to keep up and developed good relationships with other team managers, members and project managers.One day (I am sure my manager was waiting for that day) I wrote something incorrect in an email (this is my 4th month I guess). He pounded on me, and also after a 14 hour continuous on call, I took a 2 min break, he shouted at me for 15 minutes for missing a false alram ! I apologized. He tried to blame me for what I did not do and said he and someone else was watching me silently, while I was chatting with someone else about some technical issue over a group chat. So unethical !  He said some PM complained about me and when I asked for the names and examples he refused. I raised the alarm to higher management and they said it is ""his word vs mine"". One day they said they are sorry I had to go through this and next day they change the tone and said they have to believe my manager. I requested them to talk to engineers and get feedback. They refused to even do that.  I resigned the next week as I could not take the humiliation and realized that if I stay back and work in the same group, they will find some excuse to fire me. I knew all companies where I worked before were waiting to take me back any day. So I had no worry.  The funny part is the people who were working with me kept on sending me emails about how good it was to work with me and they were surprised that I left. But my manager never found anything good in me. 

I wish I had a better manager in NETFLIX, then I would enjoy my life there so much. Please make sure you understand your supervisor before you join. That is the most important thing. Everything else will fall into place."

862,Netflix,"The best job I've had, and at times, the worst job I've had",2016-07-08,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Netflix has some great pros. You'll be working with mostly extremely competent people. Dealing with teams within the company is extremely easy, as most people are very helpful and efficient. They pay you a lot of money, and give you perks like free food, paid cell phone bill, 401k, etc. This is all great, but for me, the biggest draw is always people, and your team will make or break your experience here, so make sure you know what you are getting into at the interview, and don't accept jobs with teams that you don't feel excited about being part of.","The high salary leads some people to ramp up their lifestyles, they then become dependent on being here. This in turn creates a culture of fear where people are constantly stressing out that they are ""not doing enough"" and might be fired any minute. This also extends to the directors of teams, and when your management is stressed, it will always trickle down to create a lousy experience for you.
This makes for an extremely toxic environment at times where teams are often working on similar projects, thus competing against each other to stay relevant, which is just utter idiocy. The high pay ensures that there is way more politicking than would be needed or appropriate in such situations. This in turn can have a very demoralizing effect on the peons doing the actual work, who often feel compelled to work on nights, weekends and public holidays for goals that are often vague, and projects that are often shelved. The most insidious effect of this is observed when people contemplate taking PTO, when many employees have told me that they weren't able to relax or take as much time off as they needed, as they were constantly wondering what would happen to their jobs, and whether or not they were doing enough to ""deserve"" time off. If you've never felt this, it's a rotten state of mind, and you will feel it quite a bit here.
Many times, I've felt the need to quit the field altogether, but the money and my team makes me stay for now, so I'll likely stay till my team changes.

Moral of the story here is: You'll get paid a lot. You'll also likely be laid off sooner than you expect. You'll also likely make a LOT less at your next place. Adjust for your standard of living appropriately so you can keep your head above the circus fray, and don't get used to the good things."

But the way folks discuss their work, you'd think we were working at Space X. Good thing engineering management is clueless and arrogant, and more interested in engineering by powerpoint than solving real problems. In general, there's a 'not invented here' syndrome which permeates groups, and so a lot of reinventing the wheel. The compensation is bloated, so people are trying to maximize their paychecks. It leads to poor behavior- personal branding is more important than solving problems and petty personal politics and territorial struggles are more important than collaboration.

Freedom and responsibility is definitely practiced here. No one will hand you a project, deadlines, and a specific way to go about doing your work. They trust that they've hired the best people to do the job and they leave it up to the individual to identify problems and figure out how to solve them. This sort of environment is not for everyone, because you have to build strong enough relationships with your coworkers so they'd go to bat for you on your projects. Team-building isn't a company-mandated activity here. It's an everyday practice and an integral part of the job.

Feedback is candid and immediate, so get ready. There's no sugarcoating here. To be successful here, you have to be open to criticism, no matter how direct. This, again, might not work for everyone, but it makes your next course of action very clear, as opposed to sugarcoated feedback that leaves you confused as to what you should do.","Netflix gets a bad rap, because it's not for everyone. The fact is, that's not necessarily a bad thing, and there's no shame in trying something out and seeing if it works out for you. What appears difficult about Netflix is exactly what makes it a great place to work. You have to be able to manage yourself, no one will manage your time for you.

While the company is not as diverse as it could be, the commitment to diversity is something I've witnessed first-hand from leadership and employees alike. The tone is set that diversifying the company is a part of everyone's job at Netflix, not just the recruiting team.

If you need someone to manage your time for you, need your tasks to be very clear and outlined by a manager, or you can't handle feedback, then Netflix isn't for you."

While the center is still miles better than your average call center, there's been a big shift to being numbers and metric focused (something we were promised from day 1 of the center opening would not happen) often at the expense of employees and floor support. There's a major disconnect between HR/WFM and what actually happens on the floor, and often we are given no context as to why decisions negatively impacting us are made.

The center here in SLC has also stopped promoting people internally- a majority (if not all) of the supervisors in the last several months were hired externally. This is another example of changing values at Netflix; rather than giving current (well qualified) employees opportunity for growth, they hire people unfamiliar with the process and product, which further impacts the floor negatively."

Reed is an incredible leader….focused and effective.,"While one of the plus sides of the debate culture is gathering multiple perspectives on your work, the downside is that you can get slowed down by the need to accommodate a myriad of stakeholders. Marketing leadership also hasn't quite found the right balance of art and science. While Netflix has become an entertainment brand, it should be careful to not set up an organization that acts/looks/feels exactly like a Hollywood company. If you are not in L.A. and/or working on creative, it has become increasingly difficult to feel like you are truly part of the Netflix marketing organization."

The quality of many of those let go is not in doubt, but management is frequently inept at appreciating their ability. Many who stay are very bright, but many who are let go are as well.

If you do not tow engineering's backwards line you are looked down upon. People live in constant fear of being canned and this causes them to behave in an immature fashion painting their peers as less than they are. Some seem to delight in the plight of others who are let go -- a mentality of ""better him than me."" It is not survival of the fittest, it is a blind thought police, who speak openly about wanting to hear others' opinions (as long as the opinion agrees with theirs) and then balk when they are actually given. Alternatives are not actually wanted, obedience and maintaining the status quo are. If you are to be disruptive, you must be disruptive in their way.

You are challenged daily to become better at your job, and you're given the tools and the training to do exactly that! You're coached weekly and your leaders are great motivators and great people to interact with. It's like everyone gives a damn about their careers, and their own personal growth as well as YOUR career and personal growth!

Other Perks: Great wages, 401k, very affordable Health Insurance (after your temp agency contract is over and they convert you to full-time Netflix). The building I work in is pretty great. It's a fun and colorful atmosphere with a lot of 20-and-30-somethings working hard and having fun! Around every corner is some kind of Netflix branding that's related to one of their shows, like Orange Is The New Black, or House of Cards. There's a cafeteria that cooks fresh food for you during the day (Vegetarian options included!). And Netflix covers half the cost of the meals so you can get really great lunches on the cheap! Free coffee (there's even an espresso machine to make your own lattes - also free!). And there's occasionally Netflix swag given out, like windbreakers, water bottles, even Netflix labeled sweatpants! It's easily the best place I've ever worked!","If you don't give a damn about your career or your own development, you won't last long. The talent pool is also extremely saturated with highly skilled people, which makes it very challenging in terms of promotions. 

Because it's a call-center, there can be a bit of turnover with the staff. This is pretty common for call centers in my experience, and terminations always seem to happen for the same reason: Attendance

If you get terminated for attendance, it's because you were prone to missing work frequently. They will also let you go if you're a tool to your customers on the phone calls you take. A good rule is don't swear at, or start freaking out at them. Follow this and you should be fine. You're graded on your Customer Satisfaction levels and how active you are at putting in the practice to get better. If you're not getting better at your job, or you're not working on the areas where you need improvement, you'll get let go. But your Supervisors are pretty good at telling you exactly what needs work, and they work with you to get to where you need to be. And if you're in any danger of getting terminated, either due to your performance or your attendance, your Supervisors are pretty upfront about it, giving you plenty of fair warning as well as an opportunity to turn it around. Generally speaking, if you get fired from this place, it's because you either didn't care, or you didn't show up."

The partnerships I have formed are immeasurable, and to be involved with a company changing the way entertainment content is consumed is pretty exciting. 

Biggest pro in my eyes to working here has been the people. My colleagues truly are ""stunning"" as the culture deck highlights. Really some of the best in the business, and everyone I collaborate with has a clear passion and drive for their work. 

Although we move at lightning speed, it pushes me to excel, and not simply coast through the day to day grind.",Sometimes we forget to celebrate/recognize our major accomplishments because we are always moving towards the next best thing.

You are given a lot of freedom, depending on where you work, to improve things as you see them. There is a free snack bar and fridges full of drinks on all floors and buildings, if thats important to you.  Very laid back on what time you come and go, as long as it doesn't impact your results, and they will not tolerate brilliant people around if they are jerks also. Socially you will make a lot of new friends and dont be surprised if they ask you to join outside of work for weekend BBQs etc.","Being results and data driven, sometimes causes higherups to try different strategies and they will often change their minds and direction. This leads to inefficiencies and frustrations. 
While they officially have a ""take as long vacation as you like"" policy, some people were let go a few weeks after coming back from taking their first vacation in years."
943,Netflix,Really solid company,2015-09-21,5.0,Csr1 Chat,"I love working here, you are pure customer service and you really have freedom in how you do your job. The culture is all about honesty and really caring about your customers and you can see that.  They pay you very well and your paychecks are always consistent. You get five weeks paid vacation, incredible insurance dental and vision, free Netflix and Netflix swag, and so much more.  You are treated as an adult and get to work around a lot of positive good quality people.   Netflix cares about who they hire, and sometimes those people will lose their job because they aren't the right fit, thus those people come here and leave 1 star propaganda type reviews.  If you aren't going to bring something positive to the work place then why are you even there?   It makes it amazing to work there because the people who are there are really amazing, high quality positive people making this an extremely great environment . I'm never dreading going to work, the supervisors, agents and even operations management  all talk to each other on a human level and no one is snarly or stuck up.  Its an extremely chill environment with high expectations.  You are expected to do your job and be an adult, and everything else is extremely relaxed. If you think you can come to work and mess around, you're not going to have a job long, but I've been here almost a year now and everything is just as amazing now as when it first opened.","I wouldn't say there are loads of downsides, we are a 24 hour call center so when you are hired you are told you need to be flexible with your work schedule. Most schedules you'll have for a good 3-4 months but when new schedules come out you need to be willing to take it on.  We were told this at least ten times before being hired, so you can't really complain. And even if you get a schedule you don't want you can trade and they won't stop you."

Management really needs to get it together. It feels like high school with how much you hear the cool kids ""supervisors"" talk about agents openly while others can hear them.

Boredom and fear are the only feelings around. You will walk in every single day fearing that it's your last day there, no matter who you are, contractor or full time. It's not worth it. The pressure, the anxiety, the fear. They have been massively hiring and now they are firing, for no reason. Well, from what I have seen it's either because they thought they needed you but they really don't, or because you are about to become too expensive after roughly 2-4 months with health insurance etc..The bottom line is you are not treated like a grown up but just as a tool and management is completely useless."

But all the rest is GMO.,"Contractors are used, abused, kicked to the curb and finally fired. The company takes no responsibility whats so ever for all the people who are inevitably loosing or will loose their job in a matter of very few months or in the worst case scenario, right before health insurance is about to kick in. There is no such thing as ""high performance"". The company just uses and abuses, hire and fire, really talented people found by a random staffing agency that will promise you 6 months+. Netflix prefers to hire full time ""likable"" people only, not skilled people. Upper management simply micro manages every little baby step you are allowed to take, yet full time peers will bash you and take you down until you are fired. The company will not fire people that have been working there for a while even though they cannot keep up with the company growth. Full time peers with less skills, less education, and less valuable experience will clearly tell you to back off and will stab you in the back until you are gone, since you represent a threat to them."

955,Netflix,Not worth the pay...,2015-08-19,1.0,Customer Service Representative I,"The environment is high energy and the people are very friendly. They have a lot of games and videos, as well as devices to occupy your free time. It is extremely DIFFICULT to get fired. Which means that if you do get fired then you SERIOUSLY and imaginably screwed up.","Your base PAY as of 2014-2015, as you are contracted out and paid by 24/7 is at the most 12.00 an HOUR! I do not know how Glassdoor came up with $15.

You are verbally abused everyday by the customer. The technology and the Knowledge base can chance on you, so you need to be extremely adaptable.

If someone starts calling you names, you can not hang up and you can not make outbound calls.

You are held to metrics and those standards are extremely difficult to maintain unless you have been working in a call center for 5 years. If you do not perform you will be written up.

One of those metrics is your call back rate, handle time (less than 5 and 1/2 minutes) and DSAT's (less than 4%) which translates into 1 NO in the survey.

Attendance is non-negotiable. I was sick for 9 weeks (I had my voice for less than 25% of the time) and I even brought in a doctors note explaining my situation and I STILL got written up. 

They have shift bids, which means that every 6 months you can bid for a new shift. If your metrics are mediocre or bad, then you will be moved to what every shift they give you. Most places try to put you in shift according to your requests and needs. This is not that place. You can bison your own shift...and possibly keep it. My call center lost half of their work force due to the previous shift bid. They said they were going to try and change it to make it more ""fair"", but when I left, they can completely removed my shift time.

They did NOT tell me about shift bids when they hired me.

If you try for CSR 2 and don't meet the standard by day 90, you will lose your job. You do not go back to CSR 1 or given another chance.

iF YOU want to TRADE, then the person you trade with has to be approved by your team lead and theirs...and vise versa. I switched shifts with someone else, I put up 3 people before I found someone acceptable. The shift took 3 months to process due to a lack of organization. 

If you do not mind being a punching bag, emotionally and verbally...then this is the job for you!"
956,Netflix,Best place I've ever worked,2015-08-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"""Freedom and Responsibility"" rings mostly true, although you'd have to be stupid to not realize it isn't 100% true always and in everything. Simple, indisputable example: you can't decide how much you make, yourself. That's an obvious statement, yet it proves there definitely are no-goes and as such, gray areas. In practice, it hasn't been an issue for me--just clarifying. You want X number of monitors, Y super-amazing-computer, come in at 11am, leave at 4pm, take numerous vacations, ask (and receive a real answer!) dang near anything about what movies/shows they're secretly bidding on in Hollywood, etc, etc. Not only things a reasonable person would want to do/have, more like a well spoiled person. This all assumes you are communicating this with your team and performing well above average--Netflix does *not* knowingly hire junior, mid-level, or wannabe-senior engineers. I haven't personally seen a bunch of people get fired, but of the one or two I've seen, it was not surprising. I have noticed some teams are more critical of performance than others.

Like any company of a decent size, not every team has exactly the same culture. Mine was absolutely wonderful day-to-day. My managers help you and coordinate, more than ""manage"" me, which is huge just by itself. To this point, most engineering managers I know of aren't really programmers, which I think is a huge bonus because there is far less risk of them wanting to micromanage projects and implementation details. That said, they are ALL very very technical and  can fairly trivially smell BS.

Salary: you'll be more than happy as far as I've heard from co-workers. For me, they made it impossible for me to ever even consider leaving because of salary. Almost every place I've worked prior, I had at some point felt underpaid. Not here, I felt very much appreciated and paid as such.

Summary: YMMV, like in every big company, but seriously that's super important to understand, but my experience was amazing and by far the best place I've ever worked, all things considered. I left for personal reasons that aren't related to Netflix--wife/family stuff.","If you're not a high performer, but you manage to sneak in, the fear of being canned could certainly be real since YOU WILL inevitably be discovered. But don't second guess yourself. It should be obvious whether or not you are a high performer.

Sometimes discussions on the Freedom and Responsibility culture turns sort of cult-like. With a select number of people, questioning its real-world implications has been met with very clear disgust, almost denial. Very rare, though. For me was trivial to brush off."

- Completely unrealistic expectations on calls. For example:  97% of callers have to rate you positively at the end of the call; the call needs to be under 3.5 minutes; you cannot transfer more than X amount to a supervisor; you have to keep the replacement CDs you send under X amount
- Everything, from the time you spent in the restroom, to the time you spent on a certain type of call, is broken down to the second and charted

Definitely take the job so it gets on your resume. It will open doors as other companies are starting to pick up on the fact that Netflix is awesome at recruiting (every excellent candidate on a job hunt knows the name and applies), but this company is BAD at keeping these people.

1017,Netflix,"At Netflix the technology is the WHAT you do, providing great content for subscribers to enjoy is the WHY",2014-12-11,4.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"Netflix is singularly focused.  They want to provide great family content for their subscribers to enjoy.  By doing that, people feel they are getting the most from their monthly subscription.  They have a robust service that is well architected, and they have discipline that has been honed for over a decade to become the best at what they do.  As so many leadership books say, you can tell way more about someone by what they say NO to, and how well they can say NO.  Netflix doesn't do ads, pay-per-view, purchasable content, or porn.  Just thoughtful, edgy, and family programming so you can enjoy your subscription.  They're bigger than people perceive, around 3,000 at time of this writing, but still have that startup feel of ""just get stuff done.""  They get rid of all unnecessary process, so even in management, I can spend most of my time focusing on adding value to our customers instead of administrivia.","Netflix prides themselves on hiring super senior people that are like a pro team.  Everyone is treated like a professional.  You won't find any interns at Netflix.  You'll only be working with people that have been in the industry and are smart at what they're doing--but that doesn't mean they're smart at everything.  So some coordination and challenging of each other is necessary for success.  If you're more introverted and don't speak up much, and not much of a self-starter, this isn't a good company for you."
1018,Netflix,"Amazing culture, clear and transparent strategy, and an amazing staff.",2014-12-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The company has amazing work culture. They encourage personal responsibility, so you're allowed to work the way you like to work as long as work is getting done.

- All teams appear to be very clear and transparent with regards to strategy. I knew exactly what I was doing, why I was doing it and what the overall objective was. Lots of clear communication and collaboration. You think this would be a no brainer for all companies, but this is increasingly rare so it's great to see Netflix embrace communication.

- Plenty of parking in the Beverly Hills office. 

- Catered lunch EVERYDAY.","-Lack of new employee onboarding for your particular role. When you're new, everyone is really busy so there is rarely time for you to sit down with someone and learn the processes for your role that are specific to Netflix. A lot of it is learning on the fly and asking questions as they come up.  This is fine if you're a fast learner or have a lot of experience for your role, but for others this can be a very difficult roadblock that can affect campaigns early on and stifle rapport building within teams"

From my experience, few things have differed from the information available publicly.  I was concerned that there would be a 'culture of fear' before I joined but it has not been so.
* Exceptional senior management.  They keep the company on course, share information freely, are incredibly knowledgable, and open to answering any employee questions.  I have never been more impressed with a senior management team.
* Comp and benefits are outstanding.  I started about a year ago and since then the company has increased my salary by over 50%.  Having had recent, competitive offers, it is truly top-of-market pay.
* Good work-life balance and unlimited time off.","* No formalized training or advancement.  If you want to try out different teams or roles this isn't the place.
* No long-term career objectives.  Nearly every single engineer has the same title so there are no career goals to work towards.  This also means no promotions (unless you're in management).
* All engineering positions are based out of Los Gatos.  If you live elsewhere in the Bay, commuting is a requirement."
1022,Netflix,An incredible environment that will definitely make you grow as a professional,2014-11-18,5.0,Senior Program Manager,"I have worked for Netflix for 3 years. As most of reviews say, it is incredible to see how open and honest the culture is. The company is still pretty flat for its size, and you can feel your impact on initiatives you work on. Development moves very fast and our cycles are short and iterative. Multiple 6-month long projects in other companies get out the door in a matter of a few weeks.

I definitely feel like reviews on Glassdoor do not make justice to the Netflix environment. Yes, there is a lot of work, but I do not feel people get let go all the time, or that anyone would feel scared of being fired without reason. People do not get let go without fair warning. Everyone I know that has been let go so far saw it coming and recognizes it is the best for both them and the company. I find it hard to believe sometimes we have to overcome people's fears in that aspect. And newcomers realize very fast there is a myth and feel great to have joined. 

In short, it is a remarkable, fair and candid company and I am thrilled to have joined and I plan to go nowhere in the next 5 years.","I agree there is no career plan or defined development, but then again, this translates into a lot of freedom to forge your own path. Plus, people who are hired are usually senior, so I feel there is less of a need for a strict career plan. When you work at Netflix, you are exposed to so much that it is easy to explain why you grow so much in a short period of time."
1023,Netflix,A roller coaster ride of excitement and stress,2014-11-17,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Excellent salary, smart people, great time flexibility, satisfying projects. The company values of freedom and responsibility are really like treating employees like adults and trusting them to execute the best overall decisions for the company, which is effective when enough context is given. Innovation and experimentation is rewarded well and many opportunities for ongoing education are offered.","Internal politics. Lots of blame game behavior played as subtly (yet transparently if you pay attention) as possible. Some managers spend too much time in the code instead of managing their team. I had the experience of offering many recommendations for improving team performance and not having them implemented because the culture here is to just do what you want and either get rewarded hugely or sacked. Management coaching appears to be improving, but inconsistently applied. I've seen people who need to be let go stay on for a long time with many opportunities to change and people who were very competent let go without much warning that they need to change something. I've also seen projects executed that solved the business problems presented but were dropped because management didn't like it rather than some other specific reasons."

Doesn't matter how good you are at your job, I haven't talked to a supervisor or manager in months. Constant calls with limited out-dated knowledge base to refer to.

But a stock price bubble does not equal innovation.","Most of the honest reviews on here (meaning those not written by HR) have already covered it, but it's a terrible place to work - a pressure-cooker environment full of overpaid but insecure bosses who manage through fear and intimidation.     Crazy high turnover in every group, lots of good people getting pushed out all the time by their managers.  Then those people are blamed and insulted once they're gone and unable to defend themselves.   The company also stopped innovating long ago. The salary, though substantial, is not worth it, especially when you see the C-level insiders  routinely cashing out millions in shares like thieves in the night.  Hmmm, what do they know that everyone else doesn't?  Look elsewhere - there are many other more humane, ethical, and socially rewarding places to get paid well...like Wall Street."

Every week there are at least 1, if not 2 or 3 emails that go around about a team reorganization because someone was let go.

Altho, I hear this is changing and Netflix will only give you a raise if you can find someone in the Bay Area with the exact title and responsibilities who make more.  Contrary to the buzz about Netflix being a tech innovator, it's become a ""Hollywood"" company.  What drives Netflix is  the Netflix ""produced"" shows; not the ""innovative"" streaming technology - Hollywood runs Netflix; not Los Gatos.","Since many people are only at Netflix for the higher than average salary, there is a culture of fear whereby people are constantly worried about their employment status in the company and will, unfortunately, submit to their baser instincts to do whatever it takes to keep their job.  As for a high-performing culture, I guess it's relative but I've worked with much much more talented people elsewhere.  Netflix is a great place if you are average and are able to keep upper management for figuring out that you are just average and are willing to do whatever it takes to keep up that facade.  It's a less than ideal place if you are truly innovative and want to do amazing ""new"" things.  Again, the new thing at Netflix is producing new shows; not technology."

For some reason going into this I did not think it would be a typical customer service experience based on my own satisfaction with Netflix for the past 3 years.  It's pretty easy work, but so many people who called were lazy and/or arrogant jerks.  Some of them made me feel like I was an inch tall.  It was emotionally draining, especially for someone as sensitive as I am.  The pressure to meet the 0% DSAT also didn't help.  The survey asks about the company but it's answer is a reflection of the customer service and high DSATs effect job performance.  We're expected to convey a relaxed, friendly attitude and build a personal rapport with the customer, but with pressure of the DSAT it's hard not to make everything sound forced and phony because you want to really turn it on to try get a yes out of the person.  I'm an introvert so faking conversations and trying to think of chit-chat was hard for me. Do not take this job if you're sensitive and don't have strong conversational skills.  You must get to know the person. It is required.  I also wanted to add that the schedules and team leaders are constantly changing. It's extremely frustrating."

Also it depends on which team you are part of. My general observation is, larger the team greater the politics being played within.
* IT IS LITERALLY TRUE THAT IT IS CULTURE OF FEAR, no matter how talented you are. I have seen ppl being walked out they were far more talented than other mediocre engineers surviving there for 3-4 years just because they lick the managers a*s and I have seen managers loving it being licked :)
* Few managers who came from Google or some other similar companies, think that they know everything in the world and act as if they rule the world but actually they are literally dumb a*s when it comes to real work.
* They claim it is all rockstar engineers and the fire who are not but I have seen ppl surviving for ages not even knowing what they did for all these years at Netflix and they are pure mediocre engineers.

Middle and lower management can be a crap shoot -- seek out a great boss (there's many at Netflix) and avoid the bad ones (unfortunately, Netflix has those too).   There is a level of 'playing the game' but not to an extent that I'd say is greater than anywhere else.

- Employees aren't as intelligent as other high tech firms, they're hired more for the ability to play corporate politics than technical skill.

- To follow on the above, the average stay here seems to be about a year.

Specifically they never had a clue what was happening on the floor in regards to employee satisfaction and were never involved in developing employees to rank up.

- Reed Hastings is pretty awesome
- They walk the walk in their culture deck

Overall, I highly recommend this company, with the caveat that the ""sports team"" culture can be at odds with a good work/life balance.  If you're a workaholic, set your boundaries and defend them, otherwise you will drown.

While the culture *is* different and genuine, keep in mind that (like any other company in the Valley), your experience at this company is mostly dependent on your relationship with your direct manager and the people around you. Personally, I've been happier at far worse companies because I had a better relationship with coworkers and peers.","- The lack of PTO is a two-edged sword.  Great that you can take what you need when you need; bad that there's never a good time to take time off.  If you have any responsibility and you're taking any significant chunk of time, don't be surprised to find yourself on a working vacation.
- You will get tired of hearing ""That's what Reed wants"" and not being given further context. Granted, this might only a problem if you're not a good follower.
- The ""Do it now, fix it later"" attitude runs the risk of having things that are ""good enough"" but not great. The momentum will often keep you building on something ""good enough,"" but not necessarily something of which you're actually proud."

-Good Pay
-Excellent fun and Training","-3rd Party Call center expectations-with Telus International as the client. (Telus is not as ""laid back"" as Netflix proclaims to be so there is a bit of a disconnect there).

-Changes made quickly after start so some training tools were useless such as:
-Have to keep up with 3 different metrics--which is fine except for the Average Handle Time is 5.5 min--which in training was not an issue. This metric supports customers who know what they're doing such as: how to use a PC, know what kind of PC they have, IF it is in fact a PC, aware of any info on their devices.  In other words a lot of elder cust may feel frustrated that agent is more worried about handle time instead of providing best cust service experience. Double Digits are not your friend. So trying to troubleshoot a technical issue with someone who is not very tech savvy in under 9 minutes or calming an irate cust because the system charged them even though they deserved a free trial or the NUMEROUS calls for payment authorizations which cause a lot of cust to have to keep double the amount of their service cost on their card at all times

-Technical training is not a requirement but you'll notice most of Team Leads or CSR2's are very techy--which makes for satisfied cust because they may be able to explain why their internet may not be working properly in a confident knowing manner. Overeducating is a no-no but you will find them doing this. 

-You are basically encouraged to hurry the cust through the phone call and if they cannot speak English (no spanish support) you are encouraged to have them get an interpreter--also if they are not computer savvy (like some elderly people) you are encouraged to have them try back later when they can get someone to help them. Its basically refer refer refer refer when you can. Not really customer service based or rather not really customer-based. 

-Telus very strict scheduling environment. Make sure your attendance and adherence are on point
-Recording phone calls and allowing you to listen to all your mistakes or rather having a supervisor point out things you did wrong (not much Pos feedback) and write you up for it is supposed to be a method of ""coaching"" but feels more like Big Brother. The threat of being let go is constantly hovering over your head. 
-The position itself seems highly energetic but is unstable--no career focus there
-Turnover is atrocious. which leads to back-to-back calls with no breaks between. Being late or absent on weekends is double the penalty. And the schedule can change without notice."

- They wanted to penalize me for having too many cracked discs in my hub, but couldn't find anything my employees or myself were doing wrong. Offerred no helpful advice, etc. Said we were doing great. Got canned anyway. I always had great reviews, above average everywhere else I've ever worked."

applied , gave the interview and they offered my 180k total.

lost my job after 9 months and now back in the market.

as i spent more time i realized most of the people around me were no more than an yr old.
the work was too much but i thought they are paying me more so i worked hard at it.
turns out i had 2 slight disagreements with a member in another team and bammm .....i was  gone....

the company has a very simple philosophy....if things are not 100% perfect ...fire and hire ......rinse and repeat........

dont make the mistake i made....dont leave your stress free environment for 10-15k etc because you going to end up being fired the moment your performance falls below 100%"

At the time I left there were 525 reps, and of that more then 200 were temps. The real reason they are not converting anyone right now is because they are cutting costs where they can.

1183,Netflix,The cracks start to show pretty quickly.,2012-04-10,2.0,CSR-1,"Well-paying for a call center, free fruit, cheap soda, a nice building, free Netflix.","Your work experience almost depends entirely on your manager, and your manager may or may not change every month.  Things that one manager may not care about (and tell you not to worry about) will be brought up against you six months later as a final warning.  Sometimes policies are suggestions and other times they are concrete, and this will change at random and get you terminated.  This isn't just on the ground floor either, one day everything's fine and the next ten managers are let go and their teams dispersed amongst the remaining set (but everything's still fine guys, don't worry).  There is almost zero room for advancement, managers are hired in from the outside and the best anyone hired at entry-level can expect is to become a CSR-2, a position that doesn't actually pay more.  Anyone and everyone competent seemed to slowly leave for better jobs in my time there, and at first I wondered why when they had so much going on, but eventually I figured it out.

Decent pay if you can stick it out, but way more stressful than it needs to be, and I'm not talking about the customers; an old man yelling at you for thirty minutes because his blu-ray stopped working is nothing compared to not knowing if you're going to be fired that week because you had a sick day three months ago and your calls aren't short enough."
1184,Netflix,Absolutely terrible and soul-crushing,2012-04-04,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"Free bananas, apples, coffee. Low priced soda. Free Netflix account. I worked with (not for!) some amazing people. If your supervisor likes you, you will be treated very well and have some degree of leniency when it comes to meeting stats and time spent on the phone.","Pretty much everything else not noted above. Most days the ""What's working?"" list is shorter than the ""What's broken?"" one.

No communication between departments. Customer service is forced to make things up because the Netflix ""engineering"" or ""research"" teams don't give any sort of information to the reps regarding estimated time to service restoration during outages. I put engineering and research in quotes because, as a CSR, you never actually speak to them. They are merely referenced, like mythology or fairy tales.

Reps are given goals that are nearly impossible to consistently meet, in what I believe to be a fairly obvious system that gives Netflix an opportunity to fire virtually any employee for not hitting their metrics. You basically are there by the grace of your boss, if they want to find a reason to get rid of you it will be fairly easy for them to do so.

The customer dissatisfaction is worded in such a way that many people are leaving feedback on Netflix, not the individual rep, but this DSAT number must be below a certain percentage or you risk losing your job. You are basically encouraged to burn through as many calls as quickly as possible, placating the customer or flat out lying to them (blaming their ISP, home network, or device manufacturer) enough that they'll be compelled to say that they're satisfied after you say ""please stay on the line for a one question survey"" and then promptly hang up on them. 

There is absolutely no way that you are going to have consistent, quality interactions in 4:30 minutes or less, ESPECIALLY after the missteps that Netflix has made this year. But if your numbers drop, or you spend too much time trying to help out, be prepared to be ""coached"". 

Coaching is such an absurd term, because it implies that there is a sort of team camaraderie or human aspect. My last coaching session with my boss involved being told that I was not giving my all. I was only supposed to be a contractor for 59 days. I was supposed to have health insurance by now, and some security as an employee. Instead we are told that they can only afford to hire on so many people, and better luck next time, but you're welcome to stay on as a temp if you like! So yes, I don't really feel like giving my all. Despite putting in consistently good numbers, multiple people on my team have told me (independently) that they are afraid of being fired at any time.

I get the feeling that many people are there only until they find something else. Netflix was actually a considerable pay cut from my last job, but even if the pay was higher the way they treat their employees is at the top of the list of the worst employers I've ever personally experienced. Work / life balance is non-existent. While going through some personal issues in my life, my supervisor told me to ""leave it behind me"" when I walked in the door, not offering anything close to a compassionate response.

One last observation: the people I've noticed who seem to be TRULY happy there are the ones who are too young to know any better. I'm not old by any means, but I'm also not an 18-24 year old kid who doesn't realize that jobs don't need to be like this, that you can actually be treated like a human being and be *inspired* to perform, rather than doing it because you fear for your job on a daily basis. Eventually Netflix will chew them up and spit them out, too. Ask yourself why anyone should give loyalty to a company where an employee celebrating a 6 month anniversary is considered a veteran? 

Also, the positive reviews on here are probably left by Netflix management. It cites things they don't even offer anymore at the Hillsboro facility (like free mac&cheese, and, oh I dunno, BENEFITS for most of the people here). You will most likely be a temp with Netflix (meaning no benefits) until you quit or get fired.

I've been lucky enough to work for some truly amazing companies, and Netflix is definitely not one of them."

Streaming and eight DVDs at a time.,"They hired on hundreds as temps and told all of us we would be ""converted"" and receiving health benefits within three months, or be fired for poor performance.  Well, that never happened.  We were all strung along, some of us were fired, but by the time six months came along only 30 of the remaining 250 temp employees were given health insurance.  they kept telling us, ""maybe next month.""  When I finally quit and told them why, I was told that they were using benefits as a performance motivator, and they extended the conversion time frame to a year.  I told them that health insurance is something that GOOD employers give their employers, not a performance motivator, and that they needed to find a better way to motivate their employees.

Breaks are CSR responsibility.  You have a schedule, but you decide whether it's best to go on break or take one more call.  
On extremely high call volume days (i.e. server crashes, etc.) managers show appreciation by coming around with a cart of beverages and snacks to keep you going.","While you are placed on teams to help you deal with any obscure technical issues that may arise, the teams aren't very supportive or responsive.  They love to BS in the chatroom, but when someone asks a real question suddenly it seems like no one is home.  On the rare occasions when you do have an escalated call that you can not resolve, supervisors avoid your messages in order to avoid dealing with the dissatisfied customer.  

There is very little positive feedback.  On days when I did everything correctly - 0% customer dissatisfaction (by survey response), low handle times, etc., the supervisor never said a word.  The moment you have a long call that pushes your time up, they call you on it.  Regarding any such poor performance: it was very common for embarrassment tactics to be used in response instead of constructive criticism."

I thought that technology would be used to solve difficult problems but in the end the problems to be solved are all around content, content, content. It is fun, though, to work at Netflix. The company is extremely open and transparent with data, decisions and the overall direction of the company. There are no secrets. It is very refreshing to see such an attitude; compare that to Apple.","Yes, there are interesting things to solve in cloud computing but discovery, search, personalization, and the overall architecture of the Netflix website can only be described as patchwork. The people who are working on these services are stuck in their ways and are protecting their personal little kingdoms. Netflix used to be leading when it comes to personalization and other discovery mechanisms. It has lost its ways and now those areas are a few years behind the competition. 
On a related note Netflix praises itself to have extremely talented people. This might have been the case but the talent density is certainly not the same as it used to be. A lot of the good people left recently and a lot of the deadwood hangs around because they will never be able to get a comparable salary elsewhere. There are the occasional firings going on but that is just scratching the surface. Because Netflix does not believe in career development (active or through mechanisms like 20% time) for their people it is hard to keep up with the competition."

The culture of fear is VERY real. There is zero work life balance. When I started I was suprised to see so many 30 somethings who were single and had no kids. I learned quickly that it's almost the only way to keep your job. 60 hours a week doesn't work when you have a family or even a significant other, especially when what precious time you do have off you are worried about work. Feedback is relative to who is giving it. I received my first real feedback session after I interviewed for a position 6 months after being hired.

Some organizations are terrible (i am not talking about IT/ back-office type group) when it comes to  recognizing people, allowing (forget about encouraging) their growth. No carrer, no recognition. In a way, its a career dead-end. Its a JOB.

Recent break-neck hiring has bought in a TON of managers (e.g. instead of bringing in 1 project manager, they've hired >1 managers). Believe it or not, it takes 4 times the amount of meetings (compared to 2 years ago at Netflix) to get 1/2 of what we used to get done in the same period of time.
