2,Neustar,SOC,2022-04-01,4.0,Information Security Engineer,This is a great company for those new to the cybersecurity industry. Working in a SOC requires troubleshooting routing issues and other security related events for customers. I found that being self motivated with a problem-solving mindset will get you noticed by your managers. This company will reward hard work and new skill development.,Working nights at a 24/7 SOC can be exhausting.

7,Neustar,A good marketing analytics company,2022-03-02,4.0,Principal Statistician,"If you want to work in marketing analytics Neustar should be at the top of the list given its best-in-class data and products. You will work with a lot of smart people and have access to A LOT of data. Management generally seems to care about inclusion, diversity, mental health, and getting people’s feedback, although the actual results will likely depend on the specific group you are a part of. Neustar is really a combination of many acquisitions over time, and whatever group you hire into will have its own set of quirks and culture, so it is hard to give one overall statement about the company. But the company as a whole has done well to position itself in the space and is growing because of it.","Neustar is large enough that bureaucracies are abundant, but that can be said for most companies this size. Neustar is stingy with raises but if your business unit and the company does well this can be offset with nice bonuses. Come review time Neustar uses a bell curve and forces everyone to fit on it, so if you want to be rated anything better than a “strong performer” (the middle of the bell curve) you had better be the best thing since sliced bread. Prior to the pandemic Neustar significantly clamped down on working from home which was a major concern for a lot of employees. Having said that, Neustar was recently been acquired by TransUnion so HR related concepts like above could change."

The people I work with are genuinely respectful and the environment is good. Pay is great, job comes with annual bonuses based on earning/KPI achievement. Benefits are good, better now that we have a new HR/Benefits provider.","Working here thus far, the largest issue I have had with the company is lack of communication, not much in the way of organization, and the training period was brutal due to this.

You can learn a lot given the number of businesses they are involved it.","Incompetence at every level. They sell MMM and MTA but have no idea how to run it. They keep getting new clients and sell their old client list. But VPs and above have no experience in getting real stuff done and pile stuff up on junior folks.

If you are looking for MTA, run away from them. They store your data for months, don't work on it and then find reasons that this was not what they asked. Why, because the team that worked on it left and the client is now stuck in this relationship.

On MMM, the modeling team changes all the time. Their system is a mess and they decide the numbers vs run them. Again, its a sham. Stay away.

So much politics and people who want to get work done, don't last long. This has the highest attrition rate. 

Also, all these comments on D&I, look at their Senior leadership. Its a joke, no diversity at the top. Only at the bottom."

The first thing is the culture. Employees are genuinely happy to be here and there is a common desire to succeed. People act as enablers versus barriers. The executive leadership under CEO Charlie Gottdiener is quite good strategically and they are strongly committed to cultivating an inclusive, engaged, and motivated company culture. The other thing that really stands out about Neustar is that it operates much like a startup where people are empowered to do what it takes to succeed without the fiefdoms or territorialism that is common in larger companies. Motivated employees can make a big difference here.",Neustar is owned by private equity so there is a stronger focus on profitability versus growth.

128,Neustar,Living the Values,2021-02-15,5.0,"Director, Software Engineering","Honestly, terms like ""Decision Making Framework"", ""Values Culture"", ""SMART Goals"", and ""Management Alignment Plan (MAP)"" generally give me a rash. But Neustar has really used these tools effectively to create a culture of transparency and respect. They do not throw these things out there as evidence of industry, but as ways to effectively run a company.

Two quick examples: when the pandemic hit, the CEO and executive team used these tools to come up with a bullet-point list of priorities that the company would be following. Top of the list: employee safety. Every decision made around closing/opening offices, etc, has been made through this lens.

Second example: after Charlottesville, management realized that their plan for D&I (which had been de-prioritized due to the pandemic) had to be accelerated. They not only brought the plan back out, but put wood behind it. They hired an executive-level person with deep expertise in the area to drive the initiatives. She has been moving at amazing speed, and setting up working groups throughout the company to identify and address areas where we need to improve. And when employees ask questions at all-hands of the CEO about where the progress is, he doesn't sugar-coat anything. While it was an issue that a recent restructuring of the Executive Council did not look as diverse as it should have, the CEO at least acknowledged that, and stuck to his commitment to D&I, even if it took time to ""get it right"". Others may feel like this is disingenuous, to me it feels like not just wallpapering over deep, systemic issues. But time will tell.","It's possible that the product strategy of the company is to be a systems integrator and rely heavily on channel sales, rather than direct. This is a bit outside my area of expertise, but it would be nice to see more innovation and in-house IP, and captive customers who rely on it."

Good work-life balance (Not a lot of pointless meetings for Sales)
Good company leadership (Great response to Covid-19 from leadership)","Old boys club.  If you're not a golfing buddy of the muckity mucks you have no opportunity to be successful.  There is no connection between Talent / Product Knowledge / Hard Work and Success there - it's only if you have a personal champion in management that will assign you accounts with real opportunity.

There are only so many accounts/businesses that can afford their services, so if you don't get assigned good accounts you'll starve and no one in management cares.  I got empty promises and crocodile tears from everyone on the ladder up to the C-Suite all acknowledging they had put me in a position to fail and promising to do something about it, but none of them kept their promises.  

They are very strict about account assignments so most people just sleep on their accounts and don't actually work (I found multiple deals they made me give away to people who were asleep at the wheel on the account).

They had an entire team assigned to Travel when Covid hit.  They promised they wouldn't leave everyone to die on the vine, but they never did anything for anyone on that team.  

They keep feeding the best accounts and best opportunities to the favorites and screw everyone else.  

Someone at the top thought ""More Sales People Equals More Opportunities"" so they hired AEs without any plan for account allocation and no path to success.

I spent 4 months waiting for initial account assignments and then was given a stack of dead wood with a promise they'd balance out in the new year.  New Year came and they took away everything I'd broken into and gave me another stack of dead wood.

They keep hiring new people (without a plan) so they can just churn the last crop of people that never had a chance to succeed."

Offices are decent though not impressive (san fran excluded), snacks provided, ok PTO, some work from home allowed pre-covid.","For more experienced people, Neustar may not be a good fit. Dysfunctional senior leadership, dated technology, product unable to deliver on sales message. 

You will spend much of your time making excuses for endless delays, feeling forced to lie on status and looking bad to clients for a broken product usually through no fault of your own. While junior staff will be shielded from this somewhat and learning in their role, experienced people not learning/growing from the role will get frustrated with this very quickly.

- The role: managing and coordinating Marketing Mix Modelling projects across multiple teams. Guiding and advising the client through the data delivery and EDA process (what to deliver, why and how). Once basic responsibilities are covered, initiative is essential to take home that extra value in learning. There are many resources that will give you that opportunity.
- The product/services offered: the company really pushes for innovation in the data analytics sector. As an employee you are exposed to all these products even if they aren't part of your day to day. Plenty to learn.
- The opportunities: it's frequent to change from one team to another so horizontal learning is very possible. Can't talk about vertical promotions as I've not been there for long, but looks they won't be offered by default unless you actively pursue and ask for it.
- The clients: mostly marketing teams within top-tier players in the retail, consumer goods, automotive, telecom, banking & insurance, energy and classifieds industries across EMEA and APAC.
- The line management team: always there to help, although very busy hence forcing independence and initiative on the employee's end. Quickly handing a good amount of responsibility and offering really rewarding experiences.
- The Neustar culture: I've had the experience of working here through the COVID19 pandemic and I've simply been impressed. They quickly took the lead and asked everyone worldwide to work from home. They incremented senior management updates up to once a week, gave one extra PTO day per month (the ""Mental Health Day""), allowed some expensable budget so each employee could get an office-ready space at home, provided free subscriptions to the Headspace app, and more. The senior management team really proved to live the company's values throughout these hard times.",- The HR team: the HR team dedicated to EMEA offices is very small and based in India. It's easy to see how HR protects the company's interests and follows senior management mandates but hard to find that HR partner that will be ready to listen to and help the employee when they need something. They are distant and slow to respond. They were incapable of solving the one problem I faced.

With the COVID-19 crisis.. the CEO and leadership team have been amazing... going over and above, around the clock.   Making sure our customers were supported with their needs and then taking wonderful care of employee’s, such as moving the entire workforce to working from home before government enforced.   Mental health days off.   Working from home stipend.   Access to telemedicine, increased communication with weekly CEO meetings for the whole company over Webex, which includes featured speakers such as well being professionals e.g nutritionists, doctors, fitness professionals as well as inspirational speakers.    I really can’t think of anything else they could have done.
The company is normally a great place to work... lots of opportunities etc... you can find those things at many other companies though... but you really can’t find this management team or the core values that are shared throughout the business.",I’m struggling to think of anything at this point that I could put down as a con...  guess I don’t really like the green brand color  that much!  ;-)
196,Neustar,Such Amazing Care during this Crisis,2020-04-15,5.0,Senior Director Engineering,Our CEO and EC truly care about the people who work at Neustar.  The support for our new working conditions is remarkable.  I have been so  impressed and delighted at the information shared during our weekly updates from Charlie and his staff.  I truly feel like I work in a small startup but actually we are geographically disbursed team of over 1500 employees.,Nothing to report at this time.

5. A lot of of work from home options and flexible HR policies.",None I can think of
198,Neustar,Neustar,2020-04-10,5.0,Marketing Lead,"I think our CEO has done a fantastic job in focusing Neustar on key strategic priorities, aligning our distinct business units around a common set of values and and inspiring the company, overall, to see and work toward a common vision for the future.  In particular, I commend him for his great leadership during the COVID 19 crisis, during which time he has met with employees regularly via video, shared in an open/transparent way how Neustar would be supporting employees (including, among other things, a special stipend to make everyones' home office workable -- and an extra ""mental health"" day off for all employees).  I can say I have never felt more connected to the Neustar family than I do at the present time, when we are actually more physically disconnected than ever before.  I appreciate the CEO's empathy and leadership - and it is clear from his weekly video chats with the company that he has a very big heart and sincerely cares about his flock.","There are a lot of different businesses, products and services offered by Neustar, so it's sometimes hard to get a clear and complete handle on what the company does -- outside of one's respective business unit."
199,Neustar,Watch your back,2020-04-06,1.0,Customer Service Representative,The Louisville office has great perks for first shift. The occasional cookout or prize games.,"If you are second or third shift, do not expect advancement no matter how longer your tenor. The excuse is “not enough exposure”. They are also slow selling off departments for a dying company that will probably be liquidated in a few years"
200,Neustar,Don't buy into their client list. This place is a sham,2020-03-31,1.0,Senior Manager,"Salary, big brands. You get to learn initially.","At the outside, this place looks like it's great with the top most brands.  But they make up numbers to match the old ones. There are very few people who actually know what they are doing. Most people stick around based on politics and who gets along with everyone else. I've seen people actually make numbers up and showing clients. The MTA is a joke with no client seeing any results in less than 18 months. They sell something they cannot fulfill. Take your money and time and go elsewhere."
201,Neustar,Solid Company with Great People!,2020-03-28,5.0,Director,"Since joining the Neustar team, I have been very impressed with the company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Communication and support from the CEO and the rest of the management team has been regular and consistent throughout with Neustar being one of the first companies to announce that all employees would work remotely until it is safe to return to the office.
Everyone on my team works hard but also seems to be able to maintain a good work/life balance.
Benefits are solid with relatively low employee premiums for medical and dental insurance.","In my relatively limited experience, I do not see any major negatives"

Major focus In driving a collaborative, accountable and respectful culture.  Executing against vision and strategy with momentum we’ve not always had.","The company has business units and services in multiple industries. While this provides some key benefits, it creates investment pressure to invest at the same levels as competitors.  This requires tough investment choices that may not be fully understood by teams in each business unit."

204,Neustar,Hats off to the Executive Team,2020-03-26,5.0,Director of Operations,"I know it sounds cheesy - but I have never been more proud to be a part of Neustar. I feel more dedicated than ever and am so appreciative of the support I am getting at work. The dedication and commitment to our employees during this really weird time is truly unbelievable. The CEO (alongside the executive team) is hosting weekly calls with the entire company to ease the minds of employees - ensuring that jobs are safe and that employees are 100% aware of the resources that are available to them. On today's call, we had a physician provide practical tips and tricks to cope with anxiety and stress. Additionally, an HR representative walked us through a new benefit available to us if we need to talk to someone or get support in other ways. This benefit extended to anyone in your household - wow. Last week, the session focused on shifting to a fully-remote job, offering tips and tricks from ""experts"" who had been doing this for 10+ years. Of course, these weekly meetings are rooted first in the genuine concern of the employees remaining safe and healthy above all else. 

I fully believe that Charlie and the entire executive team ""get it""... and they aren't just saying that. I can genuinely feel it. It's hard to work remotely full-time while also being a teacher. It's hard to keep to a standard schedule all day. It's a scary time - and we are all worried about our friends and families. The EC truly do understand the magnitude of the effects of COVID-19 to everyone's home life  and wow... it's a really great feeling, because life is hard enough right now.",Not metro accessible (but moving to Reston soon).

It’s such a small increase that it’s insulting.  Congratulations, you just told your employees to coast and stop trying to make a difference.

Morale has been going down.  They changed the holiday part to employees only, whereas in the past, it was employee plus one.  The holiday gala was during the weekday 3 pm to 8pm, and it was inconvenient for most people to go.  Every answer seems to be ""well, other companies are doing things that way, so we will do it that way too.""   They are on a cost cutting spree"
220,Neustar,Faux Positive Reviews,2019-12-27,2.0,Project Manager,Benefits are good in comparison to like companies.,"If you suck up to the right people you can be very successful and move up the ladder quickly.  I've seen an EVP move up the chain in a manner of 5 to 7 years and is not very knowledgeable in their job. Also, if you actually ask people about how they feel about Neustar  8 times out of 10 you would get a very negative response.  Many of the positive reviews are not real. On paper, Neustar looks good but in reality not so much."
221,Neustar,Mostly good company but benefits shifting in wrong direction,2019-12-17,3.0,Software Engineer,"Great people, good technology, interesting work, pay is competitive.","A new CEO/HR brought unwelcome benefits changes.  Work at home policy was flexible before new policy restricting to two days per month. Vacation policy change for only some of the company; a change from having a maximum accrued hours to only allow two week roll over from year to year, unless you're in California, where laws prevent companies from doing such things.  And the final insult - 401K match is now awarded ONLY once per a calendar year, in the first quarter of the NEXT calendar year.  The worst part to me is the reason for these changes was given as ""trying to be in line with other market segment players"".   Huh?"

233,Neustar,Take the long view,2019-09-20,5.0,Sales,"If you enjoy solving complex problems, Neustar will give you the training and the autonomy to creatively solve them.  When it works, you pull from amazing resources and truly unique data assets to solve a very real marketplace challenge: ""How do I know I'm actually identifying and reaching a consumer.""  There are financial rewards for winning, like any sales role, but Neustar will surround you with experts that will become a valuable network later in your career.  The Sales Engineers, Product Leaders, Consultants and Data Scientists that fly into cities across the country with me is what I value most.","There is an undercurrent of real work that gets done at Neustar, for type-A individuals who take charge.  Unfortunately, this creates some cultural bad habits where some people become dependent upon a single driver, and they watch from the sidelines.  The result is a personality-driven way of operating, versus a true process-driven way of operating.  This ""hero culture"" works at small companies, but you see growing pains as with this approach."

Exec team and GGC are patient and after some initial missteps are correcting course and making good decisions.

There are always ways to keep yourself challenged, learn more and take on additional responsibility and be rewarded for it.  You'd have to work hard to be bored at Neustar.  Not only is the company fast-paced, so is the rate of change in the industries we work in.  

While may have come later than it should have, current leadership team is actively investing in its people, making sure they have more of a voice and addressing our most pressing challenges.

Despite the changes, the benefits are VERY strong...

We have a great company already and even better potential","I could enumerate a number of 'cons.'  All companies have them as evidenced by the large number of return employees Neustar has- people that thought the grass is greener but came back when they saw that there are challenges everywhere.  For most of our challenges, we also have a game plan we are working through to address them and they will resolve with time and commitment from those that stick it out.  
We grew quickly through acquisition and there was little to no effort put into how to make us all successful together and no investment in people, systems, tools to do this.  This is being rectified for the most part, but takes time.  It is extremely hard though and there are certain groups that are bearing an exceeding portion of this burden and I am not sure that is truly recognized and appreciated (perhaps some of the tone deaf comments here)"

Your entry/exit swipes are monitored to make sure you’re spending 8 hours in the office. Seriously.
Little to no hike/bonus even after working numerous nights and weekends.
Benefits are subpar. 
They humiliate employees to quit and make the remaining employees do additional work there by eliminating as many jobs as they can. 
Working 50-60 hours/week is common.
Only 2 wfh days are allowed in a month.

Lot of positive reviews on here are not true. As you can see most of them are in the past few months and this could be due to the executive council decision to change the image which should’ve been done by improving the work place and not by fabricating lies."

-New CEO has decided to make his mark by cutting out a lot of the things that were great about working at Neustar.  Huge cut back in benefits (restrictive WFH policy, healthy lifestyle benefit cut back ($500 annual value), no gym reimbursement ($360 annual value), can only carry over 80 hrs of PTO, 401k match happens in one bucket at the end of the year).
-The WFH cut back is huge since a lot of people in the northern VA area were hired to work in Tysons and were forced to work in Sterling when the Tysons office closed.  Huge negative effect on work-life balance.  Intended to improve collaboration, but it doesn’t seem to be accomplishing that since most employees on a project work in different offices anyways.  And they are actually tracking at an individual level swipes into the buildings to ensure this policy is being enforced.  Seriously.
-New hires get screwed when it comes to benefits: 5 less days of vacation and takes 5 years instead of 3 to get fully vested in 401k match
-Constant Reorgs 
-Revenue targets have been missed the last few years leading to extremely low merit increases over the past two years (under 1% each year) as well as low/no bonuses.  
-Projects start with sales promising things that cannot be delivered.  Project management makes them take longer than it should, involve way too many people, and be more stressful than they need to be.  Which ultimately leads to bad results and unhappy clients.  Hopefully this will be improved upon with the new organization around projects.
-Very repetitive work, not a lot of opportunity for innovation.

Working here is  generally unpleasant.  You can expect nonstop politics, pressure, unrealistic goal setting, and layoffs that come out of left field.

Morale is abysmal. ""Culture"" is coming in too little, too late, and there are some extreme gatekeepers around what we do as an office. To build...something...the NY office has been divided into random teams who get points for activities. If someone on your team isn't into it, you basically lose points, which is demotivating. This is all being run by one random employee, whose ideas are polarizing.

They've also cut the 401K match to a yearly lump sum (so people will lose an entire year's worth of growth), cut down WFH (which was a huge perk in our loud, open office), cut the fitness reimbursement (which is still on the website! new hires, you will not get this!)."

278,Neustar,Time to Leave,2019-04-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are still many smart people trying to make a difference.,"There are clear signs that Neustar is not doing well.  Brain-drain.  Many key leaders and star employees have left and their jobs have been either eliminated or replaced with less experienced people at lower levels.

With increased terminations, everyone is now doing multiple people's work.  This is driving good employees to be overworked, stressed, unhappy and ultimately quitting.  I have seen many strong leaders and  highly respected colleagues leave within the past 6 months.   We have weekly terminations in my function and it seems all the A players have left or are planning to leave.  I just heard there's yet another round of layoffs.   We have new executive hires leaving within the first 6 to 12 months.  

""Aesop was right to warn people not to kill the goose that laid the golden egg. When the best employees and leaders leave a company, that company's chances of survival rapidly shrinks.""

While there has been an attempt to build a new culture, it doesn't seem to be making a difference.   New HR policies including a twice a month work from home allowance, reduction in PTO plan, a 5 year 401 K vesting schedule, and 1% merit increase are just a few recent changes making Neustar an antiquated company.   Even HR people are leaving and many of the good ones have already left.   

The new CEO ""sweats the small stuff"" and his focus is misdirected.   Having a rookie CEO could be good for a changing business, but from what we've seen so far he is not the right leader for Neustar.  He's breeding a new generation of narcissistic, non-committal, politically driven executives who drive division between groups and functions."

My time employed was generally excellent, some good, and a very limited time at good - /  fair +.  I worked on the NPAC system (in various capacities).  I really enjoyed the people I worked with and for, to the point where we became outside-work friends doing things like having meals at each other’s houses, and coordinating pre- or post-meeting activities (e.g., arrive early to enjoy theater before a meeting in NYC, ski the weekend before a meeting in Denver, stay for a beach weekend after a meeting in Miami Beach).  As is the case in almost all employment, the people can make or break your experience at a company. I was VERY fortunate in this area.

If you work on something high profile, do a good job, AND have a good supervisor, you'll get rewarded (salary increase, bonus, spot award).  This happened to me on several occasions.

For me (and my group), work-life balance was excellent.

Compensation was very good.  Benefits excellent.  Promotions from within, very common.  Remote working is common and acceptable.","Personally, not much.  I reported directly to several VPs, and once to an SVP.  They all protected my back, and kept me away from some of the politics going on in the company at the executive level.

However, I did observe other co-workers (not in my group) have issues with managers/directors/VPs that were NOT good supervisors.  Poor communication, lack of clarity on job expectations and roles/responsibilities, playing favorites with their staff, etc.  So again, your supervisor matters.

I'm not sure why a successful sales person would join the organization unless you enjoy attending Franklin Covey meetings and filling out a lot of internal forms. Only 2 people from the security group made their assigned quota last year and one of the people made it on a deal that was effectively a downgrade but was called new business. Across all divisions the highest number of sales people to ever achieve 100% of their quota was 22%. 

There are 3 products in the security group and all of them are sold to different buying centers. The DNS solution is solid but DNS is not really top of mind for a CIO. The DDoS solution doesn't have broad market adoption or name recognition and the IP Intelligence solution is good but it is a niche product in the industry. It's tough to cross sell when each product has a different buying center. 

The new sales leaderships strategy is to implement Franklin Covey. Sales process is not the issue getting new business is the issue and that should be the focus.

Acquisitions, reorganizations, layoffs, strategy changes have all left teams confused and frustrated. Key senior leaders can be distant and out of touch with their core staff and often see their teams working against one another versus together. Integration of acquired IP is still in a rocky place. Recent layoffs saw major talent loss leaving many teams a little too lean.  Hesitant to invest money in people and opportunities."

Also the delivery process from the advisory service team was well organized and supported by technologies, but ONLY for the legacy MMM product.","Neustar | MarketShare really needs to change, which can't be solved by management consultants and some good words from US. I was employed in EMEA, a high potential market according to the consultancies - data driven, less competititive, eager to get developed. But since the Neustar acquisition and following privatisation, every day this potential was ignored and imho wasted. Instead, a very centralised, conservative management drove old fashioned business practise, neglecting digital transformation at clients and within the own organisation. Team members should be generalists, just implement out dated delivery and consulting practise. Young talent was burned, seniors became slow. Never seen a company with weaker, less sustainable management. If you want a super hierarchical management, lacking in strategy and go to market approach, apply here. On top, messy digital data management for a company which calls themselves a leader in DMPs and a finger pointing mentality between teams, this is your place to be."

-Constant acquisitions where everything is fun and great for a while. Then the honeymoon phase is over and management decides to restructure and then heads roll. Their strategy? Cut the most hard working/most expensive employee there, only to rehire for that position a couple months down the line because they bit off more than they could chew resulting in a loss of knowledge transfer and optimum efficiency.
-This company's culture struggles to be hip and innovative yet it's run by people who think this is still the 90's. It's like a constant struggle between good and evil and the side that doesn't want to adapt, also happens to be the side that doesn't want to embrace change and progress for the sake of keeping their jobs.
-Constant issues with customer satisfaction due to the inevitable decline in the quality of services. Patch after patch to fix these issues, never wanting to address the underlying root problem. I have to ask, would you like to work on a product that has 20 bandages on it?

There is a massive exodus of long tenured employees and executives which is not surprising given the turmoil (just check linkedin on how many have left Neustar in 2016). 

Let's review the last two years at Neustar: Loss of a major government contract worth 50% of company revenue resulting in several major shareholder lawsuits, overpaying for an acquisition of a marketing services company by 4x and then having to publicly be humiliated and write down estimated revenues, announcing the split of a company in order to confuse the investor community. Not to mention that the company seems to have a new CTO, CMO and SVP of Sales every 12 months. 

The company also likes to layoff people every September (they just did 3% of the company) and in December to ""remove the fat"" as was said by one of the VPs in a recent meeting. 

There are lots of unknowns related to the company split and the management has shared no new information since the public announcment. Many people in General Administration are just waiting for their severance package and the office morale is depressing even at the HQs.  Speculations are that the board will try to sell off some of the low performing business units (marketshare, security, etc) before the split."

Spent a lot of money on acquisitions and they're failing, so Neustar is throwing good money after bad hoping it will solve the problem.  Unfortunately spending all that money there means that there are a lot of cuts elsewhere.

Annual large layoffs with much of the best talent being cut in favor of leadership pet projects or people leaders like the most, regardless of their benefit to the Company.  Work that was being done by the people who are cut is simply distributed to others so those remaining do 2-3x as much over time.

The culture is very back stabbing and nasty. I've never had people treat me so poorly at work. Not worth the lure of a good paycheck to lose yourself in a such a disheartening place.

You walk in the door as a professional and you leave, having been worn down and tired.  Often times others leave because they just can't watch another coup d'etat be tolerated.  There is this constant executive plotting to grab responsibility from one another instead of focusing on the job at hand.  If you stay out of the plotting, well you are going to get hurt, so it's no win situation for career growth.  There are so many Directors in charge but you find yourself asking...what do they actually do?  The CEO is inviting and personable but can't develop a sound strategy evidenced by the constant change of strategy and acquisition of companies that have no synergy with existing efforts. They aren't mergers as much as they are high speed collisions without the air bags. With each collision the existing execs get nervous and start plotting. It's going on again with a recent acquisition.  It's also unconscionable that employees would be directed to author a favorable glassdor review to boost the ratings."

Also, the office space and location was amazing.  While I didn't have the company benefits, we were on my spouses, I've heard they were quite good.","Everything else.  The fact that there were multiple times that the Director I reported to asked why I wasn't in my seat at EXACTLY 8:30 AM is now, laughable.  People have lives outside of the office, and we were punished because this person did not.  The direction my team received from this person was non-existent.  One week it would be one thing, and then next week something totally different; to the point where people wouldn't actually do anything until it was in writing to use as proof that what was previously said, was in fact said.  There was no work-life balance.  You were expected to be on 24x7x365 because ""this is a sales job, and that's what sales people do.""  Never mind the fact that customers aren't working the day before a holiday.  This team was expected to be in their seats listening to the deafening silence of no one else in the office.  The management team had their favorites, and that was quite evident.  If you weren't a favorite, you might as well be invisible.  They claim to listen to their employees yet people that should definitely no longer be employed there are there, and very exceptional people have wised up and left the organization.  

While Neustar as a whole promoted the fact that they like to promote from within, and allow people to move within the organization - that was clearly not something that extended to the entire company.  Getting the strong arm from management that you were hired on a team and have to remain on that team, doesn't do much for job satisfaction, except for pushing people to look externally - like yours truly.   There were always a large number of job openings, but sadly the people that were hired were all new-hires, because no one else was allowed to make the move; or had gotten to the point where they just wanted out."

A lot of people are leaving the company. The numbers they announced at the all hands meeting where shocking. The only new hires that are noticed are in upper management resulting in a SVP inflation. Internal promotions are rare.

The interim CTO created a lot of bureaucracy. No changes are allowed without an entire approval chain. This slows everything down and treats every employee like a dumb kid. This doesn't fix any issues. You end up working in some kind of strange startup culture following strict telco rules.

Neustars management gambles high, looses a big contract bringing in the most profit and nothing happens. The upper management lacks professionalism and swears in various company wide meetings. Dozen of things the CEO said would have get a normal employee fired by HR. At Neustar management can make jokes about someones phobia in front of the entire company.

The way the company works is to buy external companies and don't do anything with them. How much they screwed up can be seen in the following quote from the Neustar CFO made in the Q3 2015 earnings call: ""I think it is fair to say that we have been relatively lousy at spending on R&D"". Now Neustar will loose all the money from NPAC there is a push to create new innovations. In the last months the frequency of acquisitions has increased.

On it's current course and speed this company is tracking to be sold off to private equity and chunked out into pieces since at this point it's the only way the management team might salvage some return for the shareholders.

Neustar is having the unusual high turnover at the SVP/VP ranks.  Toss in a few new directors, and the loss of more engineering talent. This does not produce a stable environment.  I’m sure history will repeat itself, and the new SVP/VP’s and directors will hire their buddies.   They will make a big mess and leave.  This happens every two years.

3.

Financial planning was throughout my 3 years subject to wild swings. Ultimately what ended it for me was closing the San Diego office I worked in, as part of a grand plan to unite all the west coast offices into Mountain View. A month later they announced they were closing Mountain View and moving to San Frncisco. They have subsequent rented a large amount of office space in UTC, about 5 miles from where I previously worked. Looking back it wasn't much of a surprise. I witnessed Neustar gut the sales team, in a management initiative to cut costs (and experience) of the sales team that our business unit never really overcame. They also had a (consultant led) plan to streamline managent titles which ultimately pissed off a lot of people by taking away their titles but achieved nothing else. In my time I had 5 managers.

I' wrote a scathing, one page review earlier and I'm not surprised to see that it was pulled.

The fact is the truth is hard to take and rather than trying to fix the issues Neustar prefers to hire the services of a firm to post fake 5-star reviews and flag honest ones.

The fact is Neustar took an immediate nose dive ever since the influx of former AOL employees The worst thing that happened for the company was the day Jeff Ganeck stepped down and Lisa Hooks became CEO.

Cronyism was rampant and Neustar employees were be laid off to make room for former AOL staff. This was immediately following the downfall of AOL. It's no accident that AOL failed and as soon as the former AOL staffers came onboard that Neustar started down that path.

The AOL guys kept gloating about ""this is how we did it at AOL"" every chance they got. In one meeting an AOL crony mentioned it again and I blurted out ""Didn't AOL fail?""

The company became a culture of cronyism and witch hunts. They found all manner of reasons to fire and lay off long time Neustar employees while lining the pockets of their fiends.

One such deal was for a storage array that Neustar spent several million dollars for. They brought in a retired AOL guy to come in and facilitate the deal. It turns out the salesperson for this array was that guy's son.

They fired a longtime Neustar employee because he voiced an objection to the multi-million dollar deal. Basically, we didn't need the storage array.

As soon as the deal was done and the ink was dry the guy ""retired"" again. Go figure.

Two years later a different set of middle tier leadership decided that storage array was unnecessary and was looking to get rid of it. It turns out we never used it anyway and thus it was redundant. It's clear what was really at play here. Someone needed a commission and daddy came in to make sure he'd get it even if it cost other people their jobs.

During one round of layoffs the AOL cronies proceeded to lay off as many of the legacy Neustar employees as possible. While they were laying people off because of budget cuts they purchased around a million dollars worth of ""art"" to hang in the corporate office.

Witch hunts were all too common. It was a culture of ""no"" and ""let's blame and fire someone"". The funny thing is that all of the original AOL cronies that were brought on are no longer there. Most of them were fired or forced out.

I should get into the annual review process. Basically, the policy is that something like less than 1% of the company can be a 1 (highest rating), 5% can be a 2, 75% must be a 3, 10% has to be a 4, and another 10% has to be a 5.

Your actual performance has no bearing on where you rank. It all came down to politics and economics. When someone makes a 1 or 2 an certain number of people have to be made 4 and 5 to balance the overall payout.

A 5 was considered an automatic layoff at one stage. So they already had a pool of people ready to be laid off when it was time which happened once or twice a year. What actually determined your rating was if someone wanted you gone and how well you played office politics.

Upper management encouraged this practice. I've seen a lot of hard-working, dedicated employees get dumped on this way just because there was a disagreement one time or another.

There was a lot of other abuse and fraud at work. The beautiful thing about the position I worked was that I got to hear and see everything.

Do yourself a favor and stay away from this company at all cost. The benefits, as good as they were, is not worth it. All it will take is one disagreement or one mishap and you're head is on the chopping block."
531,Neustar,Turning the Tide - New Company is Emerging,2015-09-05,4.0,,"I have been at NSR for a little over a year. This company is in transformation mode. If you like the 'start up' frenzy in a large company atmosphere - this company is perfect! What this means is that you have the stability of a large corp with strong benefits and compensation but you also have the opportunity to make a difference at any level within the organization. The company has a strong direction and has stayed on course with the plan from what I can see over the past 3 years. Also NSR is the company for you if: 1. Work hard, play hard is your motto, 2. You have great ideas and have no problem speaking up, and 3. Can leave your ego at the door and handle works my cross department on most deliverables.","There is an influx in the culture because of the numerous acquisitions and departmental changes that have occurred in the last couple of years. Unfortunately this is part of a company that is transforming. One of the major drawbacks of this short-term challenge is that some employees are unhappy with the changes. However, instead of trying to resolve their issues they complain about everyone and everything. My advice is that if you are so unhappy at NSR and you have been here for several years - go find another job."
532,Neustar,To quote John McEnroe...You Can't Be Serious!  (who is writing these reviews)?,2015-09-04,1.0,Manager,"Not many, just extremely good benefits which is why anybody would stay",Leadership isn't setting any clear direction for the company.

They realize that only fake reviews by their department is the way to re-take the message. Source? Oh I know someone in the HR department who said that the CEO is upset that there is all this negativity so they are even looking at a firm that will put out fake reviews for them on glassdoor. How pathetic. 

Why not instead of doing fake reviews, you clean up this mess? Everyone knows that Neustar is trying to position itself for a private equity purchase. That's fine, it's all part of doing business, but nothing positive is happening outside of that. In fact, does anyone really believe that the CFO or CEO have the chops to actually deliver on a sale? The only part of the business that is mildly successful is the domain name registry business and even that only marginally so. The whole notion that these acquisitions are working together to build some great data platform is nonsense. 

If you're in technology you should stay away. Yeah there are some cool challenges that would be great to help solve, but you can't do it with a fractured leadership."

Trust me no one is happy with constant fire drills.  The legacy infrastructure is horrendous.   People who push for change are marginalized by the old guard. Upper management only takes advice from the same old codgers who are responsible for this mess.  Operations has undergone serious attrition in the past few months.

More value for hierarchical claim of credit than open discussion and deserved recognition. I see new junior workers treated rudely and devalued for no reason. I think they are hired to boost lower skilled management egos, really. It is no longer a supportive collaborative environment. People use the blame game to cover their own mistakes rather than to resolve. … I was actually told while working there to work slower and not post all of my work on confluence so the lead developer did not appear to be behind, and to make her look like a better worker. It was one of the more boring jobs I've held. I'm looking forward to getting back to working with more genuine people with less corporate cover ups. … The bait and switch of others is unethical. One day someone was told told they will get help with a work visa for helping the company and dumped for no reason of performance when the time of need came. I have seen others told promises of training in front of a group of people and pulled aside within 5 minutes to be told it is not true, The new management is not trustworthy.

The amount of people that are getting ready to walk out of the door is completely out of control, and management has their blinders on. Lisa Hook (the absent CEO) is doing more damage than good right now. 

Neustar has ZERO senior leadership right now as they are all running scared and afraid of being laid off like so many of their former colleagues. It is literally the killing fields right now. Every day is a new announcement of yet another member of the team leaving.

Not pleasant. Unbearable. Everyone is focused on covering their butts. Is it any wonder that top clients are demanding 50% reductions in their contracts? Is it any wonder that sales is at less than 50% of goal with mere weeks left in the quarter?"

Neustar is a collection of companies all of whom have been purchased with the $400mm+/year the NPAC provides. The result is 30 companies within a (relatively small) company. Mix in a CEO who is trying to wedge her way into the online ad space but who lacks the ability to be a B-level sales rep in the industry. The result is she goes in the direction that the loudest bird in her ear suggests. Every couple of years there is a new direction being charted and it is increasingly being charted into waters that the executive team is unqualified to navigate. With each course correction there is a major acquisition and although the companies being acquired are increasingly smaller the egos of the executives brought aboard are increasingly large. With the NPAC going away top talent is leaving faster than low level talent can be fired (There is a lot of that too.)

It's actually a bit boring.  The offices are cube farms where people generally keep to themselves.  

Neustar's Senior Leadership appears to lack accountibility for failures to execute, and, seem reluctant to accept the risks inherent to a culture of innovation.  Failure patterns are repeated every 9-12 months as expensive consultants chart courses of action that leadership is unable or unwilling to implement.  Leaders express a desire for culture change, but, those with the greatest ability to affect change seem the least willing to embody it.  Employees see management saying one thing and doing another - and as a result - rightfully question their sincerity.   

Efforts to become more customer-centric are improving, but, are moving slowly.  This is due, among other things, to a lack of Product Management competencies within the organization, and, a disproportionate level of influence across the company within the Finance organization - a naturally conservative group that seems oblivious to the chilling effect it has on Neustar's ability to execute the vision and embrace change."

The talent is all up in Mountain View.  Mountain View is a mecca of awesomeness.  Mountain View has all the talent.  Mountain View is a religion.  The good people are in Mountain View.  And so on.  

Unfortunately, said CTO didn't quite calculate the costs of housing in Mountain View.  Or the number of Mountain View companies competing for the same talent.  Or the salaries needed to attract the talent.  And most of all, he failed to realize Neustar is a minor player, a coffee stain on a road map to greatness.  It's a third-tier community college of tech.

Neustar's business plan sucked before the relocation.  It amounted to acquiring cheap start up technology and hoping for a winner.  The state lottery works the same way.  But after the the reborn Mountain View pilgram crap, the lotto bumped in price from $1 to $10 per ticket.

Neustar's real achievements are almost 20 years old now.  Little can be noted about the past 10 years.  Innovation within the company is long gone.  Luckily, it really did well in those early years, built up a core.  That's the only reason it's still around."

The marketing department is extremely lackluster and has no idea how SEO works.
Human Resources was completely disconnected from reality so we often outsourced staffing to 3rd party staffing agencies.
The engineering team would build features and products before doing any market research and without a revenue model.

For months, the CTO was telling us our office would be merged into another much larger office in San Diego but then, out of the blue, he decided to ""relocate"" us to Mountain View instead. Verbally, Neustar told us we could all keep our positions if we moved to Mountain View but the truth was most of us received simple termination notices with no mention of an option to move. Several engineers were hired only a few days before the announcement and one guy even closed on his mortgage the day of the announcement.

Two months later, the CEO decided to ""relocate"" the Mountain View office to downtown San Francisco.

And after years of encouraging employees to work from home, upper management decided to forbid remote work shortly after Yahoo declared it would do so.

Employees were sometimes hired and ""let go"" with little to no notice (i.e. 2 days notice). Many engineering positions were outsourced to India. Engineering meetings often consisted of one engineer and 6 managers (not an exaggeration).

Ineffective leadership - There are managers and directors that have no business being in those positions. Most display a lack of knowledge and a lack of interpersonal and overall leadership skills. Management disarm employees--while sucking the creativity and innovativeness from the environment--making final, half-baked, decisions that almost always result in the wasteful expenditure of company funds.

Most employees in the IT division are over worked and exhausted because management has not back filled the positions left open by departing employees. The message is that there is no intention to offer relief by hiring and that everyone should fully expect to do even more than the 60 hour work weeks we were expected to perform. Employees are over worked and under appreciated.

Management is unimaginative trying to copy other companies like Google in failed attempts at appearing to be progressive. The problem here is that this is testament to how out of touch management is with the office culture, and how ineffective and unimaginative they are. They try to assimilate ideas from other office cultures rather than trying to focus on the culture unique to the company.

Management displays no confidence within their own employees. Many opportunities are routinely taken away from the employees. They turn a blind eye to the fact that the talent and skills exists right under their very nose yet will go out and spend millions outside instead of keeping things in house . Or they completely misappropriate assignments that many employees would be delighted to take on. For example, the AV (audio/visual) system in the auditorium is not built or setup properly and always experiencing technical glitches. There were employees (IT) that volunteered their talents to help plan, design, and maintain the system. Instead, they were shunned and the design decision was left into the hands of two managers--that knew nothing about AV--and an outside contractor. The result was a shabby, glitch filled, AV system, that's ineffective and plagued with technical glitches. This actually plays back into the politics because the two managers saw this as an opportunity to earn brownie points for themselves.

In all honesty, management very rarely consults with their employees on many major decisions. And these employees are supposed to be ""experts"" in their respective fields. If that doesn't say it all I don't know what does.

 
Wasteful - Without doubt this company wastes an immense amount of money on bad acquisitions, products, and internal expenditures. It is common practice to spend millions on contractors, software, hardware, and building upgrades that are unnecessary.  The root of the problem exists within mid management making decisions in areas they are not qualified to and simply do not understand. 

Much of this is due to egoism of the management where the daily mantra is that they know everything, never make mistakes, while their employees know nothing and are treated no better than mindless drones.

Lack of advancement opportunities - Almost zero advancement opportunities in all areas because the company almost always hire from outside instead of within. Those that do advance within are typically members of the 'good ole boy' club. The truly skilled and knowledgeable employees that work 60+ hours a week are hardly considered for advancement. Lateral moves are common, however. For a company its size there is too high of a turnover rate in some common positions. Probably due in part to lack of advancement opportunities.

Flawed review process - Neustar has a review process where a certain percentage of employees must fall within a particular performance range on paper. This is solely due to financial reasons. Even if you're an employee that works 60+ hours a week, always on call, and always going above and beyond they usually fall into the ""Average"" bracket. For example only 5 employees in the whole company can receive the highest mark, 10 employees can receive the second highest mark, 620 employees will receive the average mark, 5 below average, and 50 failing marks. 

The rule is that if someone makes an above average grade that someone else, regardless of their work ethic, must receive a failing grade. The above average employee receives a little extra money in their annual bonus, whereas the below average employee loses money in their annual bonus. This is intentional so that the payout during bonus time is always net zero.

They do come up with clever justifications as to why someone that was always a stellar employee all of the sudden gets a failing review one year. But the real reason is because someone was graded above average and the company needed someone else to take a reduction in payout to balance it all out."

4. Nice offices","1. Low standards of professionalism. No one can write their way out of a paper bag; employees accept meeting requests and rarely show up or show up ill-prepared and speak to nothing; Responses to questions are in the form of a forwarded email that usually never addresses the question.  An typical example of an exchange:  Question: ""Is there roof leaking?"" Answer: ""Please see forwarded email regarding weather last week.""  Not only is the question not answered, the response may not even be relevant to the issue at hand.  This is commonplace and  employees are left to fend for themselves on questions.  It's frustrating.

2. A constant desire to be like ""Google""  (i.e. irreverent. cool place to work with ping pong tables or Wii's), despite the fact that employee base is neither supportive nor receptive.  Example:  Beach balls were left on employee desks this summer, after three solid week of Budget Cuts and RIFs.  Employees questioned how/why there was $$ to buy employee gifts, hold department happy hours or bring in authors to speak about new books, but their friend in the cube next to them couldn't stay on payroll.  Most would rather focus on making the company profitable than playing games all day.  Reminds one of the end of AOL.  Distraction techniques?

3.  Too few products that meet customer needs - largely driven by what product teams want to work on, without any clear road map or market research.  Product Life cycle Process is being revamped - and hopefully will take this into account.  But currently most products are presented to PLC (product life cycle) team without any background information or research into the market segment or audience research.  Very hard difficult to market to  customers that don't want or need the product.

5. CEO who takes job entirely too casually, in effort to be seen as approachable. Nice to have, but company clearly needs firm leadership.  Very self-deprecating in interactions with employees.  It's appreciated - but it happens constantly, and erodes confidence in leadership abilities."
