Benefits are good: including PTO, 401(k), medical, dental, vision, and multiple other resources to address an employee's needs.
Good leadership: despite many changes in the C-Suite, getting strong results and taking the best employees on the journey was consistently communicated.
Serving customers is one of the top priorities and efforts to provide the best tools and people to do so were put in place or planned.","Post acquisition by the private equity firm there were many rounds of layoffs.

Some of the very best in the industry work here so you can learn from each other and improve your skillset. The people here are absolutely excellent. We also have affinity groups so underrepresented people feel like they have a place to go and people to listen.,"The salary is not at all competitive and is below market value. I could make no less than $20,000 more doing the exact same thing at another company with much better benefits and who keeps up with employee needs. There is little opportunity to advance in your career unless you know the right people in C-suite. C-suite is making a killing while other employees can hardly afford all their monthly bills. They have affinity groups, but they are just for show. They are not utilizing them to improve company culture. In fact, the affinity groups are constantly undermined, oppressed, and silenced under the guise of needing to communicate company updates. If you want a raise, fringe benefits, flexibility, decent medical benefits, equality, and the ability to grow, this is definitely not the company for you."

77,Newfold Digital,A company obsessed with mediocrity,2021-11-17,1.0,Copywriter III,Great coworkers - until they're outsourced.,"Pay - Even after several attempts at restructuring the pay schemes across the business, we were severely undervalued in the market. How much? When I left, my new job had the same title at nearly twice the rate.

Work - You might think low pay, low expectations. You'd be wrong. In specialist level roles, you're expected to work out of a neverending queue, with your productivity assessed based on a juvenile points-per-ticket system that leaves very little room for error. Individual managers could be understanding about odd tickets or things that were clearly out of scope, but you were always at the mercy of someone else understanding that the system was broken - and never encouraged to fix it.

On top of that, there are absurd expectations for getting even the most marginal incentives. In my position, there was a monthly bonus for maintaining high quality scores. To receive it, you had to AVERAGE 98.5/100. And the people doing the scoring were outsourced, so they didn't even speak English as a first language. If the editors made a mistake, you had to hope that you saw it, could convince your manager that it mattered, and then could win out in a lengthy arbitration process between managers wherein you had no say or transparency.

Culture - Newfold is a private equity Frankenstein, the result of near-seasonal mergers and executive changes. It can be a challenge to know who has the authority to do what, and there are entire layers of management who don't understand the jobs they manage and exist solely to track spreadsheets and insulate their bosses from the rank and file.

Add to that the constantly shifting workforce, with experienced professionals being fired en masse to make way for smaller teams of contracted overseas replacements. The contractors were great people who did fine work, but that only made me feel worse about what I knew they were getting paid.

Impact - To hear them tell it, Newfold is all about creating a ""customer-first"" experience. The reality, though, is that the company operates on a nested hierarchy of least common denominators. They want to pay as little as possible for the least viable product while providing the least customer support, most transparent excuses, and least fair prices of any scaled competitor. In the end, it leaves you either disgusted at raising the profile of customers whose unethical products are rejected elsewhere or sorry for the customers who aren't digitally savvy enough to know better. And there's always another ticket coming."
78,Newfold Digital,Out-of-touch managers & abusive marketing schemes,2021-11-17,1.0,Senior User Experience/UI Designer,"We used to have good pay, loads of time off, and plenty of leverage. No more. They'll fire you on the spot, or work you to death.","Before we were acquired by NewFold, and there's even case for Endurance, this company thrived. We had a vibrant workforce, many talented individuals who were interested in making the web space a better place, then the corps took over and streamlined everything. They laid off half the folks around me, and expected the same workload, all after cutting benefits."

114,Newfold Digital,RUN,2021-09-30,1.0,Web Advisor I,Once New Fold Digital bought Endurance International Group the company went down hill. So there are no Pro's other than it's a pro not to be associated with the company any longer.,"The company is poorly run. New Fold Digital (Formerly Endurance International Group) has closed many state side run departments and moved them overseas to the Philippines. It was stated by Sharon Rowlands, CEO and President, that their goal is to make money and sending our jobs overseas is the best way to do that. As such hundreds of people have lost their jobs, at a time when things are already difficult. This is not a company with scruples and certainly not one that values it's customers or it's employees. Only it's bottom line. Pay raises were withheld in April and to be paid retroactively in July, but only if you still worked there. Many people lost out on hundreds of dollars because of how this was done."

[There may be many more pros, but at the moment could think of only these immediate ones...might update this review over time!!]

Note: Employees who work sincerely & put in their best efforts, will definitely be rewarded...sooner or later!!

========================================================
Answers to some of the negative reviews given by former/current employees:
1. Some people demand that they must be rewarded or recognised on a rotational basis, rather than based on their efforts, talent & instead of going the extra mile.
2. They wish to stay aloof from team activities, neither participating in self growth nor team growth, despite repetitive guidance from management and leads -> Always remember: ""Actions speak better than words""
3. Some believe that the management is biased, or certain people who are well qualified & have specific certifications receive praises may be because they present themselves better. But the question here is, are you jealous or don't you have what it takes to get there? So you pull others down to your level??
4. With the recent merger, things may have digressed a bit but with the trust shown by our management & the way things seem to settle, I can only see the brighter things coming ahead. 
(This is where trust & vision play an important role)","Everything in this world has its set of pros & cons. Similarly, there are a very few that I'd wish to highlight. Although, I'm very sure, they would most probably already being worked upon by the org:

1. Rewards & recognitions need to increase, not necessarily in terms of monetary rewards. (Eg. internal team recognitions, release parties, brand anniversaries, etc.) -> this motivates employees to continue putting their whole heart & soul at work
2. Virtual off-sites at the moment must be there every quarter, especially during these times of pandemic. Else, would prefer on-site visits if possible (trips within country or abroad) at least once a year!!
3. Team-bonding or other relevant team activities, at least once a month"

147,Newfold Digital,"A leg into general tech, not long-term",2021-08-14,2.0,WordPress Live,"Hard to put a real perspective on this very new company, used to be Endurance Intl. but was purchased by an investment firm. I've been working with this company since late 2016 and gained a lot of experience in with websites and marketing. Steady pay with insurance benefits. Free food on select days in the office (stopped during 2020 while working from home, maybe indefinitely) as the work is currently remote and will hopefully continue to be mostly remote for health and sustainability.","Once-yearly merit raises only. Been with the company since before the name change, the focus on new branding has been an uncomfortable shift as we see lots of ""farewell"" emails. This work is very ill-defined, without (seemingly) any collaboration between departments. Leadership and ""coaches"" do little to support the team, they have been struggling to communicate at all in a WFH environment and haven't made any changes to improve since before quarantine started. Main tech support roles are being entirely outsourced, and training departments were fired months ago.

NO RAISES. i had to dance around the truth to customers to protect the company about payment and fulfillment cycles (fulfilled monthly, pay every 4 weeks). i won't slander the company but i had to do a lot that chipped at my integrity. 

i'm bitter. i was a great employee, my co-workers respected me, i was good with customers, managers liked showing me off, but they cut my bonus my last year for not getting work done on time, even though they increased my workload. they never audited task completion anyway, because if they had they'd see that EVERYONE LIED ABOUT TASK COMPLETION. it wasn't hard to check, but it was easy to lie about. if i had lied about my task completion like everyone else i would've maxed my paltry $1000 bonus."

Remainder of leadership team are order takers and do not appear to like working with each other. Talented thinkers who like to act with an owner/operator mindset will be dissatisfied working here. 
Web.com overran Endurance during acquisition in Feb '21. Owned by private equity so the focus is on short term thinking and grooming of the financials for resale. Employee moral is extremely poor. They will have to cut 2/3 of the people between now and 2023, offshore major portions of the company and replace critical functions with contractors whose cost falls below the line to make their targets."

Training was good and welcoming, although felt like I was unprepared for the workplace the moment I started dealing with customers. 

Once I hit the floor was when my experience at Web.com plummeted. The Sales Leadership that they have in office constantly talked down to, and belittled their employees. They would verbally harass you in front of other employees for not hitting sales targets, and then walk around with their chests puffed out as if they were the CEO of the company. 

 I am not sure how the senior leadership is so disconnected in what goes on in the office, as they were never available - but from what I understood, excuses were constantly made for their behavior whenever a complaint was lodged. The team leaders that I had experience with were also extremely misogynistic, and would specifically seem to focus on harassing the female employees

 It becomes apparent shortly after working here for any length of time that they would rather force you to quit if you are not making targets, as oppose to working with you to improve your skillset."

229,Newfold Digital,Great Job - Pretty Good Company,2021-03-19,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Relaxed rules and management attitude (doesn't feel ""corporate"")
- Work from home
- Tuition Reimbursement after 1 year
- Pretty good benefits overall

Working from home with this position is amazing. I feel really lucky to have this job. Going to work doesn't feel like a trial. With that being said, I don't know much about the company other than what's given in press releases and praising emails.

For a fairly small company, the benefits are good. I left a major corporation to come to Endurance and got basically the same benefits package (the medical choices weren't as good, but most places couldn't compete with my last company).","- Not the best training
- No one knows what's going on (keep your head down, do your job)
- Not the greatest pay
- Rigid work structure (treats you like a children on the job)
- No overtime

So with every job that's ""fun"" you're trading a bit of your freedom. This feels like a summer job that gives a great introduction to things I've never done before (programs, technical skills, etc), but wouldn't been a good long-term fit. There is a constant (and I mean constant) ""checking-in"" that needs to take place as a work-from-home employee that makes you almost wish you weren't working-from-home. This checking in is then checked to make sure it ""checks out"". Every minute must be accounted for in between doing the daily tasks of the day, which is a task within itself.

My manager is great. I mean really good, but I have a feeling if I had any other manager, I would be lost. It seems like there's good opportunity for advancement, but it may place me back at working in an office and I may not get a manager as on top of there P's & Q's as my current one."

244,Newfold Digital,Great Experience and Career Growth,2021-01-20,5.0,Program Manager,"I've been an employee of Web.com for nearly 7 years. I started out as an agent and worked my way through the management chain before becoming a Program Manager for the business. Web afforded me the opportunity to learn more about corporate life as well as various aspects of the business that I now apply to my current role. 

The benefits offered to employees has improved over time as well as salary in comparison to the market. The business has also made safety a priority and is offering WFH solutions that have been critical and appreciated. We've seen a lot of change in the past few years, a lot of it good. 

The people are always the best part, as I've made a lot of great and long-term connections at Web.","Web has been acquired (and is undergoing another cycle now), meaning that there has been a lot of change to the business and its goals.

Pay is competitive for where I'm at in my career and my location. There is a mixture of vastly different projects to work on, which allows me to hone a whole lot of different skills. The people I work with are great. Motivated, smart. 

Leadership is strong and realistic. When our CEO took over she was frank about where we were business-wise, and I appreciate the honesty. I want to hear the truth, without a sugary coating. The business has a clear direction and focus and everything is driving towards that.

Leadership handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and Work From Home has been exemplary. Can't say it enough.","Change is the only constant. If you thrive in a dynamic situation, you'll be fine. If you're not ready for the ground to shift under your feet regularly, it can be overwhelming. 

The path to advance hasn't always been clear, but I do think that's improving. 

The company is transitioning cultural identities. That's hard to do in the middle of a pandemic with almost everyone working remotely. Can see where onboarding might be tough at the moment."
