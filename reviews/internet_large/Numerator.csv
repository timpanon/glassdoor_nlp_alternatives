Private equity ownership is incredibly cheap, and not in a good way, they refuse to spend any money on the things necessary for business continuity. Takes months/years to get basic expenditures approved.

2. Upper leadership does not care at all about their employees, it seems they are solely focused on preparing to sell the company and cashing out. They are actively shipping all of our jobs to India.

3. The departments are incredibly siloed and horde knowledge as a means of job security.

4. No one really knows what is going on, the tech stack is a complete and utter disaster... the right hand has no idea what the left hand is doing.

5. Some departments are considered ""higher and more important"" than others to the point that some departments get away with doing absolutely nothing (HR for example always has an excuse why they need some other department to take on their clearly delineated job responsibilities, and everyone is afraid to say something).

6. Ambitious middle management uses their employees as a tool for their personal upwards mobility with no consideration for them whatsoever. They will pile on additional work and responsibilities so they can earn brownie points with the upper management. 

7. Middle management is also extremely averse to any sort of negativity or criticism which creates an environment of fear and dishonesty... no one has the guts to say what they truly feel because they know there will be consequences for speaking up.

8. Blame AND responsibility rolls down hill.

9. Even if you beg for additional training you will never get it.

10. Most employees, especially those in the ""golden departments"" are rude, mean, and condescending but will treat you like a problem if you give them a taste of their own medicine.

This isn't even a comprehensive list... the rot in this company goes incredibly deep and exists at all levels. If you are considering working here, I suggest reconsidering."

Principles of operation include being tech-forward with an unrelenting bias towards delivering incremental client value. 

Plenty of opportunity for individual growth and development with an extremely supportive management team.","Company culture has room to improve. Numerator was born from a few different organizations with very different cultures and the new entity has yet to find a unified voice and identity.

The company wants to think of itself as a young startup but often operates like a more mature company in terms of its processes and values. This can at times curb innovation and the bias for speed."

250,Numerator,Smart. Interesting. Challenging (in a good way).,2020-07-22,5.0,Product,"Numerator is a dynamic place to work where you’ll be challenged by and learn from your coworkers everyday. If you have that spirit you’ll fit right in and be a part of a company that is challenging the status quo of the market research industry that has largely done things the same way for decades. This is paying off in these challenging times as more and more companies are turning to Numerator for answers to help them survive. 

The company has put forth a lot of effort to make the company fun and give back in a meaningful way with volunteer days and team activities. This has has to shift a bit but the leadership team is looking out for employees with “quiet days” to allow employees to do deep thinking that hectic calendars don’t allow and “recharge days” to take time off when work and personal time are becoming more blurred than ever.","Legacy companies coming together can sometimes still have a drag on productivity and create silos. This is much improved though. We have extremely intelligent employees but an increase in humility would allow for us to get out of “old way of thinking” ruts faster.

Virtually stress-free compared to other jobs I’ve had. The level of friendship and comaraderie I’ve experienced here is unrivalled to any other organisation I know. I am encouraged to “be myself” on a daily basis and am my opinion is often considered and valued. From my very first week working here I’ve been getting asked “what do you think we should do?” and that truly feels great. I am also always being encouraged to take as many days off as I need in order to ensure positive mental health during this COVID era. I haven’t felt the need to take many yet, but I have never before seen this degree of compassion at any former job.","To be perfectly honest, me and my team don’t get paid very much in relation to other salaries we’ve had in our careers, and I believe this has been made well-known and addressed during surveys. This only con is, however, reciprocated by the fact that our career paths at Numerator are made very clear to us and that we are given total understanding of what we can do in our power to advance. I have full faith that my diligent work does not go unnoticed because this is re-communicated with me frequently. Naturally, there has to be at least one con with almost any review, and this is the only one I can think of. Everything else really exceeds expectations."

Management is always worried about their targets, deadlines and revenue. Do not ask them to change your position or status. They will make 100's of excuses and even change company's policies before the year completion. They only favour for thier references even if you are qualified and deserving enough, they will hire that undeserving candidates. They are just using big names to attract workforce therefore to get more business. For getting into good positions at Numerator, you just have to be a relative or a friend of the current numerator employee and for surviving , you just have to do flattery.

262,Numerator,This Star is Rising,2020-05-08,5.0,Leader,"The biggest pro is being part of the “it” company that is disrupting a sleepy industry. At one time, I thought this was more about our white hot consumer insights panel but I have come to appreciate the rich data in our ad, promotions and pricing intelligence products. As one of our execs put it, “if data is the new oil, we are wildcatters” going to unknown places. Another big pro is the people – so smart and passionate whether it’s our engineering and data science teams, consultants, or really anyone. 

It is environment where I feel inspired (and a bit pushed but in a good way) to do more, do better. Most of us work even harder because we don’t want to let each other down, meaning it’s a good team feeling. 

I am pro the new CEO and the changes he has made. When I arrived, this company felt bifurcated. That seems like a distant memory today – and I give our CEO the credit for that. He is a cultural change agent. That is hard for some to accept but I think it’s been fantastic (and our reputation in the industry – and sales for that matter – seem to say the same). 

Last pro: the company is cool to work at – and not because it has a keg or free snacks but because the work is exciting and meaningful, there is all sorts of opportunity, it’s a powerful team, and we are changing a huge industry. When we're at trade shows, our sessions are standing room only and our clients are proud to be the early adopters who are leaders in the industry.","Three cons – one org, one product, one external. Internal first. Until recently, I would have said senior management is a bit old fashioned in wanting people to be in the office more than working from home. I don’t think that will be an issue any more. They have been so supportive about our transition to work from home and it feels like we are getting more done than ever. There is a very constructive spirit about this.

I mentioned the white hot panel. Our other products are older. We need to contemporize them. I do see movement in the company. Our product leadership has assigned stars to lead these path products, raising their profile internally which was needed. We are investing. And, it feels like even marketing is paying more attention to these products tnow. 

Last con is a market dynamic. Our consumer insight panel is very well thought of. It is frustrating that the “big dog” competitor in the space has other products they sell to the same buyers. They keep bundling the products to mask the price. I think they know they can’t compete on data quality so they obfuscate."
263,Numerator,Awesome place to work,2020-05-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The work is exciting, even more so with what we have been able to do during COVID. The people are always willing to help each other. The transperancy of the organization is fantastic and refreshing. They are listening and supporting employees during COVID and sharing the rationale behind tough decisions. I appreciate the open communication style.","We are going through growing pains, we have really bonded and added clarity to get where we are today, but will will continue to have to change rapidly for the new normal and for the true growth potential we have. I know change is hard for some, we have some employees with over 25 yrs experience with the company. We must embrace change, challenge our approach and drive innovation."

The acquired company (InfoScout) was catered to, literally and figuratively. There was a point where InfoScout employees were given free lunches while legacy employees did not receive that same perk. This happened in the same office in front of everybody and there was an uncomfortable tension. Management seemed to just generally prefer the business model and practices of InfoScout and that was pretty transparent in their favoritism. I understand this from a business perspective, you follow the new opportunity in front of you. But some of the glaring inequalities made for a bad work environment for us legacy employees.  

If you are thinking about working here, I fully acknowledge the chance that conditions may have improved. I can only report my experience. In fairness, the period I'm referring to felt like an especially rocky time in the company's history. I genuinely hope some of these issues got sorted out since my departure."

- Engineers are encouraged and in many cases required to experiment with new technologies.
- If you are looking to learn something new, there's usually an in house expert who's more than happy to help out.
- Kind and empathetic managers and team leads who genuinely respect and value work life balance","- Changing and inconsistent product vision sometimes leads to postponed or delayed dev cycles.
- Office cultures are very different, but this is likely due to non-engineering company politics

283,Numerator,Great Fast Growing and Winning Company Where Your Voice is Heard,2019-12-04,5.0,Sales Director,"Numerator is made up of some of the most intelligent people I have ever been exposed to. The entire company has a winning culture, from Product to Ops to the Commercial Team, and it's extremely fun to be a part of. The new Senior Leadership in place is seriously TOP NOTCH and the listen to anyone and everyone in the org. Numerator is completely disrupting the market research space, especially within the consumer panel side of the business. One thing I really love about the culture is that everyone is willing to help you at all times - I've truly never seen so many people leap to help when they have so much on their plate. Another requirement of mine when I was looking for a new role was flexible working hours and a great work/life balance - the attitude here is that they trust you AS AN ADULT to get your job done. They know and recognize people have families and social lives... This trust really creates and energy where we want to  over-achieve v. other companies where you are chained to a desk until 5 PM on a Friday simply because it's mandated. I saw the review a few lines below and can assure anyone looking into Numerator that this old-school sentiment of forced work hours simply because is not the way this company operates- they really do trust their employees to get the job done and get the job done right. What I would say to the review below is ""It's not 1960...Welcome to 2020!!!!!!!!""","This isn't necessarily a con... but with any growing company, there will be change. If you're uncomfortable with that, then a fast growing, disruptive company probably isn't for you. What I will say is that over the 2 years I have been here, the change has always been for the better and our senior leadership has never given me any reason to distrust them."
284,Numerator,Collaborative work environment; Competitive product offering; Growing pains of mid-size SaaS company,2019-12-03,5.0,Solutions Consultant,"Collaborative - Slack is heavily used at Numerator.

If you need help, just ask in the appropriate channels and 99% of time, someone will help you out or direct you to the right person. No one feels shamed about not knowing something.

Powerful Product Suite + Strong Buying Centers + Low/Zero Implementation Effort - Numerator's solutions, individually or collectively, have unique competitive advantages over the competition. The target audience (marketing, consumer insights, shopper insights, research, category management, etc) often has an abundance of budget to purchase the solution. In addition, almost all of Numerator's solutions are web-based plug n' play tools or quick ad-hoc consulting projects that requires no effort for client IT teams.

293,Numerator,"So much good, and so much great - very excited to see how the future unfolds!",2019-11-04,5.0,Anonymous,"PEOPLE: 
Folks are intelligent, helpful, kind, and interesting. You can always find someone who can help you with something - that kind of culture can't be taught, and I am so very grateful to be in a place where I am surrounded by this reality. 

EXPOSURE: 
Is there something going on in the company that you'd like to get more involved with? Find the right person, and more likely than not, they will be more than happy to find a way to get you involved. The company isn't so small that every person is wearing ten hats, but it also isn't so big that every employee is a number. I have a personal relationship with every member of the C-Suite, and quite a few folks (who put forth the effort) do, as well. My career has mostly been filled by very big companies - if you told me while I worked at either that it wouldn't be out of reach to get lunch or dinner 1:1 with anyone at my next job, I wouldn't have believed you. But it's true! I'm referencing the C Suite to make the most extreme point, but the point rings true across the board. Every single person I've met has been very welcoming and generally willing to connect and understand everyone they work with. It's a nice environment! 

OPPORTUNITIES: 
There are lots of people who've taken on different roles over time at this company. It's amazing to work somewhere where it isn't all that awkward to talk to your manager about your career - even if it means transitioning into a role in a different part of the company. This isn't something I've experienced before, and I am enjoying the trusting  and non-judgmental openness.","I don't know if we as a company are totally sure what or who we are yet. We play in so many spaces, and I look forward to seeing  how the future unfolds as we refine our purview over time. 

""Change is the only constant"" (this is not something leadership says) is a flashy way to promote excitement, but it is not without fault when translated to the tactical day-to-day.  We are not a small enough company where each individual has the requisite autonomy to shine a light through the fog of ambiguity to guide the boat toward shore. I'd welcome a little more consistency with open arms."

Unlimited PTO is nice.","Benefits are average. I'd like to see a few new perks that could help us attract candidates. There are still growing pains as we integrate products & teams, but I expect that to gradually decrease over time. 

Reading through other reviews, I can confirm that some of the negative ones were certainly true at the time - 2018 was definitely a rough patch with the merger & rebrand. I'll be happy if I never go through another Vista BOSS process again. But in 2019 things have started to turn. We're ramping up departments, have some new leadership in place (all of which have seemed like good moves IMO), innovative products in the pipeline - all things that seem to position us for another big wave of growth in 2020."

Take the low-star reviews from Data Associates with a grain of salt. It is an entry-level role and can be a grind. However, many ambitious DAs have used the role as a jumping off point to get promoted to more technical analyst/engineering roles.  If you're curious and understand you're getting experience with machine learning and data, you can leverage this opportunity.

Also pay attention to where the review are from, some of overseas locations have a different environment than the US. Lot of folks in Chicago & NY & SF love their colleagues and environment and jobs, and this is what is growing more within the organization.","The merger has growing pains of combining two different company cultures, but people and execs are advocating for what's best.

 -Very ""Big Brother"" with focus on daily activities for sales- quantity over quality.  Activity reports are pulled by managers and used as sticks in 1:1 meetings. Dialogue focuses around this activity vs. having meaningful strategic sales conversations. 
-The SalesForce process is the most inefficient I've seen. It can take several weeks to get approvals for pricing quotes and client ready SOWs. 
-The account list assigned to you when you join will make or break your success here. If you are not assigned larger CPG accounts, think twice about a sales role (as the company's primary focus and investment is in CPG, and there is little opportunity with anything else to hit target.)
- When interviewing, make sure to ask how many legacy InfoScout Sales Directors made their targets in 2018. (You can count on one hand). 
-I've seen talented Sales Directors fired with no warning or notice when not at target.   
-Favoritism is definitely an issue at this company- with so many Sales Directors not at target, who stays and who goes?  Sales Directors are always on edge, making us wonder, ""who is next""? 
-The new commission structure is set up to penalize vs. incentivize , so make sure to ask about the plan in DETAIL during the interview process.

Hopefully still the case as a combined company with MarketTrack but remains to be seen. Also a really exciting and interesting industry to be a part of, so you are learning skills that at least transfer well to other roles/companies in the future. The company has many promising directions to go in, but I'm not confident in the execution.","The benefits are abysmal - almost $800 out of pocket monthly just for health benefits for self and a dependent. (Which, BTW, we were promised there would be fantastic improvements on this in 2019 by HR - not remotely the case). It's not OK to force employees to a high deductible plan and then justify by saying it costs as much as the more desired plan... which is almost a THOUSAND dollars per month. Don't know anyone who has such awful health benefits options at their employer - and I have been on multiple interviews where candidates have been aware of our benefits and turned down an offer solely because of this. 401k matching is horrendous as well - it's pennies matched to the dollar and again has deterred great candidates from joining the team."

334,Numerator,It's an Exciting Time to Work at Numerator,2018-11-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's an exciting time to work at Numerator.  We have the stability of a larger company, but we are growing so quickly and the products and market opportunity have so much potential, that it feels like we are working here at just the right time to really make an impact.  No day at work is ever the same.  We are constantly solving for new challenges, and we are investing significantly in the business.  Our sales team doubled in size this year!

I, personally, like the variability in my day-to-day tasks and the continuous improvement of the systems and processes.  It may not be the right environment for someone who does not like change or who prefers to get in and leave at the same time every day knowing exactly what you're going to do.  If you want to be pushed and challenged and work at a company where you have a voice and where the leadership team is truly interested in what you have to say as we grow rapidly in the coming years, I would highly recommend Numerator.","Numerator is still finding its identity after merging multiple companies over the past couple of years.  Right now there are still a lot of silos, and different offices and teams receive different ""perks"".  I know management is proactively working towards providing a more consistent experience across the teams and offices.  

Although the legacy Market Track company has been around for over 25 years, Numerator is truly a new company, and we are still building out things that more established companies would probably have (e.g., structured training programs, consistent policies, regular events, etc.).  The good news is these are all currently focus areas for the team, so I know they will exist in the near future."

I have never felt so excited to come into an office every day because the culture here is like nothing I've ever seen.  We have great managers who care about their people, we make time to have fun, and I know my efforts will have a positive impact on our employees - the future for Numerator looks bright.","Growing pains similar to any company, but most functions are in an advantageous position to create the foundation for the future through designing processes, play books, training, etc.

I was originally part of InfoScout before the merger and started as a DA and transitioned into engineering team. My personal opinion for those of you who are interested in entry level roles, I can tell you that the leadership does its best to help you with your career goals and transitioning if you work hard and have a genuine interest in a career path. There should still be a need for the role that you want to transition into, you have to build your skillset and wait for the right time. This is a business after all, you are expected to do the work you are hired for first.",Merger brought some uncertainty and many changes but everything seems to be going smoothly so far
337,Numerator,Sales Review with Clarification on Negative Reviews Below,2018-11-14,5.0,Sales,"I've been working for Numerator for almost 1 year now, originally joined under the InfoScout umbrella.  Came from a company where autonomy was non-existent and here I feel so empowered. Constant support from both the Sales, Services, Marketing and Product/Engineer team AT ALL TIMES. Though we're growing, I truly feel valued here. 

ON DA ROLE: The reviews below are disappointing. The Data Associate role is an entry-level role, nonetheless extremely important to our business. I love the DAs I've met! Those posting below, in my opinion, sound like they did 0 research on a role they were applying to beforehand. Probably a good idea to have a firm understanding of the day-to-day, compensation, and job security before you accept an offer... if you didn't know what you were signing up for, that's on you.","Yes, the merge with Market Track has brought growing pains and perks of a smaller company are now gone.

There is a very obvious push to ensure there is a great culture, improved benefits and fun work environment. There are some growing pains, but it's wonderful to see that upper management is working hard to make this a great place to work!","We were formerly Market Track + InfoScout and it's taking some time to iron out the kinks and growing pains of this merger now that we are Numerator, which is to be expected. We are growing at a rapid rate and can't hire fast enough, so there are some long hours involved, but it's rewarding."
