They manage multiple teams... but most of what they do is stick to their script's trying not to ask to many implementation questions so they can keep a keep a straight face as to not brake the ""fake it till you make it"" trend.
I wastes a few months of my life at OLX and i regret every moment.
Some of the team members were cool, but the monolith php tech stack and daily need to talk with different teams just for a MR that would sometime take 1 - 2 days to get solved, and the final nail in the coffin was the conversation i had with a manager about a pay raise once they make me a senior dev, and the amount was a joke.

- Some management really tries to make things great
- Great Offices and good upkeep of the staff, logistical, material and utilities
- Took excellent care of people in the first year of the pandemic which showed a change of pace
- Career plan is Okayish* with some progressions depending on what department you're in.
- A lot of cool swag (check the posts in OLX, you'll understand)
- Hybrid Model of working (although its not 100% remote if you want to - keep that in mind)
- The new CEO might change a lot of the cons if he has the will and actually sees through a lot of the upper\mid management sucking up. And honestly, this is happening so fingers crossed on this. 
- All hands every month or so to keep you updated.","- Career paths usually are just placeholders, you can have roles that are no integrated there
- If you're with questions on the next step of your career and how to progress - this is not the place to go
- Numbers and visibility count more than projects, timing is everything in this company, and you'll see difficulty showing this if you join at the wrong time. 
- Cutthroat environment, if you don't make a lot of numbers you'll just be one in the middle with no expectations
- A lot of swag is making people ignore the real issues at stake (eg. a lot of world mental health swag but in the end, you're still expected to work a lot and have a lot of struggles down the road 
- There is no work\life balance, even though you won't be expected to do long hours, you'll fall behind and start seeing your role diminish over time. Managers will say to take breaks and take a day off, but this will put you in harm's way.
- HR is slow to evolve and adapt to the new realities. It's an old-school admin in this area which brings positives but also a lot of negatives to the new reality
- High turnover even though the numbers don't seem to express that.
- Management sometimes comes out as movie\rock stars, where they travel to places to no end, and with covid locking down this is extremely visible. Having lavish dinners with pretexts of ""improvements"" and ""gathering the teams"" while the operational people are stuck for a lot of the time doesn't translate as well as you think.
- Some teams lack the possibility of giving honest feedback to who they're reporting to and also lack honest feedback. Some people just are great for management, awful for people management even though they can say its great to see growth.
- Its an ""un-global"" company, teams and areas are silo'ed, tech hubs are kept with comms at a minimum and nothing is promoted in that area."

The development is really slow, the meetings are way too much, they discuss so much and do so little.
Their new vision is to add automation everywhere meaning a SDE now has to do automation work, hardly enticing is it?

The chapter task thing they have is a joke, a lot of useless things from which hardly anything comes out to be fruitful. 

There is a huge pay disparity, you could be working at literally half the CTC than your team member who might be dumber than you are.

The salary correction is just a thing that flies around, better not to have it, if the salary correction is going to be that low.

Now their new vision to autos, which means that the new services will have less than 3 digit RPMs, so the scaling is lost, do you really want to work at a place and boast your services' RPM is 100? Who would like this scale?

This is a massively PM side driven company who are hell bent on getting some product goals met, they are okay ignoring all the technical side of things unless everything breaks. The OKR thing is a joke, so much dependency work and you're asked to estimate, how can you estimate a dependency is something I'll never get.

Good for a stepping stone, you will eventually get bored of the never ending zoom meetings and want to leave.

I will tell you the attrition rate is sky high, apart from maybe 1-2 people that I were friends with, everyone else I know has moved on. I'll be moving on too."

Company-funded learning opportunities through online platforms, such as Udacity, Udemy. Some really talented and passionate colleagues - ""some"" being the operational word. Support during the corona-times (lending office chairs & screens, free merch)","Absolutely chaotic. Reorgs every quarter, driven by the lack of vision and direction; every year there is a complete overhaul of the vision and direction, with significant changes every quarter, which means projects that take time rarely get finished. This may be due to some extremely inexperienced and bad hires at the higher levels. 
Higher management doesn't care about it and perpetuates the situation indefinitely, leading to the talented operational people to leave. 

Majority of promotions based on friendships, politics and the ability of being a yes-man. 

Huge politics games. What's efficient or needed falls behind the battles of egos.

People having zero domain knowledge but big egos lead large teams.

Big decisions seem to be shamelessly taken by a small group of people in one particular market, despite the company being active on almost all continents.

The company thrives on creating extreme overhead by creating countless manager positions for understaffed teams all the while cutting direct communication between teams and instituting the path of escalations.

Chaotic HR policies implemented without notice."

OLX is not at all a good employer, it offered to buyback the shares from Ex employees in May 2019 at 60% Discount and the price was of December 2018. However some of employees including me did not agree for the same and we were again reached out in May 2020 and this time we were offered the Buyback and told that in Covid Times (Then why did they offer 60% discounted price in May 2019) they want to give us liquidity at 20% Discount also share price was again of December 2018 .
The share price was that of December 2018, they never shared the latest share price of the company and always told us that they don’t know the price of the company. It was a well planned idea to increase the stake of the company and not pay to the deserving Ex Employees. 
Naspers has the Fair practices for employees and lot of other things, however the same is not practiced by Naspers. I would just tell all the startups to be really cautious while dealing with Naspers as they cheat the company and its employees. They bring in their own employees at all key levels and paralyse the startup as the employees of OLX will never be as smart as the Startup employees."

At first I thought this is quite normal as OLX has acquired the company and they are trying to understand the Aasaanjobs Business but it was something else. I used to think that people at the leadership level are generally smart and they know what they are doing. But I realised this is not the case with OLX. They create some strategies in their ivory towers which are far away from reality. As an employee I understand things change, strategy changes but the problem in this company is no one actually knows what needs to be done or they do not have a vision where to go. People who are good at work are not empowered to take decisions. There are many strategy blunders and rollbacks which the OLX leadership has done which has left people really demotivated. I still feel that Aasaanjobs is in a great segment of providing Jobs, but would have been great if we could have moved forward in a definite direction. Many other competitors have moved forward and are accelerating in innovation, but unfortunately we are stuck in our internal mess. This is a general feeling in the company due to which many people are thinking to move on, very unfortunate!"

Since then employees have seen job stability and on time salary payments. It's also nice, talented bunch of people to work with.","Aasaanjobs was a budding, scaling and tech-driven recruitment startup out of India. Since acquisition, playful and talented work culture at Aasaanjobs has been ruined by OLX. 

Major reason for such downfall was bizarre management by OLX. Just few months in the acquisition OLX decided to take the authority away from original founders and brought new layer of management. 

These new people had a very little idea about how to run a modern, rapidly changing startup in India. They ignored all the suggestions and insights given by employees and started to expand business with conventional methods. This ended up killing the tech - innovation which was at the heart of the company (and which made company stand apart from the crowd)

Random re-orgs, unclear strategies and egotist management makes it difficult place to pull off some quality work. Many reviews here must have mentioned the utter stupidity of pushing and cancelling the Aasaanjobs to OLX jobs transition twice. It's like a corrupted government system - Even if one wanted to do some good work, the management can come and kill that good will in one decision.

All this also trickles down to HR, accounts and other functionalities hence. Irrational arguments, unpleasant tone is common across these non-core departments now. So if you do not care about what are you shipping, this is a right place to settle down."

They change strategy every 6 months and every time a new person comes in at mid-leadership level to whom everything has to be explained. They do not empower people to take any decisions and they do not answer difficult questions raised by the employees. 

They want everything to be done on the same day, but if you ask something from the Leadership level in terms of vision and direction, months or years passes.

- Equipment generally readily available on request
- Managers/teams are generally understanding of personal circumstances (e.g: errands during the day, doc's appointments, sick days, etc, but I think that's just Berlin.)
- Small perks are good: beer is often available, fridges are stocked with other drinks, daily fruit, catered lunches most of the week, the rooftop terrace is beautiful, the company parties twice a year are generally a blast
- Some great people to work with - I can not stress this one enough. there are some amazing people here.
- I see some great initiatives coming up over the horizon, I don't know how far over the horizon though.
- Great relocation package","A lot of cons more recently. The Berlin office has changed drastically in the last year and a bit. All of it my own opinions/perception/observations obviously:

- Engineering managers are constantly locked up in meetings and ""stakeholder management"", many don't remain engineers. Other option is technical career track, which is the path less travelled. The few people who are beyond senior I wouldn't really look up to for the most part.
- A home-made web framework that has been the bane of the company's existence for the better part of a decade (though a lot of developers have been Stockholm syndrome'd into loving it). Somehow it was only recently noticed that this was impeding basic progress. (To be fair, work is now being done to remedy this.) - I could write articles about this.
- A product that's complex enough to cause any major (and often minor) feature require months to put together from start to finish.
- Fiefdoms and office politics. I never got in to it, but it has rapidly become obvious.
- Berlin office used to be able to determine mostly for itself what it was working on, that has been slowly taken away over several reorgs. Now when senior management says ""jump"", you mostly ask ""how high?""
- poor communication from senior leadership 1) Making major vendor changes on short notice with little explanation, even when it was made clear from the bottom that communication was lacking.
- poor communication from senior leadership 2) having HR announce a major policy change that affects just about every employee after work hours, and then not being around for 2 days to own, justify, or explain it was definitely a thrilling experience. This was during moments of extreme uncertainty at the start of the coronavirus pandemic and was an unprecedented ask from the company.
- poor communication from senior leadership 3) Most hard questions in all hands/etc are answered with a non-answer (this is opinion).
- ""competency matrix"" that somehow materialized in 6 levels for technical. and 1 level for managers/leaders. When queried about this discrepancy, it was a ""work in progress"" which didn't progress.
- To get basic units of work done, you often need to spend inordinate amounts of time communicating with other parties. This eats greatly in to your development time and adds overhead. It varies greatly depending on what you're trying to do though.
- Regular reorganizations (albeit rarely with redundancies) - these reorganizations are often caused by regularly changing priorities/focus."

Salaries are quite good compared to Portugal's average.","- Terrible leadership. Goals and structure changes all the time, you have the feeling of never really knowing who is in charge
- Lots of micromanagement. Managers tell you what you should do all the time even though they're not the experts on your field.
- Leadership can be very analytical and smart but have low knowledge on how the actual work is done. Lots of people aren't hands on at all
- They don't fire people who aren't delivering. Instead, they move that person to another team, which creates other problems. After a few years of doing that, now we're in a situation where there's a lot of people in the wrong roles, which makes everything way more complicated.
- OLX is a huge product which requires a lot of people and marketing budget to be ran properly. Instead, we've been getting cut over cut on both people and budgets.
- Overall it's the least Marketing-friendly company I worked for. There's not even a leader for it, it's every market for itself, the tooling is horrible (we do have GA 360 for example but it's not implemented right, app attribution is non-existent and there's no plan to fix it). Also leadership doesn't seem to understand the problem that neglecting Marketing is causing to the company. It's a shame since OLX massive growth was achieved through  massive branding campaigns on TV."

309,OLX Group,Pathetic experience working at OLX,2020-02-07,1.0,Key Account Manager,HR knows how to beautify the job profile.,"One of the worst organisations to work with. I left this organisation within 3 days. I joined this organisation on 27th January 2020, and i left it on 30th January.
Reasons 

a) they don’t know how to respect their employee.

b) they do not have any defined policies for their jobs. 

c) they have the worst management. 

They will hire you at a good package, and then they won’t treat you well!
So! My experience: 

Before joining, I was told I will be having a team, after joining, I got  to know there’s no team. 

So, Saturdays are officially working in OLX. Before joining OLX I told the HR that I will be taking off on Saturdays from feb-June mid, because of the course I want to pursue. 

To my surprise, he said “gochi de diyo yaar, manage ho jata hai Saturday toh”

I thought it’s a very chill organisation. After joining, I spoke to my manager regarding the same, he was shocked, I cannot give you any Saturdays off.

I was told you cannot take off at all on Saturdays.

I resigned on 30th, and HR advised me to take a trip to Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. 

After almost 3-4 days, I received a call for exit interview, that HR directly said , we cannot change anything overnight. Thank you so much for joining OLX."

 - Employees are not heard by managers.
 - Insecure environment, even if you are a permanent worker you can be fired just like that. You don't even trust HR to make a complaint. They don't work for the employees but for the managers.
- Bad work/life balance. Advisors sometimes work from home to keep up with the numbers because that's all they measure not the quality of the support.
- Managers are not transparent with you.
- Manager give you like cliché talks, but they don't walk that walk. Particularly in Portugal, the manager for the CS Team seems to be more focused to go to other OLX groups (Brazil for instance).
- They don't like that you have an opinion on change, if you are not in the same page, they will make your life a living heal. Harassing you, saying that you're not a good worker, then a few months latter you are awesome. You go from zero to hero to zero again just to mess with your head, make you uncomfortable so that you'll leave.
- The benefits are the minimum of minimums in Customer Support. In comparison, Pipedrive, Talkdesk and even Farfetch pay more than Olx Portugal!

Free snacks and meals.
Endless opportunities to learn.
Free access to learning platforms like Udemy, HMM
Grant of Stock options","Pathetic mid level tech management specially managers who are from front end technologies. Most of the work here is backend intensive and most of the mid level managers are from front-end who don't understand anything about the backend systems and keep doing mistakes in decision making and the blame goes to engineers. They are not even experts in their front-end domain. Most of them come from service based companies and bring the same culture here. They don't even have good degrees. One of them is BCA from some fake unknown college.It's like hiring process gone wrong for them. Actually they were not hired as managers, instead made managers overnight because HR didn't want to take a burden of hiring EM's. HR knew it could take them months to hire managers so they promoted engineers to managers and that was completely based on favouritism. They also organised a test for the same but it was fake because it was already decided before the results came out. So what can be expected from those managers who doesn't have any experience in management. Despite the lack of capabilities they are surviving and the reason is they have good engineers from IIT's, NIT's, IIIT who are working for them. EM's doesn't push back product features even if the team is overloaded and that's another surviving strategy for them - To keep product management happy by asking no questions and become YES man for them and forget about your team's wellbeing. Almost all of them have completed close to 5 years and won't leave the company unless they are kicked out by company itself because every one of them has stock options worth Rs. 50 Lacs or more except their ctc. So they are doing whatever they can to save their jobs because they know very well that they will not find a job outside. They have even tried in the past and failed to get jobs. I have worked here for close to 5 years and know about each one of them so everything written in this review is 100% truth. Ask any former or current employee before joining. They will tell you the truth. Also check your reporting manager's profile before joining. As a global company it deserves 5 star but these EM's have ruined everything.Employees don't rate companies, they rate their supervisers hence 1 star for them."

-Most of the time product team tries to impress folks in Argentina. The culture is all about making things look good in front of superiors. 
-The timelines are always crunched. Its all about getting things done with bare minimum. There is no scope to refine ideas or think through things.
-The OLX group has got enough funding, so they may offer you high pay. But don't fall for that. Go for any other reputed company even if they offer you lesser salary. 
-If you are in Product/UX/data, this is not the place you would like to work. There is very less maturity in terms of process and knowledge about these practices. And people don't even understand how these things work.
- The work environment in general here is highly manipulative. You can't trust people.

430,OLX Group,"Hypocrisy, bad HR and poor",2018-01-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Best work life balance I've seen from a company. It's generally chill and,"They hired and promoted the wrong people.

While they hide under the image of being an objective, data-driven organizations with its values being be empowered, be open, be curious, build on each other, and live out the values however the organisation is filled with politics contradictory to the above.

Their employee appraisal system is built on fitting in like you would with highschool cliques and agree-ing with everyone. OLX only wants yes-men they don't want curious people asking or giving a different opinion or even being different from the status quo they have of each team. Be unique or have an opinion that's contrary to other people's opinion and prepare for the savagery that comes about in the appraisals. It's not about how well your work is, really you'll never be rated based on that. Your team will rate you well if you're one of the bros. Good luck if your queer or unusual, you can't sit with us.

They won't step in and would even protect people who espouse hate speech to a minority and that kind of ""bro"" behaviour is actually tolerated by an appraisal system built to favor the ones who fit in.

The biggest disappointment is HR. As the vanguard's of a company value OLX PH's HR seems to enjoy being hypocritical of it.

It takes them months to react to an employee concern (if they even react to it at all, so they aren't fast). They aren't genuine as they would rather keep lying to you about doing things or believing in things when they themselves would likely be spreading gossip behind your back. They aren't open to feedback in fact give them feedback and they will likely be defensive about it.

They've also things that are quite disappointing such as overpromising at the start of employment and never actually following through with it. They've forced people to resign (not fire but forced to resign, which is technically illegal in Philippine law). 

On the very shallow side, OLX actually underpays a lot of its employees, when asked about compensation contrary to the value of being open they will just cite an industry survey which you won't even be allowed to view or see the salary scale. Truth be told you'd likely be earning 20-30k PHP more in another startup than OLX."

Awesome marketing team","Select all cons from OLX order by worse ascending  
* The tech & product leadership - This is top one. They don't like you, your days are over. You have a different opinion, your days are over. In fact one very good engineer was fired because he dared to argue with director technology/cto. Yes, his only fault was that he once argued with director technology/cto. They need a yes man and you are not, your days are over. I have heard one dialogue which the director technology/cto said, ""It's not working out"", if you hear this dialogue, your days are over. Their way of working is simple, instils fear. No job security at all. Something you did not worked, your days are over. The tech & product leaders, two of them, found that when they come to office not everyone greets them. People are busy with their work and they are unable to notice if someone arrived. These two guys got a workshop arranged for everyone in tech and product. The aim of workshop, when you come to office, greet them, say ""Good morning sir"". Seriously? The open and healthy atmosphere in tech and product is now totally messed up.

* Helpless HR team - They know what is happening with product and tech team. They have been getting feedback since January. Not from juniors but from senior staff. They are unable to do anything. They are mute spectators. Few guys left the organisation without even  waiting for bonus and I heard one took a pay cut and joined another company. If this happens, HR team should retrospect,  something wrong is happening. 

* Sweet talking CXO team - CXO team doesn't care about the tech & product staff. They have their own PhD & IIT grad BI team which they care for. Rest everyone else is disposable. There were some waves but that happened after glassdoor reviews. The CXO team did sweet talking, ""You have problem, I am reachable"" and disappeared. They knew what was happening and their silence or ignorance was the last thing someone will expect. 

* Not conducive environment for learning & development - The best a tech guy can do in OLX is become an engineering manager. Which is only possible if you are a yes man to CTO and even then there are hardly 5 positions which are already filled. Being a yes man is not a skill that will take you far. Udemy courses are limited, hardly anything there to learn. L&D team organises sessions which are mostly aimed at teaching you how to greet people or marketing. In 3 years, I have never seen any tech oriented session happening in OLX. The only thing you can learn at OLX is newrelic, which is director tech/CTO's favourite tool.

* The financials & overall growth - If OLX is such a pathetic place, then why do people join OLX? Cuz they lure you with money. You get min 30% hike, however what people do not realise is that next year this 30% will be levelled up. 20% YoY growth is much better than 30% one time hike. HR & recruiters always paint a very beautiful picture, that's their job, sell lies. They are not going to work with you. So  be wise."

- India org  is run by ineffective, sweet speaking leaders.
- all decisions are made by one phD scientist who twists numbers for presentations to global management. Everyone knows it but no one says anything. CEO India is completely ineffective, 100% dependent on the phD and is name sake and only listens to his favorites, showing global team rosy figures.
- Numbers were used to challenge marketing decisions and spends when those numbers could be twisted in anyway. No one has right to question the Data team.
- There was a very strong, brilliant Marketing head who built the brand but decided to leave because of all this. 
- Good leaders leave suddenly or are fired abruptly and no effort is made to stop them or understand the real concerns by CEO or global team. If the executive leadership have no job security, how can anyone else have. 
- Too many changes in marketing team and strategy. A good team has already become very small with so many guys leaving. New head is a nice guy but has no idea about marketing. Nothing left to learn after the old marketing head left."

This was a job I quit because of my manager. And people aspiring to join OLX should know my story. 
Last year, I approach my new boss telling him I am demotivated. Boss says, ""No worries, we will take care of this."" Within 20 days, I am told, ""You should start looking out."" And if this was not all, within 15 days, I am being put on PIP. I ask why? I have decent ratings. No complaint from anyone. ""No, you need to be put on PIP"", I am again told. I approach our top most HR, ask for help. HR says they were also surprised by my boss's decision to put me on PIP and assure me they will reach out to other people to assess my situation. And they also assure me, ""I dont think your boss is vengeful"". Soon, I get to know HR approached my boss. As expected my ""non-vengeful"" boss has put me on PIP, has given me a next to impossible task. He also tells me, ""If someone approaches me for your feedback, I am going to say you are OK guy"" This was along with his every now and then constant reminder, ""It's not working, you should start looking out."" 
I decided to quit even when I had no job offer. I will better sit at home unemployed then feel humiliated everyday. My boss, the CTO mentioned in one of the reviews, screw up my career big time.  
But why would my boss do this to me? Cuz, I had different opinions on some topic. I didn't feel any need to meet my boss everyday and tell him what I was doing. In my career of 15 years, never ever felt to do this. In fact, I could counter argue my  earlier boss. Tell him he was wrong when he was wrong. In any professional environment this is appreciated. But this new boss of mine, took note of everything. He was setting me up for failure. And he succeeded. 3 senior staff members left the organisation just because of one person. 

Conclusion of all this 
* If this was just my boss's fault, I would have cursed my boss and moved on. HR has turned a blind eye to all this. Not just HR, CXO staff has turned a blind eye. They know all this and have decided to keep quiet. 
* The favouritism, ones who gather inputs and claim that as their own and talks to boss are clear winners now. Boss doesn't like you, you may be Denise Ritchie but you are not required in the team.
* Vile office politics & micro management has made the work environment toxic. 
* Pathetic leadership, gets their job done by fear. You either tow your boss' line or get kicked the company. I considered myself as an average leader but compared to this leadership, I am awesome.
* If you are an engineer who thinks that the solution boss gave you is not the right one, start looking out.
* Ineffective India HR and the global HR can't help you. CTO/CPO report to central team. So essentially, HR in India is non existent for tech team. They are just processing your payroll if you are not being laid off."
462,OLX Group,"Company having leaders without goals and vision, poor leaders, managers",2017-07-08,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Free lunch, snacks, flexible office timings, yearly offsite,online learning portal","Poor leadership specially Tech and Product. No one knows what both leader wants to do. Both the leaders don't give any input of their own instead just blames the developers. Tech  leader himself doesn't know what he wants from developers. Randomly he will come to you and asks to do useless things without explaining what he wants to achieve.Tech/Product leaders pursue high degree of favouritism and will listen only to handful of people and those people know very well how to manipulate both of them. Unnecessary hierarchy, useless Engineering managers, old employees are united so no one speaks any negative about any other employee. For example there is no need of EDM's still teammates doesn't say anything instead just following status quo. Hierarchy should be flat and devs should be given more freedom.Tech leader is more inclined towards backend, as a leader he should take the entire team along.

Overall Tech and Product leadership is not in good hands. Leadership is not about a title or a designation, one should have the quality of leaders which they don't have.
No job security at all. How can one give his/her best if he/she is not sure whether his/her job is safe or not.
Very scary work environment. Employees are treated as lower class labour. Both the leaders expect you to stretch and work long hours otherwise you are not ambitious and hard working in their eyes. At the same time both of them will leave sharp at 6 daily.
Regret that I joined this company."

Being Open used to be value which defined OLX Ggn, Now 'Be Biased' is our core value. Preferential treatment, Dirty Polictics and non transparent decision describe the current work culture.

2. No Respect for Domains other than Backend - If you are a front end developer, QA automation , android / ios dev. Don't join this company. Top management feels only backend knowledge is important. No wonder everyone is leaving this organization or atleast trying to look out. Top management (CPO & CTO) think they can fire anyone and use fear to drive the org. There is a constant need created in every employee even high performers to prove themselves to top management. 

3. Biasness & Preference to BootLickers - For good rating , Go to CPO/CTO everyday , talk all kind of blah blah blah and they would think you are doing great work & promote u. Only one team and few special people are given preference and rest don't matter.

4. Ineffective HR - HR is completely clueless.HR should try to understand why people are leaving the organization. Answer is pretty simple - ineffective leaders like CPO & CTO. There is a trust deficit with hr and everyone is afraid that their feedback with be shared with same leaders and they would face the heat. 90% employees feel the same but don't wants to get involved.

5. Micro Management - Top Managment under the umbrella of being aspirational completely micro manage all teams. Full of useless meetings and status updates. How can team be productive if we have 3-4 hr of meeting everyday.

6. Focus on impressing counterparts rather than Product Development - Top Management want to prove themselves to the Global/Argentina Team. They just want to finish things without getting involved in any details. CPO doesn't even know the Product let alone talk about it. CTO obeys everything dictated by CPO and only cares about Backend & Machine Learning.CTO thinks everything else can be done by reading a book and comparing status codes. 

Summary -  Great work place ruined by Top Management (CTO / CPO). I would request other peers to update their experience here. Perhaps HR takes notice and tries to improve the organization."

3: Dirty politics, if you are good at licking then you have good chances.
4: If you don't do your regular work rather work in general website issues that too by delegating issue to the concerned person, then you are rated the best among all.
5: Only backend team in technology department is considered worthy, rest are just doing time pass checking website status."
465,OLX Group,"Favoritism, Poor HR Policies, Poor Top Management in Technology",2017-07-05,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Free food, drinks, snacks. Yearly offsites. 
Opporutinites to travel outside India.","Highly Politicial. Favroitism. 
People with average technical skills are promoted because of their licking skills. 

Top management in tech thinks that developers should somehow showcase their talents by talking and prove them (to top management) that they are best.
There is a constant need (created from top) to prove yourself. Top do not understand that people have proved that is why they are here.

Also top has to prove himself that he is a capable leader. Proving yourself is a two-way game. Otherswise top would get boot lickers only.

Top also thinks he is capable of firing people. Thera are few instances in which senior tech members were fired because of attitude/expectations mismatch betweem top and those senior tech guys.

Top takes decisions which have no basis, and are not transparent.

There is new term coined here, which is become visible. Which basically means, you have to goto to CTO in the morning, stand near his chair, and speak blah blah blah. Or if some production issue  happens, dont solve it but stand up and again blah blah blah.

Top management is not able to evaluate the quality of work. Top mangement in tech is micromanaging the developers in terms of the number of hours they warm the chair, or cups of tea they have in a day.

Tech team has become sought of India Saas Bahu Serials, lots of dramas, nothing concrete.

HR team takes decision which are not open."

473,OLX Group,"The BI team in Poland - very unprofessional, no job stability, bad career prospects,",2016-12-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I worked in Dubizzle (acquired by Olx) for 4 years and it was amazing. Great people, interesting projects, funky and cool office environment.  

After moving back to Europe I decided to apply at the European BI team, based in Poland. I was expecting similar culture and conditions, because this is what the company promotes. However it was an extremely disappointing experience.
I'll list all the reason below:","- very unprofessional and careless attitude
 - lack of open and objective communication
 - very narrow-minded and biased team / management
 - no global or ever regional perspective 
 - very low level of English
 - very far from the business (had no idea about basic marketing and product tools, projects etc)
 - no stability in the team. The whole team might be dismissed soon, as there will be a new global team which will take over.


- 
The interview process lasted 2 months in which they never told me the exact role I was interviewed for and they didn't provide the job description. Within these 2 months I only had 3 very vague interviews with no communication in between. 

Eventually, they invited me to meet them in Dublin at a team building event. I still did not have the job description and the job offer. They finally sent both docs the night before I flew to Dublin. I was hoping to discuss the offer when I meet them the next day (negotiation is a part of the contract in normal companies). 

Unfortunately, the managers at Olx did not feel the need to discuss with me my contract. They did not give me a chance to voice any concerns or questions during the stay in Dublin. 

During my stay there I realized that this ""European"" team is has very low level of English. They are all Polish, very closed-minded and antisocial, quite apprehensive of new people, (especially foreigners). I spent a week with them and they hardly spoke to me in English. All communication within the team was in Polish, although I was told they are a ""global"" team, responsible for Europe. 

On my second day with the team, the team lead told us that there will be a new BI team in Berlin, so he would advise everybody to look for job there. Later, he told me, it was good I did not ""give up"" anything for this role because it might not exist soon. 

As I had no chance to discuss the offer in person, I sent an email with a request to review the compensation they offered, as it was inadequate for the role and experience, especially given the insecurity in the team. 
I expected a ""yes"" or a""no"", and I was ready to negotiate. Instead, the hiring manager sent me a very personal, shaming email saying that they are very disappointed and they do not tolerate people with such financial inclinations. 

I tried to call him to get some less emotional explanation. At first he refused to take my calls. When he finally answered my call (I called from a different number), he said that he expected that from me, because I lived in Dubai before and obviously that meant to him that I only care about money. He even dared to tell me to go back to Dubai. I was speechless by this hateful and extremely unprofessional attitude.

BOTTOM LINE: the ""European"" BI team in Poland are a mediocre team, that does NOT have a proper vision or strategy, does NOT have understanding of business on a global or even European level and has absolutely no clue about how to work with people from other cultures or backgrounds. They offer an average pay which does not reflect person's skills and expertise, but where they are from. Most probably they will not exist quite soon, because they will be displaced by the global BI team (based on their own announcement).

Feedback/career progression extremely unclear, basically whatever your boss thinks about you (and he/she may not communicate it to you directly). HUGE gap between management and everyone else in terms of intellect, salary, etc., yet even there it's rather disparate - some general managers are professional and come from consulting/banking/tech/MBA backgrounds while others come from very entrepreneurial backgrounds, with the latter often doing things by ""gut feel"" and without justifying their decisions. If things don't go well, they will look for scapegoats. Depends a lot on which office you get. Some have a good relationship between colleagues, some are the 9-6 and go their own way type."
