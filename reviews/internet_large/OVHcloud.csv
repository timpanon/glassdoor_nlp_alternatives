The work environment and management just needs a bit of work,"Management does not empower employees and help is not given to those who ask. Good products, but work environment is high-stress and unfriendly.  Pay is decent but it is not worth it when your co-workers/managers are not there to assist when you are drowning."

12,OVHcloud,Ends do not justify the means,2019-10-21,2.0,Manager,"Most of the folks working there are awesome. The benefits are decent (assuming they stay that way), and the office has some perks. (snacks/coffee)","Inept leadership from the owner down to the Sr. Director. Too many employees, while talented and capable, in the wrong role. The constant reorganizing due to poor planning, the exclusion of those impacted, the ongoing turnover, the interference from the parent company in France, and lack/limited resources to complete the work required creating multiple impediments. There are conflicts of interest and political issues (what company doesn't). Lastly, mixed messages sent to employees. Benefits put in place such as tuition reimbursement, gym reimbursement, phone, etc only to be discouraged from using them. I tried using the tuition reimbursement and you'd thought I asked for a raise and a company car! Oh, and not cool making us work at an office not yet ready for everyone and not prepared for the hot summers!"

16,OVHcloud,Clown show in a dumpster fire,2019-02-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"When I was there, free food on Fridays","Everything else. No one in management, particularly executive management, there has a clue what their doing. Most are way out over their skis having never held these positions or titles elsewhere. A complete bunch of frauds. There were several rounds of layoffs in 2018 and the inept CEO and CFO quit with no notice late in 2018 rather than be fired. I heard 2019 stated the same way. Doubtful the US entity will be in business by July. Let’s see if this gets deleted like the more than dozen other bad reviews that have disappeared. Glassdoor is a joke and cannot be relied upon for accurate information."
17,OVHcloud,Deep Issues in the Roots,2019-01-22,2.0,Manager,"I originally did not have any intent to write a review, until it was brought to my attention that other negative reviews have been removed.  You have a right to know.  Let's see if this gets deleted.

Decent gym facility
Lunch on Friday
Good people
Opportunity to do all the work
Due to confidentiality, details must be spared, but there is a case study here that deserves its spot in every MBA program

It will offer the experience of a lifetime.  I am very serious, and I am still very thankful for the opportunity.  I could not have learned this much from anywhere else.","This review is for OVH US LLC (specifically Reston, VA office), which is a subsidiary of OVH Group (Roubaix, France).

As a subsidiary there are constant communication gaps with the parent company located in France.  Culture gaps, business culture gaps, and language barriers can be closed in time through mutual respect.  I have seen that they are working on this, and I believe that this can be fixed.

A flawed mindset from the US management team is their largest roadblock to success and happiness.  After constant restructuring, the company has failed to find its footing and focus on the important tasks at hand.  

The objective of the restructurings have not been to streamline the workflow or to run with an efficient cost structure, but rather to pad and secure the lifestyles of those in the inner circle.  The most recent restructuring (early 2019) reinforces the oligarchic governance where small insular group continues to reside in the epicenter.

It seems every review that mentions this is being removed.  It is hard to substantiate this without breaching confidentiality, but there is evidence.

There are good people and hard workers at OVH US LLC, but they are constantly hindered by backwards and unfocused management.

I am hesitant to write more or refine this review as it is likely it will also be deleted.  Already removed quite a bit of information just to try to get this posted.
Actually, that about sums up my work experience at OVH.  You can work hard, analyze the weaknesses with intent to improve, but no one will want to face the truth.  Unfortunate, because that is the first step towards success."
18,OVHcloud,"Nice place to work, hope they improve",2019-01-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good technology, great coworkers, strong teams, positive culture, growing company.

Organization is a mess.
19,OVHcloud,Potential blurred by ego and legacy,2019-01-20,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Relaxed environment, incredible benefits, great education reimbursement program,  access to inter-nationality and culture cross-over.","Toxic employees and absentee/toxic management.  Lack of opportunity for promotion. General disconnect between OVH Group and OVH US. Lack of meaningful respect, trust, and understanding of separated teams. Lack of meaningful discipline of objectively poor behavior and easily avoidable mistakes."

Awesome benefits. I've never been happier with my job, team, or boss.","It's exactly how start-ups are defined - chaotic, dynamic, crazy - but that's what I love about it.

25,OVHcloud,Life here at OVH US: we Have youth and experience on our side.,2018-02-15,5.0,Principal Systems Engineer,"We are a fast moving start up trying to chip away at some of the biggest players in the cloud segment. I feel like I’ve lived three lifetimes in my 27 years in tech, and I can honestly say that the thing that I most love about my job is the people I work with and the kinship I feel for them.

We have a lot of 20-somethings in our company, and I’m regularly asked to help them and act as a mentor. Being able to take my 27 years of experience and share that with people just getting into their IT careers is unbelievably rewarding. These youths are our greatest assets, and as veteran IT professionals we have to cultivate them, foster their growth, and help them down the path we’ve already traveled.”",Normal old Startup chaos. For me it is good times.
26,OVHcloud,OVH US is a great company to work for!,2017-08-04,5.0,Customer Support Advocate,"OVH US is an awesome company to work for because of the transparency of the executive team, employee opportunity growth, and the culture everyone feels like family.",OVH US is constantly changing but that comes with a new company so I was aware and have no issues with it but for a person that may not like change this is not the company for you.
27,OVHcloud,OVH US,2017-08-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Growth Potential, Change to compete with other US IAAS providers, unique experience, innovate",Just starting up in the US so  this could be daunting for some people.
28,OVHcloud,Great people building a business with huge potential,2017-08-02,5.0,Account Executive,"I've only been at OVH-US for a short time, but I'm very impressed with the caliber of the people and the excitement around OVH's potential here in the US.  Executive leadership is refreshingly transparent and that includes explaining their thought process around various decisions and priorities.   Benefits are very good and sales comp plan is competitive with significant upside potential (management seems willing to pay for top performers).

Despite the fact that OVH-US is a startup, they did a very good job with some important on boarding activities like payroll, 401k and insurance (medical, dental, vision, life and disability).  Somewhere along with line an executive made a decision to prioritize payroll and employee benefits...good call in my opinion.

OVH has been one of the largest Cloud Service Providers in Europe with technology that will play well here in the US.  The addressable market is exploding and customers always want alternatives to help them spread risk and maintain leverage.","The ""cons"" are what you would expect for a startup.  The environment is very dynamic and it sometimes takes too long to come up with answers to what should be simple questions.

The good news is that management is taking the time to build processes and an organization that will scale quickly while keeping customers happy.  The bad news is that it takes time to do it right.

If--however--you are the type of person that expects to find a procedure manual your first day on the job, this isn't the right place for you.  If you want to help write the manual, then you should consider OVH."
29,OVHcloud,Why I love working at OVH US,2017-08-02,5.0,Manager of Customer Support,"Not a start-up in the traditional sense, it is very much a stand up mentality required to be successful here.  The opportunity to build something from the ground up, make an impact, and have access to decision makers is an opportunity of a lifetime! Everyone is on the same page, working hard, with every action purposed on what is best for our customers.
Russ has provided us with the vision, and the freedom to make it happen!
Everyday I come to work, I come knowing that I have the support of the team. It is a very positive environment. Our new offices, our strong benefits are just samplings of how valued we are. I would highly recommend OVH US as a company to work and grow with.","Like with any start up there are minor hiccups and growing pains that one must deal with. In truth, it isn't much of a Con in that we are dealing with these issues to better serve our customers, stay out of our comfort zones to avoid complacency, and constantly looking to improve. That said, this environment isn't for everyone. You have to be willing to put in the hard work, be flexible, patient, and understanding."
