2. Free Food
3. Above market salary.","1. Management lacks vision. A new project starts almost every 2-3 Months and most certainly fails. 
2. Too many review meetings. There is a review almost every week and you spend most of the time preparing PPTs instead of actually working. 
3. Constantly had to live in fear as you get humiliated in review meetings
4. Company doesn't care about your career. They will hire you for a project and if it fails then there is no back up plan. 
5. Very high attrition. Every other day you see people around you leaving which makes you wonder whats wrong. 
6. Too much randomness at work place. You are uncertain about everything and management expects everything to run smoothly. 
7. Firing cycle happens once every 2 years. Even before Covid there was a firing cycle in dec 2019. People in the company tell you its a regular event at Ola. And the worst part is after a mass layoff they start recruiting in 2 months. (After Ola fired 1400 people in May 2020, they started recruiting again in Aug-Sep 2020)
8. Excessive work pressure. Long working hours.
9. Too much focus on Data. Prides itself on calling a data driven company. Company has hired a lot of people from fancy colleges who have little practical work expereince."

2) Fast Pace Development.
3) Learning (Both tech and personal)","1) Politics
2) Poor Management—they don't even know what they want to do in the near future.
3) Higher Attrition Rate (In the past 6-7 months the tech team count has been reduced to 50%) So many good people who had worked hard left. The company doesn't value anything but revenue.
4) The product team is not good as it has to be. They just want to release a product no matter the quality and user experience.
5) It was good in the initial days when I joined, but with each passing day they are behaving more like a service-based organisation.
6) I must say that Ola is not an Employee-Friendly organisation. We started working 6 days from Jan 2021 even if there was no new product to be launched. When the country was going through the Covid pandemic, they asked each employee to come to the office and mandatorily between 9:30 and 5:30. No value to the employee only to the business.
7) New people are not joining the company as it has 6 days/week working. 
8) No career growth as the people whom you are reporting don't have enough time because they need to handle a big team (because so many dev managers have already left due to this toxic work culture and now most of the team have common dev managers)."

Couldnt plan a 5 year old birthday party yet alone a successful business strategy. In the 2.5years i was there, there was no plans with more than a few months foresight. The total business direction has pivoted three times.. from Foodpanda...to international expansion...now Electric.... 

No attention payed to culture or employee well being. 

Frequently asked to complete tasks that were very unethical business practice ""lets interview competitors to get an understanding of what they are up to"" .. if you pushed back management would just get someone else to do it and you were removed from all communication."

It has been made mandatory for all employees to join office as if we all are suddenly immune to Covid. If your parents are diabetic, if somebody in your family is pregnant, you are pregnant or if you have an infant or elderly people in your family it doesn't matter because you an Ola employee first and then you have a family. Everybody has been forced to come to office. And to top that they have made it 6 day work week and the reason is simple. We are a mobility company and if we don't move then how can we ask others to move. I am thinking if the same is being said over at Swiggy and Zomato!!

462,Ola,Worst HR out of all organisations,2021-01-17,1.0,Associate Director,None at all. Absolutely nothing,"Ola has the worst HR possible. I will explain why

1. They unilaterally made a decision to shift all employees from 5 days a week to 6 days without any consultation. Typically, when you are making such a shift you do it gradually by introducing alternate saturdays, or a half-day on the 6th day or even increase the number of annual leaves to compensate.
But no, one fine day the HR head decides to increase your number of working days by 52 days a year.
What more, this decision to make it a 6 days week was in plans for last 3 months or more. Still they hired new employees over the last month by fooling them that its a 5 day week organisation and now they are stuck. Deceit and trickery is the essence here.
2. They have introduced some ultra stupid core collaboration hours concept, where you have to mandatorily report office everyday by 9.30 AM even if you are working till midnight the previous day. Again zero flexibility for the so called 'startup' culture.
3. Even for a 1 day of leave, you have to apply 3 weeks in advance
4. They even have the audacity to mention on their offer letters, that you are expected to work on public holidays
5. No team bonding exercise like offsite, etc ever takes place. An individual at Ola is only expected to work and do nothing else.
6. Even if you are on a sick leave for genuine reasons, you are expected to work
7. There is zero job security. The founder literally goes around telling everyone on their faces, I will fire you and hire a replacement.

In a nutshell, the HR is only hell bent towards making Ola a worst workplace and its only getting worse by each passing day."

624,Ola,Stressful hours with a verbally abusive and unprofessional manager,2020-07-27,1.0,Product Designer,"It can be a great collaborative experience as there are some amazingly creative designers working in the UX and brand team.

As a global company, Ola can provide a platform to work on problems that will impact users across countries. This also helps in getting a good understanding of different markets and demographics.","It's sad to say but there is no room for discussing out innovative and creative ideas. Most teams are only aiming to achieve mediocre results. This happens because of the unrealistic deadlines and many times working under stressful hours (midnight and early mornings). 

Another huge let down is that the manager/head of design (in the year 2020) is verbally abusive, unclear in his approach, treats the members of the design team as his college juniors and abuses them verbally in front of any team. His careless and unprofessional attitude has made many leave the company on a day's notice. A whole team of UX researchers (6 members) slowly left the company under his management. There is no UX research team in Ola as of 2020.

People have cried, cribbed and fall sick working till midnight and early mornings. #BurnoutGuaranteed 

Now one might ask, is there so much work and projects going on? The answer is no. Most of the time the designers are forced to work on one of his ideas that he wants to present to the CEO in order to impress him (which by the way is crystal clear that never going to get built). And then the designers also need to find time to complete the actual projects on-time without missing the unrealistic deadlines.

All the designers are merely pushing pixels, day in and day out, and not getting any chance to do some real problem solving or actually using and implementing any of the design methodologies.

Let me be very clear that these practices are discouraged as there is no time to even think about the user. Designers even joke about it whenever they are being forced (due to the deadlines) to ship a feature which they clearly know has usability issues. #RIPUser"

- Exposure to whats happening in the business
- Growth in salary if this is your cup of Tea and you are a workaholic
-Salary is good, but then if you calculate the number of days/hours you work, it is actually not great as it looks in your offer letter :)","There is long long list of these below---

-It is technically 24/7 work, people will not hesitate to call you on weekends/public holidays and at odd hours, even also when you are on emergency leaves, and ask you to open your laptop and work. No Empathy for employees and their personal life.

- The Company literally operates at the whims of just one man (The leadership team cannot say no to him and they have no say, seen senior industry veterans get blasted at meetings by this gentleman). This culture trickles down across the organisation.

-No Job security - They have a very impulsive style of running business. New businesses start and close very fast. Also, so called growth plans turn into downsizing very soon as well. They have laid off probably 2000 people in a span of 6 months. It is a gamble of sorts

- Highly unprofessional, people abuse during meetings, meetings wont take place on time, meeting invites at odd hours-invite for which will follow at last moment (as if you were waiting for it)

-Attrition in teams are very high, and work gets passed to existing team members, so you will always be over-burdened with work, and nobody will allow you time to pick up new things as well (it is presumed you know everything from day1). Teams change here in 6-8 months (it is fast paced, right!! :-) 

- Forget leaves, even if you are on leaves, you need to carry laptop along. No cash encashment or carry over of leaves. Have seen cases where employees on notice period, literally use all their sick and paid leaves."

Here are the cons:

1. HR- Recruiter people will tell you so many nice things bla blaa just to get you on board. These are clear LIES as TA team don't know anything. You will feel cheated once you join OLA Electric and when HR team - finance, tell you actually how things happen.
2. You are expected to start your working right from Day-1. Even if you are new in this EV, don't expect them to give training.
3. The place is fully messed up. You will get the feel that you are working in a Call center. No Tech company will have this kind of atmosphere.
4. You will be chasing highly impossible time lines, for which you may have to end up working up to 12hrs/day and forget about your personal life on Saturday's & Sunday's. You have to work on these days as well. HR's might not tell this, but it's mandatory for you to work on weekends as well.
5. There will be this variable pay concept, so for which you have to be a slave for your manager. Eventually, you will not get this. 
6. You must enter the office by 10AM or you have to sign in a book. You have to stay for not less than 9hrs/day even though in your offer letter it's 8hrs/day.
7. They will offer you some ESOPs, but you will not get that as well. It's just another LIE.
8. No parental Insurance policy.
One suggestion is don't join this company & screw up your life. All teams, it's same.

And many more... Thank God that I left this place."

- Highly political management.  Despite being a start-up promotions and career-growth are highly political and dependent on how much you  bootlick your manager ( which can involve taking up a lot of  poor quality work, toiling away on the weekends unnecessarily).
- Unstructured organization. Despite being around for close to a decade, the org is still majorly unstructured with no clear division of responsibilities and with poor work frequently  being dumped on the ones weak enough to not push back.
- Un-competitive pay. Although the work is above mark standards and the workload is much higher the pay is  still only at average market level or below. This has caused heavy attrition across levels and management does not seem interested in correcting it.
- From 2019, all perks have also been withdrawn. You don't get free lunches and the snacks in the cafeteria have also been scaled back majorly."

The head of the company is very smart and inspiring. He's the most hard working person in the company but is surrounded by some really dumb people reporting to him. 
Average pay.","The HR department actively looks out for ways to suck the blood of employees. Policies such as 6 days working and pay cut if you come after 10am are being introduced. You have to sign your name in the late attendance register like a school kid if you come after 10am. They don't even have good chairs. Ac doesn't work most of the time. You don't even get a good cup of tea in the pantry. 

The management is incapable and is playing a game of blames. Nobody wants to take responsibility. Operations, tech and product teams are not aligned and everyone just wants to save themselves. It is the end product that takes a hit because of it.

Most of the employees are asked to come on Saturdays but are not given ESOPS. Some employees who are given ESOPS are not even given formal letters. That's because they will do it after another round of funding when the value of ESOPS gets further diluted. For the rest of employees, they have a lollipop of something called as LTIPS which is nothing but a scheme to not give ESOPS right now. If you are going to give LTIPS after one year, why would one work on Saturdays and Sundays for you right now? Its a simple concept of value exchange which they don't understand. If you expect unconditional loyalty, hire a dog. I believe in practical value exchange. 

the app is not consumer facing and is used by a bunch of support executives who make your life hell. If you just want to make money then it is ok. Otherwise look somewhere else."

The work environment is extremely volatile and no effort seems to be made to rectify it. There is no sense of team effort or ownership and everybody is clearly in it only for themselves. This is not a welcoming, friendly place at all. People are very quick to play the blame game and shift the blame onto someone else at all times. The level of infighting and unprofessionalism on display is overwhelming. Not an hour goes by when you don't see someone shouting at the top of their lungs or backbiting in the cafeteria. Yes, that happens everywhere but it's much more here than it needs to be. There's a huge difference between being cutthroat and being needlessly vicious, and the people in this organisation don't seem to understand that. If you're looking for a place that's challenging and constructive, this is not the place for you.
3. Long Work Hours:
Employees are expected to stick around for 11-14 hours a day at times while the middle management conveniently leaves at 5:00PM on the dot. 
4. HR has no structure or direction:
Much like the rest of the organisation, the HR also seems lost and directionless. The policies in place are hardly understood by them, let alone explained to us, and there is absolutely no clarity provided on any topic because they probably have no clue either."

When asking to seniors, reply is:-""We had proposed to seniors for those who didn't receive any appraisal, may be you will get it in june month"".

Age & experience are not really a criteria for success, but all depends on how much stress you can bear and for how long.","Working late and across the weekend is 'expected'. The leadership is perpetually working round the clock, so the 'culture' is to just follow that. If the boss is in office on a Sunday evening taking reviews, his entire team spends previous 36 hours in office prepping for that. 

You might say startups are supposed to be intense, but this is a notch above everything that I, my team mates and my friends at other places have seen/experienced. Ola has a few thousand people now and is not a garage startup anymore - things need to change with time; organisation needs maturity..period. 

Working weekends & late nights is not the core issue but the whole culture around 'expectation' that employees have nothing else going on in their own lives is what ruins the place. An old-ish employee recently left since her boss was not willing to give anymore time off to recuperate from a pretty serious illness. People are made to feel very guilty about taking any time off. Holidays are just a thing on the calendar that nobody cares about - Aug 15 or Ganesh Chathurti was like any other normal weekend with people coming in late and leaving early at 8PM for dinner.

Almost everyone in our team has either worked or has friends in other startups in India - this place seems very different & very intrusive in your life. People leave as soon as they hit a year. Prospective hires just don't accept offers from this place even with better compensation/roles etc"

1367,Ola,Great place to work !,2015-08-16,5.0,Software Development Engineer,"Very good pay
Work is challenging and no hesitations in using new technologies
Developers focus more on feature development and bug fixes rather than being on-call which is excellent
Cool culture
New office and its location is amazing
Many perks (free lunch and dinner; juices, fruits, water, tea and sandwiches served at your desk, get ola money on joining)
Less processes makes your life easy",Many 'not so intelligent' people ruining the code quality and products.

Debugging the deployment errors throughout the night.

No Proper Sprint planning from product and project management teams.

And guess what most of the deployment happens just before on weekends thursday/fridays. For sure issues will come  and your weekends are gone just like normal working days.
On top of that all latest deployed app team members will be scolded irrespective of mistake at their end or not."

1374,Ola,Recruitment should be proper,2015-06-15,1.0,,Product is popular but having lot of security loopholes.,Recruitment of OLA is like lottery. One of the Test Engineer folk joined as senior director in Engineering. They easily could get good senior folks from Indian institute/REC/BITS. They don't know whom to recruit for Engineering post.

1381,Ola,Lots of Action; But Lacks Culture,2015-03-27,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"1) Fast paced and aggressive - One gets to do a lot of things in a short span - would give satisfaction
2) Lots of highly talented colleagues - most people are high energy
3) Work you do impacts several lakh people everyday","1) Immature and arrogant top management
2) Exploitative work place - Unapologetic to ask you to work over weekends (on the basis of fake urgencies)
3) Lack of mutual respect - bossy attitude in several managers
4) No defined cultural or company values - Since values aren't established, and the current employees who are the interviewers don't share common values, the interview process doesn't select for people who have a specific set of values, and this goes in a spiral - results in mercenary work force; not employees aligned for a mission
5) Random levelling; too many levels; several people with inflated titles - Inmobi has already inflated titles; since this company poaches from Inmobi, one more level of inflation - Due to inconsistent levelling, lot of insecure people who steal credits and don't act like leaders"

Working and riding with Olacabs on this Technology plane so far is awesome and i am still enjoying it. This company has a clear funda work hard and party harder.",Every Company has cons this has too like you have to be dynamic and competitive to cope with the growth.

* Very haphazard decision making. You are there mostly for execution
* Load of churn in technology and product
* Heavily ops and marketing focused, if you want to be on tech or product, reconsider and ask a lot of questions
* No ESOPs even to early employees
* Work like balance is a myth"

2. They will take you for granted 24x7. You will be hired promising a 5 day week, but they keep you chasing on weekends.
3. Business heads and managers are not gutsy enough to say no to unwarranted demands of the management.
4. No fixed appraisal cycle (its there only for namesake). No hikes/appraisal if you don't ask for it.
5. No team building activities, no outings, no employee rewards etc.
6. Workplace is analogous government offices/ post offices. No cubicles, no team spaces etc.
