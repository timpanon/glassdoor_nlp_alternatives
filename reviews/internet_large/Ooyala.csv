  - Struggling daily with middle management bloat and indecision caused by endless bureaucracy.
  - Two rounds of employee layoffs, the second follwed almost immediately with ""We're having a great quarter"".
  - Zero transparency from the upper management, no clue about how the company is doing.
  - A near total collapse of the compnay culture after the acquisition by Telstra.
  - Four different CEO's, each with a different vision that just caused more confusion and zero forward progress.

When I left the company was still struggling with the problem of having zero company culture and still struggling with defining what it actually does. Flex is just a last ditch attempt at rallying around a product that doesn't have anything to set it apart from others on the market.

To the great people that are still there, get out now. The management buyout just means that Jon and his lapdog Mike are trying to get as much money for themselves as possible, they have no care for employees or their futures."

At least one good product in Flex","Only 2 people really matter at this company - the self important, invisible CEO and his vicious little lap dog COO. If you are reading this and that is not going to be your title then move on - nothing to see here. Seriously - do yourself a favor and keep looking.

To be fair they took over this company when it was on it's last breath  due to complete mismanagement by it's parent company Telstra , it's weak board of directors, and an inexperienced senior management team that were blind to certain people/practices.  They have at least managed to stop most of the rot but at the cost of multiple lay offs, complete culture destruction, and the fostering of just a plain nasty management style where everybody feels at risk all of the time and there is no trust.

For friends i left there i hope there is a future for Ooyala but i for one am very glad that i am no longer part of it. My new company has restored my previously held belief that execs don't have be be arrogant, self centered *****!"

59,Ooyala,Lack of leadership means lost potential,2018-07-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There was so much potential here. A lot of talented developers who really enjoy solving technical problems. The product itself is solid as a backend solution. But sadly there are more cons than pros.,"Complete lack of leadership. The teams have so little leadership from their managers that they have to make decisions on their own without the lack of guidance or structure, which means there is a huge gap between product and development. Communication was terrible. Goals were vague. No focus whatsoever on building a UI that was based on customers needs or product vision until recently, Zero push for data, UI testing processes, and basic understanding of Agile. Measuring the success of a release was not important as long as you released. The general tone in meetings was negative to the point of rudeness. Without a leader to set things straight it was the Wild West and every person for themselves. Quite a disarray. They can blame it on the current sale of the company, but let’s be honest. If they actually cared about solving customer’s issues, they would not let a purchase get in the way of valued production. Such a shame. Because there are enough talented people who could have stayed and helped make the product what it could be, but management doesn’t care to prioritize value or customer satisfaction. I’m not really sure what they prioritize. It certainly isn’t the “help”."

Entire engineering talent (both senior and junior) have ran off long ago, along with every competent engineering manager. Technology has stagnated for years. 
Senior management, which has changed multiple times, is not capable of developing any effective business goals and objectives, because of their lack of knowledge of video platform industry as well as incompetence in enterprise software engineering in general. Instead the senior managers decided that they know how do develop software better than engineers and dictate from the top which software technologies should be used in what context. The results have been predictably disastrous."

Sad this use your be an awesome company to work for but the new managers only care to steal ideas and increase their own salaries.  They promised raises so people wouldn't leave but they never got them and then fired employees after complaining.,Management is clueless about the industry and HR is only there to terminate employees who know the business and disagree with the new management.

- An exciting product, Flex, that could pivot the company away from its OVP and ad product issues
- Delicious snacks, coffee, and food in regional offices (daily lunches in HQ!)","The company has stumbled over the past 2 years under the leadership of 4 different CEOs. Because of the lack of leadership and direction, the video product has suffered and client retention has plummeted. Purchasing Videoplaza has proven to be an expensive acquisition that was not able to compete against better-known ad tech companies in the US market. Some of the best, longest-lasting employees have fled over the last few months or been mysteriously let go. Every day, employees come into work wondering if their team or product will disappear. 

There is no documentation on how to service clients and no management leading the charge to change this. The last group of middle management that set up any processes was laid off. Therefore, whenever a client-facing employee leaves the company (which is happening in droves these days), all client and product knowledge is lost with that person, leading to further client unhappiness and departures. There are no career paths or new hire training for Ooyala employees. HR (what’s left of that department) has done away with quarterly performance reviews and the quarterly employee recognition awards."

- Ooyala offers a fantastic opportunity to work with outsourced IT vendors brought in to shore up gaps created by persistent brain-drain in the wake of poorly throughout  and executed layoffs by an inept, insensitive interim management team.

- Tons of parking at the company's new, smaller yet still seemingly empty headquarters office located within stumbling distance of the San Jose International Airport! 

- A very inclusive environment fostered by sales and marketing quietly cracking inappropriate jokes in the break room or near the bathrooms or wherever they just happen to be standing at the time. Want to know about all to fun stuff the sales and marketing teams team gets up to at trade shows? Don't worry, you'll learn it pretty quickly. The company loves to talk about its sales and marketing teams. (Other teams? Well, aren't you happy the sales bros have such an awesome time on the company's nickle?)

- Fantastic facilities chosen for cost over comfort. The most lush, sound damped portions of the office have been given over to sales, marketing, and upper management while the rest of the company lives in an unfinished industrial open-office squalor. Don't like working through deafeningly loud grinding, clanking, hammering, and drilling? Wear headphones. Two months after moving into the new San Jose office construction is still a daily, on-going thing.

- A constant march of new and improved but really downgraded perks for working at the company. Lunches are at least still free and there are way more bananas in the break room that you could ever want. The coffee is bad but there's a Starbucks just a short walk away which is great because the office is such a horrible place to try to get work done.","- Crushing technical debt from years absent of competent supervision, especially in customer satisfaction and engineering. Lacking clear direction or priority whatsoever apart from an obsessive campaign of cost cutting, improvements or innovation to all of the company's platforms were swept out the door as talented engineers left seeking challenges more significant than polishing rapidly tarnishing brass.

- The great sense of morale the company once had has largely been replaced by a low-level thread of cynicism, especially among technical staff. Successively bad decisions during and following a 14% laying off (that included the entire engineering team responsible for one of the core products), disruptive hyper-focus on cost reduction in favor of customer satisfaction, negligence in allocating resources toward maintaining critical internal infrastructure, and ever growing technical debt have sapped away most of the optimism the company once had.

-There has been zero visible attempt made to stop the exodus of the company's talent, good employees are jumping ship out of frustration. This has been so persistent it's not uncommon for somebody to ask you--with absolutely no note of irony, humor, or sarcasm--if it's your last day when you walk from one end of the office to the other carrying a small box. More than once a day.

- Zero technical hiring in the Silicon Valley office if there's actually any direct technical hiring happening at all anywhere within the company. All technical back-fill appears to be funneled to outsource vendors.

- For individual contributors there are no career paths at Ooyala. With the seeming freeze in hiring there's no expansion to any of the teams with direct hires and thus no opportunity to shift among teams or to move up within either individual contributor or management tracks.

- Ooyala has lost anything resembling a culture of any kind. People used to hang out around the office on their time off to work on projects because they enjoyed being at the company working with the people at the desk across from them.  Ooyala used to host technical meetups for open source communities and host regular hackathons.  In the last nine months this has completely evaporated. There's no longer a sense of value or reward in being connected to the people you work with in any way deeper than the 9-to-5 clock. The company has completely lost it's sense of fun."

90,Ooyala,Lot more change happening,2017-09-23,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I do not want to talk about just the free breakfast, lunch & dinner, but want to mention about what the new management (CEO & COO) is upto. There is lot of cost cutting that eliminated waste (including beer), and they are trying their best to retain the smart engineering team. I personally think this is great to eliminate wasteful spending. Management is bringing in external vendors to augment the product delivery. So there is lot of hope.","The sad part is there is lot of churn still happening in engineering & customers. The goal is to cut costs all the time, but they have shifted focus on PMO to run the organization, so it is neither a product driven or engineering driven company. Unfortunately PMO has an upper hand on what needs to get delivered - this is the direction from new COO. The new management does not have any clue about the video business and are relying heavily on a ""failed"" sales team who never met any of their targets in the past 3 years. The bottom line : if you have a sales team that does not meet targets and a PMO driven organization, I would say this is not a place for smart engineers or product managers. So you can see why churn is high. The company will take another 6-8 months to settle down from all the employee churn."

94,Ooyala,[Zero Stars wasn't an option]  Poor and manipulative leadership,2017-08-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Very little to say in this section.  Seems that all the pros about the company have gone out the window.  Still some good people here.,"I am not one that needs to be on a soap box, but I read a review this morning entitled This Isn't Normal - and I want to second what this individual has said.  
I have been with the company for 2 years, and so much has changed.  4 CEO's, which means 4 new directions.  They should have stuck with the first CEO - he was awesome and truly was able to see vision and lead the team. The 2nd one had no business being here, and we were all happy when he left. The interim CEO who was the GC, also had no business being the CEO, he was so full of himself that was in the end his demise.  Now the new CEO, I don't even know where to start.  Look this guy up folks, all he does is dismantle companies. So those awaiting a layoff package, you can keep waiting- I'm sure you'll get it, but there won't be anything in it - the exiting of employees recently has shown how little they respect the work/effort you've done and how clueless they are on how to exit someone respectfully.  
The recent changes in Engineering should speak volumes to you.  A VP leaving in EMEA because he just didn't want to be a part of what was becoming of the company, and then the SVP being walked out and blamed for everything.  He had no ability to do anything because of the remaining founder who is still here trying to manipulate everything.  
I agree with the other post. about the witch hunt - it's a shame the company tries to silence people.  For the most part I believe the IC's here want to do the right thing and want to try and rebuild the company.  But I also agree that it's becoming hard to look at myself in the mirror for allowing the type of behavior I see here to continue.  I've questioned myself and the work that I do, because it's become OK for managers and leaders to bully employees, publicly humiliate them and more.  
You think people are out interviewing - you are so right.  If you aren't out interviewing you deserve to go down with the new leadership team.  
The leadership team will tell you they need you to be successful, but the truth behind that is they only need you to have the position active, so it's more favorable to their bigger plan of selling. the company off piece by piece.  
The new HR team is a joke.  Talk about being controlled.  No ability to speak up, no ability to work for the employees- just a cowardly group that ""needs"" their jobs so they do unethical things.  
Sales organization - not sure why some of these guys are still here, an organization that struggles just to bring in a $50k deal.  Have some dignity guys, you are loyal to your CRO, but in the end, he has the package he needs to stay, and you'll be left holding the bag.  
Good Engineers are dropping like flies.  With no leadership or support for them, who could blame them.  Calling all external recruiters --- ripe for the picking here."
95,Ooyala,Operations,2017-08-14,5.0,,Endless smiles and great coworkers,Very tiring job at the company
96,Ooyala,This Isn't Normal,2017-08-14,1.0,Engineer,Avocado Toast. Hopefully we'll get better coffee soon.,"Please note: every negative review on Glassdoor has prompted a MASSIVE company-wide witch hunt to the tune of “who is the author?!” That alone should give you a sense of the culture here. I didn’t really care to write a review, but apparently it’s such a scandalous act nowadays that I simply couldn’t resist. 

Let me tell you what happens when you work here. You forget what normal feels like. You think it’s ok when senior management openly gossips about who’s getting fired next month. You shrug your shoulders when bodies start dropping so frequently that nobody even bothers to tell you who works here anymore. You watch your coworkers leave in droves and the work just piles up as management smiles condescendingly and tells you “let’s just do more with less!” You begin to expect disrespect and political games. You think toxic is the new normal. You start to believe it when management tells you you’re just lucky to have a job. You work your tail off - on call at all hours of the night -  only to have senior management, during a tantrum, shout “what have you even done since you got here?” You get in trouble for not looking happier - aren’t you having fun? You step out of the office during lunchtime to pick up your kids and immediately get put on blast for “obviously interviewing elsewhere.” You start to doubt your own self-worth. You may have a thick skin, but this place eats away at you. How could it not? 

It’s sad because I do like and respect a lot of my coworkers. I also used to respect our “executive management group.” Our GC (and former acting CEO - don’t even get me started on how messed up that was) and CFO were straight up Gs. I looked up to them. Now anyone with any credibility is gone and we’re on yet another random CEO. And don’t get me started on the remaining founder. I usually find anonymous personal critiques distasteful, but this has to be said. On one hand, he’s clever. Great. He’s also manipulative and a legitimate sociopath. Don’t be fooled by the “pleasant” demeanor.  And by the way, he hasn’t done real work for years - he’s secretly a master delegator and all of the work rolls downhill to those he openly treats like his “minions.” All of his time and paranoid energy is spent maintaining an image of total control and indispensability. People think he stays here out of goodwill and loyalty, but it’s obvious that he just likes feeling like the top dog. 

But enough about that. One person doesn’t make or break a company. Remember, though, that the fish rots at the head. This company has somehow gone from a plucky startup to a graveyard where dreams and self-worth go to die. I truly used to believe in this company - but it’s too far gone at this point.  The most recent executive posse has really upped the ante by the way - there’s a new level of fear that anyone could be fired at any time. You know it’s bad when you have to sit in your car and take deep breaths before heading into the office every morning. You know it’s bad when you fantasize about getting laid off because you don’t have the courage to leave what is essentially an abusive relationship. You know it’s bad when your aggressive and desperate job search is crippled by chronic self doubt and a nagging feeling of worthlessness that you’ve internalized without realizing it. My advice to all of you? Take a step back and realize that this isn’t normal. It is not going to change. And you are better than this. One day you’ll look back and wonder why it took you so long to leave."

Beer every now and then. Ping pong table. Things are much better if you're in Santa Clara.

Food: Comes from restaurant menus. Great if you have metabolism of a 22 year old, but a constant struggle if you're older.","They've laid off people in Feb'17 so take all reviews (positive and negative) after that date with a pinch of salt. That includes this one of course.

A VERY bad place to start your career: There are no processes, no accountability, no planning. Until some guy with Agile experience joined our team, we didn't have daily standups, sprint reviews/retros etc. You'll learn everything that you should NOT do as a good developer when it comes to processes and soft-skills. No one's given any training on any topics, even free/internal-trainings are not encouraged. There are no team meetings at team or site level.

Stagnation in US: There were plans and promises of growth in Dallas, but then the strategy changed and they opened up office in India. Which is ramping up, at the same time as layoffs in US. Perhaps a good time to join the Indian or Mexican centers!

Bad management: A very senior manager said things like ""scr#w the unit tests"" and something to the effect ""deploy whatever we have to production, our bonuses are tied to it"" (that manager has been promoted twice and is now even more senior). He has multiple teams reporting to him, but he spends most of his time debugging some technical issues, and never held a team meeting. Things get delivered despite leadership, not because of. Most interactions he has with team are trying to find whose fault it was. It's never his. Right now team is struggling with very high number of bugs they were forced to deliver over last 1-2 years.
When CTO came to Dallas, during his inaugural tour, he was sleeping in the meetings.

Promotions: It's rare to see that managers receiving more promotions than junior team members. It's baffling while lay offs are ongoing. Every manager got one promotion, and some got 2 in a short span!

Cronyism and the Indian bias: This is subjective so I'll just state the facts. Half or more employees are Indian at this location and still during the layoffs there was only one Indian among some 10-12 that were laid off. Out of 5 engineering managers, two were not Indian, one was the laid off and the other quite shortly after.

Unlimited PTOs: It actually works the opposite of what they advertise, because you need your manager's approval.

Bait and switch: I have heard of multiple people hired with promises that they'll work on Golang and then they are made to work on other languages with zero exposure to Golang."

The corporate marketing pictures on Ooyala website seem cool, but most of the people shown in those pictures are no longer Ooyala employees.  These pictures certainly don't reflect the current status of Ooyala.  Over the past few months, some senior management in the US had abused their managerial power by letting go many talents and high performers, but at the same time, they gave personal favoritism to freeloaders by creating questionable job titles or redundant roles at company higher level.

Best part is they hire people very recently and when layoffs came, they mentioned that ""if you had observed the company's growth since you joined, you could have seen the layoffs coming"". 

Mr. Crafty/Dumb promotion-greedy manager: You shouldn't hire people when you know the company is going downhill. That is the first sign that could alert us of the company's failure. If you continue hiring, people will think that the company is doing fine.

As for the solutions team, I am not sure what was their role in the company at all. There were no significant growth in products, lot of flaws in the product architecture and no visible roadmap. 

And don't even get me started with the product scientist. One useless candidate, hogging the meeting rooms just to browse other products(mostly cosmetic based I presume).

Co-founder - People thought the only reason he sticks to this company when all other co-founders left was because he trusts the engineering team and its products. But he proved otherwise. The only time he seemed efficient in his moves was when attending meetings to kick people out of the company.

And there is a guy in the board of Telstra who successfully brought down Nokia when he was in Microsoft. That guy continues to do what he does best. Curbing down the next company - Ooyala. He is on a roll. This guy is bad news. Maybe companies have him on board to balance headcount and bring about re-orgs I guess.

No wonder few of the bright minds left well before the cut down foreseeing the future.

There is no future here. Its a hoax. Don't fall for it. Its a sinking ship through and through.

One last thing - I saw this line in the offer letter or the HR home page - ""We value our employees"". Hell you did! A terrible severance and horrible payroll term during layoffs. 

Please remove the above line from the offer letter and be honest. Tag it - ""We screw our employees for the bad decisions we make and we are proud of it!""."

Ooyala recently lost some of its best talent which either walked right out the door or were laid off.
The past year was spent focusing on products and customer retention but has done little to maintain customers or focus on product.

The morale is low not because everyone works from home, but because the product sucks and the customers are unhappy. The service teams spend 24/7 putting out fires with very little help in the organization. When a customer leaves no one understand why, but then blames it on the service teams, not on the products.

There was at one point excellent room for growth but with recent layoffs, and low-morale, you're expected to do your job and pretend it makes you happy. There is no middle management whatsoever to give you feedback on your job or work on developing your skills.

Product builds what they want to build, and not what the customers are asking for.

133,Ooyala,It really is good. REALLY.,2016-09-01,5.0,,"Very shocked to read all the recent bad reviews.
We are so spoilt in the office! Loads of food, drinks, snacks in the kitchen; ping pong table, playstation and other games (which not many people seem to be using).
The HR is not bad at all, and if anything she seems to care more than most (not sure what sort of hand-holding people expect). 
Reading the previous reviews I guess people don't like to change the status quo of not doing much and being paid good money. But the change is happening and it's a GOOD change. 
We are being challenged and should be happy to showcase our skills.
It's very strange to hear this criticism, when it was never voiced constructively.","London office is a bit disjointed, but I think it's improving (especially with people who were dragging us down now mostly gone). More effort should be put into making sure the people have the opportunity to integrate."
134,Ooyala,Haters gonna hate,2016-09-01,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Former employees who posted some of the recent reviews left Ooyala because they couldn't handle working in a bigger and fast growing company, people who never appreciated what HR is doing for them. The company is great, flexible working time, tons of food/fruits/booze in the kitchen, amazing Friday breakfasts and good people around. Good remuneration + bonuses. Work hard and you will be noticed and promoted. Good luck finding that elsewhere!",London office could be bigger and better equipped/designed. It's an EMEA headquarters but it's lacking the character.
135,Ooyala,A headless disaster,2016-08-30,1.0,Systems Ops,"Company prides itself on being 'cool'. Mostly flexable working. Coffee machines. Central location, it's right next to Covent Garden and near East side to Oxford Street.","A year into moving to the company no attempts by management or personnel to integrate. London personnel are self-serving and most staff feel un-included or out of place. Nepotism from management and especially human resource, they feel in league with each other. Promotions are behind closed doors, are announced without job even being advertised.

With our heads of the management leaving, chaos reigns. Those stepping up are poor. Decisions are made without reason. Communication is unobtainable luxury.

I don't understand why people are still here. Plenty of work in London."
136,Ooyala,A company with serious problems,2016-08-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"While the company overall and the London office in particular has deep-rooted problems, there are still some very dedicated people working there.

The money's good, although some would consider it hazard pay.","After a couple of mismanaged acquisitions, most of the management are clearly out of their depth.
Big projects have failed and customers been lost due to a lack of accountability and oversight.

People management is a disaster as skills and dedication are not recognised - especially if they make someone higher up look bad.

Career development opportunities are not on offer.
Even though the company is in desperate need of skills, it finds it easier to recruit from outside than to actively manage existing employees.

Much of the company's middle management seem to live in a dream world where these problems do not exist. No questions are ever asked when good people decide to leave.

The result is that many who actually do a good job have taken themselves elsewhere due to a lack of support and recognition.

Until these problems are actually acknowledged, there won't be any improvement."

continuous blackout and system failure and management doesnt know what going on and pressure enginers to fix but understaffed and too cheap to hire enough people
company has much politic and promote only few people to prevent them from leaving
much of code is patchy not good written and peope who write them leave and no documentation or very little
pay is much less than standard in silicon valley
old ceo left (looks like he is fired by parent company) and new ceo is not doing good job at get company back on track; company struggling big time but try to show itself as doing good
when you walk in building is very flashy and looks very fancy but when you work you see its illusion. It is sweat shop and lot of stress
management style is very micromanaging and even recently they lay off many people and also fire a few people and many other people quit.
Be careful of job advertisement is not true. They say something but you dont work on what they promise and not learn much because company care more to survive than care about individual employee success (for ex even if you say you interest to work on certain project or want to learn  management will put you where they choose and limit your growth big time

Besides feeling good for being a member of the winning team, it also brings great professional challenges.

Nothing better than constantly being challenged, in order to really enjoy work and keep growing as a pro!

Everything always boils down to people, and people at Ooyala are cream of the crop. I think it's safe to say that their hiring process is extremely good. What I also appreciate a lot is the level of transparency, and everyone's accessibility, as well as willingness to hear you out about anything.

The engineering team at the time was building great products and the company began to be perceived as a thought leader in the online video distribution space.","After some of the most talented early employees began to leave the company, it was then difficult to keep its momentum and continue to build solid products that added value to the online video ecosystem. The fact that it became a global brand, asked for much more processes than the ones that were in place at the time of that decision and made it harder to focus on its customers.

In order to cross this hurdle, the company brought along senior executives, who weren't necessarily old-fashioned but ended up hurting the company's culture and slowing down its ability to scale. Perhaps, it was an strategic move towards being acquired later on."

You may learn how to struggle with their unclear instructions, disorganized process, and unstructured business decision process. No wonder many talented people have left the company.

- Flawed cross-functional collaboration which is worsened by applying the Waterfall model hammer to almost everything.
- Top-down management making things sluggish and occasionally questionable.

We get unlimted time off, fully paid medical benefits , and lots of other benefits that are based on individual needs. The company really goes out of their way to make their employees happy and allow them to maintain a good work/life balance. There is lots of challenges across the board, so the job is always interesting and challenging. They promote innovation with hackathons and allow people to come up with new cool ideas through patents or future projects. They provide breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Most of the people are pleasure to work and interact with. Lots of people during the day are laughing or smiling while chatting together and everyone is working hard. They have a strong get stuff done attitude and allow people to arrive late or leave early if they are meeting all their deadlines. They also have some great managers that really empower and treat their employees well and with respect.  

They also proved and promote a very collaborative environment and hire really smart people who have no egos. This allows everyone to learn something new everyday and respect each other as employees.  HR is very down to earth and very much works hard to stay competitive. Salaries are competitive in the current market and are adjusted every year to make sure their employees are paid appropriately. If you get a promotion you can get a big raise, but even if you don't get prompt and your salary range increased, you will see a bump. They also give out quarterly bonuses based on performance.  The company is very much career and employee focused. If you don't like the role you are in and see one in the company that would be a better fit or want to try something new, then you can transfer, if that team has a role available.","There are some bad apples at the company that while smart have a very poor attitude towards other employees.

- Flexible work hours
- Ability to work with a variety of technologies","- While the industry and market space that Ooyala operates presents many challenges to the overarching business, the actual technical challenges seem to be concentrated to only a few spots. What used to be 'working with a bunch of smart engineers' seems more like 'working with a few lead engineers and a bunch of reliable code monkeys with an endless supply of duct-tape' now. 
- Cross-team gridlocks in engineering are very real.
- Career growth/progression can be questionable; Not many advancement opportunities. 
- Amount of technical debt/legacy code to maintain can be painful (depends on the team). 
- Engineering onboarding ranges from very bad to passable (varying on team). It can be frustrating."

They're usually very experienced and from good schools.  Many are very good at communicating and teaching.  You get to pick most of your own tech stack, and you're working on cool tools that can get you a nice salary bump when you move on to your next company (examples: Hadoop, Cassandra, EC2, Scala).

The work is varied because Ooyala does so many things with video and analytics, and it's interesting because every section of the company has hard problems to work on.

There are also good perks -- always-available snacks and soda, catered lunch and dinner every day, discount massages and sushi every other week.","Management doesn't know how to handle promotions for senior engineers.  Almost nobody makes Staff Engineer, while many, many become Tech Leads.  Does management *really* think that's because every senior engineer would rather be a manager?

The Ops (and DevOps/SRE) group is pretty screwed.  Executive management doesn't really care about fixing it, so it's been awful for years.  Most groups do some ops themselves but engineers aren't better at it.

2013 is a ""tighten the belt"" year.  Fair enough, it's time.  But still not as fun a time to join.  Some of the perks may go away."

Ooyala is really flexible with this so I think it's often the person not really making it known or communicating what they need. It's hard to say though because Ooyala tends to hire top-notch, dedicated, and hard workers. I guess that's why Ooyala has been a launch pad for entrepreneurs. A lot of people have started their own companies after Ooyala so I guess that's the benefit of hard work, even if you do work a little too hard sometimes."
