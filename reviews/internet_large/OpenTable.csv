Phone/Chat/Email For restaurants 


So far everyone has been pretty helpful. They are pretty understanding. I worked for about a week and had to leave for family emergency. Instead of firing me they let me join the next training class. 

Good schedule options, I currently have Sat, Sun, & Mon off. You can choose a 30min or 1hr lunch.","I work 10 hour shifts and only get 2, 15 min breaks and a lunch. Every other job I had has been 3, 15 min breaks per 10 hour shift. 

Training is 2 weeks then they put you on the floor. I honestly think training should be extended to 4 weeks! Its a lot of information to learn in 2 weeks and I think that's why half the class quits before the second week starts


Benefits are decent. No company perks other than a discount at 1 hotel in Miami, Fl

There is no Overtime. There is no Bonus Pay"
10,OpenTable,"great place to work, female CEO",2022-03-14,5.0,Lead Creative Producer,awesome people. opportunities for travel. flexible work from anywhere structure. great work life balance.,limited growth after the lead level on the individual contributor track. not as much innovation as other competitors in the industry.
11,OpenTable,Worst company I’ve worked for ever.,2022-03-12,1.0,Customer Service Representative (CSR),- nice snacks but that doesn’t make up for the cons,"- Incredibly low salary considering the amount of work done in the role.
- No support when you had a complexed issue and those with the task to help treaded you like an idiot
- When asking for additional training, always told to find time and do it myself when they never gave us time
- Lunch was half an hour and one 15 min break which if you went slightly over they gave you hell for even if you were unwell.
- Managers had their favourites and made that very obvious
- No opportunity for growth at all, only if you were a favourite 
- Harshly critiqued on calls if it took longer than 6 minutes without any context on how to improve or consideration of the fact it was more than one issue.
- Higher management give CSRs a hard time and expect a lot with NO reward for their efforts 
- People let go with no warning or reason. 
- Good people leaving because of how incompetent management were and never took on idea for change 
- Mangers Would tell others business that was given in privacy which I reported to HR and nothing was done."
12,OpenTable,Amazing company...,2022-03-10,5.0,Inside Sales Representative,Truly a people first company. Lots of perks and competitive salary!,Can't really think of any
13,OpenTable,"Great Start, New Opportunities",2022-03-10,5.0,Account Executive,The AE New Hire Training was very effective and helped prepare me for going into the field and start pitching to restaurant operators based in the anatomy of a sale at OT.,"No formal salesforce training to follow up the NHT. I was encouraged to get in the field and figure that out as it came. I reached out to some veterans on my team for help but that took a lot of time and was reactive. 
I have not attended/shadowed a veteran AE in their market to see time management, pipeline management, Forma management, or sales meetings drop-ins or calls. I am a hands on learner and think that I would stand to benefit greatly from going to someone else's market to see the model behavior. Right now OT is sending people to my market to watch me, which is good, but in my opinion backwards."

20,OpenTable,Doesn’t pay enough for the micromanaging to be worth it,2022-02-25,3.0,Customer Support Representative,"Mostly kind people working there
A good job for those who need a bit more professional experience","Micromanaged by all managers. Daily schedule was so precise it was hard to adhere to— adherence was also a metric used in assessments. 
Every action you do is timed and if you’re taking longer than they think you should, they will message you to basically tell you to go faster. It was excessive.
Remote for most of the pandemic but forced us to go into office July 2021.
Got hired on full time from contract and only got a 50 cent raise. Took on a ton more responsibility and didn’t receive any more compensation."
21,OpenTable,Work/Life Balance,2022-02-23,5.0,Senior Security Engineer,"- There is actually work/life balance here. I can adjust my schedule to accommodate my life outside of work. Kids, doctor's appts, home maintenance emergencies...no one ever gives me the side eye or a hard time. Ever. Plus, we get to work remotely from (almost) anywhere!
- I feel valued for my contributions to the company
- Benefits are commensurate with other tech companies
- I am encouraged to expand my knowledge, and given resources to do so
- I get to work on a variety of projects. It does not get boring.","- We could use some more people, but what company doesn't have that problem?"
22,OpenTable,Finance Dept - Would not recommend,2022-02-22,1.0,Collection Specialist,Office environment was ok before covid. They had lots of snacks and a nice office.,"One of the worst places I’ve worked!!! During my 2 years working at the Opentable LONDON FINANCE DEPARTMENT they had problems retaining staff. At one point there was a staff member leaving every month for over a year. The team was about 10 people. This was due to incompetence of management. They have had no training on how to deal with staff problems. The managers would play favourite with employees which causes resentment and frustration between staff. Management would also discuss personal matters of other employees which isn’t professional. I was always told “not to say anything” when told something about another employee. 

During the pandemic I had a family member pass away and needed to go back to my home country. The day I found out of my family members passing we were told in a meeting “you should be grateful to have a job during the pandemic and if you don’t like it then you should leave.” I reported staff bullying to HR and these comments but they seemed unbothered to fix the problem. I was asked to return in the height of the April 2021 lockdown even though HR had approved until June 2021 for me to stay. I feel this breached a duty of care they had towards me as an employee. 

Many staff have left due to bad management which is a recurring problem. Managers blame staff they are managing and there is no accountability of whether what is being reported to higher management is correct. Due to the team being reduced during covid and staff retention rates low, the workload was piled onto loyal employees who stayed, which caused a lot of stress. This then impacted their performance reviews at the end of the year as higher management saw it as underperforming. Managers were trying to persuade others feedback for them to be favourable so they received high bonuses. My attempts to ask for new staff members were always brushed off and was told to work harder. Career opportunities are non existent until someone leaves. 

Management change the direction of work constantly which makes it difficult and confusing to know which way to proceed and plan your day. I believe the higher management did not understand the EMEA market as they were based in the USA. The workload can be reduced by implementing changes but this was always blocked by management as they did not like trying new ideas. 

Would not recommend this place to work even if you are desperate for a job!!!"
23,OpenTable,"Overall happy, but don't lose your personality",2022-02-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Amazing coworkers
Historically has had a great culture","Many of the exec updates have made the company feel more KPI driven than people driven. Most OT people come from hospitality, and that was the life blood of the company culture. I don't think OT is a lost cause, but there is a very real struggle from pandemic burnout and a sense of overly ""corporate"" and impersonal trajectory for the culture."

30,OpenTable,Terrible management,2022-01-18,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Met some great people and social life was not bad,Lots of people that are institutionalised in the London office.

88,OpenTable,Micromanagement at the highest level,2021-03-20,1.0,Customer Service Representative (CSR),"- Decent people to work with.
- Decent pay for entry-level work.","- Micromanagement: expect every single thing you do to be monitored and under a microscope. Breaks are ridiculously short for call center work.
- You have to work weekends. No life/work balance at all.
- Politically infused: if you are not a liberal, be prepared to be ostracized for differing views. BLM and LGBTQ are forced upon you, despite your religious or personal beliefs. Diversity only applies to political agenda and nothing outside of it.
- Inappropriate conduct from supervisors; lack of professionalism in the work place.
- Limited mobility
- Biased, unclear and subjective assessments on employee performance based on ""Pillars of Excellence"". No room for authenticity or personal creativity, but required to conform.
- Poor communication from supervisors
- Expect to experience burnout from a steady influx of angry customers."

114,OpenTable,A slow speed crash and burn,2020-11-18,1.0,Customer Support Representative,"The only pro is that due to OpenTable's size and foothold in their industry there are so many employees that some of them are cool. That's it. Same as you would get at any company with hundreds of employees. 

If you want to think of this as a pro: it used to be a great company to work for. Two CEOs ago. When they cared about being a good employer. Long time ago.","Short version: the highest level of micromanagement at any company.

Well, the company has gone through three CEOs in as many years. That says a lot about how the company operates. 

Along with those changes, and specific to the Support organization, the top-down leadership of OpenTable Support, almost entirely white middle-aged men, is cold, callous, ineffectual, divisive, and worst of all phony. 

That's probably the most insidious thing that I could advise you about. Like a lot of tech companies OpenTable can roll out a great red carpet: they have sodas/coffee, there's a lounge with video games, they're spending a lot of money during and just before Covid hit to build out a new office. Not dissimilar from an abusive parent who attempts to buy your love. 

The senior leadership (VP, Directors, Managers) can make small inoffensive gestures to make the people feel well taken care of, or feel heard, in shortsighted unimportant ways. The management team will talk at length about this ineffable, indescribable ""*magic* that happens when we're all in a room together"" as an excuse to bring people back into offices as soon as localities allow, totally disrespecting the fact that the Support organization's low-level rooms aren't actually given any agency to positively affect a single thing. That magic might exist in engineering rooms, or product management rooms. It doesn't exist at OpenTable in Support rooms. We just follow a script.

OpenTable Support follows a ""coaching"" system. However a more accurate name for it would be a micromanagement system. Higher up employees on the team like the Senior CSRs and Supervisors might try to convince you that they welcome creativity, however any creativity that you're allowed is under such tight scrutiny, and requiring such a high level of conformity that to call it creativity is nonsense. Let's be explicit about what this ""coaching"" system is, particularly as it is the biggest determination into promotions, advancement, and raises. A person on a QA team randomly selects a single case that you worked in a week, grade it for conformity to their system, and then report that single case per week to your manager so they can coach you on what you did wrong. Many of these categories are highly subjective and very little recognition is paid toward what you did right. If you get a single thing wrong within a category the entire category is marked as not having been met. 

At the end of the year virtually your entire raise is based on conformity to this system. 52 randomly selected cases. How many cases you worked doesn't really matter. CSAT scores, creative problem solving, deep dives into highly sensitive or more time consuming cases, all that has no bearing. Just conformity to their system. The Pillars of Excellence.

I strongly advise against you taking a position at OpenTable's Support team unless it's just a brief stopover on your way to a bigger and better things."

127,OpenTable,"Confused company, super confused leaders",2020-08-16,2.0,Manager,"OpenTable Mumbai has one of the best, modern design, awesomely decorated offices in India. It is centrally located, provides standing desks, has a decent snack and happy hour policy. (All of the above is negated due to wfh in covid times, their heavy investment has become dead)
Each employee is provided with a Mac and multiple monitors at work, so facilities are good.
Work life balance is good in Operations as one is required to operate only during IST hours. One does not get disturbed out of office hours. Alerts out of office hours are handled by different offices in other countries in their timezone.
The work atmosphere is casual, people are free to walk upto any other employee in the company and talk to him/her. People are generally helping and mind their own business.
Lots of tools, technologies and processes which can be a good ground for learning. Open source is encouraged, code is open for reading. No work is big or small here, if you can fix it or improve, take ownership and do it (don’t expect any rewards though). One will also find a lot of legacy tech.","Mumbai Ops is a small team, less than 10 members, hence limited scope to grow in the long term. Better to plan for 3-4 years with the company (3 year stock vesting).
Compensation looks attractive on paper with bonus and stocks. The bonus calculation is so complicated that even the best of chartered accountant can’t decipher the amount you will receive. The stock amount is greatly reduced due to tax deductions, transaction surcharges and dollar conversion fees. The company calls the stocks as “golden handcuffs” and uses it to its advantage. When you leave the company (or laid off or kicked out), the stocks would be forfeited. “Salary correction” is a forbidden word. Compensation changes during annual reviews never matches with your effort and ratings (at least I haven’t seen for myself or for my team in the 4 years I worked here).
The company is almost 22 years old, hence has its share of old products, tools and technologies. They are trying hard to give up legacy systems, but the progress has been extremely slow (and frustrating).
The company has a big share of people who are with them for more than a decade, golden handcuffed, happy and content in their positions.
The organisation is engineering/product driven and operations always takes a backseat. This blocks introduction of new tools, technology or even upgrading new ones. Sometimes, the legacy mindset of the leaders also comes into play.
Managers are treated as God, you can’t question manager’s decision, especially during review ratings and compensation changes. The HR team, called as “People and Culture” team, is a dumb spectator and sides with the company leads. The People and Culture team is only visible while preparing the job offer letter and non existent afterwards.
Although the office infrastructure is great, of late, the culture has been going down. They’ve invested heavily in sprucing up the office (spent unnecessarily and extravagantly), but not ready to invest in their own people. Inspite of good efforts, performance and receiving a good annual rating, many (including in tech) were handed a pink-slip due to “business decision” and were unceremoniously kicked out (during covid time 400+ were kicked out). This act showed the true character of the company (and its leaders). The company has shown that this will be the culture going forward (substandard hiring and firing at will)."

I worked on many good tech and legacy products and tried improving the tech stack.","The hard work done here is not appreciated nor recognized. The management takes the team here for granted. I was stressed with work at odd hours and support calls. The management took my late hours work for granted. Market corrections never happened although role and work kept changing. New hires were provided higher pay and better stocks for the same role. I left the org as I was not managed well, not paid well. Many other team members in the Mumbai office have the same complain, we get no appreciation, taken for granted, the compensation not worth our efforts. Many senior members and managers are with the company for 10+ years, hence they are little old school, enjoy legacy (read they have pile of stocks and nothing to do), they do not take polished decisions which is hurting the company (infra and tech stack is old and people under are not happy)."

They usually have teams a fifth the size of the same teams at similar companies. It usually results in a lot of overtime, stress and cut corners. On the other hand, the scope of the work is comparatively limited, so it's somewhat manageable.

Leadership is conservative in their decision-making. They do not like to make big gambles, but given OpenTable is a market leader, that's not uncommon. They're also well aware of their position.

Their tertiary benefits tend to pale in comparison to other companies (e.g. lunches, snacks, amenities). You pay for lunch on your own dime and the company rarely provides catered lunch."

*There are some great people that still work at OpenTable.","Here’s the truth. OpenTable is a 20 y/o company with not much going on. Do your research, you’ll see most of the reviews say very similar things.

*Departments don't work well together. While there are only a handful of company objectives, teams seems to still have their own agenda and are not aligned.
*It gets boring and redundant. You’re given specific things to work on and that’s all you do. It’s not scrappy, things do not move quickly.
*There used to be fun happy hours and company events. These no longer exist.
*Really bad leadership. There is a lack of creativity, inspiration, and empathy from leaders. This could be because they are not getting clear direction themselves, but this is a problem.
*Limited growth (unless you’re really good at playing the political game) and few opportunities to learn new skills.
*It’s very political. Whatever Kayak wants, Kayak gets. The OpenTable leaders will bend over backwards to make sure it happens.
*Lack of excitement. Ever since the Kayak integration, there has been a big drop in morale. It’s been almost a year now, and the morale is still very low.
*There is no OpenTable CEO currently. There are two OpenTable leaders who both report into the Kayak CEO. This could explain why Kayak is so highly favored and why many employees at OpenTable are in the dark."

169,OpenTable,Wasn't great,2019-04-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Offices have free snacks and soda/tea/etc. 
-Plenty of happy hours and other alcohol-related events, which are fun if you're into that sort of thing. Over time, the happy hours and constant drinking seem sad, and a way for people to forget how unhappy they are at work.
-Great coworkers. For the most part, everyone is very nice and some close friendships are formed. 
-Flexible work schedules.","Where to begin. This company is going downhill fast. It's a bad sign when HR is so busy processing termination notices, they lose track of whether you are an active employee or not. Here are some notable cons:
-- Zero room for growth: this is mentioned in many other reviews. The only real possible movement (if you do manage to move) is lateral. It has become much harder to even move laterally as the company has been turning permanent roles into temporary ones to save $$$ (another blow to employee morale) - so if you decide to take the role, you lose your benefits. Promotions are very hard to get and are given out seemingly randomly.
-- Exec team: the entire exec team is completely clueless as to what the 'low level' employees actually do. They set unrealistic goals that any employee at 'ground level' could tell you are not feasible. When the goals aren't met, they come up with half-baked excuses as to why and then proceed to replace them with new, equally ridiculous goals. They sent out a survey to employees to gauge employee satisfaction and work culture. Needless to say the results of that survey were never disclosed.
--The job itself: OpenTable used to be proud of hiring the best and the brightest. They don't hire that way anymore, simply because the job doesn't require it. It is boring, repetitive, and anyone can do it after a couple weeks of training. Goals are increased every quarter so that you have to keep doing the same thing more quickly and more often. I've seen people go from enthusiastic and excited for their OpenTable journey to de-motivated and jaded within a span of 6 months. There is no end is sight and the job will only continue to get worse and more automated. It's a bad sign when the average length of employment of the people on your team goes from 5-7 years down to 1 year (no joke). People are quitting faster than they can hire. Many people still at the company are just sticking around until they find something else.

OpenTable will never be the fun, start-up-like company it once was. Ever since the Booking Holdings takeover and now being put under the umbrella of Kayak, the company is a shell of its former self. My advice, if you decide to start working there: stay for a year max and take advantage of the flex time to work on pursuing the career you actually want. Because your career won't be here."

The Denver office has it's own feel for culture and atmosphere and it's absolutely a silo to HQ in San Fran, which can be a pro and con, depending on how you see it. They encourage you learn and grow, have great benefits like the ecopass. I also really enjoyed the collaboration between tech and support.","Even though they encourage everyone to learn and grow, growing within the company seems a bit hard.  Especially for support members. They also have a very rigid attendance policy and there were a couple (not all) people in leadership positions that were truly insensitive to human problems and seemed to only care about hitting stats and measurements than making sure their staff is okay!
As I mentioned above, the denver office most times gets the shorter end of the stick. There were many times I remember needing to speak to account managers or sales rep in SF and they weren't available because apparently they get happy hours and half days, while we are getting yelled at for a mistake or miscommunication that happened on their part. Also, because they don't have support teams in SF, they rolled out new campaigns, features and beta runs sometimes without letting the support team know this was happening and we'd get pissed off customers calling in about a feature we had no idea was already available, talk about lack of departmental communication. Also, if you are hired for any of their bilingual departments be ready to either translate or create new processes, they are still figuring it all out."

I always felt I had the resources I needed to succeed.  Direct leadership has always been supportive and never felt micromanaged.  The best part of Opentable is the employees.  Some of the most supportive, collaborative, and encouraging people I've met.","I started having issues with Opentable when the company reorganized their field operations program.  I was in the field but decided to move to a remote role when the company reorganized, and when doing so I definitely pigeon holed myself with no optimistic career path.  The company is focusing their remote central queue in Denver and so if you do not live there it will be difficult to move up in the organization.  

Another qualm I have is that when I became a remote employee, I feel as though I was restricted to duties that just became super repetitive and unfulfilling.  Before the org change, I felt empowered in my position,felt I had variety, and was able to work cross functionally.  I have spoken with many of my coworkers who voice similar issues with the dullness of our job duties.  Its hard to stay motivated and excited when you do the same thing over and over again day after day. 

I think it is telling that when I started at OT over 2 years ago the Glassdoor rating was around 4.3 and now we are sitting at 3.8.

Good benefits and PTO program. I feel more valued here than I have at any other call center I've worked at and certainly more at my last job. There is minimal push to hit prefixed stats, so it's quality before quantity, which is refreshing.","Grossly underpaid for the level of technical expertise and vast and varied system knowledge required. The ""top down"" management style creates more problems than it can solve. Departments do not seem to be educated on what the others departments do. Some departments have no appreciation for the people (ie, look down upon) on the front line at the call center. Certain programs are just broken and need a make over. Only a couple of supervisors have experience with OpenTable, thus leaving the rest unable to support and up-train their team adequately. Likewise, training is provided by a good guy, but  who has minimal exposure and experience with the products. The opportunities to excel in new endeavors or roles seem shrouded at best."

Working on a team that often utilizes freelancers and contractors, I am embarrassed at how long it takes for those individuals to be paid the money they were promised, over 7 months in some cases. The management and HR teams seem to move particularly slow in matters like this. The company claims the usual platitudes of ""moving fast"" being ""thought leaders"" but the reality is that the petty ego-wars that middle management wage against each other keep anything interesting from actually happening at OpenTable."

MOST people are kind & work/life balance is great. Location is convenient to public transport & food options. There's also lots of flowing booze & costumes if you're into that.","Unstrategic, unfocused, & inefficient - Absolutely the worst place I've ever worked on these attributes. We're desperately trying to prove our worth post-acquisition, doing too many things & doing all of them poorly. Unfocused strategy along with general inefficiency across the board = a bunch of chickens running around with their heads cut-off.

Highly political, where who you knows & who you suck up to is rewarded. ""Yes"" people are favored over those that question. Directors & above only focus on managing upwards vs. inspiring & leading teams below. People subtly fight for more power, people, & budget, by spinning stories with data to meet their needs & self-interests, instead of putting the interests of others & the business first. 

Lots of churn of great people leaving frustrated with the environment."

Not clique-ish. Smart engineers everywhere. Well paying for Los Angeles . Great office.,A lot of legacy tech still exists which needs to be maintained.

257,OpenTable,"Great folks, but overall mediocre",2016-11-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The best part about OpenTable is the company culture and the people.  Your colleagues are approachable and a delight to work with on a day-to-day basis.  The company also throws fun happy hours and parties to allow you to get to know your colleagues and enjoy each other's company.

The company's products and future vision is much more practical and well-defined under Christa's leadership.","The company is very cheap.  The systems are severely outdated, which creates a lot of manual work.  Efficiency is not a priority and never discussed.  The common complaints to why the company does not have the basic necessities is ""it's not in the budget."" I imagine this is because the Priceline Group examines every single penny the company is spending.

Growth opportunities and promotions are determined closely linked to how close you are with your manager rather than merit.  Despite making repeated cases for a promotion or a growth plan, your manager holds the key to whether you get to move up or have the support to foster growth in your role.  This is quite a contradictory vision given that the People & Culture team emphasizes how much employee growth matters, but the team does absolutely nothing to enforce this.  The company also needs to invest in mandatory manager training (again - cheap!) to establish some sort of uniformity.  A lot of folks have moved into manager or team lead positions who have not managed teams before because of high turnover rates the company experienced in 2014 and 2015.

Compensation and benefits are severely below market.  My salary is 50%+ higher at my new company for the same role.  The company is very far from being competitive from other bay area tech companies."

 OT also chose to close a branch office (the one I worked at) with no real investigation into the work that we did. Then proceeded to wait until the last week of our employment to actually care about transition. (At which point they panicked)

The conglomerate (Priceline Group owns OpenTable, each with their own CEOs), didn't work. It might be a failure to communicate, but having two CEOs on top of a board and shareholders felt like it stifled innovation, but having too many layers of approval and blame caused nothing to happen."

The current management in place isn't trusting employees, which is tragic because there are a lot of talented folks here. Instead of delegating, management is being more hell-bent on instituting rigid processes that everyone needs to fall into line with versus actually managing the people, knowledge, and skillsets they have working under them. Classic case of a medium-sized company bloating itself into an inhumane corporation. Process has become more important than results, which puts OpenTable in an odd position because there's definitely a sense that the Priceline Group (which bought OpenTable) has become increasingly frustrated that their recent acquisition isn't producing results fast enough."

Beyond our amazing products for restaurants and diners, what makes OpenTable special is the people. We are absolutely a company of foodies who work hard and eat well -- often at the same time. There's always someone to grab lunch with, terrific healthful snacks for employees, and treats from colleagues' latest travels on Steakman's (Yes, we have a bar in our marketing department!). There's a new focus on professional development and there are always opportunities to broaden your skill set if you're willing to take on new challenges. Management puts a true emphasis on work-life balance, and the company regularly celebrates team and individual accomplishments. Volunteering is important as the company values giving back -- and those outings are typically followed by great food and drink! There's a great deal of transparency around company goals, which I appreciate. And, as a diner and former restaurant professional, I really love the service and the product so it's incredibly cool to work for a brand you actually believe in.","The growth we've achieved has definitely been accompanied by changes, and they haven't always been effortless to navigate -- when you staff up dramatically, for example, it can be hard to establish solid career paths.

297,OpenTable,Great work life balance + culture,2015-11-16,5.0,Software Engineer Intern,"I had an incredible experience at OpenTable! I had a lot of opportunities to choose +/ work on exciting individual projects that led me to believe that I was making an actual impact - meanwhile I also had a lot of help from fellow engineers + my manager whenever I needed it. At no point did I feel like I was doing pointless work. Lots of lovely, clever people. Great work life balance i.e don't expect to work for more than 8-9 hours. Location is perfect if you love the city. Also - as it shouldn't surprise you, people here are foodies! They love to wine and dine at good places. It's also an exciting time to be at OpenTable because it's growing a lot.",Not the most hip tech company - overall employees are a little older than expected. (although I believe they are working on hiring more new grads + the HR team is working hard on bringing in that hip vibe).
298,OpenTable,"Not quite what it used to be, but still a great place to work",2015-11-05,4.0,Lead Software Engineer,"Lots of smart people working on some pretty cool projects. Move towards SOA definitely opened up a lot of opportunities for learning within engineering.
Pretty open collaboration with minimal stonewalling between teams.
Most people are passionate and energized by the product roadmap.","Not many advancement opportunities for individual contributors. Over time, as team leads grew into Directors, members of technical staff only got to senior level, and senior got to principal.
Relatively flat reporting structure worked great up to a certain size, but at some point the company outgrew it.
Until recently, comps were not keeping up with the market, and new-hires (some through acquisitions) were coming in with inflated titles and packages. This also significantly diluted the culture."
299,OpenTable,Data Science Intern,2015-10-15,4.0,,"Small team, smart people, interesting work",The higher management is not very clear since priceline has taken over. Many things are rapidly changing inside of the company.

301,OpenTable,"Many Opportunities, Many Challenges",2015-10-02,4.0,Software Engineer,"Awesome, well loved, product.  I love to tell people where I work. Smart co workers.  Lots of opportunity.  Fun technical challenges.","Opentable is in a somewhat tricky spot.  It owns it's space, but it also needs to grow into new areas.  The focus has been too much on growth at the expense of the core business.  Some teams have too few concrete deliverables, others have far too many."
302,OpenTable,Exciting growth...,2015-09-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"OpenTable has a fantastic brand and a healthy, mature work environment.  Now part of the Priceline group, they are investing big in growing the product, content and global footprint of the company.  Its an exciting time at OpenTable as we go through the next faze of growth.",There are some growing pains as we go from late stage startup to post acquisition maturity.
303,OpenTable,Best.Job.Ever.,2015-09-14,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"This is, hands down, the best job I have ever had in my life. I hope to make this a permanent, lifelong career.

- Fun, friendly, supportive company culture
- Excellent pay and benefits
- Lots of autonomy
- Perfect work/life balance
- Hard work pays off well with bonuses and promotions
- Opportunity for travel
- Work with some of the best Chefs/restaurateurs in the world",The only down side to working for OpenTable is that it would be impossible to find another job as good in the future if I ever had to.
304,OpenTable,Cheap,2015-09-04,2.0,Software Engineer,Technologies used are up to date.  Flexibility in choosing technologies to solve problems.  Convenient location.,Business does not value employees.  Resistance to providing meaningful benefits/perks for employees (cheap).  Management seems incompetent.
305,OpenTable,Excellent place to work,2015-08-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The culture is wonderful.  Employees are respectful of one another and always willing to help out when needed.  While we may not get free lunch, we do get an endless supply of snacks and soda (please don't take the soda away!).  I don't mind not getting free lunch.  This makes me go outside and try the delicious places around the Financial District.",Would be great to have benefits that align with our restaurants.  Like vouchers to go out to eat!
306,OpenTable,Engineering,2015-08-20,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very fast pace company, a lot of learnings",You can do many tasks and responsibilities but no title and compensation changing
307,OpenTable,Restaurant Relations Manager,2015-08-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Benefits, equity, fair salary & bonus, work from home, monthly allowances/expenses (cell phone, internet, gas mileage, parking, etc.), build your own schedule.","Recognition from upper management, unclear goals in particular role at times"
308,OpenTable,Fun company!,2015-08-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Good culture and great people.,Company is going through a lot of changes right now.  Sometimes things feel disorganized.
309,OpenTable,"Quality of Life, Great Benefits, Room to Grow with the Company",2015-08-17,5.0,Account Manager,"All that restaurant experience does not have to go to waste! I used to think after leaving restaurants for quality of life that my only options would be in wine/liquor sales, Adams Burch, etc. At OpenTable, that experience is a major plus! Additionally, you get much better quality of life with many positions working at least part time at home. 
The company is consistently looking to advance, expand & develop. With that comes a lot of opportunities. And you certainly won't be bored doing the same thing day in and day out- there are always new developments, products, and processes. It's nice to have a job that has just the right amount of challenges. 
The benefits and compensation and great. This is a company I see myself staying with for a very long time.","Because most employees outside of the home office in San Francisco are remote employees, those positions don't see their colleagues as often as you might see them in a traditional office job. This isn't necessarily a negative- it's more of a personal preference from person to person. You do need to have self motivation and self discipline to be successful in a remote position."
310,OpenTable,The best career move I have ever made!,2015-08-13,5.0,Account Executive,"There are so many pros to working for OpenTable.   The opportunity to work with some of the best, talented, and knowledgeable hospitality professionals makes the workspace enjoyable and  gratifying.  In addition, OpenTable offers  upward mobility, career growth, international expansion, all with a Team of people that serve the same purpose.","We are growing so fast, you have to dedicate a portion of your day to keep up!"
311,OpenTable,"great culture, talented people",2015-08-13,4.0,,"I love telling people I work for OpenTable. Most people tell me they love OpenTable, and they use it all the time. I work with some extremely smart people who challenge me every day. There's plenty of opportunity for growth at this company, and even offer valuable tools to help guide you along your career path. I never feel left in the dark as communication and transparency at this company are highly valued. The people at this company are professional, easy-going, intelligent, innovative, and hilarious.","As far as I'm aware, our bonuses are in the form of RSU's. There are no extra bonuses on top of that. However, the RSU's are fair, in my opinion. In terms of salary, I can only speak to my own, but I believe for the amount of work I put in I should be compensated more than what I'm receiving as of now. This company pays based off of market salary (and they put in a whole lot of research in order to pay their employees fairly), but I believe going above and beyond and showing extreme dedication to your work should be honored."
312,OpenTable,Great people,2015-08-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The group of people are some of the best you will come across. The job is not without challenges, but is fun (must dine out often to become a trusted expert) and the people make it all worth while.","Once the company became public, the dynamic changed a bit. There was considerably more pressure for results, and it became challenging to continue to expand at that pace. Good problems!"
313,OpenTable,A great company to work for,2015-08-11,5.0,District Manager,"The culture at OpenTable is one that other companies often try to imitate but fail to do so, OpenTable has an organic culture where employees are absolutely engaged, work hard are committed yet are rewarded and looked after extremely well. There really is a work hard, play hard ethic. Senior management share their vision with staff and engage them in the same philosophy - this transparent culture gets all staff motivated and hungry to contribute and succeed. 

Despite being part of the larger Priceline group and being 17 years old, OpenTable still maintains that hungry, .com start-up feel to it. It's exciting, fast paced and everybody feels they are part of something big.",Honestly? I can't think of any!
314,OpenTable,Great Company,2015-08-11,5.0,Account Executive,"Positive work environment, above average pay for London, great products and innovative, strong management team.",Holiday time could be improved. It seems below average for EU standards.
315,OpenTable,Great company,2015-08-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Worthy mission, great products, excellent bonuses and compensation program. A fantastic place to work.","Some growing pains, to be expected with such fast expansion."
316,OpenTable,"Great company to work for, but jobs are underpaid.",2015-08-09,4.0,,Work in a fun environment at a fast growing company. Working in a smaller company allows for lots of cross-functional interaction.,Get paid 15-25k less than industry standards. This is such a great place to work but I'm afraid that employees will continue to leave for equivalent roles elsewhere that pay significantly more.
317,OpenTable,I love it here,2015-08-03,5.0,,"The exec staff 'gets it', and empowers employees to constantly strive to make our company, employees, products, and customers excel! 
We also have snacks!","Parking is expensive near the office, but there is plenty of public transportation"
318,OpenTable,Fun but crazy,2015-07-29,4.0,,The people who work for OpenTable are awesome.  The company culture is really fun.  Things are ever-changing so you never get bored.,"While the company culture is fun, it's pretty wild and can be overwhelming or intimidating for some.  They pick new ""company initiatives"" like they're picking socks in the morning and then drop them as soon as something else comes up.  This makes it difficult to feel accomplished when you can't finish what you started."
319,OpenTable,Great place to work,2015-07-15,5.0,Business Analyst,"Fantastic place to work. Creative people. Focused but relax attitude of the organization towards it's aims and deliverables. Helpful and fun loving people. Ramping up on new technologies recently. Growing greatly post the Priceline acquisition. 
Non work related : In the heart of downtown San Francisco. A billion food places around. Great compensation and flexible work hours. No one is overworked (except occasionally close to deadlines)","If you don't live in the city then you gotta take the BART/Caltrain. Parking around is extremely expensive. (I have heard that) annual increments are smaller. Little space for vertical growth. Some technologies that are being used are old, but they know that and are working to upgrade."
320,OpenTable,"Great Company, Great People, Great Products!",2015-07-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,OpenTable is a great place to work.  We have a very dynamic and growing company with a lot of exciting initiatives coming up.  I am very passionate about our products and the value they deliver to our restaurants and diners.  We build great systems and we have a lot of fun doing it.  I also love the culture.  It's fun coming to work each day and working with people across all of our departments.  There is a sense of 'family' here and everyone is willing to help others out when they need it.  I believe in the company and the direction we are moving.  I also believe we have a lot of challenging and fun opportunities ahead of us!  Go OpenTable!!!!,"The company is growing at a very rapid pace.  Although some might find that challenging, others see that as opportunity to work on new projects, new technologies, and to meet new people."
321,OpenTable,Awesome place,2015-07-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,People! The atmosphere in the office is great. It is a place where it is a good thing to be a bit crazy and speak your ideas because most likely someone will listen.,If you are shy person you might feel intimidated but the recruitment team seems to do great job hiring people who fit the picture.
322,OpenTable,A company you can stand behind,2015-06-29,4.0,,"The biggest thing for me is that OpenTable is a company I can stand behind. I love the culture, the values and the fact that we do business with integrity. This company is really fun, it is definitely work hard play hard. There is a lot of opportunity in various departments for advancement and there are definitely perks to working at OpenTable like getting to rub elbows with amazing Chefs and Restaurateurs and incentive trips for high performers. Personal fan of the PTO schedule and the benefits plan.","The biggest con I can point out is that salary increases are few and far between. Great company but it is really difficult to work so hard and not feel like you are being paid what you are worth. I think if that issue was solved, there would be no reason to ever look outside for opportunities."
323,OpenTable,"Great Company, great culture",2015-06-19,5.0,Restaurant Operations Consultant,"Main thing I like about OpenTable is the culture and the people that work there. With every job there are people who are not your ""favorites"" but I've found for the most part that's the exception to the rule. Most of the people who work for OpenTable come from the same industry (restaurants and hospitality) so there is that common bond of experience.","There are times I've found that some departments don't fully realize or utilize the wealth of knowledge. Over the past few months this has gotten better, but it still needs some work."
324,OpenTable,"Great Culture, Great People!",2015-06-18,5.0,Sales,"OpenTable's company culture is its biggest attribute. A lot of companies boast ""great culture"" but OpenTable really delivers. From offering amazing opportunities to connect with other employees and learn more about our industry (I've gotten to ride snow mobiles, attend VIP culinary events, and have enjoyed countless team dinners at top tier restaurants) to making sure great leadership is in place at every level, OpenTable really walks the walk as far as culture.

I really believe that great culture and success at every level trickles down from the top and we have the greatest CEO and executive staff. I am a mid-level employee and I've gotten to meet and talk with all of the company leaders. How many people can say that?  They are all down-to-earth and don't see themselves as ""above"" anyone. It's very much a ""we're-all-in-this-together"" mentality. People are rewarded on performance, sure, but also for providing solid customer service and coming together to make great changes.","I work in a smaller office and though we've grown a lot over the past few years, I wish it would speed up even more and there would be more opportunities for career growth without having to move to another city."
325,OpenTable,I keep hoping things improve.,2015-06-17,2.0,Software Engineer,"Extremely great work-life balance, and I'm almost shocked to read other's who wrote that as a con. Most of the employees in SF have families and tend to leave around 6pm every day. 

Almost all my colleagues are super friendly and great to work with. Plus, we're all foodies! I've never found so many great places to eat in the city than during my time here at OpenTable.

There's a lot of passion for making the best restaurant experience. Everyone from the bottom of the company really believes in the mission.","With that said, where do I begin with the cons? First off, the CEO is hardly around and makes bizarre low-level decisions without entrusting of his direct reports.

Another exec is completely out of touch with their org other than a couple projects that interest them. This makes communication a gigantic hurdle and employee promotions a struggle.

Another team came in from an acquisition with an *extremely* toxic employee who insults everyone around them causing stress and damaging to the culture and still manages to get praised by the exec team.

We have a very tiny budget for anything that increases employee happiness. Only a few employees have standing desks, and there's only a couple boxes of fruit for 400+ employees, and we share low quality Costco sugar snacks. The office manager does care about this problem, but there's little they can do given the unreasonable constraint on budget."
326,OpenTable,Great company to work for,2015-06-17,5.0,Inside Sales Representative,"Great work environment, no micro managing, can self direct, flexible schedules, stocked kitchen, beer fridge, commission pay generally reflects your efforts, good benefits and FUN people. Our team generally enjoys being around each other and are friends in and out of the office. When you have fun at work, it shows in your work.",Base pay could be a little higher
327,OpenTable,Love the engineering culture!,2015-06-12,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Tons of hard interesting engineering problems here - they are working on Mesos infra (on AWS), Spark cluster. The web teams use node.js. Most of the backend stuff is in Java/Scala - play framework/node/Clojure. They have some legacy code in C# but they are moving away from it (no one is really ""porting"" the code), teams are building new products which is replacing old products over time.","None for now, enjoy working here. Scale is not as massive compared to other consumer web companies in social media or web in terms of user data or activity. But its still fun to work here."
328,OpenTable,OpenTable is Passionate and Inspired,2015-05-29,5.0,Account Manager,"I've never worked for a better company.  The culture and people we work with, the industry we serve, and the constant forward motion makes OpenTable a special career opportunity.  I believe I'm constantly growing and learning professionally, and the leadership, top down, is inspired and driven.  The company has a strong ethos of doing what's right for employees, consumers, and our restaurant partners while making smart and focused business decisions.  It's an amazing place to push your career.   OpenTable is also a very fun place to work!  Company parties, events, off-sites, competitions, and accolades keep us motivated and growing.  Lastly, OpenTable is as interested in personal growth as my professional growth and respects the work-life balance which is important to me. I consider myself very fortunate to have landed at OpenTable!",Is a company that is too much fun a negative? :)
329,OpenTable,Passionate about food? Love building relationships?,2015-05-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Come join our team! I've been an employee for over 10+ years now, and I've yet to have a dull moment at work. Even as a remote employee the communication level has been on par as to if I was work in corporate. We have a great culture, with a team dedicated from top-down in leading with innovation in internal and external products, employee development, and ideas sharing. Every year we have many social events that bring employees together from around the world were we learn, share, suggest on new ways to advance our organization into the future. Oh and we have lots of fun while doing so. On a daily basis I get to meet new restaurant people, and I think they are the glue to our economy and are probably the hardest working people in any industry. Come and be a part in a company that has great technology, great people and great food for an ultimate well rounded employee experience.",Career advancement for a remote employee could be quicker
330,OpenTable,Great Company!,2015-05-28,5.0,Account Executive,"I know it is cliche, but the people are the best part of the job. At OpenTable there is a work life balance and a creative culture that welcomes feedback. There are opportunities to travel and try new things.  If you like to eat, drink and enjoy an ever changing field in technology, OpenTable is the company for you.","OpenTable is constantly growing and innovating so if fast paced environment isn't your thing, this may not be a good fit.  There is usually travel required and depending on your position or region, you may go long periods of time without seeing other OpenTable employees.  If you need a team atmosphere there are positions where that is possible, however for a lot of us there is a lot of solo time."
331,OpenTable,Senior Account Executive,2015-05-28,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Great culture, environment and people. Work from home.",Work from home also has its disadvantages such as not seeing co-workers as much as you would like. 401k is also not good.
332,OpenTable,"Great people, great products, but needs work",2015-05-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people here rock!  Very intelligent people here who are always willing to share what they know with you. Some managers make an effort to and take pride in developing their direct reports.  You get lots of opportunities to learn about and engage with different teams across the company (e.g., engineering, finance, marketing) and see how all these teams combined make OpenTable function.  Great company culture - people are easy to get along with, which helps to forge great relationships.","Outdated & Old Systems: The company has grown rapidly over the past couple years.  Management has prioritized growth on the front end, but has provided very little support to back end employees, who are critical to OpenTable's day to day function.  The inefficiencies that old systems present make it hard for back end employees to do their jobs.  Management does not seem to be sensitive of their needs. 
Compensation / Benefits / Perks: No cool perks compared to other tech companies.  Compensation and benefits are not competitive to market or other tech companies, even though the company advertises itself as such. Bonuses are only given to certain teams when other teams equally deserve them.  Only senior managers and executive staff members seem to get promotions.  This makes a lot of hard working employees with great talent feel unappreciated."

It doesn't feel hierarchical at all, everybody is so approachable and most people are truly passionate about what they do and why they are here. We have many foodies and love that our business bridges tech and hospitality.","Sometimes it feels that the people that scream the loudest, will also get rewarded faster and the people that work hard, do a great job and wait for recognition or progression are forgotten, as they haven't screamed and stomped their foot loud enough."

They have a clear-cut vision and set of goals for growth.,"During my time and since my time, the CEO keeps breaking up the operations department.  He breaks it into pieces shuffling each component under a different VP.  Then when a decrease in morale and productivity is noticed, he combines them back.  Then breaks them up again.  Across the org, though, there seem to be several exec changes that make it difficult to keep up."

This is definitely the OpenTable culture. People are nice but like to go after opportunities and results. Work hard/play hard culture. Solid compensation and benefits. Meritocracy environment where ideas that get resourced and launched are based on data and testing versus hierarchical decisions. Awesome office space, location and parties.",Too many goals at times.

The technology is market-leading and with the recent acquisition by Priceline Group, OpenTable is benefiting from investment and strategy for growth which is really exciting.  Work life balance is very good, time differences between London and San Francisco are never easy, however there is a genuine appreciation of people's personal time.","A few internal processes can be a bit clunky, however the business is still nimble enough to be able to influence and change anything that needs fixing."
348,OpenTable,"Good work, good People and good times.",2014-12-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The People - An intelligent and collaborative workforce that makes it enjoyable to come into work every day.  Everyone does seem to respect one another professionally as well as personally; the people are genuinely nice.  People also ask the right questions, and move forward on ideas accordingly (Decisions are thoughtout and most of the time are backed with data).
The Location - Downtown San Francisco. Can't really beat where the HQ is, and the office space is welcoming. 
The Happy Hours - Creatively themed and a lot of fun. Not overproduced (nor a waste of dollars) these events typically are centered around the employees. Most notable have been Halloween, Kentucky Derby with employees riding large toy horses around the office, St. Patricks Day and then the impromptu happy hours that happen out of thin air and typically include people from various departments. 
Base salary is competitive and the RSUs add a nice touch.  Happy with the benefits too.
Seems to be a time for opportunity and growth for the business and me as an employee. I'm excited for the growth of the product.","At times I feel like the work hours can be a little long in comparison to my friends that work at other companies in the Bay Area but in all honesty I think this could also be a result of me not feeling the need to rush out of the office right at 5pm.

We, being a team of Engineers, Designers, Product Managers, Sales, Support Staff, Office Staff, etc. We loved the company and did our best to make it successful. That was an incredible team that succeeded in a major way. We were so proud when the company went public and watched the stock soar.  It was sweet.","Something happened a couple years ago where the old guard was summarily dismissed, or encouraged to move on by treating good people badly.  Stress, bickering, and managers yelling at employees in public increased, and people fled. The new engineering regime brought over their dozen or so cronies and even set them up with their own office in Southern California, away from the mother ship in San Francisco. Rather than learn about the existing culture at OpenTable, they imposed their own set of rules, values and skewed militaristic sense of what makes a good team.  The engineering team was constantly reminded that the company was moving fast, and to keep up or get left behind. Older workers were jettisoned for younger workers, a clear sign of ageism."

The product is excellent. Nothing in the market compares to it. 

Sales quota and targets are achievable.","Extremely stiff & uptight people who lack imagination and creativity. If corporate culture is important to you and you value working in an environment where creativity is encouraged and appreciated, this is not the place for you. 

Sales managers pit salespeople against one another and encourage them to say negative things about each other. Be careful who you befriend, these reports go into your employee file and will likely be used against you later. Everyone out for themselves type of environment. It was like working on Celeb Apprentice every single day. Very hostile working environment.

While not perfect, engineering concerns now take a much higher priority than before. We're moving away from a .net walled garden to a multi-platform distributed stack - some node.js, rails, also java in addition to C#. Also getting our build & deploy house in order, working towards continuous delivery.","Change doesn't come easy, I guess.

There definitely is a ""in"" crowd with upper management so if you are not in that ""in"" crowd you might as well forget about growing within the company.  There is one female there that is based in Colorado that is awful to work with.  The company use to be a great place to work at before they went public now the culture has changed."

374,OpenTable,Great working environment,2013-05-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,OpenTable offers a great work/life balance.  The company also hires wonderful people who are a joy to work with.  I've never felt so valued as I have at this company.,They are a bit behind on pay however that has been improving over the past year or two.  The company also tends to move more slowly than what is needed to keep up with their competition.  Hopefully that will improve as well.
375,OpenTable,Good Company.  Not the right fit.,2013-04-20,4.0,Sales,Nice environment and nice people.  At the time I was there all of the management was accessible.  Compensation was fair and they were continuing to grow.,It didn't seem like there was much of an opportunity for upward mobility because of the size of the company.  They may have already addressed this but there also didn't seem to be a clear direction on marketing and account management.
376,OpenTable,"Stuffy, Anti-Creative Corporate Culture",2013-04-15,2.0,Account Executive,"Excellent earning potential, great base, great commission opportunities
Advancement opportunities, they do promote from within
Very competitive benefits and time-off package","I was in sales as an account executive. 

This was the worst job of my life. I have worked for several tech companies (from start-ups to Fortune 500's); and with the exception of Opentable, they were all truly amazing experiences. 

OpenTable claims to hire ""challengers"", but the people they actually hire are just plain rude. They're motto ""If you're not being thrown out of a meeting at least once a week, you're not doing it right"". While this type of attitude may work in some markets, it does not work in all parts of the country, sales styles need to be adjusted to to the corresponding market and to the person or people to whom you are presenting. 

The company pits salespeople against each other. Healthy competition is a great thing in sales, but this is not what OpenTable does. They encourage sales people to say negative things about one another. This information then goes into the employee's file, to be used against them if necessary in the firing process. 

Be prepared to hit your goals or be fired within 60 days. Period. They rule by fear and as opposed to working with team members to help them reach their full potential, OpenTable is very quick to fire.

Fortunately, I was not fired. I put in my year and got out as soon as I could."
377,OpenTable,Sales is old and out of touch,2013-03-27,1.0,Account Executive,"- Fantastic co-workers, lots of great talent across most departments 
- Decent benefits 
- Potential to travel for the job","- Culture is very stiff. This is by no means a hip tech company. They work at this though. 
- Old technology. Staff laptops for sales are cheap PCs and old iPads (no 3G/4G). Technology is pretty dated on the customer side as well, the only thing that keeps the company at the top of the market is its network of users and restaurants. 
- Constant change. Within a few months of bringing me on they essentially decided to restructure the sales org. Bonuses were slashed and the commission structure was changed for the worse."
378,OpenTable,Micromanagement,2013-02-17,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Good salary and location. Company I growing fast and stock is recovering back.,"All the managers and directors have been there for almost 8-10 years and have not updated their technology skill set. They don't let their employees think on their own, but they influence how to get the task done and micromanage them, line-by-line code review. 

There is no recognition or encouragement for the hard work or for the innovation. The foody awards are only given to sales and marketing people and very rarely given to engineering team.

The CTO is trying to build his own empire by firing current employees who disagrees with him and bringing his own people from his ex-company, so on one wants to propose any changes or disagrees with him."

*  Most of the employees are cool and competent
* The company has a great market niche","* The engineering VP rules by fear 
* One of the engineering directors is the most inaccurate yet condescending person you will ever meet (i.e. he is frequently wrong but talks down to you even when you are right - it's quite amazing)
* You won't be trusted to think and do a your job without being micromanaged
* Favoritism is frequent and out of control
* You will be sacrificed to 'the bus' and demoted if a manager needs to lay blame on someone else (even if said manager was micromanaging you)
* The technology is about 10 years behind current times and no one in management is in a hurry to change that"

388,OpenTable,Engineers receive no recognition or reward,2011-06-10,1.0,Engineer,"Interesting work, conveniently located. That's about where it ends.","Are you an engineer? Are you looking to use your talents to build great products, and receive recognition and reward for your hard work? Then you'd better look elsewhere. Go to Google, Facebook, or countless other technology companies which value their engineers. These
are fundamentally technology driven companies, OpenTable is a sales/marketing driven organization. Engineers are simply cogs in the wheel, and are easily replaceable  in the eyes of management.

They just don't do performance-based compensation at all. Sure, management has received about $20 million each in stock option based compensation, but the rules are different for everyone else within the company. Even for the engineers who actually create the product that is making management so extraordinarily wealthy.

There is no individual recognition whatsoever, unless you make a mistake which costs the company money. Then they will hold an all hands meeting to place blame on the engineer who made the mistake. If you create a product which generates millions in revenue, not a word is said. There is no bonus structure at all. Work as hard as you possibly can, still no bonus. There is absolutely no incentive at all for hard work within this organization. You work your butt off and management gets rich, that's pretty much how it works around here.

There is no opportunity to advance within the Engineering department either. All the team leads have been there 6+ years and aren't going anywhere. Promotions and even recognition are not lacking  in any other department within the company, but they are an extreme rarity within Engineering.

I want to reiterate to any talented engineers out there -- if you want to see your talents appreciated and rewarded, you are better off looking elsewhere."
389,OpenTable,Great experience,2011-04-27,4.0,,Every one loves the product.  Still a small company so there are lots of opportunities for growth.  Very nice management team.,Very fast paced environment so sometimes in can be overwhelming and exhausting.  Lots of remote employees so communication is difficult.
