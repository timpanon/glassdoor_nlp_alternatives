Amazing down to earth SLT members as well. Something that made me smile everyday! And hopefully I can experience again!",Prefer not to say at this time.
30,Orbitz Worldwide,"Great company to work for devops, not so much for DM!",2016-10-28,2.0,Technical Lead,Great work culture. Awesome environment for developers and technologists. Ideas are exchanged openly. Innovation is something appreciated by top management.,"I ended up having a horrendous Boss who was a micro manager maniac. He'd ask your whereabouts if you're away from your desk for more than 30 minutes. He'd take your brain dump, and puts your idea down. He'd then go and present it to the top management claiming this is his great idea, so he could get credit for that. If you had done 99% of the time great job, he'd focus on the 1% in your annual review, when you did not out perform.  

My immediate management had full control of the situation, and thus manipulated it. I took my concerns to my manager's Boss. It turned out that he is also a micro manager. Unfortunately this was my worst nightmare. When Expedia took over Orbitz, he jumped at the opportunity and eliminated my position. Thus ending my nightmare!

Reflecting back on last one year since I left Orbitz, this was the best time for me. My mental and physical health has improved. I got a chance to work with amazing people. They appreciate your work. I should probably go back to my old Boss and thank him for giving me the opportunity to explore new opportunities :)

Moral of the story: If you ever get into such a situation, do not waste even a minute. There're plenty of great opportunities out there for the right person."

The fun atmosphere and the opportunity to build a future and grow were plentiful.,"Orbitz had a distinct culture of cohesive teamwork and managed to amass a group of high functioning, committed and passionate professionals. Then Barney Hartford arrived with his own culture of divisiveness, cutthroat, dog eat dog, good ole boy network. The company spiraled out of control and was a shadow of its former self. His background as an exExpedia executive and married to a current Expedia executive left his agenda very transparent to everyone but the greedy board of directors.  Barney, board and crew all made out like bandits and landed softly with their golden parachutes and left behind carnage and devastation in their wake. Expedia is similar to Stepford there is a distinct ""type""."

75,Orbitz Worldwide,Sad and Disappointed to read latest reviews!!,2016-01-25,2.0,Team Lead,Used to be a great company to work for until the expedia acquisition.,"It got bad right after the deal was announced and kept going down. From what I read here and from talking to ex colleagues still there, things have taken a turn for the worse. The incident reported in one of the reviews about a senior leader calling women ""honey"" and saying they are good to look just blew my mind. That would not happen in the old Orbitz and if it did happen it would never be tolerated no matter how senior the leader is. Shameful!"

-Most people are job searching
-Chicago is now a ""satellite"" office which means there is limited career growth"
81,Orbitz Worldwide,Grim outlook post Expedia acquisition,2016-01-17,1.0,,Expedia benefits are great. The company prides on being action oriented and there is a culture of test and learn.,"So many talented people already left or were let go. Those who are staying were offered much lower level of title and responsibilities, so morale is low. No clarity on quality of projects to be worked on. Bellevue teams are already too bloated with duplicate work and wasted effort. Expedia touted their goals to have 30 percent women VPs by 2020 yet no effort was made to retain Orbitz women leaders, so many talented women were let go: they were directors and VPs at Orbitz."

Coming from a company where I was a product manager who go to analyze problems, talk to customers, look at data, and then sell my roadmap idea to management, this has been very de-motivating.  I am essentially handed a roadmap and told to execute, which is not fulfilling at all.  After a training session we had with a silicon valley tech speaker who said ""no product manager wants to be handed a roadmap,"" I found out that several other product specialists felt the same way I did."

I've only been at Orbitz for a month now and I've gone to two workshops off campus and a bunch of Best Practices workshops on campus. 

My manager is great, just the right amount of nurturing - they expect you to figure things out on your own, but they are there to support you 100% when you have questions.

Personal growth is also a focus with various groups for mentoring, for women, etc. There is an overall happy ""vibe"" and management is very accessible - great culture.","Salary isn't quite what of some major companies can offer.

Smart people who are hugely supportive and willing to drop what they are working on at any time to provide help.

173,Orbitz Worldwide,"Very stimulating place to work, great opportunities for growth and development",2014-10-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Orbitz is remarkably unpolitical for a company of its size. There are so many opportunities to learn about the company, and about different functions within the organization. For a company that's at the cutting edge of many areas that translates into a very unusual opportunity to learn about at scale web technologies and e-commerce. 

The company has been consistently focused on 3 strategic themes for several years now: loyalty, mobile and international expansion.  The company's consumer brands have industry-leading loyalty offerings - Orbitz Rewards in the US and ebookers Bonus+ in Europe - and very successful mobile apps. Internationally the company is expanding into high growth markets through its own brands, private label and corporate (managed) travel.  It's nice that there is consistency of these strategic themes, so we're able to invest against them and build meaningful technology to support each of them, versus flip flopping all the time like many companies seem to do.

The Orbitz tech platform is very strong. They went through a multi-year replatforming that finished early 2012, which sucked a significant amount of resources at the time. However now it's in place it means the cycle time is way reduced. New hires on the tech side now typically ship code to the live site by the end of their first week, which is pretty cool.","It's a super competitive industry so there is always a list of things to do that is way longer than what we can get done in any given time period, which means prioritization becomes really important, and not everyone's projects are going to get done. 

The performance management process compares people across different parts of the company, and means the company is able to target rewards towards the highest performers. Some people don't love this approach but it has certainly increased the caliber of people at the company quite significantly over the last 5 years or so."

Some areas have below market compensation
194,Orbitz Worldwide,"Exciting, Fun, and Open to change at all levels",2014-10-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"ORBITZ WORLDWIDE (OWW) IS A DYNAMIC ORGANIZATION.  
A lot of companies say that they are a ""dynamic organization"", but few actually are.  When a company says it is ""dynamic"", it usually means that you have to expect harsh, abrupt and sometimes senseless changes as the company responds to market conditions.  ""Dynamic"", in the hands of bad leadership, can often be an excuse for bad management to constantly change the course of business which can adversely affect the employees.  This is not the case with Orbitz.  Orbitz is a dynamic organization in all of the best ways.  They are constantly improving - constantly evolving.  They are in a highly competitive environment, so it is important that they are always looking at ways to do things different and better.  They are also in a generally challenging business (Travel), that literally changes with the weather.  A company in this industry could not be successful without being truly dynamic and able to quickly respond to changing conditions.  What sets Orbitz apart, is its ability to initiate strategic change while making every employee feel like they are agents of the change that is needed.  Employees are not just ""along for the ride"" while management decides on a new course of action.  If Orbitz is doing a push into a new market or product, we will hear about it... if not through regular meetings to discuss it, then through other communications.  Very seldom is there anything that happens with OWW (unless its confidential information such as financials) that employees learn about by reading an article on CNN.com.  We will generally know about it first.

OWW PAYS WELL FOR THE BEST TALENT
In my opinion, Orbitz works hard to identify and source the best possible employees.  They focus very hard on making sure that they are finding people that are the best possible mutual fit.  I remember back when I was going through my interview process, the recruiter asked me ""so, do you think that this seems like the type of place you would want to be?""  It wasn't just about me winning them over.  It was about them making sure that I would succeed.  Am I a millionaire?  No, but I know that OWW works hard to find the best people and make sure that the applicants know that the process is not about finding how to get the best person at the cheapest price.  They pay fairly (if not better than fair), and you know that you will work hard for what you are paid.

OWW COMMUNICATES WELL
OWW has regular employee meetings at which they discuss upcoming changes or new business.  When OWW was making a major new push into a new country, they offered employees the opportunity to see what the plans were, and why the new business was going to be beneficial and positive to the entire company.  In addition to these personal meetings, OWW communicates regularly through internal social networks and newsletters.  They do a very good job of keeping everyone involved whenever possible.  On top of all of that, the senior leadership team (SLT) is not in an ivory tower - inaccessible to the masses.  You could walk into the office of the CEO if you wanted to.  If they are free, the SLT are very accessible.

OWW IS ACTUALLY FUN!
The company has regular social events, such as ""Thisty Thursdays"" where drinks are served and everyone comes together to meet and talk.  It is very open.  The atmosphere is generally casual; the idea being that what is important is the work and offering the best service to our customers.  They have different employee networking groups that are very inclusive.  Some of the things they offer are simple, but SO nice... like free vending machines and coffee, and being able to connect your wireless devices to the company network.  They allow us to volunteer on company time, and have different events where they allow every employee the ability to push up big ideas to improve the company.","OWW is very loyal to its employees.  While that normally is a wonderful attribute, it also means that they don't like taking things away from people who have been there for the company.  This has lead to an organizational structure that is somewhat fragmented.  Example:  Person A is a director, and they have ""always had"" Department 1, so even if they build up an organizational structure around them, they will have the ""legacy employees"" in Department 1 reporting to Person A, but then other new people with the same functions may report to Person B, who is a Manager.  This leads to an organizational structure that is zig-zaggy (in some departments).  The global structure can also be challenging, with some people holding onto little fiefdoms even at the expense of efficiency.  Some technology groups (as well as other areas) are outsourced, and even though they all would fall under the Global ""OWW"" umbrella, the individual companies will not allow the particular function to be centralized.  In my time with the organization, this is something that is not unique in any part of the global company."

255,Orbitz Worldwide,"Fun vibe, good senior leadership, but this culture is superficial and does not permeate through middle management.",2014-05-30,1.0,Account Manager,"The overall company vibe at Oribtz is very positive.  The Senior Leadership team is relatively accessible and compared to other companies, they are quite open.  I appreciate the openness with regards especially to bonus compensation calculation.  Orbitz does try to create a fun, open, tech environment with lots of employee activities.  Fun isn't going to keep good talent around though.","Orbitz's employee benefits are paltry and do not match industry standards for business professionals.  PTO, maternity/paternity leave, etc are dismal.  I came from 28 days of PTO in my prior company to only 12 days.   I've had fellow employees actually quit Orbitz when they find out they're pregnant, getting married, or other life events that require flexibility.  
Experiences vary greatly between teams.  Some teams have managers who are open to flexible working concepts and working from home and other teams have mangers who refuse flexibility even under family emergencies!  Other reviews are correct, there are extremely limited opportunities for growth here.  Middle management here is awful.  People become managers because of tenure not because they're suited to management functions.  I've had my manager lie to me, yell at me, and take credit for my work.  
Finally, Orbitz HR team made quite a few claims during the recruitment process that they had no right to make and that went completely unfulfilled.  
I would never recommend any Orbitz jobs to any fellow business professionals, but would recommend Orbitz to campus hires.  Orbitz is a fun place to start a career right out of college and benefits for campus hires are aligned with the industry.  For experienced professionals...stay away!"

Also, this is the time HR asks you to comment on glassdoor.com, when you are fresh and everything seems perfect.  Very smart.","After my first year, I learned the truth about Orbitz.  Not much potential for growth.  Investment in training and learning does not exist.  I asked many times about going to training seminars, but was turned down because of ""budget"" reasons.  Upper management is absolutely horrible, no backbone at all.  After I left the company, I realized how much I did not learn at Orbitz.  I felt I had gone backwards instead of forwards in my industry.  Also, after I left the company, I found out I was blocked from an internal opportunity by upper management.  And I was lied to about the reason why I didn't get the job.  Makes me sick.  HR is clueless.  My exist interview was a joke."

263,Orbitz Worldwide,"Challenging work, great peers but difficult to understand management",2014-04-16,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,A lot of the work involves many technical challenges that keeps the engineers really focused and excited to work on the upcoming and current projects we have. The challenges we face are things that are great to people if you're a problem solver and love to work on things that will make the platform stronger and better. One of the most important things to look for in a company is how you can grow in the company. The lighter form of beaucracy allows you to communicate with different departments such as operations and business fairly easily to push forward a new idea that engineers may be interested in. This really allows you to seek new opportunities that you may not have otherwise thought about.,"Many people seem to think of the company as having a ""startup culture"", but in my experience, that is far gone. With cost savings in mind, management has taken away a lot of things that keeps employees happy. The benefits package is average, the ""healthy food"" breakfast has been trimmed down significantly, and there are few perks such as rewarding good innovative ideas. Compensation is based on average market forces in the area, etc.

The office dynamic is fairly mixed. As a cost savings measure, many software engineering positions are off-shore creating a VERY poor work/life balance. With the time zone difference, you would be expected to work at 10pm-11pm or come in early between 7am-8am just to communicate with the rest of your team. This creates a very tiring cycle of work which makes it very hard to be productive during the day. In addition, the significant amount of work off-shore is starting to have an impact on the quality of the software being wrote which as Software engineers, you'll find to be very infuriating to work with. 

Another significant office culture dynamic is the increasing amount of contract work. Although you may find yourself with a better work/life balance, our fellow contract co-workers are facing even more harder work conditions simply because HR doesn't handle them. This causes an increasingly stressful work environment where people are becoming less relaxed and less ""startup culture"" and becoming more of a company where people are expected to be worker bees."

The interview process was efficient & helpful. The recruiter who I worked with was very quick to respond to my inquiries & concerns. The background check process was a little ridiculous -- one of my prior employers had shredded all of my documentation -- but the team was quick to help me remedy my issue.

The onboarding process was very smooth & I'm impressed with the number of team-oriented and professional/personal improvement events that have been hosted in such a short amount of time. I was set up with two mentors within my first month of employment, and we continue weekly meetings so that I can bounce ideas/concerns off of individuals within the organization who are not within my immediate team. That's pretty refreshing & a nice sounding board. In addition, the organization just launched the Women of Orbitz panel which has been a fun and educational program thus far. It's evident that Orbitz is trying to supply its employees with different outlets for growth.

My work has been challenging and I'm really enjoying the team that I am on. Everyone is very supportive about helping me get acclimated to the job.","There are way too many meetings. Teams have meetings to talk about upcoming meetings. I'm finding it difficult to balance the number of meetings that I'm attending with my work load, and I'm hoping that will improve with time because there is no sense in meeting just to meet!"

It strikes me as very ironic that Orbitz recruits smart people and then thinks it can lie to them about how great things are within the company. Smart people can see when half their team leaves to take new jobs in a matter of a few months. They can see when two top level execs: the CFO (who was there less than 2 years)  and President of Partner Services resign in the same week. They can see when Orbitz isn’t turning a profit quarter after quarter and year after year. And, they can see when bonuses are not paid out and raises are a pittance. I think that Orbitz bragging to employees about its AMAZING Glassdoor report card has actually prompted some employees and former employees to write accurate reviews about the way things really are. Attempting to pull the wool over employees’ eyes isn’t working—it’s making smart employees angry. 

And as a side note,  the company does actively ask HR as well as the entire company to give it positive reviews on Glassdoor."

The laid back atmosphere was nice but also a symptom of zero accountability anywhere in the organization. The office is located in a good spot for running errands during work hours (was always able to go to the post office or stop at CVS if I needed something). Decent opportunity to move up in the organization because people are always leaving, creating positions for others to move into.","Huge amount of turnover ends up leaving large gaps in knowledge, which are then filled in by numerous silos because the replacements don't have the knowledge of how everything fits together. A constant problem is the competing systems and priorities to the point where nothing ever gets done because all of the time is spent actually prioritizing and re-prioritizing when things inevitably fall off the divinely inspired ""Roadmap"". (which has yielded exactly how much incremental revenue over the past 3-4 years?)

The people who have made the decisions that have caused the company to lose market share and revenue are still responsible for making those same decisions, which is why the stock price has crashed while competitors are soaring. 

Compensation is pathetic and it is not hard to see where the money that could be allocated to merit increases and bonuses is being wasted on, ahem $80K xmas party, a couple of $50K all hands, not to mention the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) being treated like royalty and having catered lunch every day while the actual worker bees who get the job done hope to afford something decent from the food court downstairs on the pittance that they are paid. Seeing the money just pissed down the drain on the SLT jetting around the world makes it all that much harder to see the bonus pool shrink and shrink each year. 

People are not just cogs that can be replaced and that fact has proven itself over and over as good talent leaves and the company continues on its slow march to irrelevance or being bought out."

Promises promises
Why do I believe""

Orbitz is a great place to learn some new technology and really feel like you have your finger on the pulse of the travel industry. The company culture is very relaxed and one where you don't feel pressure to present yourself in a certain way (appearance-wise) to be heard. The company is focused on bringing innovative solutions to the market...which can also go in the cons section.

A majority of my co-workers are hard working individuals that bring a lot to the team.","Unfortunately, Orbitz, you're getting more in the cons section this year. Especially with the new Report Card that just came out.

- Non-tech and non-Marketing employees are not treated as they should be. The bonuses and salaries are disappointing, as are the lack of real growth opportunities. The amount of work keeps piling up, but the salaries are not suitable for the work.
- There is a lot of talk about growth opportunities, but these rarely come through. I've seen numerous qualified individuals leaving the department or company because they were not given what was dangled in front of them. You're told you'll be considered for a position, but then when it comes down to the final talks, suddenly everything is different.
- The Senior Leadership Team is completely out-of-touch with what the employees are thinking and feeling. They act on their limited knowledge of the teams they manage rather than holding informational sessions to learn about the challenges that the teams are really facing.
- The turnover of employees and the poor documentation of processes hinders the teams and causes huge backlogs of work. When you think you've caught up another change happens.
- There is poor communication between teams regarding changes on the site that should be sent out to any team potentially involved. This includes 50/50 testing.
- Too much focus on ""innovation"" rather than strengthening the core systems that are sub-par for today's standards. The Product team seems to avoid working on core issues and focuses on enhancements that the Senior Leadership Team feels are important. If the systems are barely hanging on, enhancements will not be successful.
- There has been a distinct lack of informational meetings, such as Town Hall sessions. There has also been a lack of Learning and Development classes or Team Building activities. Company morale feels much lower over the past year.
- When moving positions or getting a promotion in the company, it's almost a miracle to get any sort of pay raise. If it's over 9.9% salary increase, it needs to be approved by Barney. This drags out the hiring process greatly."

However, management has acknowledged this as a legitimate issue and is doing everything it can to get cross-departmental teams working together in order to break away from this widely-believed notion.

Career development plans tend to be unclear; it's widely believed that career advancement at Orbitz requires proactive conversations with management that some (if not most) would deem awkward.

438,Orbitz Worldwide,"If you have to work, there aren't many better places",2011-12-12,4.0,,"A highly collegial environment where you look forward to engaging with your co-workers. There are tons of interesting initiatives going on all the time - makes you feel proud to work for a company that is on the leading edge in its industry. There are loads of social activities - happy hours, holiday parties, and volunteer events, etc - if that's your thing. If not, you don't feel pressured to join.","While there are opportunities for professional development, the size of the company naturally limits the potential for upward mobility beyond a certain level. It's not to say that people don't get promoted -- they do - but in some areas of the company there are too few spots coveted by many people."
439,Orbitz Worldwide,"Play a role in using technology to transform the way consumers around the world plan and purchase travel, plus have fun!",2011-12-10,5.0,,"Opportunity to work on projects that impact millions of consumers. Orbitz is on the cutting edge of a bunch of interesting fields esp in areas of technology, marketing and analytics. Great opportunity to learn while working with highly talented and engaged team members.

Fun, flat, non-hierarchical culture where ideas and execution are what matters. You can move around the global organization and broaden your experience set.

Nice HR benefits like a week off between Christmas and New Year, 401K w matching, frequent social events. Some cool travel industry discounts including access to some really spectacular industry rates at hotel chains including Fairmont, Starwood and Marriott, plus 20% off hotels booked on Orbitz.

Good work/life balance, and the Orbitz offices are on top of a major train station, making commuting really easy.","Ultra-competitive industry, the pace is very fast, there's always a lot of stuff to be done, and often the need for some tough prioritization decisions.

Over the last few years there has been a lot of effort devoted to platform migration, which has slowed down the pace of customer-impacting innovation. The good news here is that this migration work should be finished by the end of Q1 2012, which should allow us to step up the innovation that will impact  consumers.

Chicago can be cold in the winter. But it's a world class city, with great restaurants, and loads of culture of all varieties."
