Now I have to say... These people have no idea what they're doing anymore.

- The turnover this year has been ridiculous. What kind of company are you running?

- Leadership, both middle and executive, are misguided and uncaring. Very little transparency about the company direction. Stop with the ""lighthouse"".

- Politics rule. You have to play the game to win the prize. Less talented people are favored based on relationships, which creates a very fraudulent culture. Awful HR dept that definitely is not here to support us, especially the woman running it. They have made things up to get people out.

- The comp is not great. Some people are making drastically more than others for doing the same work, which seems extremely unfair and biased.

Between the employees and the culture, I have truly enjoyed growing with Outbrain over the last few years and am excited for what's ahead. I constantly feel supported and valued by my team as well as across other departments. Even after being around for 13 years, the company  still remains upbeat, warm, welcoming and encouraging.

- This is a great place to learn if you are new to the industry.

- Decent benefits

- Communication across teams has been improving","- Outbrain pays the bare minimum

- Constant organizational changes are very stressful

- Commission goals are set to unrealistic levels

- I hit 100% of my goals but am still brought down because of team members that can't hit their goals. Why should I be penalized for other people that I can't even help?!

- There are not enough impressions in the system for every seller to hit their goals, which is why they want to keep on sales people who perform poorly so the company can pay each sales person less.

- I leave here everyday unmotivated knowing that the hard work that I put in will just be an uphill battle with management/operations to fight for accounts that should count towards my goal. 

- It is very  unclear what you have to do to grow within the company. There are no benchmarks or checkboxes to meet if you are trying to move up within the company. 

- Advertisers stop working in the platform because there is not enough inventory and prices are becoming too high.

- I feel like I don't get reciprocated for the hard work I put in."

134,Outbrain,They're trying to be something they're not. Be extra careful when applying!,2019-05-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working hours were OK in my case, but are not exemplified by most of the management.","There is a high level of general employee dissatisfaction at Outbrain in Germany, which is reflected in the working atmosphere. Unfortunately, complaints are only made behind the scenes, which of course does not lead to the desired result.

In my opinion, the company's focus is too much on beating the competition as opposed to further developing its own business (including its employees) and optimizing existing processes.

When I tried to openly address problems, they were either interpreted as personal criticism or not accepted at all. There is no professional feedback culture which is highly uncommon in this industry and really surprised me. Since many colleagues (esp. from management) feel personally attacked when given feedback, I am not surprised that a certain level of resignation has been established amongst employees. In the long run, more and more qualified employees will leave the company as a result.

There is no structured working mode, which is expressed, for example, by the fact that roles are filled without concrete expectations. This leads to misunderstandings and disappointments on both sides. Also, there are no career paths in place for either of the roles. This makes it very hard for employees to stay motivated and to feel appreciated.
Apparently there are only two options for a ""good"" cooperation: either you submit to the chaos or you leave. You can see very clearly that the managers here have no training in communication and leadership. Unfortunately, this is noticable all the way from the application process until resignation.

Due to my poor experience, I do not recommend Outbrain in Germany as an employer. Please note, that my experience does not refer to other Outbrain locations."
135,Outbrain,Good but...,2019-05-07,3.0,Software Engineer,"The majority of people are great

Executive management are approachable and attentive people who genuinely care

Executive management has very high moral values and care about things that are way bigger than money or commercial success 

Great perks and salary 

Great work/life balance and an opportunity to work from home if needed

Visionary head of engineering who’s always willing to help 

High coding standards 

Great administration team that will take care of all your needs and will do that with a  big smile

A real international company that embraces multiculturalism","There’s something very old about the atmosphere - old product, old office and some people with a very old state of mind. The ambient is a far cry from a cool and hip tech company. There’s something “tired” in the air. 


Teams are a hit or a miss - if you hit, you can find yourself with an inspiring team leader and a fun group of teammates. If you miss - you can be under the authority of a whimsical and arrogant team leader who leads to micromanagement and to a fearful day to day routine . In that case, you’ll find your teammates (who are almost alway great people) asking to leave the team.

Much time is going to waste. 
As a developer, you might find yourself spending more time on being in meetings or tech talks, reading emails, writing tests, conducting code reviews or being in plannings and other scrum meetings, rather than really developing or creating something new and innovative.

HR is weak. None of them will ask you how you’re doing nor show any interest about your wellbeing.

No innovation nor any major new initiatives"

-Excellent opportunity to sharpen your skills and develop new ones.
-Can't emphasize enough how good the people are","-Outbrain does not underpay, not by any means, but I think they stays squarely at the competitive average.
-Because they go after very capable people, and partly because they aren't at the top end of the industry pay scale, there's a not insignificant amount of turnover.

If on the other hand you want to work hard with hundreds of other talented, intelligent people for an industry poised to implode because of greed then this is your place. It's a strange contradiction because I haven't heard of a company that treats its people better.

That said, if ad-tech does implode I think Outbrain is one of the best places to be if you hope to survive it.

- Really questionable spending habits in so many ways. Also, the structure for receiving bonuses and promotions is opaque, not done in a systematic way, and subject to a lot of bias/favoritism. Outbrain also likes to “promote” people with no increase in pay, with increased responsibilities on top of the original responsibilities."

- The office is a bit too small - and needs more space!  Sometimes it's very difficult to book conference rooms b/c people who haven't booked them take them over and refuse to give them up.
- unclear communication from the Israeli office -- depending on the department, things can seem opaque and unclear -- and you find out changes at the last minute (obviously this is not indicative of ALL of Outbrain - but I def. see it in some departments)
- this past year saw a lot of turn-over -- people felt unsupported in their roles & left to go elsewhere
- convoluted & duplicative processes -- sometimes other people in other departments would do the same work I'd be doing.  Communication is often broken between teams
- compensation is below market rates"

Very modern office in a good location.","Other teams, the managers say things like ""That's why there's an S in front of my VP"" as their answer to everything and do not care about the clients or people working for them. Don't get stuck on that team; you will hate your job very quickly.

The training was so in depth and comprehensive that within two weeks I was 100% on my own. The company really strives to make sure each employee has the resources they need for their job, as well as making sure they are also happy at their job. HR and Management check in fairly regularly for feedback and will work hard to make sure to help fix any issues or situations. They are also very big on career advancement and actively encourage all employees to be vocal about their career plans. 

Free lunches, annual sales summit in awesome locations (Puerto Rico anyone?) and all around a fun environment. 

Product wise - they are frontrunners in the Native Space, and there are a lot of people who know what they're talking about and have a clear direction where the company is going.","One of the company's biggest things was that they would gladly turn away potential clients, regardless of spend, if the content was subpar. Except that was not always the case, and there were times my team would work long hours and weekends to monitor seriously crappy content, all because we needed to hit quarterly goal."

I'm at a satellite office where there's even less support from HQ. We're so cheap that we only get headcount when it's 1 year too late and our revenue targets are untenable, thus missing out on our bonus."

As it maintains a start-up feel the job can be varied, challenging, and with room to get creative.  There's some great people from around the world who are passionate about what they do.","Outbrain is at war with its competitor Taboola, so it can be a rollercoaster of ups and downs depending on who's winning the battle. Management often knee-jerks to the competitor's movements, and the lambasting and name-calling of them to their advertisers can be very unprofessional. In the race to first prize you see the darker sides of business - that coupled with the long hours can make it a stressful and unpleasant place to work."

230,Outbrain,Great marketing but not living up to it,2014-10-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Outbrain is the originator of the ""You Might Also Like"" widgets that are all over the web today. It is a great company to launch from. You meet lots of advertisers and publishers so there's great opportunities to network while you're at Outbrain. Some of the perks are pretty good: free coffee, free lunch 1 day per week, free snacks (while they last). Most of the people who work at Outbrain are very friendly. There's lots of socializing in the office, including beer cart on Thursdays, when new hires push a beer cart around the office and introduce themselves to the rest of the team.","For muchof the company's life, they were the only game in town aside from display ads. But now there is major competition in the market, and that is causing some flailing. There is a lot of pressure on sales/accounts to lock in clients, and on product/engineering to copy what competitors do, and on management to ensure constant growth in a very different landscape. As a result, a lot of the original magic has been lost. 

Outbrain's big claim to a competitive advantage is that they have better quality links than the competition. While that might have been true in the past, Outbrain now shares most of their best advertisers with their competition. So it is kind of moot at this point. The leadership can be arrogant about this. The response seems to be ""We invented this space"" or ""We're the only one with content guidelines.""  It is not really clear what that means beyond ""We have less Cash4Gold links, but they still have plenty of Kim Kardashian and bikini links.""  But the latter is what seems to offend people most. 

As a result of the arrogant responses in the face of intense competition, Outbrain is getting out-innovated and losing ground to rivals, including Gravity (owned by AOL) and nRelate (owned by IAC). The biggest threat though, is Taboola, which is actually less than half the size in terms of headcount, but  really starting to win the space and seems to be developing better technology."
