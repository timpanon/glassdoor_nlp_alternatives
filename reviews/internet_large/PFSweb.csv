- Flexible work hours (37h/week and you manage them the way you like as long as you arrive in the office before 11AM)£
- Meal vouchers
- Big clients (will look good on your resume)
- A lot to learn (but only in the few months, you will stagnate very quick)
- Understanding management (but they will ask a lot from you)","- Teleworking  max 2 days a month (when 99% of your work is done online... Is this 1995?)
- Large employee turnover, I saw 20-30% of the staff come and go in 2 years. And most of them because it was not going well.
- Quite a high level of burnouts depending on the departement you are working on.
- Quite a high level of people leaving the company after 3-4 years because the feel like they are not evolving anymore.
- No digital culture. It's an eCommerce company and you can't find any dorks, geeks or people interested in the internet era. The lack of passion is shocking.
- Don't expect to hang out with your coworkers for a beer after work. The culture is not suited for it.
- Don't expect other benefits than meal voucher and DKV unless you are senior manager (which means you are managing 6+ people and have at least 5y experience).
- Don't expect many extra's, business trips, training, team building events,...
- The company is not client centric at all; it's price centric. Everything is made with the cost in mind, especially hiring and firing. The consequence is bad experience for the customer :  people (and sometimes entire departements) fired without notice sent to the client, quote way too expensive or way too cheap compared to industry standard,etc...  Just an overall lack of client service mindset.

And many other things when you scratch the surface...  Truth to be said nothing truly unbearable but when you addition it all, it does not make you want to pursue a career there."

The managers here make sure that everyone on their team including them LIES to and keeps valuable information from the clients about what is REALLY going on all of the time. How can you live with yourself? Managers are inexperienced and they blame everything on their teams because there is no training from day 1 and a lot of disrespect involved. You will not get paid what you are worth here and be expected to work all of the time. If you don't hang out with your team or your coworkers outside of work whenever they want you to then you will be exiled from the group. You will be pressured to drink and smoke whenever your boss says so. Tell me how much you value your self-respect if you take a job here, I would say that you have none. They want people working here with no experience to see their processes and not be able to identify how twisted their system really is....and believe me there is a lot wrong here. A lot of people who work here went to ACU and they will ""glorify"" you if you did as well, have fun here before the company's tanks and you have to join the real world. Unorganized environment, harassment that HR overlooks, high expectations for company processes and implementation when there is no backing to carry it out, no communication, really hanging by a thread, anywhere else is better than this company."

Maybe if the management would learn the real meaning of words like ""respect"" and ""consideration"", people would feel better in the company.
- You can deliver the most perfect job and entirely satisfy your clients, but if you're not in the ""small papers"" of the top management you won't get any reward and neither recognition for the results you have brought.
- ""Always On"" mentality, you must be available at all time (24/7) in case an issue would occur on a system (especially during last quarter of the year, which is the high peak period). However, working late when it's needed (even until 2am in some rare situations) will not bring you more consideration from the management for the cause, because ""that's normal"".

2. The area is very accessible from the highway.
3. The mid range level employees are nice to work with & they truly will help the company reach its goals
4. The company overall is innovative.","1. The american managing director has an attitude of ""know it all"" so most of the time it is very difficult to pass your opinion. His perception is the reality.
2. The company has a value of respect but unfortunately you will not get this from the managing director if he does not like you. Ex: you will greet him good morning & he will just ignore you. But wait, if this guy is with a client or with his higher boss, he does say good morning with a big smile, coincidence perhaps.
3. Low salary with no bonus system except for call centers.
4. HR department is not much on human resources & they tend to say yes to the director to be in the safe place.
5. Basically, there are a lot of politics in this company. The top management personally like you, you go up. They do not like you, you're out or they will make your life really hard for you to decide to go."

Then when you follow a clearly defined process and make the only decision allowed by that process, Program Management attempts to bully and complain about the choice that they refused to make. Some folks are lived by managers and can do no wrong and are still taking up space. Even after repeatedly giving supervisors and managers every piece of evidence as to why someone needs to be removed from a position or the company, they still get rescued and continue to show up and screw up. There is no work life balance. They probide the resources to work from home. Yet you are not allowed to work from home unless the company needs something from you. You are expected to be available by phone (which they don't pay for or reimburse for) or email at all times. You are considered selfish and disloyal if you actually want to have a home life.

The company puts so much stock into the college recruit program, other employees are often overlooked, even though they may have same credentials, education (or more) and more experience.  Learn to build up your employees instead of tearing them down.

359,PFSweb,Good starting point for a recent graduate to gain experience,2014-06-12,3.0,Account Manager,"The company is small, things are personal, and large amounts of responsibility are delegated to starting-level employees. The company is very much a ""go get it"" mindset, meaning any and all training is self driven, and you will not be given anything on a silver plate. While this gives a lot of learning, it is not necessarily good for developing new employees, and results in huge amounts of variation between what employees do and learn, even within the same function/job title.","The company suffers from poor management throughout the company; there is no ""path to success"", ongoing developmental programs, or required reviews/feedback from management. The company does have a yearly review, however, there is no requirement for managers to abide by this, so tracking development is nearly impossible. 
With this in mind, the amount of work one puts in has nearly no direct impact upon one's development and salary, as it is entirely in the hands of your direct manager, who may or may not voice your impact to high management, who approve/discuss any potential promotions. 
The company does seem to have a habit of paying lower than market for both new and tenured employees, so keep this in mind when setting expectations.

The company is structured as follows in the US :
Allen, TX - Corporate office
Dallas, TX - Call Center office
Memphis, TN - Distribution Center
The company also has locations in Leige and Manila, however, they are on a smaller scale and perform differently."

The environment is only semi-organized so it's small enough to make mistakes and learn how to be a professional, but large enough where you have exposure to how things should get done.","Highly political, not a place for most people to build a career.  Many non-political people who choose to stay beyond five years are laid off when times get tight or their account goes away.  It's basically a DOTCOM company that hoarded enough to cash to not be killed off.  They've never returned capital to investors and they aren't about to start.  Shareholders aren't active so senior management simply keeps the place afloat to extract high salaries.  It's run like a private company.  If you have the opportunity, ride the job out for a few years and learn, then go work for an actual productive enterprise.  I would guess they'll be acquired purely for their portfolio of brands in the next decade, they're sitting on piles of cash they stole from the capital markets so they'll plug along for awhile but they won't do anything revolution (and if you don't make friends with the right VP they'll lay you off eventually)."

Information is power here and used against employees.  Employee turnover- 14 employees within the last year left or were fired (the department is 16-20 people).  I've never seen such a work place where people refuse to share information or products because of concern over their job security or the ""throwing of others under the bus"" in order to get ahead.  After I started I was told that my department was ""career suicide"" and I should leave now.  Should have listened sooner."

Popularity contest.,2014-02-12,2.0,Delivery Manager,"PFSweb is a pioneer and has impressively evolved over the past 20 years while remaining one of the leading fulfillment companies in the industry. They have an excellent college recruit program. The offices are new and bright. There are new accounts that are helping the company grow, financially","Old management is very clique-y. New management has no people skills. There is an obvious divide between those who are ""in the circle"", those who tip-toe, and those who are not ""in the circle"". Managers are given lots of freedom to do whatever they want so new employees aren't protected if something is mishandled or if that manager does not like you."

I have been here 3 years and now to keep from giving me what is due me they are going to take my position and make me wait on my annuel for more money when in fact the position I am being put back in I havent held in a year and I was capped out.
