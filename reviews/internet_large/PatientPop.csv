3,PatientPop,lacking empathy,2022-03-09,1.0,Team Lead,work life balance was nice,"I worked at his company for almost 5 years. my father passed away unacceptable and I didn’t even get a slack message expressing condolences. after blood, sweat and tears at the company since the beginning and being in a management level role I was appalled from the lack of support and empathy. the day I got back after 4 weeks, I was told my role was expected to take on several levels of tasks that wasn’t aligned with my title. this spoke volume to me and made me realize I didn’t matter and my work to build a department wasn’t worth my effort. just terrible."
4,PatientPop,Vet Your Options,2022-03-01,1.0,Sales,"- Friendly coworkers 
- Some managers
- Great place to develop your sales skills","This is a very honest review in hopes to help someone out. Please do not ignore the negative reviews on here and vet your options.

You need to be the type of employee to really put your head down and get the job done. Sales at PatientPop is a very demanding job and time management skills are necessary for success. High activity metrics and tough, often uninterested, prospects. Thanks to the amazing training team, some managers. and teammates, I was able to refine my sales skills and truly grow into a top performer. Unfortunately, past this “honeymoon” stage I was severely disappointed with the company.

The product is sub-par at best. At this point, there are so many other companies out there doing just what PatientPop does, but better and cheaper. Doctors are often shocked at the price and those who sign up often churn not too long after. Seriously, the churn rate is ridiculous. If you look at PatientPop's Google reviews as well, there are several dissatisfied doctors.

I remember reading bad reviews on Glassdoor before I took the position years ago. I thought to myself, “whatever, that‘s someone else’s experience and I will forge my own path.” Parts of me wish I could go back in time and slap myself before accepting the offer. In all seriousness, I gave the company a shot multiple times and they fell short every time. There was a lot of smoke and mirrors - a lot. Employees often felt distrust with upper management and the feeling of just being a number. They may make you feel valued for a little bit, but when it comes down to promotions or action, they never deliver. This has been the experience of over 10+ people over the course of 1 year. It's become the norm and their reputation now. Just look at the past reviews from years and years ago! 

I think the true tipping point for me was when I heard through the grapevine some senior managers were gossiping about some of my colleagues and I. I have worked at other companies before and the lack of professionalism really pissed me off. Leaders should not lie, gossip, or make employees feel unsupported. No smart person wants to work under people like that.

Now with so many top performers leaving, I hope the company takes accountability and improves processes for the future success of the company and their employees. If not, attrition will f them over.

If you can deal with the bs, it’s a great place to develop your sales skills - because it’s a hard job."

6,PatientPop,PatientPop is Elite!,2022-02-23,5.0,Sales Representative,PatientPop is a company for the people. They are so good to their employees as well as developing them work wise but more importantly as better human beings. The managers are also a key factor as they guide their teams into success and better opportunities for the future with PatientPop.,The only con i can think of is we are yet to be in person and experience that social aspect of work. But that isn't even PatientPop's fault as soon we will be in office.

8,PatientPop,Great company and leadership,2022-02-23,5.0,Sales Development Representative,Great leadership development and training enablement for new hires. Unlike any other company I have been to and the culture is unparalleled.,"Base salary is lower than I would like and can be less than needed for comfortable living, but if you are good and make a lot of sales, it is sufficient."
9,PatientPop,Great Company,2022-02-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great company to work at,Not many cons for Patientpop
10,PatientPop,"a toxic culture of bullying and gossip, lies about promotions and sketchy payouts",2022-02-16,1.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"you get to meet great coworkers who you can learn from and with, potential to network and have connections for when you inevitably leave the company. A lot of people who quit refer others who quit to better jobs","The sales org promotes a culture of bullying and gossip, teams and individuals talk about each other. The reason it's such a red flag here is that it's actually encouraged and fostered through the managers themselves who promote that behavior under the guise of ""competition"". (Managers explicitly asking team members who their biggest competitors are that they want to go after, referring to other people at the company as dumb, and comparing everyone). Just the most unprofessional management style, they don't even try to be formal about it.

You will be trained for months only for the manager who takes you on to tell you to forget everything you were taught while making fun of the training managers for not knowing what they're doing. Once you're in the job you'll be hit with expectations for promotions, only for your manager to vacillate and sway constantly with new reasons why you can't be promoted. Maybe you haven't hit your extremely difficult metrics(fair), but if you are doing well maybe it's because you don't embody good ""company culture(:"" and didn't create a <3*~brand~*<3 for yourself at the company. 


They over-promise and underdeliver. Reps get strung along and told they can be considered for a better position(the only sustainable way in this company is to leave the SDR role, the role is not designed for long-term, you will be making at least 50 cold calls every day while being underpaid. You either ""make it"" to a new position or get pushed around and talked down to until you leave.) 

They benefit off of new hires who are eager to impress and work excessively (I've seen many reps work weekends, vacations, and after hours while not logging anything, in hopes that they'll hit their numbers or at least be recognized). The reps are overworked under the guise of a hustle rise-and-grind culture. Eventually those reps realize the entire thing is smoke and mirrors and leave, but new hires are already on their way in to replace them until those new hires leave too. Constant stream of people being hired while the most senior people leave.

A few people get ""promoted""(which the majority of the time is only a lateral promotion anyway. They are just pushed into an entirely different field under the guise of a promotion- usually in customer support! The others stick around hoping they get a closing sales role. It's so sad to watch, since no one's happy and everyone's sticking it out just a bit more. The smart ones(usually the top performers) eventually realize how much time they waste waiting on management to follow through on their word, so they secure a closing position in a different company and quit. When all of the top performers leave a role and the most senior people in it have only been there a year, that's not a good sign! 

The managers explicitly tell you that you're ""paying your dues"" with this job. At one point my manager laughed and joked that they couldn't pay her enough to do our jobs, told us it ""sucks to be you"" and she had to do it too but it was worth it because she's made it now.

There is a huge disconnect between upper and lower management, and aside from the lies and confusion that causes, commission paychecks end up being weirdly off. Just absolutely no transparency at all. You'll get your paycheck and have no idea what's happening.

There are so many better opportunities out there that will help you get your foot into tech sales. More importantly, there are real opportunities out there to work in an environment where you're treated with honesty and respect, and given the opportunity to be promoted. Don't settle!"
11,PatientPop,Not paid what I’m owed,2022-02-15,2.0,Sales Development Representative,"The people are nice, at least over Zoom",Management is new and inexperienced when it comes to communication. Commission structure is inconsistent. Paychecks are often not accurate. Not honest about promotion to the point where every top performer in Sales ends up leaving.

- I was lucky to have a boss that truly cared about me
- When the company was in person - the dogs - one of the biggest perks of the company","- Very young co-workers
- Low salaries - once they even promoted people giving them company options instead of a salary increase 
- Low morale - everyone are looking for new jobs
- Unstable workplace - high turnover and now that the company is merging with another - I wouldn't be surprised if there will be massive layoffs coming
- One of the board members of the company has a pretty scary background - beyond his famous last name, he was also charged for assaulting his wife and had to step down from heading a company due to misconduct with workers at the company"
14,PatientPop,Great culture but low salary,2022-02-09,3.0,Implementation Specialist,Great culture. Diverse workforce. Very strong onboarding program for new hires. Everyone interested in helping you.

-Management is easy to speak with and understanding of Work/Life Balance 
-The product is exciting and constantly expanding 
-Working from home is such a huge benefit 
-Enablement is constantly training teams on new product launches","-Pay is below market standard 
-Clients are constantly upset based on expectations that are set with them during the Sales Cycle. Our sales team definitely gets practices across the finish line to sign the contract and boost sales numbers, but clients seem to become frustrated and feel misled as they enter the onboarding side and realize some of the features they thought we could offer were empty promises. Unfortunately, even though this is called out, Sales very rarely takes accountability for the upset client and other teams are forced to bear this burden. 
- Our engineering team is spread far too thin.
- High Turnover within many departments 
-No 401K matching 
-Client Confusion: due to changes in the CSM org, Lots of clients seem to be confused on who their point of contact is whenever they have an issue, and just reach out to any PatientPop email they can find in their email history. This leads to a lot of client frustration."

23,PatientPop,"Not the worst, but not the best",2022-01-16,2.0,Customer Success Manager,The people are great. Position is remote.,"A CSM at this company is simply an extension of customer support. The base pay is low for all you are required to do. Employee turnover rate is really high. Too focused on selling product and not enough on building a strong relationship with clients, thus the reason why there is a high client churn rate."
24,PatientPop,Great Company,2022-01-11,5.0,Project Manager,"- very organized workflow on every level

25,PatientPop,CS Cleans Up the Mess of Sales,2021-12-29,3.0,Customer Success,"- Management will try to support you
- Great benefits
- Fun company culture
- Internal mobility is great
- Teammates are great, fun to talk to. Will try to help you and answer questions.","- Now that I've been with PatientPop for a while, I can truly express what I think.
- We do not have enough support reps or CSMs to help customers in a timely manner
- Management needs to hire and train more people, we are severely understaffed
- Support cases are sitting in the queue for over a month sometimes before they are actioned. Even when I ask management to escalate the request, the case will still sit there. 
- It's frustrating having to tell doctors that you can't do anything because you are waiting on another department to their damn job. 
- SDRs and AEs need to better vet the practices that they sign on. Doctors will be unhappy with the product/service and after looking at their account it's not hard to see why. CS has to clean up the mess of Sales and its unfair. 
- The software is only beneficial to practices with a two way or one way integration, I think it's misleading to sign on practices that cannot integrate their EMR and then charge them full price for a software that they cannot even use to it's full potential
- When you need help with a case, management will try to help by pointing you in the right direction, but half the time you will get thrown for a loop and if the case isn't resolved in time then you get in trouble
- I think management is only good at managing people, they definitely struggle with product knowledge themselves and it's difficult to action a case when they cannot help and then tell you to go ask someone else. 
- CS deals with a lot of angry customers that do not understand tech or the product they signed up for. Doctors expect us to put them in the #1 position on Google but don't understand that they need to use the software in order to see the results they want, PatientPop is very much meant to be self-service and sales needs to do a better job of communicating this to the customer.
- I think PatientPop needs to focus on building a solid product and setting customer expectations before they sign on. I guess it's just part of the sales pitch to not reveal everything to get them to sign because then they are stuck in an annual contract and have no idea about the Terms of Service.
- Pay is a little low for the industry, this is a good job for right out of college but I would move on in about a year, you could make more elsewhere without the unnecessary stress of this job
- I think the responsibilities of this job do not match the pay what so ever and although you do get commission, if the customer cancels the add-on that you sold them within 6 months then PatientPop will take the money back out of your pay check.
- They do not match your 401k contributions
- I don't think PatientPop is a bad company to work for, I think they have a lot of growing pains to work through."

45,PatientPop,Smoke and Mirrors,2021-08-30,1.0,Customer Success Manager,"- Headquarters are in Santa Monica with some great places to eat, the beach, and workout spots.
- Dog-friendly office.","I went into PatientPop knowing the pay wasn’t great but wanted to learn more about health-tech, so I thought it would be a trade-off to break into the industry. Something I quickly realized is that PatientPop is a lot of smoke and mirrors.

Customers: The sales department is very good at what they do. Unfortunately, that leaves the customers believing they are getting products that don’t exist. As well, the PatientPop portal is not the most user-friendly leaving customers calling the Customer Success team either angry or angry and wanting to break their contract which as a surprise to them is binding for one year. Look into their reviews at the Better Business Bureau. 

Management: While I was at PP there were special projects given out to clean up Salesforce. Then we learned that our quarterly bonuses would be incorporated into our salaries rather than paid at the end of each quarter. A couple of weeks later we all found out that we were moving from an account-based model to a round-robin where the entire Customer Success team shares customers. This model VASTLY reduces earning potential as Customer Success Manager’s no longer service the same accounts. People started quitting left and right with no new hires to take their place, leaving the remaining employees to manage even more accounts for less pay. 

Employees: Upon first meeting, everyone seemed upbeat, friendly, and happy. Then things got weird. Gaslighting from the HR department about benefits they said we had during orientation, but later said we didn't. Bullying from a female employee who would make backhanded compliments and take over my desk. As well, a colleague of mine was called into a meeting with management for not being a ""team player"" in a Zoom team meeting. All because he wrote in the chat that some people had questions, could management slow down and answer some of them. PatientPop is never wrong, you are."

- good wlb
- young and inclusive team","I joined recently ignoring the negative reviews here, I'm planning to switch soon. Here's what I've experienced: 

- Company is trying to cover too much feature but there aren't many people in R&D and are spread too thin 

- The architecture doesn't seem to be well thought out, in trying to ride the microservices wave they've developed a Distributed Monolith. Delivering a simple feature needs multiple projects and teams getting involved and takes way more time. 

- Due to #1 & #2 devs are burned out while missing the milestones multiple times and leadership considers this dev team's fault somehow even though most of them weren't the ones making the architectural decision at the beginning. 

- Customer churn out also seems to be high. I don't fully know that side of the story but I assume it's related to above concerns. Fixing a small issue for customer takes a lot of planning and missing milestones multiple times."

The company has pushed open communication, support and guidance during this wild time. Each department has it advantages and the beauty of the communication is that the entire organization leans on each other - egos are checked at the door and the overall mission is to help practices and each other grow. The amount of learning and development I personally have received in addition to what I've seen others receive is phenomenal. This has been a transformative and hectic year, both professionally and socially, PatientPop has created the space for conversation, growth and potential.

They were equally interested in how they could be a good fit for my goals, as well as what I can do to contribute to the company culture and overall mission. As I have started my journey, I can feel a concentrated effort from seniority to try and connect with me, even as I begin working remotely.","After I accept my offer and was congratulated, I didn't hear anything from anyone for about a week, which made me a bit nervous.

PatientPop is a not a job for the feint of heart, you will need to be engaged, proactive and comfortable with change (our CEO often refers to working at PatientPop as an MBA experience - he's not wrong!). However, you will be surrounded by incredible peers who will challenge you to grow, think different and collaborate to move the company forward. Working at PatientPop has allowed me to become more comfortable giving and receiving feedback, become more adept at navigating ambiguity and, prior to COVID, meet some wonderful office pups :). If you are looking to be a part of an incredible team and and challenge yourself to grow in your career look no further. As an added bonus you'll be helping medical practitioners provide care to patients during this incredibly demanding time.","I've been fortunate enough to be able to transition to remote work during the COVID pandemic but it hasn't always been easy. I feel that everyone who is currently working remotely shares some of the same concerns around work/life balance, zoom fatigue and more.

85,PatientPop,They're trying and failing,2021-02-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The exec team are genuinely nice people - no jerks.
- When layoffs happened following COVID in 2020, the co-CEOs took their pay down to $1 and the entire executive team took a pay cut so that they could continue offering health insurance benefits to the people who were laid off for a few extra months after their termination - the exec team does genuinely care about their employees as humans.
- The leadership provides a lot of transparency about company performance
- Most ppl are really nice
-Maternity leave is decent for an American company: 12 weeks of fully paid leave for mothers, and 2 weeks for fathers.
- While the PTO policy of 15 days isn't great, the 6 extra flex days are really nice and can be used for anything.
- It's a supportive, relaxed, modern team culture all around, not frigid or overly strict. 
- Healthcare package is really good: options for inexpensive (but comprehensive) PPO or zero-cost HMO.","Most of the problems with this company stems from the fact that the product wasn't built for scale. It's a highly manual, extremely broken product that looks impressive on the surface, but doesn't perform for most customers or requires manual processes, or is only a fraction of what other vendors can do.

As a result of the broken product, 40% of the entire employee base sits in the CS org, because it requires that many ppl to do manual tasks. IMAGINE 40% OF THE COMPANY BEING CS. Does that sound like a scalable model? The execs will say it's because they care so much about the customer - the reality is because the product is highly manual and requires a bunch of low wage workers to finish the task. 

As a result of requiring so many CS people, the pay is 15-30% below market and it's very unlikely you'll be promoted because they can't afford it. As a CSM with a ~2-4 years of experience, you can expect to make only $68K per year and a highly specialized ops person can expect to only make $85K per year. 

The other part of the problem is that the execs REFUSE to admit that the product stinks, and has convinced themselves that the product is innovative and unique. There's no innovation here. The product & engineering teams are forced to launch MVPs that are copied, and a small fraction of what other vendors can do. They are then moved on to a different project because of another re-org or ""strategic shift"" before they are given a chance to optimize the product OR they're terrible at their job but the exec team refuses to admit it and help them get better.

Lastly, while management says they want to implement change, they are incapable of doing so. They are too scared to make any decisions, too scared for how they'll be perceived, too busy to actually get involved, and too inexperienced. So they pass off the work to the mid-level managers, but don't approve anything to be rolled out."
86,PatientPop,Everything I was looking for!,2021-02-24,5.0,"Senior Manager, Customer Support","Four years ago, when I first joined PatientPop, I was looking for a company in which I could learn and grow, one that provided transparency into the overall business (goals, performance, etc.), as well as ""the why"" behind decisions made that had an impact on team members. Four years later, I can say with absolute certainty, that I got all of that and more. PatientPop has been an incredible place to work, and joining this team has been the best decision I've made for my career to date.","While this has not been a ""con"" for me, and may only be one for some, it is worth noting for those looking to join this company that PatientPop is a performance-based company; one that will ask to get the very best out of each team member. To be successful requires an openness to feedback and coaching and drive to give your all on a daily basis. If you're looking to grow and learn from some of the best in the business, and willing to put in the work that comes with it, PatientPop is absolutely the place for you!"
87,PatientPop,Work here if you're a masochist,2021-02-23,1.0,Customer Support Representative,"Every two weeks they deposit money directly into your bank account
Some of the people are cool.
Santa Monica is fun. 
There are dogs in the office.","The amount of money they deposit isn't enough for how much work you do, or the abuse you take. 

This place is just bad. There are no true positives that doesn't have caveats. 

Are the people cool? Some of them sure. But most are either terrible at their jobs and/or selfish. Even most of the cool people are so burnt out by the other terrible selfish coworkers, that they've become terrible and selfish themselves.

Now what you might be thinking 'If your coworkers are doing so poorly, why don't you go to management?' 

If you do, it will 100% be brought up in your performance review as a negative. ""Focus on yourself' they'll say. It doesn't matter if you meet every (unreasonable) metric they give to you, you should do your coworkers work in silence and thank them and the company for the privilege. That isn't hyperbole, management has actually said 'you should be thankful you have a job' when people have complained about the working conditions. 

Is the location cool? Sure Santa Monica is beautiful and fun. Don't expect to enjoy it. You're timed to the second on any lunches or breaks, so hurry back. You won't feel relaxed or recharged from them since your team lead will be watching you with a metaphorical stop watch. After work you're so burnt out that you won't want to visit the beach or any cool bars. And you're hardly paid enough to afford them if you do. 

Are there dogs in the office? Yeah! And some are cute too. Too bad you're shackled to your desk and can't interact with them anyways. Even if you did, most of the dogs are on other teams, and teams at Patient Pop hardly interact. Each team hates pretty much every other team, and for good reason too."
88,PatientPop,Entry Level In Disguise,2021-02-18,3.0,Customer Success Manager,"- The company is mature and structured well so you can take that information along to another company to help build frameworks. 
- The culture is pretty fun and positive internally.","- The product doesn't work for the majority of customers 
- The discrepancy from what sales promises and what CS can deliver on is astronomical. 
- The customers are doctors who don't understand the product at all and expect to get x number of patients per month.

-Ability to work remotely
Pre-Covid:
-Dogs in office
-Central Santa Monica location
-Good snacks/catered lunch once a week","-Management seems VERY disconnected and disengaged with the team. It's a heavy numbers game.
-People have been quitting non-stop, all across CS, and since positions aren't being backfilled that work falls on everyone that's left - creating very bad burn out.
-Unrealistic metrics, and dangling tiny bonuses in front of you to chase them.
-When sick or on PTO, you need to make up all of the cases you should've been closing either before you go or after you come back, which strongly discourages you to take leave as needed without feeling burdened that you need to burn yourself out closing cases before you go, or dreading coming back to have to try to catch up (while still closing your daily goal).
-Pay is said to be in about the 50% percentile of similar sized tech companies, but in my searching that does not appear to be the case, especially for being in the heart of Santa Monica."

I've also been able to grow my career in just the short time I have been part of the company (1.5 years) and know there is still a lot of room for me to grow. Having the support of my manager and peers makes me feel valued and validated. It's a really exciting time at the company, as we are delivering new product and scaling - it's the perfect time to join a startup.","Not really any cons. If I had to think of something, it might be that we have been working remotely for about a year now. It's hard to replicate the amazing culture we had while in office. While the company tries keep employees engaged with different events and activities, it is not quite the same as being able to chat with a coworker in the kitchen, or turn around and get an answer immediately. On a positive note, the leadership team has taken measures to compensate for the remote work culture, providing company recharge days, flex days, work from home stipend, updated onboarding program, etc."

HR even said they will not take cost of living (this is a company with an HQ in Santa Monica, yea?) into account. No real values. Everyone are burntout. I don't know even one person that does not look for a new job. Diversity and inclusion is horrible- HR is barely involved. Instead, a bunch of poor employees that joined into a Diversity Committee are assigned for tasks that should be someone else's full time, paid, job (ermm.. HR?!) - they were even assigned to create presentations, throw events, assemble focus groups, create new company statements, and interview consultants. Guess what, once again minorities are working more and are not getting paid for it. Ironic. The majority of the people that were involved in the Diversity Committee has quit their jobs already. People have been quitting like crazy. There is no culture at all. The company did NOTHING for the holidays, not even a Zoom ""happy holidays"" session. OKRs continuously push people to the edge and continue to increase every quarter regardless of the feedback or lack of resources. Horrible."

You will get to wear many different hats and the opportunity to jump on projects that interest you are always available. The company seems to be doing pretty well despite the pandemic. You will also get to work with so many amazing people who care about their contribution to the company. The managers are all very smart and passionate about PatientPop's mission. You will learn the inner workings of a successful tech start-up.,"The organization recently switched to a pod-based account management style, so you don't get your own book of business if you are SMB. CSMs now have to be on call answering phone calls and taking inbound customer inquiries all day. This makes the job feel a lot like support, and with so many CSMs quitting, the workload gets more demanding. Every day feels like a sprint, which is mentally draining. The staff and the customers disapprove of pod-based account management but it saves money because you don't need as many CSMs. They claim that the switch is to benefit us. It now feels like a reactive job, management will tell you otherwise. You spend a lot of your time dealing with cancellation requests, you have to resell the benefits of the platform to customers on every call.

It’s easy to get promoted if you can stick it out that long. Turnover is high so seniority is easy to achieve and seniority = promotions.
You might meet a friend (they might be gone in a month though)","I’ve worked at multiple startups and this needs to be said: PatientPop cannot blame it’s deeply toxic culture on startup growing pains. PatientPop has a leadership issue that’s created a toxic pit of a workplace. I know numerous employees (who have since left) who developed extreme anxiety disorders due to working here. It all starts at the top, and I believe at this point it’s nearly impossible to change.

I was at the company for a few years and what I found is that every talented person who’s hired leaves as fast as they can. So get ready to work with a bunch of kids who have no idea what they’re doing. If you ignore my advice and do decide to work here, you’ll see first hand that these are same people who rise up and get promoted — the laziest, most unethical members of your team — the same people you’ve been “cleaning up after” all year. They have seniority because they’ll never leave a job where it’s essentially impossible to get fired, even if you’re barely working at all. This is one of the most common customer complaints (tasks not getting done) and the company is doing nothing about it.

Working cross functionally is also a nightmare. In CS, you better know how to do every job in the department or all of your clients will be upset. Escalating issues to the managers on other teams gets nowhere. Escalating issues to managers on your own team results in crickets. There is ZERO, and yes I mean absolutely ZERO, accountability. You won’t want to work either under these conditions, and eventually you will become one of the “bad” employees as a result...or you’ll be smart and just leave. 

Oh, and in case you’re wondering, HR does not seem to take complaints seriously (to be fair this comment is based on what I’ve heard from others, not personal experience). You might be harassed (seems to happen more frequently than it should) but in the end, you’ll be the one looking for a new job. 

Overall, at the very start of your journey with PatientPop, recruiters will lie to you and you’ll find out just how badly within your first week. This will leave a bad taste in your mouth that never goes away and only gets worse. That’s because it’s baked into every layer of the company. No one has any interest in helping anyone but themselves at PatientPop, and you’ll feel this attitude rub off on you too. After leaving PatientPop for a better job (or ANY job), trust me on this, you’ll need some time to wash the toxic sludge off. Unfortunately the toxic culture is contagious and no one is immune."

118,PatientPop,Best start to your sales career,2020-12-14,5.0,Sales Development Representative,I love love love the sales team and I have only been working here for 2 months. The training managers and the other reps are all super helpful and give you all the resources/tools to really learn what it takes to be in sales. There is a lot of opportunity for growth!,"Low base salary, not willing to negotiate"
119,PatientPop,Awful Company Offering No Innovation,2020-11-30,1.0,Implementation Manager,There are great people that have found themselves in tough situations working here. The comradery that working in these uncomfortable circumstances creates is amazing and you receive a support system like no other from your peers.,"The quotas were difficult and promotions were dangled and swiped away based on cherry-picked metrics (qualitative or quantitative). The compensation is appalling, even more so when you take location and workload into account. The biggest con in my time there was the lacking training and managerial support provided as a new hire. The training consisted of slide decks that are neither comprehensive or speak to the multitude of caveats that undoubtedly arise with each customer. The product is not innovative. It's b2c marketing targeted towards healthcare providers. This is a tech company funded by healthcare, it has limited personnel that come from healthcare and it shows."
120,PatientPop,Work here just to get SaaS experience.,2020-11-18,2.0,Customer Service Representative,You learn some things that you will take with you to other companies to get paid significantly more.,"Underpaid. Overworked. Management never listens to any the feedback they constantly ask for. Company has ""too big to fail"" mentality when half the things are burning down or breaking. The burnout is real. The PTO is horrendous for a ""tech"" company. If you call out sick or use whatever measly PTO you have left; you literally fall behind on your work due to the strict KPI's that's placed. This also impacts your chance at getting a raise since promotions are rare and practically non existent. You will have peers that are absolute trash at their jobs, and you will have the burden of carrying their workload or fixing whatever they ruined. But management will never punish those people because of seniority."

There's free food and the People team did a great job at doing little things to help with overall morale. Most team leads and managers in the Implementation department are great and truly want to help.,"Everyone's biggest complaint: the pay. It was terrible for the IM job and they later capped our OT to 4 hours/week. The IM role is incredibly stressful and other companies pay about 20% more, so if you're interested in this role I might look elsewhere because it's simply not worth it to a lot of folks.

The clientele can also be pretty rude. It might sound cool to help build the online presence for providers, however, about half the accounts you have are going to suck.

In terms of the rest of the company, you can tell there is a lot of focus on the Engineering department. Granted, they're developing some interesting products but the sites you're launching as an IM aren't as great as they advertise.

Most of the sales people that were laid off were well under 1 year of employment. Now they are restaffing the very same roles.  Be careful and know that going into Sales with this company  that it could be a temporary role if they can easily fire employees and rehire the same roles again that soon.

- Puppers in the office","Where do I start...

- Upper Management: Most of them barely know how to do the very job function they are managing and act as glorified babysitters. They are never transparent in goals and metrics as they are constantly changing and often are not received until halfway through the quarter.

- Pay: They severely underpay their employees (which results in their high turnover) and only provide the same canned response about comparing market value. 

- Growth: It's not apparent how promotions are handed out. It's heavily involved with politics and often they do not reward hard work. They see everyone as just a number in the cycle and how much they can get out of you before they fill you in with someone new. They would rather replace employees than pay to keep the good ones. It's also hard to work with anyone at all when people are constantly leaving and replaced with new hires that are still ramping. 

- Product: Their product is average. Due to the politics and constant restructuring of their Engineering team, nothing ever gets done or built. The product has barely changed in the past few years and they almost never listen to customer requests as they are just trying to keep the product as basic as possible to sell to as many people as possible. 

Get out of this dumpster fire as fast as you can. Ever since their switch to telehealth, it has been a rollercoaster of issues and them trying to sweep it all under the rug."

142,PatientPop,CSM or glorified support rep?,2020-02-09,2.0,Customer Success Manager,Proximity to the beach and 3rd Street Promenade. Opportunity to launch a career in tech without prior experience.,"Oh boy, where to start. The CSM role is sold by the recruiters as a, dynamic, stimulating role that is ""highly valued"" by the company. After a year in the role, it's clear this is not the case. The role is essentially a glorified support rep position. CSMs are constantly putting out fires, trying to placate angry customers, and having to re-sell the value of the product that was improperly sold by sales. 

Oh and good luck getting promoted unless you suck up to management and are in with the ""cool"" crowd. So called ""team lead"" roles are handed out like candy to those who play the game and dangled in front of the strong, capable CSMs as incentive to keep plugging away as  worker bees. My advice: put in 6-12 months and find a better, higher paying position elsewhere."

The list of cons is far too long to even begin. How about that PatientPop is attempting to ""thrive"" in a dying industry. St. Joseph's, Baylor Scott & White, HCA, Kaiser, Trinity, Prime; ever heard of them? Major healthcare systems are going to swallow this company whole. The new hires are hopeless, the veterans are exhausted from the constant BS/smoke & mirrors.  And what is upper management's solution? Hire more inexperienced managers to weigh down the sinking ship. There isn't a single former teammate that I can think of that gets valuable input, feedback, or advice from their manager. These employees are flat out dejected by the lack of assistance, and the incessant feeling lingering over them: to the company, you are merely number, and a replaceable number at that. If you are considering an opportunity with this company, please make sure that you exhaust all other potential suitors before landing here. This disconsolate place will rip your soul to shreds, and leave you questioning your decision not long after you sit through their worthless new training program.

I'll finish up our cons section with a quote from Serj Tankian: 
""Conversion, software version 7.0; Looking at life through the eyes of a tired hub; Eating seeds as a pastime activity; The toxicity of our city, our city
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder""

147,PatientPop,Churn and burn,2019-11-23,1.0,Field Sales Representative,"Health insurance, free snacks, fee lunch Thursday’s","Churn and burn seems to be the name of the game for PatientPop for both the employees and customers. Very high turnover and churn rate. 

Unbelievable level of micromanagement and ridiculously brutal 2 week training. Management constantly calling (2-4 times a day) to “check in on pipeline”, who’s pipeline is changing that often in a course of a few hours?! 

Product is a hard sell. It is priced higher than market competition and, like another review said, essentially vapor ware. There is not much actual technology behind it and I would not consider it SaaS as the company claimed since there is barely any actual software in the product and most of the functionality is driven by manual processes. 

As others have mentioned, this is a very young, millennial culture. It may not be a horrible place to work briefly, early in your career to try to build your resume for better opportunities. It is definitely not a good place for more seasoned or experienced people."

The clients are mentally and verbally abusive, to the point that it’s now completely overlooked and we’re all just told “whelp, it’s part of your job.” You’ll spend 50+ hours a week being condescended and patronized to by clients, and management as well. Managers heavily watch and document when people come into work and leave, and will comment if you’ve left before 8 hours, without even the acknowledgement that some people work at different speeds and if their work is done, and completed well, they should be able to leave - unless you're a clear favorite of upper management, which seems to be an ongoing trend in this department. Every quarter, they’ll add more KPI’s on top of an already ANXIETY INDUCING work volume and client-base, and act like it’ll help you when it’s really another way to effectively micromanage. They pretend to have this amazing support and loyalty to the employees but it’s another money-hungry tech startup with a product that is nearly a decade away from offering a solid solution to it’s entire client base. All-in-All: another toxic LA tech start-up in the form of an Indian call center, which tries to airbrush out the mental abuse, low compensation and patronization with dogs, location, free airline snacks, and a single ping pong table - not to mention taps that are never refilled.

158,PatientPop,The Grass Is Greener Where You Water It,2019-07-24,5.0,Customer Success Team Lead,"I worked at PatientPop for 2 years and let me just say it was the best company I've worked for. The amount of learning and growing I did here as a young professional is what has allowed me to be where I am today. I started as a CSM in June 2017 and was able to move my way up into a management role as a team lead in Dec 2018, and with that came a lot of lessons to be learned that furthered my development. 


I'll be honest, some days were tougher than others, but that's every job you're going to have. There is no perfect company where processes don't need to be changed, or communication is in tip-top shape, or the product is the best it'll ever be. That doesn't exist. I think the best part about working here is being a part of all these changes, helping a company grow, and contributing to the bigger picture. Be prepared to have things change up but don't be afraid of it, take it as a learning experience.


The reason I titled this review what it is, is really because of one person in specific...I can't really recall what month, year, or all hands meeting it was but I remember Alexis, the head of HR, getting up in front of everyone and addressing some grumblings going around the office—and what she said stuck with me day after day, and continues to ring true. She said, ""The grass is not greener on the other side. The grass is greener where you water it."" And with that she meant, instead of working through challenges in our relationships, our jobs, whatever the situation may be, we get the feeling something better exists in a different yard, and anything less than perfect won’t do. But really, perfection doesn’t exist. Working through the challenges is what life is about, it's what this is about as a startup. I recommend this place to someone that can adapt to change, roll with punches, and make the most of it. If you're someone that needs more structure or set processes, a startup environment might not be right for you.


Let's talk about the CSM role: you're chatting with doctors (or their admins) most of the time. Some calls will go great, you'll both have a laugh, share something in common, and you'll possibly get an upsell if you play your cards right. And then there's always the other side of things: the doctor is upset about something with the product, a task that was completed incorrectly, or you not following up fast enough. This isn't unique to PatientPop, again, these are things you'll hear in any account manager role. You are the go-to person so you hear it all. 


Other than that, your main focuses are to train them up on how to get the most out of PP, see how they're performing on our website/platform, listen to any frustrations and offer resolutions, and most importantly build rapport. You are their consultant. I think the key to success in this role (for me) was creating open and friendly relationships with the doctors, being empathetic and listening to what they had to say (without being defensive), and not taking anything personally. You're dealing with people's businesses here, their babies, their livelihood, so sometimes their emotions will get involved. Yes, some clients are easier than others and hopefully you get a nice, level-headed book of business, but let me tell you—it's the wild cards that helped me have thicker skin and learn something from them. Embrace the few that you'll most likely get because this will not be the last time in your life you will meet or communicate with people like this. It's good practice. 


CASH! My favorite. If you're hungry and want to make some extra money, this is the role for you. It's not as intense as sales where if you don't hit your quota you're chopped, but you do have an upsell goal—and let me tell you if you're sales focused like I was, you can take home a nice bonus at the end of every quarter. It's all consultative selling—keep that in mind—so you're not dialing for dollars. It is, however, important to know doctors businesses and do a little SWOT analysis before jumping into the call. Another thing that will help you with selling in this role is building rapport. Most of my big sales came from doctors I schmoozed with, sent holiday emails to, and even texted. This just goes to show, people don't buy solely because of your product, they buy because they like and trust you as a person. Don't believe me? Just ask Travis. If you're wondering who that is, do some research on the company before you come to the interview. 


Moving on to the CSM team—they're all gems, and I mean that. When you're on the CSM team it feels like you're part of a big family. I saw it grow from 12 to 35 within a year and met all types of different people, and let  me just say these are the type of people you want to hang out with outside of work—and that says a lot. I also noticed that everyone on our team had something uniquely special that they contributed (work related or not), that made our imperfectly perfect family what it was. They're fun, smart, ambitious, and did I mention fun?


Wrapping up my novel here, my main takeaway is this—work here. You'll learn a lot about the medical industry (and sound really sophisticated to all your friends and family when you tell them you work with doctors), evolve with a well-known startup, make some mistakes and learn from them, build solid relationships with your peers, and earn some nice bonuses. 


Oh yeah, and there's a lot of cute dogs in the office that need petting.","I do think the CSM team lead role can use some refining. Again, I totally understand with a startup comes growing pains and a lot of figuring stuff out, but really focusing on this will allow the team leads and the CSMs to work more productively.


As for the CSM role, with the high-caliber clientele PP has, less accounts per CSM would allow them to be more proactive and helpful to these doctor's, rather than reactive."

Great location right next to the beach.","They encourage a ""#RiseAndGrind"" type culture where you have come in at 7am everyday and most people put in extra hours (you're paid hourly) but you shouldn't report those extra hours or they will micro-manage you even more than they already do.

Upper management has no idea (or is turning a blind eye) to what is actually happening on the sales floor. They put out a completely different image of what we are doing. They seem to think we are selling by asking intelligent questions, showing value, or even selling to the receptionist (lol). Some of what they talk about would work if we were given enough time and had a real process to finding leads that are a good fit for the product; but the SDRs are required to adopt a ""spray and pray"" type approach. ""Make those dials!"" ""Time for a call blitz!"" is what's yelled at you on the sales floor. You have a minimum quota of dials per day and they will micro-manage you if you don't achieve it; which doesn't give you enough time to find or create leads that you think have needs PatientPop can solve.

How can you use a buyer-centric, value-driven sales strategy if you don't even know who you are calling?

Actual SDR output and deals closed takes a backseat to metrics like number of dials performed, number of emails sent, or number of demos scheduled (even if that means scheduling demos with office managers, who are easy to get on the phone and a demo but almost never close). 

Upper management also made the decision to promote an SDR class after only a few months to AE positions because they did well as a group, and the whole situation caused a lot of internal strife among the SDR team.

There are some really cool people here, especially on the AE and mid-management team, but the SDR team has a serious ""bro"" problem. A group of the SDR guys are hyper-macho, and can be shamelessly overheard in a corner talking about ""all the new hot girls they want to smash"" in the new SDR class, how much they bench, how much they idolize Donald Trump, etc. These same guys will drink and aggressively go after you if you are a girl and attend any of the happy hours after work (many girls avoid going for this reason). It honestly felt like a lot of them wished they were still living in their frat house, or watched ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" too many times and thought that's what a sales floor is like. Very toxic and extremely uncomfortable environment if you are a girl; especially if you are straight out of college and don't know much about what a professional workplace should be like."
160,PatientPop,Be careful,2019-07-03,2.0,Sales,"Fun young culture, and dogs in the office","Don’t believe everything you read on LinkedIn.   What is said on LinkedIn is to help promote them, but is not what is preached in the office (believe me I have screenshots of the opposites). Managements calendars (on the sales side) are full of meetings with other companies instead of helping their own team. It’s a very built startup with changes every week which should no longer be happening with this many employees. Get ready for call blitz’s (but that will change probably in a few months) Turnover is huge so don’t bother making friends. If you want to get promoted quickly, even though you are no where close to ready, but think that looks good on a resume, than this may be the spot. But get ready to be put in to the position to sink or swim."

162,PatientPop,Great opportunity for qualified sales reps,2019-06-10,5.0,Sales Executive,"One of the fastest growing companies in Silicon Beach, great location, lots of perks, amazing culture.

I will say I was inspired to write this review after seeing a negative post by the Kool Aid guy below.  I make over $200K a year in a role that gives me a lot of flexibility.  Metrics are important, it's how every company evaluates employees and sets goals for future months.  

The SDR role is tough.  It's a junior, entry-level position.  Because of that, many of the employees will have very little experience in sales.  PatientPop has a lot of training for this role and metrics are monitored.  Not everyone will love sales, but those that do will exceed and move up the ranks quickly.  Others that are not used to hitting quotas and positive metrics will struggle if they are not willing to put in the work.","Not so much a con but as we are a growing company, roles can change over time as the platform continues to develop"

If you are a hard working individual who cares about the quality of your work and expects that of those around you as well, save yourself time and find another company to work for. To middle management, it's about delivering a product—doesn't have to be a good one. They will deal with the complaints later.

They will pile more and more work on you as time goes on and expect you to get it done in the same amount of time, and if quality slips even if just once a month, they will keep track of it and hold it against you later. Even the best employee will make a mistake, especially when overworked and underappreciated, but that logic is dismissed here.

They will tell you there is room to work from home but then once you start, say it's up to your team lead and the team lead never wants you working from home.

I also experienced bullying here from people outside of my team and on it. Gaslighting is alive and real—even within HR. Even despite blatant proof of harassment, company overlooked and made excuses for harasser—this is ultimately why I left. They talk a lot about values but at the end of the day, it's all for show.

Great CEO's - both are intelligent, genuine and great leaders. 100% approve of them and would gladly work for them again under a different management and leadership team","Working at patientpop is working on autopilot. If you do not like to use your brain and like to copy/paste and do not like to think - APPLY HERE. If you are eager to learn, driven, ambitious - DO NOT APPLY HERE. You are hired to do menial and cumbersome work. The harder you work the less recognition you get and the more work they [management] will dump on your plate. You are simply a ""body in a chair"" and if you leave, they will hire another body - as one executive on the leadership team mentioned.  

Don't believe the ""good"" reviews - those are coming from college kids where it's there first job outside of college. They like PP because it reminds them of college/highschool days with the gossip, incest etc. You work in an office with fresh out of school kids who play harsh ""jokes"" of SEXUAL MISCONDUCT/harrassment on their colleagues. HR will reprimand as needed and these kids go on to win ""Top Performer of the Quarter"" awards - LOL. 

Middle management is a joke and they know it. They all look miserable shoving numbers down your throat while putting on a fake smile to mask that everything is ok.  Team morale is non-existant and has been this way for the past 2 years. It is clear they do.not.care. CEO's are rock solid and great people. It's middle managment that is awful and will do nothing for you. They feed you to the wolves (the clients) and hope you survive. Did I mention that it's NORMAL FOR CLIENTS TO YELL AND CUSS AT YOU on the daily and management won't have your back - you're just going to have to deal with it. 

The bottom line is - they treat their employees like they treat their customers... you get pushed from around manager to manager, no one ever has the answer, and nothing ever works. Despite the initiative you take to mitigate the lies  and grow your career on your own terms, you will hit a brick ceiling and your hard work will not be recognized or rewarded.

193,PatientPop,"Grab a cup, the Kool-aid tastes GREAT!",2018-08-07,1.0,Customer Success,"1.) This is a good transition job. Meaning if you’re moving to LA, this isn’t a bad job to have while you figure things out. PatientPop pretty much hires anyone so your chance of getting hired is high, and you can get a nice position title you may not actually have experience doing, like CSM, which is good experience to have on your resume. Having the position title and company name PatientPop on your resume will help get better opportunities down the line, but don't expect to make this your home unless you're a high level hire or an engineer. It's also a great stepping stone for those looking to get their foot in the door at a tech company, or a recent college grad who wants to see if tech is right for them.
2.) This company is very good at dangling a carrot in front of you, for example with promises of promotions and raises, so they get the maximum energy and effort out of you as an employee while actually investing very little in things like raises, bonuses, and promotions because those don't usually come to fruition. So it's a pro that you will always feel at least slightly motivated, like you're chasing something, but unfortunately you usually end up on a wild goose chase.
3.) The workload is so stressful and high volume that it will prepare you for working anywhere! The endless waterfall of work will keep you busy and make your days fly by. Your life will flash before your eyes and you might realize what is truly important to you, what you're actually passionate about, and what you actually want to do with your life, which is great!
4.) You get money when you refer someone for a position and they get hired. So if your friend is telling you to apply, that's why.
5.) You will learn about digital marketing and SEO, but will only learn extremely basic knowledge on the subject. If you're actually interested in the subject matter and want to know more, you'll have to teach yourself outside of work.
6.) Typical startup benefits like snacks, ping pong, and lunch once a week, but nothing you can't get anywhere else.
7.) Living and working in Santa Monica is great.","1.) Don't expect a raise - ever - unless your playing politics right. I was there for over a year and half with no bump in pay or promotion at all. The only thing your guaranteed as you become more senior is a company hoodie at your first yr anniversary and a company water bottle at your second year anniversary. Yes, you read that right, you get a hoodie at your 1 yr and a water bottle at your 2 yr. Your third year at the company you finally get 5 extra vacation days.
2.) The CSM position is headed in a direction where it's become increasingly salesly and quota based, straying from away from the original job description, which is to provide proactive customer service. With new metrics, processes, and ad-hoc projects being added on every week, being able to provide quality customer service is slowly going down the drain. The position title should be changed to something more appropriate, like High-Volume Account Manager or something.
3.) The workload for many customer success dept employees is high volume, high stress, and not sustainable. You will get burnt out. Combine that with the fact that many employees, especially in the customer success department, do not feel valued as an employee and it's easy to end up feeling demoralized, demotivated, and disengaged. Probably not a job you will be happy to come in to everyday, especially if you're commuting.
4.) The company praises volume and numbers over all else, for almost every employee, not just sales. This is not a company that values quality over quantity. All the leadership cares about is growth which makes for a bad environment.
5.) The CSM position is becoming increasingly micromanaged. We used to be more autonomous when I first started but every little thing is slowly becoming tracked or some kind of process built around it. It takes a lot of time to track your activities and remember what the process is for something and it takes away time from doing what's actually important, which is taking care of the customers.
6.) With the insane number of clients you have to manage as a CSM and the intense work load, you'll feel like you’re being pulled in a ton of different directions at once. Especially with all the ad-hoc projects, tasks, and processes that mgmt keeps adding on. You can’t focus on one thing for more than 10 minutes. You won't feel like you can get any quality work done, it’s just go go go. So if you're used to a project based environment, you're gonna have a bad time and will eventually hit a breaking point. The only way to get over the breaking point is to quit or realize you have to stop caring so much about the little things, and then it will become easier, hopefully. I have had coworkers break down crying next to me.
7.) This company is a revolving door. There’s a lot of turnover. A lot of current employees are seeking different, better paying jobs. I barely know anyone in the company anymore. PatientPop treats employees as expendable and employees notice, so they don't tend to stick around too long.
8.) If you want something from the company, say more pay or vacation days, they will usually say no. And if you give an ultimatum like ""well then what if I leave?"", you will get a snarky response from managers like ""it's okay, more heads are being hired all the time”.
9.) Let’s just put it this way. The founders started this company with no prior knowledge of digital marketing for the medical industry. They just thought that it’s a good idea and that there is demand for it, so they decided that they would wing it and learn as they go. It's been years since they launched and many very important things are still being figured out. Founders are looking to generate as much revenue as possible in as short a time as possible, to hopefully sell or be acquired in a few years. So execs end goal is to exit, which means their heads are not in the right place. Execs only caring about making a large sum of money down the line, which makes for a bad environment to work in. It's typical corporate American greed.
10.) The CSM job is not what you think it is. You will be misled when you're interviewing and the position will turn out different from what you expected. You won’t have time to be the proactive CSM you're imagining. You will serve as the first point of contact for an unreasonable number of accounts. And many of the accounts are high touch clients, which means they are needy. An endless waterfall of emails, phone calls, voicemails, multiple clients per week reaching out to you saying they are not happy and they want to quit, in addition to trying to get all your metrics, goals, projects, tasks, and everything else done. And then when you can’t meet your KPIs because you were not set up for success in the first place, they’ll tell you that you won’t be able to get promoted, or get a raise, because you’re not performing!
11.) You will be treated as a number here and your role will feel dehumanized. You will likely feel like a sheep following the herd, drinking the kool-aid.
12.) Managers don’t have your best interest in mind. They've been conditioned to only have the execs best interest in mind because otherwise they fear they will get demoted or let go if they advocate for their subordinates too much. Managers are just pushing the business agenda and keeping subordinates on track. Very much a top down approach. Managers make things more difficult to do by adding red tape all the time rather than trying to make things easier and more efficient."

SDRs/AEs are constantly looking for new jobs while at PP. The leadership is extremely condescending and offer no training or insight into how to develop professionally. The sales recruiters are anything but transparent and give you bogus OTE numbers just so that you sign on. You have to walk half a mile to the office because the parking lot is no where near the office. If you work early don’t be surprised if you get cat called while walking past transients. I have never seen so much turnover in an organization. NO ONE hits quota. It’s perfect for kids fresh out of college looking for experience in sales but if you’re looking for an environment that will challenge you, this isn’t it. They blind you with the flashy office and fun perks because the actual work is anything but exciting or challenging. Buyer Beware."

202,PatientPop,Account Executive,2017-12-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great health benefits, dog friendly office, great location, awesome free lunch on Thursdays","First, I would say to those considering working here, please be cautious when reading the glowing positive reviews (especially if they are from someone on the sales team). It is no coincidence that every negative review is immediately followed up with an overly positive review that tries to deny every claim made in the negative review. No person on that sales team would leave a review that said everything at PatientPop is perfect. They have a great product and great reps there who are very competitive and want to succeed. The issue is with the management and structure of the sales org. I came from a sales team that was very data driven, processed focused, and team oriented. At PatientPop it seems like they are closing their eyes, throwing stuff at the wall, and hoping something sticks. Every person on my team dreaded coming to work each day and was/is actively looking for other job opportunities.  The entire time I was at PatientPop, not once did we have a meeting with the entire sales team (all SDR's, AE's, AAE's) to discuss the state of the business, where we were at on our goals, training to discuss how we can get better, etc. There are very basic things missing that every sales org should have. It is clear that management has not been given any type of training on how to effectively coach sales reps and how to work together as a team. You have a team full of hungry, intelligent reps who want to succeed. When an entire team of people is performing poorly, it is not an issue with your reps, but your leadership team."

234,PatientPop,"Hard-working and rewarding start up company, culture, and vision",2017-06-30,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Great company culture and values. Employees are young, motivated, hungry to learn, and fun. Coming from the dog-eat-dog world of my last job, it was refreshing and inspiring to come to a company and work with like-minded individuals who are big on elevating each other as teammates and having fun while doing it. Company and team goals are ambitious, but you gotta aim high to land high! Company is big on helping employees' build their career path, developing various skills, and on internal promoting -- it really shows that they are invested in their employees and their success at the company. As if that wasn't enough, we get catered lunch on Thursday, the office is dog-friendly, we have game nights, happy hours, and participate in other local activities as a company, like Dodgers games! Upper management/Executive team is approachable and has an open door policy for employees, which is nice and important in making employees feel valued and heard.","Start up life isn't for everyone -- it's fast paced, it's hard work, it can be 'messy' as times, processes are constantly changing while the company finds its optimal footing with different departments. So individuals who are: able to work hard, roll with the punches, are flexible in different situations, are pro's at handling various projects and tasks at once, and keep a positive attitude will thrive here. 

It's perhaps not the ideal fit for individuals who are not able to handle stress well, get overwhelmed easily, do not manage their time effectively or efficiently, aren't big on the 'team player' concept, or who aren't able to understand that a young and growing start-up takes time to mature all of its processes and that occasional mistakes are expected and are a learning opportunity to  further elevate and strengthen the company."

Transparency is also there. Free lunch every Thursday and beer on tap available after 5:30pm.","Employee retention isn't high. They are constantly burning out their employees. Most employees are working on over 100 accounts. Things are constantly falling through the cracks and management basically acknowledges this but has a very lackadaisical  view on it. If you complain that you're overworked, same excuses ""this is a start-up"" or ""things used to be worse"". Upper management and middle management don't share the same values. The messages seem great and dandy coming from the CEOs and VPs. However, when they get trickled down to middle management, it gets lost. Middle management has no experience. They just happened to be there during the huge growth of the company and got promoted. They spend a lot of money hiring great talent for the VPs positions but mishandled middle management. It's like High School Musical. 

If you have talent and are experienced, you are better off at a more established company. This company will burn you out and throw you away. If you complain, management will tell you ""start-up life isn't for everyone"". Good luck with going forward with that kind of management."

Management is awesome but they expect a lot and push hard. Decent commission plan but last year's was better.","Not an easy product to master. Customer Success dept reps are nice but disorganized and mixed messages to sales. Managers seem to be under a lot of pressure to perform, and goals are very high. They fired most of the NY team and turned over a lot of bad reps last year, which lead to us newer employees having to do more than expected.

Great benefits and opportunity for growth if you work hard and deliver results.","Startup life isn't for everyone.   It's fast paced, and we regularly run into problems that we need to fix immediately.   Communication between departments is less than ideal, but that's pretty standard at this size."
249,PatientPop,A rocketship that's getting ready for take-off,2017-01-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"PatientPop is one of those companies that startups dream of having the chance to become and it's still figuring itself out, which makes it even more exciting. It has an actual chance to change the way healthcare providers handle their marketing strategy and patient experience to match consumer expectations. In a market that desperately needs innovation - PatientPop is succeeding in building that path forward through software and it has an audience that is starting to listen. 

Will PatientPop get there? Only time will tell, but no question it has more of a chance than the 99% of other startups that exist today. It has an actual product and an actual market to go after plus the vision and strategy to execute. Furthermore, its defining the marketplace and is a first-mover which gives it a competitive advantage. 

Besides this there are lots of other positives:
- First the executive team is open-minded, listens, and willing to make decisions. I've been with this company for a while now and have seen things that were going to really hurt this company, be remedied through a plan of action and now they're a position of strength. That shows me this company has the mentality it needs and by having two co-founders/co-ceos who truly work well together - it allows us to have this collaborative approach that isn't always the case in the startup world. The rest of the executive team is also top-class in my opinion and managers are being put in a place to succeed.
- Opportunity growth certainly exists here and in fact compared to other startups I've worked for - it seems to be possible much faster. At the same time, there are a lot of young driven professionals that work at this company so people will lose out on roles they wish they could take on - its just how it works. If you have a long-term approach to working here, build meaningful relationships and do everything in your power to impact this company positively - opportunities will arise.
- The culture we're creating here is an interesting one (in a good way!) and that has something to do with the market we're going after. Building a fun, cool, innovative and forward thinking culture that sells to healthcare from a marketing/business approach is not easy in my opinion, but I like what I'm seeing. We are trying to stand out and that's exciting! Companies exist because of the people that work there and I really like the people I work with at PatientPop - it's a huge pro for me. 
- The company is located in a fantastic area in Silicon Beach, which you must factor in when comparing it to other LA companies. Don't join a startup because of the perks - those are always less fulfilling than the actual work you do","Now stating all the positives doesn't mean there aren't things to consider when working here, but the pros far outweigh any consistent cons. This company is still figuring out its culture and structure, which means things can change pretty quickly so you have to be open to that sort of identity. I've seen people come and go or be asked to leave, but the ones that are still here have earned it in my opinion and gone about building relationships within this company in the right manner. This company hires people and puts them in a position to succeed as we want people that want to push this company as high as possible an  as quick as possible so you have to have that mentality. This is teamwork first environment.

There are certainly chances you might not feel fully valued every single day or certain days will be better than others, but thats just because of how quickly this company is moving and how much work is being done by everyone - its a consistent chaos but that's what makes it fun and a unique career building experience. 

Every company has it's pros/cons and things it needs to work on. Furthermore, every employee is different in terms of their expectations and what they want out of an opportunity, but generally speaking there aren't any widespread cons that I think are going to really undercut this company at the moment. It's more a matter of will we able to figure out the right strategy and execute together on turning this company into the rocketship it has a real chance of becoming. There will certainly be ups and downs during that process, but this is an awesome company in so many ways. 

You'll notice I didn't state what department I'm in or where I'm at in terms of my own career here. I just wanted to be really honest and take a wholesome approach to this rating. Others might not feel this way and that's okay, but working at a company like PatientPop takes having some perspective. Startups move so fast and people tend to get so caught up in each day that you should always balance what you want in a job versus how the company will help deliver that over time.  This is how I feel about PatientPop today and that might change down the road, which is totally okay! Thats the fun thing about working at a startup like PatientPop - parts of the company are still being defined and you have an actual chance to help with that definition."

254,PatientPop,AMAZING COMPANY,2016-09-27,5.0,Sales,"Hands down the best career move I have ever made.  Aside from offering an incredible product, this innovative company is comprised of the most talented and hard working employees I've ever had the privilege of working with.  From the top down, every employee in this organization bends over backwards to create a cross-functional team environment that continues to improve daily.  Each individual's contribution and hard work has taken us from a small start-up to a hyper-growth company in such a short period of time.  The Exec team's open door policy has enabled employee feedback to help strengthen and improve all aspects of the business and has led to an amazing company culture.

This is the place to be if you want your hard work to stand out and directly influence the success of a phenomenal start-up.","With rapid growth comes change, so be ready to pivot, adjust, and keep going.  Typical start-up growing pains, however, exec team has been quick to recognize road blocks and adjust accordingly."
255,PatientPop,Amazing Company. Amazing Company Culture.,2016-09-07,5.0,Senior Sales Director,I was one of the first PP employees and have watched this company grow from 10 employees working out of a tiny shoe box office to 150+ employees working out of an incredible office space 1 block from the beach. I have had more success in my 1.5 years with PP than I have at any company previously. A major factor behind that is the incredible management team as well as having the Executive Leadership team being behind their sales reps 100%. They will go the extra mile to help big deals close and genuinely want us to succeed at the company. They welcome feedback and are willing to listen and make changes when they better the business as a whole. This is a great place to grow your career and have your efforts not only be rewarded but also directly impact the growth of an amazing start up. Making the decision to join PatientPop was the best thing I could have done for my career.,"Like all extremely rapid growing companies, there are speed bumps along the way with product development and streamlined operations. As long as we continue to learn and adapt with continued growth, the sky is the limit."
256,PatientPop,Amazing place to work!,2016-08-29,5.0,,"- Amazing location right in the heart of Santa Monica
- Everyone is super smart, hard-working and supportive
- I receive all the training and mentorship I could possibly need
- My work is interesting and challenging, and I feel like I&#039;m doing something important every day
- My manager is the man. Super smart, funny and caring. He treats me like a family member and an integral part of the team, even though I&#039;m very new to my role. 
- Snacks, organic fruit, amazing catered lunches on Thursdays and happy hours","- Because we&#039;ve grown rapidly in the past few months, we&#039;ve definitely outgrown our space. Meeting room and bathroom availability have kind of been a struggle. However, this is very soon to be rectified as we are about to move to a beautiful new office!"
257,PatientPop,Highly Recommend PatientPop!,2016-08-24,5.0,Customer Success,"I've truly never been happier at a company. I'm continuously impressed by the people, product, and overall vision, and wake up excited to come to work every day. That feeling, in large part, is a result of a strong executive team that encourages collaboration and welcomes feedback. I've learned so much from everyone I've worked with and look forward to all of the exciting things to come.",Bring a jacket... Office is often cold!
258,PatientPop,Dumpster Fire,2016-08-22,1.0,,Free lunch once a week. I'm writing more words here to fill the 20 word minimum because there are no other pros about this place.,This place is absolute garbage. The product is flawed beyond belief. Upper management are complete buffoons. No one takes responsibility for anything but everyone loves to play the blame game.
259,PatientPop,DONT LET THE FAKE REVIEWS FOOL YOU-STAY AWAY,2016-08-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Nothing - they treat their employees like their clients..the have a misleading business module and they barely pay enough to eat in LA but my inexperienced and incompetent managment team have huge unearned salaries..and i know this because they say how much they get paid,"Management that has little to no experience making business decisions is unreal. They let go the office in Vegas after reassuring them there is ""nothing to worry about"" At my location in Santa Monica our mangament team has no direction or clue and it shows to everyone except the COOs..The people who were capable have move on to the competitor as this way of doing business with a misleading these doctors will catch up, guaranteed"
260,PatientPop,Amazing people and goals,2016-08-17,5.0,,"Really cool people, somewhat lots of perks (like free weekly lunch weekly and happy hour). Company shoots for high achievements and encourages us to do so too. Lots of growth opportunities.",The office has an open floor plan which means a lot of noise.
261,PatientPop,Needs work,2016-07-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good insurance 
Flexible schedule","Management has no backbone
People in management with no managerial background 
Make it impossible to get bonus 
Negative work environment"
262,PatientPop,Worst start up ever! Run!!,2016-07-12,1.0,Sales Director,"Remote, Mac computer, I met a couple cool people from training, headquarters is in Santa Monica .... that's about it!","Never met the CEO for a 60 person start up
All hands calls are worse less 
No employee perks- turn over us way high
Comp plan is a joke, if you want to make a lot of money this is not the job for you 
Management is lacking normal skills
No communication-I went weeks without talking to my manager"
263,PatientPop,Company with a great outlook,2016-06-30,5.0,,"This company has an excellent product, a strong leadership team with a good idea of what they want to accomplish (no shifts, no pivots), and a great overall team with a friendly and fun culture to it ... that and a lot of other details make it a sure value for the coming years. They may not have all the bling and perks of some of the other tech startups in L.A. (though the perks are also quite nice, including the location and free lunches), but they sure do have great momentum and competency to go for them. If you are skilled and love a company/product that make waves, this is a place that should catch your eye.","Too much sun in Santa Monica?
More seriously, there are some growth pains, but these are things that usually disturb people who want a peaceful 9-5 job. In here, no time to rest, the company has momentum and you need to be willing to work for that growth."
264,PatientPop,Hot Mess of a Startup,2016-06-29,2.0,CSM/DMA,"Great health insurance coverage, nice office, pays for parking","Nobody knew exactly what they were doing at my time there. They were constantly hiring and removing positions, creating random processing without reason, and then taking them away. The company was founded by 2 smart guys who aren't really in touch with the company, so they hired random people to manage departments who are way too young and inexperienced to lead, especially when everyone is scattered across multiple offices.Nobody had any idea what they were doing, but they love to act like it. 

The work is menial, the product is underdeveloped, and then sales pushes it out and tries to scale it and the rest of the team has to make up for this overpromises. There was not alot of transparency in the company and a lot of nepotism. Stop hiring your friends (HR) and start hiring qualified candidates."
265,PatientPop,"This place is about to implode, all positive reviews are a month ago and a lot has changed",2016-06-14,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"great people, great location, snacks and free weekly catered lunch, covered parking","where do i start? its an emotional roller coaster to work at Patientpop. ""don't complain or you will get fired. you will worry about your job security daily"" is accurate. I know there's a lot more positive reviews here on Glassdoor but it's not the truth. I was surprised there aren't more negative ones but they're all outdated and show how strong the influence is to insist on things being good when they're really not. I feel bad for everyone on this team. we all work hard and we're good people and deserve better."
266,PatientPop,Great people - great product!,2016-05-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- smart, committed people
 - hands-on leadership
 - willingness to adjust/adapt/refine/revise processes and policies as needed
 - terrific product","- while not a big con, the fact that this is a start up means that process and systems are in flux; interation is an element that anyone working in a tech start up needs to recognize and understand
 - we could use more space for 1:1 meetings, team meetings
  - some folks seem not to understand how start ups work; perhaps some explanation might help?"
267,PatientPop,Absolutely amazing Place to work! Exactly what I was looking for.,2016-05-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This place is absolutely fantastic. Not only are they an extremely fast growing and collaborative start-up, but they also embody fundamental habits that epitomize how healthy companies should function today. The management is fantastic, and relly looks after each employee. I am sat down at least once week, to ask how I am doing, how things can improve, and how management can help make my job easier. I would have no problem speaking to my boss, my boss's boss, or even the CEO on any given week. 
Both the work and culture here are amazing. Days fly by because I am doing a healthy (not too little, not too much) amount of work, but also being cared for in an environment full of awesome people. I can have awesome conversations with my co-workers at any time, there are more happier hours than I can handle, and HR does an amazing job of creating opportunities for employees to bond. 
Working here has been an absolute pleasure, and am shocked than anyone thinks otherwise.","There are really no real cons to working here. 
Some people have complained about the pay, the constant changes that occur, or lack of guidance. The pay is average, it is not amazing, but they are a start up and it is more than enough to be comfortable in Los Angeles, which is saying something. Plus, if you don't like the pay, there are very upfront about it, so don't take the job.
On top of that, this is a start up. Of course there are going to be many changes as we adapt and try to make our company as best it can be. With such rapid growth, I would be more concerned if there were NOT a ton of changes. As far as lack of guidance, I seriously doubt that. I know there is not because I sit through all of the training meetings, all company meetings etc. There is so much communication, you must not be paying attention at all if you do not know how to do something."

- No management.
- You basically have to learn how to do your job by yourself, nobody really seems to know exactly the right way to do their jobs.
- Salary is the worst. Can't even pay my rent.
- They sell this job as a marketing job, when its actually data entry."
