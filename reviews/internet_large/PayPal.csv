If you are in sales, you are money motivated. News flash, paypal no longer takes care of their reps. They would rather hire people right out of college and tell them they can make 100K. We were making 180K-200K. PayPal just use their globally known name to hire/keep their reps instead of actually compensating them well. I would rather work for a company who takes care of me and compensates me well than work for a company for their name. People who get promoted are ones that management likes to take golfing and to happy hour. If you are a female you are only being promoted because they have to even out male to female ratio.
Would not recommend this job to my worst enemy. If you are about to start this job: Welcome to the sinking ship and make sure you have a life vest."

Your individual manager always tries their best with whatever information or tools they have (they are just as limited for most things).","Working on Venmo’s side of the corporation, we don’t get all the benefits that ‘actual’ PayPal employees get. Venmo customer service employees are treated very poorly with little to no communication about changes or updates about the company. When you need information, the supervisors don’t know what’s going either so they send you in circles. We don’t have the same time off benefits or shifts as ‘actual’ PayPal employees. They used to preach about opportunities but since being here (4 years) the company has had less and less and now hire outside for more roles.
Now, since working from home, there is a false sense of community and team- what is, is limited and it’s only out there so that the company can check that box.

We were constantly paid more every year, we got large bonuses and advancement came when you wanted. 

Since going public in 2016 things have been going down hill. Responsibility has skyrocketed and the amount of information you are expected to retain is endless. You need to be a psychologist, a sociologist. You need to be public relations and a product expert in 8 queues. 

PayPal has moved away from specialization in an attempt to break down silos but instead what has happened is PayPal expects more and more work and continues to hand out 2% raises for ""Meets Expectations"" and rarely hands out ""Exceeds"" especially if you are on a specialist team. 

In 2019 my pay increased from 35k to 40k which was amazing but every year there after and for a few years leading up to that we were given 2% raises which are consistently below inflation. Which means PayPal would tell me how great I am and then effectively pay me less every year despite increased responsibility. 

I have moved from frontline, to specialists in various roles to senior agent and in that time my pay has moved by a total of 3%.

Lastly, but not least, after 5 years of service, PayPal will give you a 30-day paid sabbatical for you to enjoy and will do this every 5 years you work there.","Cons ... as long as you have a growth mindset, there are no cons. You will get feedback about your performance and if you do not like it, it may bother you. But of course, as long as you are staying responsible and accountable for your work, then it should all be good. A con for me is that at the end of the day, its a job. I have to constantly remind myself that I should be thankful for all of the amazing things this job offers. For many, it has turned into a career."

569,PayPal,"Started off great, but slowly turned into a nightmare",2021-10-30,2.0,Anonymous,"When I first started with this company, I worked in operations as a phone agent, so I’ll list pros that apply to operations.
The operations team had some really wonderful leadership: folks who were constantly optimistic, inspired, and overjoyed to help their teammates grow in the company. There were a ton of opportunities to learn about other departments, partner with other teams to tackle problems, and even help our training teams manage their workload. We got to volunteer with our teams once a year, which was lovely. One year, my leader took our team on a paid “team retreat” where we learned more about diversity and inclusion in a relaxed environment. Our group leader had hundreds of people under her at one point, but was still able to focus on every individual and call out their strengths. Absolutely amazing experience. Until I moved to a support role.","Towards the end of my PayPal journey, I spent a year interning in a support role. During this internship, I was basically given busy work by my “managers” to keep me quiet, and completely ignored by them otherwise. I hoped that if I stuck around long enough, maybe I would get some actual training. Little did I know, the nightmare had just begun.

I was given the support role, and immediately discovered the pay for this “promotion to salary pay” was 2000.00 less annually than I had earned the year prior as operational leadership. But my health insurance cost nearly doubled as a result of switching to salary. So I lost money for this “amazing” new role.

Then, after a year of no training by leadership while interning, I was suddenly plunged into a hellscape of:
-still no actual training
- having huge projects flung at me without warning, usually two- three months later than I should have known about them, causing major issues for the company and my sanity
- oh by the way, these projects you don’t get notified about until they are three months in? They’re all going to be labeled “high visibility high priority moonshots” so I better not mess up, right? Ha!
- Id would be doing that moonshot high visibility top priority project that I have zero training for and require PD support for (and tell my boss this) then my own boss would go and tell PD to prioritize something else completely so it won’t get done on time and then I would get yelled at by my boss even though my boss knowingly sabotaged it for me and still expected me to complete the project according to near impossible timeframes
-I remember successfully creating a gigantic presentation I was told about last minute and presenting it to upper management to rave reviews- only for my own manager to pull me aside and say I did “fine” but would never succeed as a manager unless I dropped 1500.00 on a Carnegie Mellon public speaking course
-did I mentioned no training for this role?!
-I had my senior manager state he wanted to meet with me to discuss a list of issues I had identified and shared on yet another high priority moonshot. He insisted I set up the meeting at a very specific time, and proceeded to simply not show up. I sat in a teams meeting for 30 minutes while he refused to respond to my messages asking him to join. When I rescheduled the meeting later in the week, he showed up hostile and cranky, and when I asked him to please let me know if he wouldn’t be able to make it to a meeting, he yelled at me that he had apologized to one of my peers about that “the other day” so I needed to get over it. This manager then never spoke to me directly ever again- for a year.
-the white male management just loves talking about how they’ve recently hired “so many women and are so diverse”- meanwhile this group is less diverse than they have ever been, with all the female senior management leaving, one after the other. More on that….
-every Black, Mexican and Asian manager and their teams were abruptly moved to other departments with no warning in one fell swoop towards the end of my time with the company. Whether this was intentional or not, it looked incredibly bad on my department.
-eleven hour shifts. Probably with no lunch. Get on early enough to meet with someone in the UK(5am) stay on late enough to meet with someone in Australia (5pm) and probably have to do some extra work with India (10pm) from your phone while laying in bed. It never stops. And while all this is happening, your managers are going on vacations back to back. It’s a nightmare!
-being gaslit by management. They refuse to respond to requests for help, then find a way to blame you if things don’t go as they should. These people should not manage the department they do as they have no certifications or degrees of any kind and no knowledge on the subject. They BS their way through work and throw the “hard” stuff onto new hires and other support positions. 
- Finally, I ended up having to go on leave due to major depression prior to leaving the company. Two months in, my leave was approved with less than a week of leave time left, and I got the correspondence via email. Then, I put in a resignation three days later, and the leave was suddenly denied via paper letter because I “dressed appropriately” to go to my doctor and therefore couldn’t have been ill. Seems awfully retaliatory and illegal to me, but whatever. :) ok PayPal 

Anyway, long story short. PayPal was a wonderful place to be for nearly eight years. I loved my job and never wanted to leave. Once I started with this support role, I started hating it and had to get out for the sake of my own sanity. No job is worth crying at your desk every day over, and once it gets to that point it will likely never go back."

Yes that's right, my least preferred shift! Why bother giving us an option to rate our preferences if they would be completely disregarded anyway. Tried to take this up with my team lead in which they responded in other words ""it's in your contract so there's nothing you can do (though)"" This happened to most of my co-workers too in which I have heard are all activly seeking employment elsewhere (including myself). Also found out PayPal have just given all the new hires their first preference shift (which was my first preference) left me feeling VERY underappreciated, over worked as I am skilled in many departments.

717,PayPal,The Marie Antionette Moment,2021-09-12,2.0,Engineering,"I realized the extent of my burnout when there was an email hyping third quarter, lots to launch, we’re in a marathon but start sprinting. 4 weeks later, another email came about management's refreshing 2-week vacations, the realization of how important it was to recharge and how good it was to step away for time with their families, yet it's still 3rd quarter, so keep sprinting. 

For the majority who can’t take time off due to an overload of varying production deadlines and escalations and who start their workday earlier and end them later just to keep up, this came across as exceptionally tone deaf. Making it worse was an all hands discussing how to ensure a better work life balance—here, read some slide decks. 

What finally convinced me to write this review was when a dev colleague told me after he’d been diagnosed with a serious illness, his manager asked if he could take on an additional product launch to the ones he's currently handling. In short, it’s your own damn fault if you can’t manage self-care, regardless of the work load. 

Pros:
•	Good health benefits 
•	401k match 
•	ESPP program
•	RSUs
•	Commuting reimbursements
•	Roth 401k
•	Track free vacation - no need to put in a request for time off weeks in advance","Cons: 
•	2020 Covid moonshot attitude focus, aka “all hands on deck/sprint to you drop, people!”, is now the workstyle norm 
•	Reports overload. Multiple, often duplicate reports must be done each week. Even if there was no movement, something must get added (punctuation change, word deletion) otherwise it’s a mark against you.
•	Rampant Yes Man culture in meetings where people race to add their “wow, fantastic insight!” comments in the meeting chat just to get noticed for promotion
•	Quarterly team re-orgs that are just constant churn / chaos
•	Layoffs in January/early Feb (avoids bonus payout) 
•	Promotions are difficult to achieve. The process is pretty much where the manager who shouts the loudest in the ranking meeting, gets the promotions 
•	Fewer RSU awards 
•	Track free vacation almost impossible to use due to the workload. Most people end up only taking 2 weeks at the end of the year"

In one word until U.S management handles everything its Awesome coz they know how to take care of their employees,Pathetic indian management especially in sanctions.

-The investopia slack channel
-Focus on gender diversity","-Reorgs (and rearchitectures depending on the domain) happen nonstop
-Heavy politics. You can tell if you’ve done a project well if three other teams try to take credit for it
-My WLB is dismal. I work 12+ hrs daily. One time I had an ongoing personal emergency (which I notified my team about) and could only work a 40 hour week and I got publicly berated; I was told I needed to “grow up” and work more than 60 hours per week
-Low Pay. We already make less than industry standard, and I recently found out that I’m getting paid 20% less than the rest of my team. Upper management responded by raising my salary 3% 😐
-I have a technical background and I’m in a technical role. However a significant part of my job comes from my boss volunteering to do PowerPoints for their bosses and then farming it out to me
-Be careful who you tell your ideas to. If you show interest in something or if you think something could be more optimized, they will make you do it and own/run it addition to your day job."

Telesales turned into a nightmare once the new managment of the sales department came in and cleaned house. They let go of ALOT really great people and just let them go out of nowhere. Then came the goals... oh wow! Goals went up to an astronomical amount, they were raised by 65% , let me repeat that... 65% without ANY better leads or way of ""achieving your goal"", they jsut raised them and said well.. it is what it is. Over 10 of the most serniored sales people (including myself) had been in sales over 7 years EACH and we all left becasue the pay was horrible for the amount of work they wanted us to do. there is NO life/work balance. the goals do not match up to the pay they are giving. when going on an interview, make sure to ask ""how many seniored sales rep have left in the last 6 months"", because its been more than 10 at this date."

Please beware of their lies.","Literally everything, they lied about how they treat employees. If you get covid once you're good but if it happens to someone you need to take care of after you are out of luck. Their pay increase is base on performance but every year they make it harder and harder to get a pay increase. Oh and the bonus, you used to get quarterly bonuses now it's yearly, literally anything to make sure they save money. They are firing those that have high hourly to hire people for less pay. I had no idea about Glassdoor until another person of color that's was let go for the same lie of a reason let me know. I definitely will be tell every other person I know that is dealing with this about know about this."
807,PayPal,After COVID avoid working here.,2021-08-11,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Good benefits and work from home for those looking for that but that is about it.,"The moment their stocks went from about $95 a stock to over $300 a stock they no longer care about the employee but about the stock holder. They talk about about caring about your health and financial wellness but this is simply no true. They have changed stats to make it where the only thing that matters is how many customers you help, more of quantity over quality. 

They release products that are not completed and leave front line employees to deal with the issues and the angry customer. We are not allowed to hang up on abusive customers but only report them after the call. You can literally have every number great but if your handle time is bad you will get fired. They do not care if you have the best knowledge of any customer service agent in your team or how happy you keep customers, if your handle time is high you will get fired.

They will also blame you for technical issue with the equipment provided to you. If the laptop given to you is so slow that your calls keep dropping or it add to your handle time with a customer, guess what? It is your fault. When you contact IT to solve any issues, it never gets solved but because of this you are not able to work, guess what? It's your fault. 

When it comes to moving up in the company, hiring is about how much you are liked by the hiring manager vs how much you qualify for the position. I have 6 years of sales experience however the people that got the sales jobs have none yet were cool with the managers, same as supervisor positions. PayPal no longer cares about their employee or truly assisting customer, I no longer even use PayPal for my own business. They talk about inclusion yet it seems odd that a lot of the people being let go seem to be people of color, maybe Mr. Schulman should take a look at that before yelling out that his company embodies inclusion.

If you care about your sanity and your mental health please avoid this place like COVID. I became suicidal because everything was our fault and never GCS upper management that I am pretty certain they have never ever worked front line a day in their life."

1073,PayPal,"Negative Culture, Almost No Opportunities For Growth",2021-05-12,1.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"Job security, and great speeches from the CEO","I unfortunately experienced many critical issues working at PayPal.

The biggest issue I faced was around promotions and raises. They give each department so few allocated promotions, that most teams aren’t given even a single promotion for years. This creates a serious problem, because so many people are under leveled and under compensated, that most just decide to leave as soon as their stocks vest after the first or second year, causing a huge drain of knowledge and experience, and a never ending cycle of recruiting. 

Then, our yearly budget for raises is incredibly small. As a manager, it was disheartening to tell my direct reports that I couldn’t give them a raise more than approx. 2%, even though they deserved it, because of PayPal’s allocated budget. It really felt like mixed signals when they keep bragging about their highest profit levels ever in their earnings calls, but then tell us their isn’t enough budget for raises to keep up with inflation.

Additionally, compensation packages for new hires is reasonable, but lower than most of their competitors, which made it extremely difficult to get candidates to accept offers.

I also unfortunately experienced an issue with diversity and inclusion. When I was affected by something that at most companies would be considered a serious offense, where private personal information was leaked without my consent, I was basically told that “this is the way it is and there’s nothing we can do about it.” I felt so alone, and cried for days, and felt like all of PayPal’s messaging about diversity and inclusion and caring about minorities was all talk and no action.

All of this made it very difficult as a manager to keep our talented engineers at the company, and to have optimism when telling new candidates about the role."

Before COVID-19 period, the work life balance was decent, like an old school place good for retirement/family oriented employee.

If you are in a team don’t need to support business clients/operations directly, but just do research/develop products or model in production, you could experience more flexibilities and less politics than in my team. 

The new hire orientation was considerate and warm, I enjoyed a short honeymoon period after I joined.","My department has very high turn over rate, to guarantee their own positions, senior director/director/manager level were in a hurry to cover up issues to higher level leadership: 

(1)	Due to lack of necessary technical skills to handle tech team appropriately, insecure junior manager with banking background assigned challenging tasks to incompetent candidates and assign low-profile/labor tasks to competent candidates as a way to balance the power and keep control.

(2)	Due to frequent re-org, senior director/director/manager were afraid of themselves putting on the chopping board, they all secretly allocated some resources on seemingly fancy but not so practical prototype research/machine learning project to showcase to their leaders, and shifted low profile, repetitive job such as data cleaning to people under them. 

(3)	It’s like on a wobbling crashing plane while managers preparing parachutes for themselves because they have access to upper management’s vision change but try to keep you in the dark with nice words. 

(4)	Everyone was trying to avoid the hard work of diving deep into data. Many built their models by taking shortcut borrowing the data extracted & put in production by some poor superman(usually new hires who is in dark). Some senior staff told me, business clients and senior management only care about “you tell a good story(of model) in front of them”. Rewarding system was broken so people took advantage of it. 

(5)	Senior director treat engineers just as ”numbers” without enough respect, this mentality made the situation worse during COVID-19 period because most my teammates with engineering background belong to one ethnic group 

(6)	Play mind games with gas-lighting ability, skills, personality…or create an event/circle and leave you out to subtly hint you don’t belong, or spreading rumours among teammates or business clients to shift blames to scapegoat. 

(7)	Some manager was both pretentious and insecure, putting on the mask of innocent hard working, outgoing, knowledgeable in front of leaders/clients but turned into a type-A tyranny manner in front of subordinates. If you dare to voice opposition, she would assert authority by 
- play mind games in (6) to intimidate & shut you down
- block your model from passing legal review and enter production
- throw a bus of new unnecessary tasks at you all of a sudden 
- let other teammate take over your project ownership

(8)	Preventively give written performance warnings to employees who they suspect would leave, so that if the employee does resign it wouldn’t contribute to team turnover rate."

1251,PayPal,Best Company to Start Your Career!!! #PayPalUniversity #PayPal,2021-04-05,5.0,Software Engineer II,"I joined as a recent college graduate in pandemic, PayPal's values and mission have always inspired the work we do and the impact we create is beyond amazing. As a new joinee, I feel learning curve has been big for me and PayPal has been super supportive to help maintain WFH life balance. Why should you be here ? 
1. If you care that your work positively impacts the world and you want to be in a place that cares about you. 
2. Benefits are amazing ! Wellness days - FTW 
3. Challenging problems to solve; great work domain 
4. No late night staying at work 5. Happy friday hours are for real !",Re-orgs might happen often; but looking at a positive side - this gives you a chance to network across other teams
1252,PayPal,*** DO NOT RECOMMEND WORKING HERE ***,2021-04-05,1.0,Debit Card Support Agent,The only positive coming into work each day was seeing my coworkers and knowing we were going to endure the same hell every day. Yes they offer some good benefits but it's because it is a horrible place to work where you're just a number,"I have worked many years of inbound phone customer service jobs and I have NEVER EVER had customers treat the people the way me and my coworkers were treated on a daily basis. I am a Very positive and upbeat person and always try to find the little bit of positive in even the worst of situations but the constant verbal abuse that we had to put up with was unreal. The crazy thing is that PayPal could do something about it ---if someone can't get into their acct or give any of the personal info they should be able to provide we were not able to help them. I think as a company who claims to ""care about their employees"" they could stop the abuse. You give someone a warning if they do it again then they can only self service via the internet and if they continue being abusive you tell them they are no longer able to have a PP account. I literally had people calling me not only cussing me out but telling me to die and that my family should die and some other horrible terrible things I can not imagine EVER saying to someone I don't know who is trying to help you. I got to the point were I was suffering from severe depression because of the job and decided my mental health and well being was worth more than the money I was making there (which was just ok btw) I definitely would NEVER work for them again in any position. What they expect their employees to put up with and endure is SO unbelievable. There are WAY better corporate jobs out there with upper management that actually care about you and you're treating as a human not just another number."

I experienced 4 org changes and 6 different leaders in less than 2 years. Each one demanding a new plan and new strategy to be developed in the first weeks they took over. 

Everything is a priority and there is no resourcing to match. You take a job here, it's your 24hr a day 7 day a week commitment because ""it's a rocket ship"". 7am calls with EMEA, 9pm calls with Asia - it's normal to have 14hour days three or four days a week. 

It's a rocket ship for those with millions in stock, not the lower level employees who do the work. it's just a grind with no end in sight. You get one big project done, and there are three more you are behind on that you get called on the carpet for because that leader is upset his/her project wasn't the first one you did. 

Management runs from one fire to the next. It's all about greasing the squeaky wheels. And the politics are sooooo deep here it's crazy.

There is very little thought to longevity of employees, outwardly the CEO talks about the importance of employees, but internally he is driving programs and demanding outcomes that can't be met by the organization staffing levels. So he is stressing out every department, bursting capacity limits, and demanding more and more every week to satisfy the thirst of investors and drive the stock price up."

1454,PayPal,"Such a bummer. The business is doing very well, but I'd rather have fun on a sinking ship than be unhappy on a yacht.",2021-02-11,2.0,Software Engineer,"- The opportunity to learn about the fintech industry as well as practical system design and architecture.
- The opportunity to work on widely used products and services.
- There are loads of interesting Slack channels and groups to join around crypto, blockchain, quantum computing, cooking, you name it.","Background: I have been here < 6 months and joined remotely during the pandemic when offices are not a thing. I'm so unhappy and disappointed.

I've never started a job and have it not go well—this is new to me. Moreover, the ways that this job is not going well is surprising. My work/life balance is fine, the pay is fine, and the benefits are fine. It's literally everything else that's awful.

Onboarding and my team are the two biggest negative experiences. 

I feel like I'm burdening all of my teammates and especially my manager. I repeatedly cannot get the support I need and this has discouraged me from seeking help. The help I do get is a ""oh, you have to use this tool."" So I get referred to this tool like it's something I should know how to use when, in reality, it is a tool that was built internally at PayPal and I, as a new hire, have a 0% chance of knowing how to use. 

In general I'm drowning in a pool of abbreviations, foreign terms, and a lack of context. Documentation is scattered in confluence and mostly outdated. Reading source code is a good way to learn, but it's unfortunately the only way to learn at PayPal. When I ask for more help I'm either ignored or I another suggestion made without enough context.

Communication in general is poor. My team is mind-blind when it comes to onboarding a new hire. They seem to not understand that I don't yet know how things are done at PayPal and they can't remember how to set up a new developer for success. Finally, there is 0 enthusiasm on my team. Nobody loves what they do and that is tragic. This is also a byproduct of lackluster management. I've tried to cultivate team spirit, but I feel stupid for doing so when it is met with nothing.

Working at PayPal feels like eating by myself in a massive food court. I think there are teams out there that are fun and productive, but my team is the opposite. I'm just a newbie floating around waiting to be terminated. PayPal feels like a corporate blob and I have zero personal connections with my team. I feel as if I am burdening them and as well as my manager. I feel bad that I'm not instantaneously up-to-speed. 

Finally, a re-org eliminated a team member out of the blue and it gives me no security as I feel like my team doesn't like me because I'm new and stupid.

The business is doing well, but I'd rather have fun on a sinking ship than be unhappy on a yacht."

To put it into perspective a bit, in my opinion the only thing you might have trouble with is, if you are in the bay area, Seattle or somewhere with comparable cost of living and want to buy a house. If you are renting or live somewhere else I think you should be fine. I still think you could buy a house in these areas but it will take a decent amount of saving. I would guesstimate for myself 3 - 5 years for a down payment of between 10% and 20%, on a house in the $1 million range. Living decently comfortable.

1808,PayPal,All fluff but no love for dedicated workers...,2020-10-07,2.0,Analyst,"(This is a review for PayPal after acquiring Hyperwallet)

Pros (a few of which are partially thanks to Hyperwallet pre-acquisition):
- An existent workplace social life with various events happening throughout the year, for those who are into that.
- Stocked kitchen with snacks and beverages, occasionally getting treated to catered meals for special events or meetings.
- Happy Hour on Fridays (free beer and wine).
- Nice, modern office space.
- Lots of great people to work with, learn from, and socialize with, locally and abroad.
- Lots of fantastic management that do whatever they can to help you develop, but unfortunately don’t have much power in the administrative side of things.","Cons (largely appearing after PayPal’s acquisition and somewhat pertaining to a certain department):

- Certain departments had varied benefits and were structured differently upon acquisition (such as some going hourly, not receiving stocks, while others were on salary and stocks were granted). It produced a feeling of unfairness as the departments in question were very, VERY small and quite cohesive prior to the acquisition, even with salary and task differences. Understandable that PayPal had to align the positions to their own departments, but it felt like the local departments just split off and became almost foreign to each other, in a very negative way, not only compensation-wise, but even socially. 
- Employees in certain pay grades (not necessarily C-level but just employees in different departments) appeared to be treated quite well, while employees at lower-level pay grades were always given the short-end of the stick (less benefits, minuscule bonuses, etc.), even with years of loyalty and hard work. Never seen such a disparity in treating coworkers at any other company in terms of benefits.
- Competitive culture with what felt like a lot of elitism between certain individuals and teams once the acquisition happened. The acquisition seemed to put a lot of people up on a “high horse” which was laughable to see. Lots of petty drama too. 
- PayPal likes fluffing themselves up on all the good they do and the record profits they make, and though they may do good, they don’t necessarily translate this to their employees in terms of wages and job security. They could do much, much more for their employees, particularly at the lower levels.
- Further on the outsourcing: after acquisition, teams overseas were trained on local work and although job security was reassured, that promise was not held up... you can see where that leads to. Plenty of false promises that your job will be secure which turned out to be a lie. 
- Salaries and hourly wages were laughable in some departments compared to similar positions at other companies. It was easy to understand why people left one-by-one after the acquisition.
- Raises were meagre and non-negotiable despite record profits and despite you working yourself to the bone... so there’s really no incentive to work hard as you’ll get compensated in peanuts anyways.
- Higher-ups abroad have an eat-breathe-work attitude, with little to no work-life balance that felt like it was pushed onto lower-level employees at certain points.
- Quantity over quality was key and encouraged... which led to an enormous amount of time wasted fixing stupid mistakes made when rushing the work. 
- Little opportunity to move around or up in Vancouver unless you move to the US or overseas. Was a lot different with Hyperwallet where there were opportunities to learn new skills and take on new positions with no prior experience. 
- Just another giant tech corporation. Free snacks and t-shirts are nice, but I’d rather skip that and get compensated and treated fairly.
- Dan Schulman seems to have good interests at heart but it feels like it gets severely bumbled somewhere down the corporate ladder."

Competent salaries and benefits;
Great campus and cafeteria.","Following data points are specific to my experience and doesn't necessarily mean all teams suffer from the same. This feedback is specifically for Data Infrastructure team.
(1) People who have worked in the company for many many years don't share any knowledge or information to new staff. Extremely political. They feel their jobs at risk if they share any knowledge / subject matter which makes the environment highly toxic. I had to go run around people for permissions/ approvals, information shared is highly cryptic and misleading.
(2) Managers here lack leadership skills. They don't have a vision and are never sure of their roadmaps. They prefer to be people managers for HR purposes. I had to go to skip level to get help but even they were of no help.
(3) Chennai mafia - Yes, the office in Southern India is full of highly toxic personalities, scheming, misleading, extremely manipulating. They have subject knowledge but they are absolutely difficult people to work with. It's a shame that most of the Engineering resources are situated there.
(4) Insane and inhuman scheduling of meetings in late nights for visionless, directionless endeavors. Following Agile for a meaningless projects, blame games make your life stressful. I had to attend at least 10 meetings a day from 8 am to 11 pm. What a culture!"

-the company has been constantly re-structuring and centralising more and more decision making out of California. The aim of doing so is sound but it’s simply not worked and made the regional offices in Europe far less effective. Ultimately PayPal has become like any other big US corporate, obsessed by KPIs, sales pipelines and maintaining control. most of the long serving European leadership has left and the brain drain is still continuing now.
-some senior leaders in Europe were dispatched from the business in quite a nasty way in cases.
-Some leadership in US often have limited understanding of the payment landscape in Europe, leading to flawed commercial and product strategies- which staff on the ground are more powerless to influence than before
-limited technical roles in Europe leading to eventual career plateau unless you’re happy to move to the US."

Opportunity to collaborate across multiple teams but everyone belongs to a relatively small team.
Teams have been trying to be more agile and forming hybrid teams.
Recently upgraded several collaboration tools (Teams, Slack, Jira since 2019)
Excellent benefits overall.
Great company for parents with small children, as the company culture is very flexible with time.
SJ campus have nice common areas to hangout, and 2 awesome cafes, my favorite is Indian food in Cafe 17, they have a proper clay oven!","Culture is still heavily based on face to face interaction, and often its difficult to work done remotely. (Though the Covid19 situation is forcing people to adapt.
Engineering teams gets things done, but processes are somewhat sloppy.
Some engineers who have been here a while are grumpy, stubborn, resistant to change.
Performance review and feedback execution is not good, though there is good process and programs (Step Up) are in place.
Managers in my org are too involved in project management rather than developing their teams. Some have too many direct reports (10+).
Frequent reorgs have created some level on panic in workers, especially those with work visas in US.
Communication with overseas teams can be challenging sometimes because of timezone difference."
1972,PayPal,Corporate environment has really gone downhill.,2020-05-26,3.0,Information Security Engineer,Pay for Tech positions is good. There are some great people scattered in various groups.,"The Information Security group is very cut-throat and not a fun environment to work in. It is full of unnecessary fire drills and inconsistent, temperamental leadership. Roughly half of the 2nd line InfoSec group, from CISO on down, do not care about their employees in the least. Managers will smile and lie to your face then do the opposite. Very unprofessional managers will openly mock former employees and expect you to laugh along at their horrible jokes lest ye be next. Last year they shrunk cubes and banned personal items on desks. Personal items must be kept in a bank of lockers so that it is easier to walk people out as they are terminated. InfoSec has constant ""reorgs"" to get rid of employees(Often more than once a year). Management complains that they can't find good employees, but the reality is, they probably should be taking a long look at their own management styles instead."

1. No innovation takes place in our company. We only copy what competitors are doing.
2. There is an org re-structure every two months. We don't allow out employees to settle down and focus on work. We want them to be worried about their jobs, so their productivity is low
3. We don't have work-life balance. We slog, slog, slog and then get laid off.
4. Our leaders lack transparency,  leadership and compassion. They are robots who think the employees are emotionless machines.
5. If your tongue can do the talking, you can survive here. Knowledge, hardwork, attitude does not count.
6. Managers here are the worst species. Most have come from services companies and run this company as a service company. They treat us like slaves. I know of a director who used to prepare charts and paste them all over to walls when her bosses would visit Chennai to please them. 
7. Managers are not bothered about our career progression.  They are like leeches who suck our blood. And once they have sucked all the blood out, they leave us to fend off for our self or be laid off.
8. We do not get time or the opportunity to sharpen our skills. We need to do the work equivalent to two employees in the US.

2300,PayPal,In a midst of a Reorganization & Business transformation - Growing Pangs,2019-08-22,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Good culture on diversity inclusion  and living company values and demonstrated by CEO
- Strong focus on Risk, Security and Compliance. About 30% of staff is hired to perform such roles.
- Work/Life Balance : PayPal gives a 1 month sabbatical for every 5 years of service
- Nice office environment and depending on location free lunch and ample stock of a variety of drinks and beverages
- PayPal brand well recognized in core markets like USA, Europe and Cross border commerce markets in APAC. 
- Cash rick company that invests in fintech startups and acquisitions over the last decade. Acquisitions include: iZettle, Simility, Hyperwallet and Braintree.","- Business reorganization in process. Workforce reduction due to redundancies or change in org structure led to people leaving the company due to attrition or redundancy.
- Marketing teams from various products were merged with the new CMO joining PayPal. 
- This followed with Worldwide Sales team reorg where PayPal sales team have been merged with Braintree sales team for Mid and Large enterprise business. This started in USA last year and have been expanded this year to the International markets. This has caused lots of uncertainty to employees
- Product strategy is to have a single PayPal platform with other services like Braintree, iZettle, Hyperwallet, Simility as part of the platform. The various product team have been merged back to the PayPal product team group. Integration is still in progress and question is whether products like Braintree  will still exist post integration.
- Investment by the company is on the top clients in the USA, less focus on growing the international markets. The competition like Adyen and Stripe are heavily investing in other international markets via increase local acquiring and local/regional payment methods. This will make PayPal less competitive in meeting merchant needs internationally and drive merchants to other providers.
- Underwriting and Pricing teams sits in the USA and have no local context of the business to work with Sales to price deals to win the merchant.
- Management is telling employees that the strategy is clear and the right thing to do but have no definite details to share on the execution  especially on the people front. People are concerned where they will be any impact in their roles with this transformation."

Started in April and got a +$700 bonus my first quarter.","Honestly the only downfall is the customers sometimes. When dealing with money, people get upset. The beginning segment (SSP, or “settings, security and payments”) is rough just because you’re having to explain what an echeck is and why it takes so long to process, or that a transaction will not go through due to the security system blocking it. People can get angry, but that’s to be expected I guess. Just can be emotionally taxing.  Gotta do well on your metrics or you can get in trouble. Never happened to me and it seems pretty easy to keep metrics up. Those who don’t are coached on how to get them up and the coaching is very helpful and not like being scolded etc. so I guess maybe that’s not a con after all lol."

Once you join this team you will realise IIM should stop Executive course for sending incompetent managers to Industry. ** if you are a recruiter please double check IIM Executive courses profiles. Most of managers ( even of some top management ) are fake. They hardly care about PayPal. All they want to see their RSU grow.

Company Mission of democratizing financial services is a priority and customer is put first which is great. Very inclusive culture. Many smart people at the company and every 5 years you earn a month off on sabbatical!,Work life balance is terrible because of my manager signing the team up for way too much. Other teams are better so be careful with what team you accept a job from at PayPal. Despite being a startup cannot move up quickly despite what HR tells you when interviewing. Matrixed and political promotions like at a bigger Fortune 500 company so plan for that and do not accept a level less than your experience level as you will regret it. Do NOT allow HR / recruiters to underhire you because 2-3 years for promotion regardless of work. 1% yearly salary increase is the norm so be prepared to be paid in equity vesting over 3 year periods at 1/3 per year.

Politics is not too much. But it's there. People tend to take away your work if you are not careful enough.
Many KT sessions, seminars would happen, but you won't get time to participate it.","Regular Lay-Offs. I joined PayPal by reading all good reviews here. But they laid me off within one year saying silly things. You are likely to be thrown away after project gets over.  HRs spoke to me so nice, made many promises, called me often to get me on board. In the end they escaped. I suspect most reviews are posted by marketing HR themselves.
If you are already settled in a good company, don't join here. You will be screwed.
You will be always loaded heavily. No breathing-time in between projects.
I had worked even on weekends for months. No work life balance. Still your work won't be appreciated.
Pay will be good in papers only. (-) all taxes, it's almost like old salary only.
I don't know how they top 25 as best company to work with. It's false.
If you are joining as a lateral with good experience, it is difficult to survive competing with guys sitting rubbing bench here for years. Since most of the things here are internal. Also if you caught for long term, difficult for next jump.
CEO talks so soft & nice in videos; but in actual, management is very rude, never care for employees.
I overheard two very top management people talking in the library ""it's boring to see old face daily - lets fire some, and get fresh faces in"". Understand their mentality.
So you can be fired anytime. Severance pay won't be that good if you haven't spent many years in PayPal.
I know the pay will hide your eyes, but based on my experience I am saying, you will regret joining here. Better take some more time and prepare well, and join a better product company. Remember PayPal even fired Elon Musk."

The people I work with care deeply about their work, especially in the diversity and inclusion sector. Groups of employees create their own initiatives and get support from the greater PayPal management. I have been impressed with the level of transparency leaders give to their different orgs, and the growing willingness to have difficult conversations.","The company feels like it's in transition. Internal reorgs happen fairly often as divisions grow and the company figures out how it will be structured moving forward. Leadership is very open to feedback, and they make changes as we move forward. The campus is going under construction constantly, and building are either using an old dated aesthetic or have been remodeled to a fresh new look and feel. 

All of these things combined can lead to a feeling of ""incompleteness"" or ""unsteadiness."" That being said, this transition is only temporary, and I am more than willing to be contributing to a growing company who's eager to improve, and excited to be a tech staple."

If you don’t care to advance your career, this is a good place for you. Even if you have a supportive manager advocating for you, unless your department has a competent HR business partner and not just a roadblock, you can bet HR will either 1) shut the promotion recommendation down immediately 2) attempt to understand the employee’s job function and promotion justification with repeated inquiries for the same information, creating churn and additional work to deter managers from pursuing this process.  Of course there are exceptions - if you’re a savvy politician, you have a chance of being promoted.

Last word - avoid to join the APAC internal audit unless you are prepare to lose your job in the near future.  The fear of “don’t know” when might be your last day is just too much risk to take."

Typical American tech flat organization: No dress code, no formality, no insistence on hierarchy
Super nice and clever people as a general rule
Very positive corporate culture : Lots of focus on diversity, financial inclusion, charities involvement, work-life balance etc.
Cherry on the cake: The Paris office is located in one of the best areas of the city","The Paris office is relatively small and there are almost no opportunities to relocate or move to different functions. You'll spend quite some time doing yearly and quarterly career plans and reviews that go nowhere.
The ""family"" atmosphere has a dark side: If the management team decides you don't belong anymore (sometimes for relatively trivial reasons), you'll be out quickly, whether you like it or not.
One trick pony: Local business units are mostly about sales/biz dev and putting a button on websites and apps. Limited chances to really acquire new skills.

-Pay is below market rate, and is being squirreled away in favor of stock options which vest over many years. Example: an employee will receive their annual bonus only 3 years after the fact.
-Heavy micromanaging via Agile - tasks are reprioritized almost daily, making the previous day's work a waste of time.
-Stack-based managing style - last customer that the manager or prioritizer talks to has the first priority task, no matter the actual importance of the task
-Rewards/recognitions are purely political; I have seen people get promoted for the sole reason that they need a higher level person in that location. 
-Bad engineering practices in non-customer-facing teams - I have seen horrors like shell scripts that write to file to pass variables to subroutines. This is enterprise-level production code."

Everything is over worked into a big deal causing extra waste of time work
Reports on our reports with challenging if not inaccurate information
Group leaders and above regularly stop top talent moving on to feather their own bed at all levels
No accounting of different personalities and diversity is a word not an action. Only focus is male and female
Work life balance is a joke. No tolerance at leader level to work from home, unless it’s after hours and meeting needs of the business. A good work week is 80 hours. 
Salary reviews each year decrease through “creative” new targets set up for teammates to fail, annual review for exceeding teammates get 2% and people meeting targets get 1%. 
Promotion increase very poor on a good 5% or less. Budget cuts constantly for reviews. In a >5 year period a meets has gone from avg 6% to 1%. Bonus has also been scaled back with payment in shares based on the years performance capped and not paid out or vested for 12 Months.  
Targets are ALWAYS flawed and the focus is only on budget not the people

The sense of community is astounding. Gained really good friends here. Support (on and off work) from co-workers is unbelievable, and few examples of people ready to walk over your dead body to achieve things wont diminish this as a Pro.
The benefits are also very good: 
VHI cover (half paid by company);
paid sick leave (up to 6 month covered);
sabbatical leave (every 5th year - paid month off);
free gym;
long 4 days working shift of 10.5 hours (0.5 - unpaid lunch time), but gives you 3 days off, which is great.","When I started, I thought it's a job for life, but gradually I became disillusioned by my initial feelings. Company's motto/slogans are preached (drilled to you) constantly, but in reality exist only on paper. For example ""being open honest and direct"" is working only when your thoughts are aligned with management/company's ones, I was warned in 1 on 1 session, not to voice my opinion, as it is highlighting deficiencies in companies rules/behaviour. 
Growth available is only horizontal, as vertical promotions are done through ""who you know, not what you know"" basis (favouritism). One of the few ""proper"" adequate managers even recommended just to ""smile and wave"" on everything, get along so called. How can this be an option in innovative company. 
By my nature never backed down or backed off from work, but recently came across such a situation: helping out other team (full time basis) in performing their tasks with training given 1,5 hours of up-skill, while normal agents and people after me receive full blown training of 1-4 weeks, on top of that my metrics were measured as theirs!!! That's fair?!
Even though I receive constant praise from other teammates (through helping in their tasks with my expertise), my direct team leader continue to say that is just part of my duties, however other people receive awards for less significant contribution. Consequence - good specialists are staying at their current tasks and favourites got higher promotion, forcing specialist to look for another options outside this company. 
Yearly review, supposedly confidential, are backfiring on people speaking their mind as well. Vicious circle - of whoever want to make a change and company to prosper is just not listen to. Good company should praise good employees and make them as welcomed as they can, as in return employees could give extra for the company. Not for me at this stage, not here."

However, even though you earned PTO management still gets angry when you take time off.","You get a base pay plus bonus if you meet metrics.
No one says it, but if you don't meet the metrics of ""getting results"" or a meets your job is in jeopardy. 
The metrics contradict each other: you have handle time and quality. You cannot service a customer fully and have a good handle time.
Also, if a customer hates the PayPal system but LOVED you and gave you a bad survey... you could lose your job.
Everyday things change.
You come into work and every Monday they change something.
Whenever I come into work on a Monday I assume that I am getting fired.
They hire so many people also that after hearing ""PayPal is the best place to work"" every day after a year you become the person that seems mean and nasty because it's annoying.

The cafeteria sucks!!
Same food everyday and the employees in the cafe are JERKS!
You come in at 8 and you can't take a break within the first hour of work.
So you're not eating until lunch.
Then at lunch time the cafe is ALWAYS ALWAYS busy and the people behind the registers just seem to be joking around rather than working.
They also tear things down early or are in a switch between breakfast to lunch or lunch to close.

Management is garbage.
I sit next to my supervisor and hear conversations of crap talking EVERY SINGLE DAY.
Rather than management talking to an employee directly it turns into back talking... where the employee will never hear about it.

MANAGEMENT HATES ITS EMPLOYEES.

Oh also, every single thing you do is monitored.
Your screens are recorded 24/7 and they tell you this.
So if you have a question you can't just email your neighbors or leave your desk. 
THEY CAN FIRE YOU AT ANYTIME FOR ANYTHING.

I have been happy until management changed.,This is specific to my organization but the managers lack leadership and are micromanagers. There's also no work/life balance. A co-worker was super sick but was expected to come into work because there were deadlines to meet. If there was a true need for them to work at least allow them to work from home. What happened to keeping it human? There is also a lot of nepotism in this organization.
2992,PayPal,Incompetent Management Bring Down Productivity,2018-01-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have worked for PayPal for sometime now because I really like the company, its mission and vision.  I also like how our CEO, Dan Schulman, leads the company.","I loved and was proud working at PayPal until recently, when there was a re-org.  I have met some Senior Leaders of the company who are good leaders but others are not, unfortunately.  The ones who are less competent or less productive are creating an unhealthy workplace.
I’d like to highlight some of the negative behaviors/negative culture of the Senior Leaders in my group:

    1. They have intimidated staff members at meetings so much so that they are hesitant to speak out or voice their opinions, thus creating an atmosphere of anxiety and trepidation.
     2. An employee was told by a Sr. Leader that using the restroom during work hours was not permitted.
     3. During Kids at Work Day, a company-wide event, a manager told employees that they had to stay at their desks even workload is permitted.
     4. Sr. Leaders have been known to procrastinate and take a long time to make decisions.  There have been several instances where their indecisiveness led to urgent ""fire drills"".  They waver about how things should be done and as a result, project deadlines are compromised.  When mistakes are made, they don't want to be held responsible or accountable for them, so the ""finger-pointing"" starts. Others are blamed for the mistakes they should ""own"".  Furthermore, this indecisiveness and procrastination has caused a late reporting which increase regulatory risk for the company. 
      5. We recently received an email communication regarding annual performance and 360 Performance Feedback as part of our review.  However, our Sr. Leader mentioned that she will NOT incorporate it into our annual performance review, a blatant disregard for employees feedback/input.  Sr. Leaders say that they welcome our input, but they are not honest with us.  When we offer suggestions, it is not what they want to hear.  It's ""their way"" or ""no way""."
2993,PayPal,Leadership,2018-01-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The People and the Culture but that has changed significantly because those who don’t work here didn’t understand who the true leaders were,If we share our ideas we are pushed out.

2996,PayPal,Joke of a company since re org,2018-01-19,1.0,Senior Analyst,Benefits are great good teammates and some good  team leaders. Nice building short commute for me anyway. That's about it.,"Re org came in this  year. Staff like myself were moved under a different director. New Segments created and staff on low grades in the new orgs suddenly got moved up to higher grades overnight. We actually provide support to these guys and troubleshoot their problem cases. And now they are 4 grades above us. Other staff getting bumped up purely on a decision made by their new director.
On the other hand, when our department asked if we would be included in the upgrade of our grade , the answer was no. Apparently other orgs can do what they like and there is nothing we can do about it.
We are a multi-skilled, highly qualified team being treated like new hires. 
Yearly survey to ask how they are doing as a company, all questions loaded to make sure we don't ""unload"" as one of our managers called it.
Lies lies lies from senior bosses."

Oh, and the guy who works at the deli sandwich station and the one cashier lady are super awesome. Pros are few.","Horrible, demeaning, zero morale, weird feelings in the air, black cloud hanging over, several not good people, egos, hypocrisy, management does NOT have your back, as a matter of fact, several of them view your back as wide open to be stabbed. And this is for no reason. You can be just a person who shows up to work every day and minds your own business, and management will for some reason pick you out. As will certain evil people on the floor. No reason. It's just the culture there. You know how addicts and people with serious character defects and issues somehow find each other? That's PayPal and the horrible individuals that work there. The entire place and the entire experience of working there is one big con. Management encourages snitching, even when none of it is true, and pulls the innocent, unsuspecting person who was snitched on (lied about) into a meeting room and ""confronts"" them. But they won't say who said it, or what they said, which leaves you defenseless. And they know it. And if you, as the unsuspecting innocent one, dare to defend yourself, management only doubles down on you. It's like the Gulag Archipelago in that place. Something is really wrong there. Management and upper management retaliate against subordinates. Open door policy... non-retaliation policy... non-harrasment policy... these things means to PayPal what religious freedom means to the Pakistani constitution - the words are in the document just for show. And there is nowhere to go unless you want to just become a manager of the department you're in. There's one path, and that's it."

You get taught about the wage gap and how women are oppressed in society.... I mean I am almost 40 years old, a woman and call BS on all of that. If you don't buy into it and you voice that opinion you are basically not a fit for the culture and your career will die. I have been working for PayPal for 10 years and it was a great place when I first started but management is too afraid to say what they think and keeps pushing the SJW agenda. People are being promoted because they scream the loudest and not because they work the hardest. Soft skills and improving people's happiness (i was in a supervisory position) is not appreciated. They claim to have a coaching culture but that is there on paper and not lived.
My Advice to new employees:
- you better make sure you laugh at the jokes everyone else laughs as or you'll have an interesting 1on1 with your manager coaching you for not laughing at the appropriate moments.... yes.... this happened.... and i was required to do this to my team which I wasn't going to do. Sorry."

3083,PayPal,This is a Honest Review About this company.,2017-11-03,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"A paycheck onsite cafeteria covered parking, gym & and a lot of attractive people.","I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone honestly. They do not keep their word on anything or practice what they preach. We were told we were in one department in training. And when we hit the floor we were basically all departments and were held accountable. PayPal is basically a Hardcore Call center expect to take 80 to 100 calls easily no filter for departments. They will let some people go for doing the same thing someone else is doing. But if they don’t like you you’re the one that’s let go or written up.  I knew people that were well over the attendance threshold but were still working. While others were terminated on the spot because of their attendance.  I had always wanted to work for this company in there Fraud Department or Compliance Department (Which are now nonexistent). They do have a lot of layoffs so you never know if you have a job or not.  I believe at some point this company was great. But in the last year so many Great people left during the time I was there while the hardcore social climbers stayed. If you want to work for a company that pays very little and works you until your mental capacity is about to break this is the company for you. Employees will try to sabotage you because they think that's how they can get ahead. I was lied to over and over the entire time I was there nothing was consistent.  But it’s done that way to brainwash you into working harder and believing that they really care when they don't.  The workload is unbearable and they do not care until they are fined or losing money. They micromanage you without doing it aggressively by 7 meetings a week. There's one team meeting per week, 5 short meetings then a one on one with your manager every week to keep up with you. I would have rather had an hour lunch incorporated every day or an extra mental break. They’re very unprofessional but that's so that you will let your guard down to instill trust them. If you are an adult and want to feel like you are trusted and given benefit of the doubt and like to work independently do not work here.  Not to mention an electronic key to log into your computer that's how much they trust you.  They have laid off two departments that were really great departments (All Back office Positions). But claiming there is still opportunity in the company. The pay is definitely under what they expect from you. We were told we would be in one department doing one job function. On a day to day bases we were taking calls from other subsidiaries , also Site support calls , email calls , dispute calls , fraud calls and collections calls (without getting paid for collections). If you like really intense and very busy hyper environments this is for you. Management walking around all day constant meetings right there on the floor. Management also standing around talking to one another about other employees. I honesty felt really uncomfortable and I had reason to feel so. They let go of all the genuine management and kept the ones that were willing to be corrupted in fear of losing their jobs. And forget about sick time with this company you will be lucky to have PTO for 5 or 6 days. Not much work balance in my opinion unless you want to take it without a check.

 There is always someone on the floor  watching. The walls are glass so there is always someone looking.  Wages are roughly about $15 an hour but there expecting $ 18 worth of work. You are not fired for your stats but you are reminded of them every day aggressively. And the way they are set up you look really bad unless you are in a very low percentage. And wage increases are very minimal not huge in any way. I suggest seriously if you are not willing to give your soul and integrity to this company think twice.  I have talked to people that had mental breakdowns and were let go.  The final act was just jaw dropping all lies no truth what so ever which in any other state they couldn’t have gotten by with lying. If you go into this company trust no one always know that you are judged every second. Everyone is scared when people are fired you ask what happen to this person. I don't know there just not here anymore?  No one should live in fear like that. The stats are basically a monthly report (but its weekly) they have everything on their except for your bathroom breaks but they are monitored separately and definitely a big deal.  They send your stats out to everyone that's so you can feel bad if you’re behind and work harder. Nothing is private it’s all designed to make you work harder for nothing. Stat wise you have 6 other things to meet including a Re-contact rate and a Transfer rate. Yes! You are held accountable if the customer calls back as well as if you have to transfer them to another segment. Plus you couldn’t really assist the client in most cases because PP systems had already implemented the decision (Which I heard that's why the compliance dept. was not needed. So in all essence you were there to take the heat and couldn’t give an answer. But at the same time you were given the negative survey for this which heavily weighed if you made bonus or not? It really was stressful and didn't make a lot of sense. If you are looking for stability I wouldn't bank on this job. If you are an adult and looking for a real job skip this place they cater to mostly the younger population now. To mold them into how they expect PayPal Soldiers to be and to be grateful for working for the company. Bonuses are a joke they are quarterly and very little money. Management do not work at all just schedule one on ones all day and  go to meetings what I said above. And it really makes the environment uncomfortable because you don’t know what’s going to happen next. Which in most cases there is always something but nothing that’s going to advance the employee’s paycheck. I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone. They do not pay enough for the quality of work and expectations that they want from their employees.  And the micromanagement is stressful and overbearingly scripted. The company feels more like a cult than an actual place to work which made me uncomfortable especially for the money. You will have scripts to read and will sound like a android daily. This company’s reputation is surviving off the people who had integrity that are now leaving either by choice of force. As time goes on you will see that the reviews will rapidly decline. All that remains are the people with no heart no conscious and just trying to survive to keep their job."

The social environment is comfortable and derverse.,"The company's pay is sub par for the industry, and I was only provided one cost of living increase of .25 cents in over four years. 

It was well known that many people would simply come work there for the experience, then leave for other companies who pay better for the same job.  

The company is incredibly disorganized internally. Personally I felt that people in charge of long term planing and communicating these plans were utter failures. With any given change, launch of a product, or even hiring e employees the plans implemented seemed to be 6 months behind. 

In general since the split of PayPal with eBay the company has made a huge turn from putting their customers and employees first to the all mighty dollar."

It's still a work in progress, but it's certainly getting better as time goes on.","You have to find the right team.  I know some teams are not a great experience, sadly. 

As with any large company with a LOT of branches, there are communication issues where teams don't always share needed information. 

In some roles (such as management) work/life balance is challenging.  Additionally, the rating system is on a grading curve which absolutely sucks.

Some decisions are held up because of process, and the bug metrics seem to result in ticket closing instead of actually getting to the root of the problem.

Products are focused on particular silos rather than overall experience. 

The longer you work here, the harder it is to get promoted.  This is the most serious downside in my opinion, and is causing good and knowledgeable people to leave for other opportunities.

1) Career growth : There is a huge opportunity to learn and perfect what you do, because you will be working in the same job, at the same designation and salary, in the same function for min 5 years. There is zero growth like a govt. setup.
2) Politics : You can graduate from here and easily join a leading political of India. It is a place for obsequiousness with boot-lic*$ng being rampant.
3) Salaries : You are paid on time but very poorly. Expect a raise only if you are vv good at politics (see point 2).
4) Learning : At PayPal, you will learn about the different emotions you have. The company pays for anger management and meditation courses, after they offend and slander you at regular intervals.
5) Work-life balance : After you join they will ensure you are a dedicated employee and have you work for more than 12-14 hours everyday and Saturday, Sunday. Contractors work for 17-18 hours.

Sunday and tuesdays they have FREE donuts and Fruit

 

The lavista NE location is very well kept nice gym, cafeteria, volley ball court and basketball court with a pond in the back to walk around during breaks/lunches

The desk are bigger than normal call centers i've seen!","Just as any other call center you are sitting 95% of the time and it can get tiering sometimes you get conflicting information on what is right and what is wrong.  They seem to say there is room for career growth however with out a degree i have not seen that possible and ive been there two years.  

The calls can be very dificult (depending what department you are in) however Debit card Department you get the callers who are upset about their cards not working or issues with their account and they can be highly unproffessional rude. 

Metic based per performance- some of the metrics just as any other call center AHT there are some metrics we as employees are subject to but its not within our control ex AHT is in your control call control but when we get bad survey they make it impossible for it to be appealed even if it was the correct response we gave the customer if their upset we have to take the hit on the survey which affects our TIP payout (bonus) at the end of the quarter

When i started i knew it was a call center however i did not know what position i was going to be placed you dont get to choose what you want you go through :my path"" then they decide and give you a schedule  you cant change it unless there is a ""shift bid"" available and it does not happen often. we can not shift trade like other call centers allow you too. its very limited"

Unfair selection for promotions, often the promotion came out from the canteen or from a conversation in the balcony, so the decision is made pointing fingers based on who much you play the game. 
No respect from the Supervisors, neither from the Managers, and the worst part is not support from the HR department. 
Team Leaders often don't know the product or the goal of the department, neither the market needs or trends, eg. no strategy. No leaders, they are just to chase employees about the breaks, lunch time and to apply the carrot in front the rabbit policy.
Management is authority, once again there are not leaders, just authority and employees must to say the same than them in order to don't be blacklisted. 
Hr is the union of both groups, so they only support Supervisors and Managers, never employees.
There is no The company policy, it can be changed in base of the manager, supervisor, it means that rules are not the same for all employees within the teams. 
No communication at all, when you release a feedback you will be penalized. 
Salaries are out of the real living cost in Ireland, and salary reviews are just for friends, doesn't matter how hard you work or how high are your stats vs target, the best result will go to the friend of the manager, supervisor, even more if both have worked together in a different company before.

- Non-flexible work for engineers. They always assign more work than is feasible to complete. They expect people to work at a constant output all of the time.

As an agent who began on the phones, I and others were constantly switched from team lead to team lead. Some were better than others, and a few were down right awful. There was very little consistency and as I moved up in my career, that didn't change. 

As a facilitator I felt much more apart of my team, but many trainers were overworked, didn't know their schedules most of the time until last minute, and didn't have any effective facilitation guidelines to be held accountable for. Everyone trained in their own style."

1. Politics - especially from those unqualified to lead. Team Leads are somehow hired based on 'years of Customer Service experience'. Non-performers from other organizations (can't even communicate effectively) are hired/promoted to be yes men to make management 'easier'
2. Employment practice. Some would think that call centers are filled with fresh graduates. I want to correct that assumption. PayPal KL is filled with folks who has >5 years working experience, didn't get anywhere, and was somehow brought into the organization, influencing the rest of the staff with bad working culture and attempted political underplay.
3. Staff treatment. My years at PayPal saw a few of the good folks leaving for greener pastures. Aside from planned promotions, PayPal KL does nothing to prepare their staff for any form of career progression, instead focusing on redundant 'soft-skill' trainings.
4. Sucking up is also an art plenty of those 'Leaders' you see got to where they are. Frequent 'outings' with the management increases visibility, and the management seems to much rather have someone with the same mindset, than have someone with actual ability."

They still haven't realised that they are sending me their employee benefits hub offers despite having left quite sometime ago. Was able to use their undeserved reputation to get myself a much better job.,"Bending the rules is the norm. You have a strict hierarchy and if your face doesn't fit, you have new ideas or you are interrupting the TPV then you are going  to have a hard time. Promise lots in interview delivered on none of it at all.

Whilst there saw a lot of people who came in thinking they could get some where only to be bitterly disappointed. PayPal is a glorified call centre and it is all metric driven. The targets are ridiculous and are contradictory and require you to ignore a lot unlawful activity.

Raised this with management and team leaders and found that it expected and was told not to be raising issues. Was asked to do projects and mentor staff who despite being tenured were under performing. This was ignored at end of year. Project suggested some automation was possible and this was frowned on. Later found out that they were planning automation all along and did not want the bods worrying and not doing their jobs.

Now sending a large number of people back to night shift customer service roles especially if they are Irish.
Gobby self interested nit wits likely to succeed but should remember being top of the pile doesn't matter if it's a pile of festering manure.

The money is terrible and if you are promoted internally you are on a capped increase. 26.5 k is not a lot for what you will be doing. Was promised 30k interview and later told that this figure included bonuses. Applied for one job and was not told I was being given another one until 6 weeks in. Dishonest or very sharp recruitment practices. My stupid fault for not walking earlier, but gave it a while to see if it would get better and that was mistake too.

Hours are not good and if you are new agent you will be shoved onto 1000 - 2000 shift or night shift so say good bye to your social life. Asked to get moved of my assigned shift and had to wait for several months and left before they came back to me.

I would give no rating if I could, but again forced by the idiocy of the web developer to award PayPal a generous one start from me.

3351,PayPal,NOT a great place to work,2017-05-03,1.0,,"- Colleagues
- Canteen was ok
- Gym","- PayPal wants to appear like the best place to work but the management doesn't care about the employees
- Every time you want to make a suggestion or if you have a concern they say they will consider etc. but they never come back to you
- Even in the public forum, Facebook or Glassdoor ""PayPal"" says ""we value feedback, we will consider, we are sorry to hear about...etc."" Everyone knows that these sentences are fake and that they are written on the first page of every marketing book 
- At least once a year they ask the employees to fill out a survey but in the end they don't care about the outcome, and it appears that they don't share the correct results 
- Very low payment for the work load they are expecting
- The work procedures in some departments change every day in a way that no one really knows what their scope of support is
- If a customer complains about PayPal its the employees fault because they weren't able to make the customer happy in the end
- You are not allowed to talk to your colleagues during the day. As soon as you want to say a word or if you want to ask a question a senior advisor asks you what you are doing (thats why its always quiet in the back office)
- The targets in some departments, especially in the front office, are almost not achievable - and as soon as they notice that too many advisors reach the targets they set it higher
- They offer the bonus but this amount is very low, and they take every chance for not paying it. In some occasions the advisor was too many times sick, the advisor handled one out of 100 calls wrong or just because ""they can't give everyone a bonus"". Yes, they need to select people who can not get the bonus.
- The manager tells you every week that you need to improve in something even though you reach all targets by 200 Percent- If all targets are met you need to work on your personality (!)
- You don't have many career opportunities because a lot of good jobs were offered to relatives or friends of managers
- The shifts are not fair. Some advisors had to work weekend shifts for years (!!) while others only had the shifts during the week. However PayPal advertises with a change every 6 months which is clearly a lie. 
- I could write so much more but to put it all in a nutshell in the end PayPal wants to create robots but they advertise with a great place to work etc. I would not recommend anyone to work here as I know a lot of people who suffer from depression etc."

A simple search on EU labor laws found that US employees are allowed far less time off with no annual vacation days. Sick time must be accrued starting at the beginning of each year leaving no room for getting sick during winter, a time most people are apt to becoming ill. As it stands an employee cannot call-in for being legitimately sick until sometime in April of each year. Once a manager actually told their employees that while he understands things happen, but we should try avoid anything happening during our work days. This is especially insulting coming from someone not personally affected by the policy.

2) Strategy is tops down (Snr. VPs and above). Everyone else is a worker bee trying to perform on an already defined roadmap.

I like PayPal the most.
I have completed 1 year at Paypal and this is my 1st review.

PayPal provides Very good package :) - First most


My team has good Work life balance. Not sure about other teams.
Nobody cares what others do. Team follows Agile with 2 weeks sprint.

Flexible Office Timings. Nobody cares at what time you login / logoff.
Work from home option.
Good support from manager and team for higher education (I completed M.Tech part time).

Very good Transport Facility. (They have scheduled timing shuttles and also Door drops if you stay late) - This is awesome.

Free Snacks (Usual Tea/coffee vending machine, Biscuits, Plain vanilla & chocolate cakes, Tropicana, Real and Appy juices. Heritage Badam milk all flavors :) )
Recently they started healthy campaign and started providing few healthy foods for a short span. (Peanuts, Dates, Buttermilk, spouts, bananas, other healthy snacks)

Annual Events celebrated by PayPal is awesome.

Very good Gym with Trainer, 
Gym attached with Rest rooms for bathing (Includes towel, shampoo, Body wash, coconut oil, safe locker) 

Play area - Shuttle badminton - 2 courts
I play for 2 hours every day.

Bollywood Dance classes.

They also arrange guitar classes, Running club (3 months batch)
Some kind of club for people interested in Photography, Music and Singing , 


I don't have anything to complain as of now. Waiting for my appraisal cycle. Will come to know the real face of my manager soon :)","Their choice of food vendors...
Lunch is the only thing I hate at PayPal."

3728,PayPal,Deceptive Payment,2016-07-14,2.0,Software Engineer,"Growing environment for fresh grads
Freedom of work life
Opportunity to vocate your ideas","They quote a made up CTC which would be twice your base salary and you wont know how they arrived at that amount, as end of the year what you get is much less.

If you have a joining bonus component be very careful. They will take it back based on the service period condition on your offer letter. But never mention the amount they have taken back on any paper, not even From 16. Payroll team is extremely rude and harsh. They will not tell you till your last day how much money you have to pay back. And you have to pay then and there by cheque. 

Now, you keep mailing HR, they would not mention about this amount in your From 16 and you end up paying a huge tax amount (1/3 rd of the bonus). Nobody from HR, your director, manager would understand your argument and ask the payroll to correct the From 16. Complete harassment I would say."

3748,PayPal,"Great company overall, to an extent",2016-06-20,3.0,Regulatory Compliance Analyst,"Benefits start day one, bonus opportunity in many departments, good medical, employee stock purchase plan, growth depending on your department","Micromanagement has increased a ton unnecessarily. Coming from the department I was in where we were completely off the phones and strictly just did investigations, it was extremely hard to handle being micromanaged by other managers who come from call center enviornments because they didnt understand our flexibility. Aside from that it was just all over the place with how they wanted things done, and  everyone had their own way of doing things and it was like pulling teeth to get a straight answer.  Approximately 20 of us were hired on to help the department where they were struggling, and to make things better with compliance yet we were never listened to when trying to give ideas. A lot of us who were hired on have worked in banking compliance for years and we know the best ways to get the work done but it was really hard to get our ideas across because the company is very stuck in their ways of how they do things and it's like they did not want to budge at all. Their quality system for the compliance department will cause you to probably lose your job, its highly inconsistent. Just a warning to be careful!!! As a result of that they have lost a lot of people who have quit in fear of losing their jobs. The inconsistency of the compliance department is very scary. They say to use tour best judgement when writing sar reports then fail you if they dont agree with YOUR own investigation. The slightest error can result in a fail. No matter how many passing reviews you get, if you get 3 fails (no matter how minor) consecutively you go on corrective action. No financial institution operates like this. 

Paypal is a great company. The benefits are amazing. Most people who worked in the compliance department feel the same way I do. However, outside of that department i have  heard much better."

Nice facilities and company events
Generally a relaxed, informal workplace
Salary and comp plan is acceptable",PayPal has potential to be a tier 1 company but I don't think it will happen. Since eBay split nothing has been accomplished. Always a constant reorg at any given time stopping engineers from making progress on projects that would take PayPal products from OK to great. Now a constant budget squeeze for hiring but plenty of money For things like moving hundreds of people's desks or fluffy marketing stuff. this plus politics at higher levels make progression nearly impossible. You might have some chance if you are a male from a certain country with personal connections to the leaders. There has been talk about diversity but Nothing is happening. The lack of progress toward product improvement has people wondering if the plan is really to grow PayPal or get it really for sale.

Easy barrier to entry and decent pay for entry level CS. Unlimited overtime most of the year. Overtime incentives are usually pretty enticing with large prizes. Quarterly or semi-annual bonuses aren't amazing, but are based on a % (up to 6) of what you made in that period - so overtime pays extra there. If you perform you can move through different departments and often the hardest workers will get their choice of jobs and shifts. Variety of personalities so you are bound to make friends somewhere along the way, some really good people work here.","Your experience at PayPal varies greatly depending on your direct leader. There is an extreme variance between styles and discipline. Some are much more involved in office politics than others, and there are many more followers than leaders. If you can ignore it and push through PayPal looks great on a resume and pays for you to go to school. The pay scales well if you continue to move up, but staying in the same role for years doesn't yield great results and at 5 years and 4 positions in, I'm starting to look externally, mainly because I want to make the same amount each year without having to work overtime. If you want to make 50k+ a year you can in any department if you put in enough overtime."

The benefits are also great - $.25 Soda, gym, 401K and matching, Employee Discounted Stock, Med/Dental/Vision, and a game room - almost all available from day 1. PayPal is the king of online payments, so you also have a lot of job security as long as you stay on the good side you supervisor (even if you NEVER hit metrics!).","PayPal tries to put up a facade of a company that lets successful people thrive and innovate. This may be true for the non-call center position, but it's definitely fool's gold at the call centers. It's all about who you know rather than how well you do your job. If you're well liked by management, they will essentially get you the schedule and position that you're looking for. If you fall into disfavor, look forward to skipped one-on-one meetings (required weekly coaching meetings that help YOU improve with your manager), low yearly ratings, strict enforcement and harassment, no promotion and/or moving out of the department, write ups, and possibly even termination. I have seen people get fired for absolutely BS reasons. There are rare opportunities to move up, but most people try to move sideways off the phones, which gets you stuck there for 6+ months. 

There is also a culture of misinformation and deception both to employees and customers. Managers regularly withhold information or straight up lie. For a company that supposedly focuses on being transparent with customers and employees, they fall short. A fun lie is that ""PayPal has never been hacked."" While it is true that there has not been an attack that has successfully taken large amounts of data (as far as PayPal knows), ALL systems are hackable - it's a matter of how fast you detect, catch, and expel the invader. We also had to regularly lie about ""system undergoing maintenance"" when something would crash or a bug was plaguing the system. While technically true in the sense that engineers/techs would be updating the system to fix these, it implies that the bugs/outages are intentional - which is definitely intentional deception.

Also in the 3 years that I worked here, I was always one of the top performers and even received the top rating for each yearly review (Exceeds Most), yet cumulatively I received only 7.5% raises. One of those raises was from getting a slight promotion, that they ended up giving to ALL customer service agents less than 6 months later."

Rather than work together, managers will sabotage the work of others if they feel threatened or overshadowed. This is not a company that you want to go to if you want to work to make things better or have any ideals beyond making your manager look good in PayPal's Game of Thrones managerial culture.

Not only that, but every single business process internally is broken. The company runs everything on rushed artificial deadlines, resulting in tech-debt ridden software that is in constant need of replacement. When it does get replaced, it's replaced by yet another rushed out and tech-debt ridden solution. This is compounded by poor hiring standards resulting in sub-standard developers writing terrible code with little oversight and no code review. But who has time to review code when this feature needs to be rushed out by tomorrow?

There are so many better companies to work for out there that there's no reason to come here. Leaving was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life. I look back on my time in horror. It's like having left an abusive relationship. I still find myself stopping, shuddering, and then releasing a huge sigh of relief that I no longer work here."

You are not able to excel into the department you want to move to without meeting or exceeding your goals and that is made very difficult to attain without the right tools to help your customers.

They do not seem to have any motivation to keep PayPal on a good track doing the right thing. Already this is evident in the lawsuits against PayPal, some with non-disclosure agreements and some like the PayPal credit settlement.

Most of the time these kinds of things tend to work themselves out, but sometimes it can take longer than you think.

Some people may not like the amount of ambiguity or change that happens due to the competitive landscape we are in. (Reorgs happen more than once a year.)

Great working culture, you will get to know people from all over the world and build your network within the company.
Canteen is subsidized and the food is decent.

Great benefits, opportunity to invest in shares (definitely do this if you have just landed a job with PayPal). There are some really great people there too who are passionate and knowledgeable about their job. 

For my first two years with the company I worked under an excellent manager who would walk through walls for his team, had in depth product and process knowledge and was a true motivator.

However on the flipside to that, the manager I had for my second 2 years was the polar opposite, sparse product knowledge, few contacts within the company, no idea of chain of escalation, did not inspire or motivate, did not respond to emails and regularly attempted micro managing people who did not require management/training in the area identified.


Overall it's a really nice place to work, the people there are what make it what it is,I have made friends at PayPal that I will have for life. The training is excellent (access to Harvard training courses), PayPal will sponsor your studies if they are industry relevant. 
The integration team does a really good job of supporting the sales floor. 
PayPal's technology is the industry standard, you will become proficient in some of the world's leading software.

PayPal are also a company that will stick by you in difficult times.
I suffered with a medical condition which resulted in me missing quite a bit of work and the company was always supportive and accommodating in granting leave.","These cons are in relation to the telesales department and are not reflective of the company as a whole.

Your experience can vary depending on your manager.
I had the best 2 years of my career to date when I started with PayPal but once I changed teams due to an organizational shift I found myself reporting into a manager who I felt was under qualified and did more to antagonize staff than motivate them.
The vast majority of managers working at PayPal are highly competent and professional but like any company in the world you can sometimes end up with a manager that makes life difficult.

I was in a sales position so naturally the role can get stressful from time to time, however this seems to be shifting in the wrong direction for PayPal's sales team as the market reaches saturation.
Sales agents who wish to make decent commission can expect to self prospect 80-90% of their leads as the lead generation team tend to recycle dead leads and non profitable companies over and over again!
Investment and proper utilization of software can solve that problem but there seems to be a lack of interest/innovation at the management level of lead gen."

This is definitely more significant post the spilt from eBay Inc where opportunities to partner and acquisitions of high potential companies helps PayPal 

The organization is definitely fast moving and in this organization, things move pretty fast. Keeping up to the pace and the changes can be both exciting and challenging. 

Great teamwork and sharing happening across the organization. Understanding the importance of keeping ourselves as one team, PayPal has a great work culture where sharing is very core and key to keep abreast of our fast changing environment, 

Keeping it real - management team never fails to keep it real for all our employees, not masking any bad news but for all of us to have the courage to face brutal facts and action on necessary to keep us in a good shape. 

Culture - Collaboration is key cornerstone to how we work together as a team , One Team!

The infrastructure is simply a joke. A lot of time spent figuring out why something that is supposed to work is not working.
The processes which you'd expect to find in the mature company are almost entirely absent. 
As a result the code quality is in a pretty sad state. The Live issues are pretty common and surrounded with a lot of drama.
The technology stack is ancient. (Although it depends on the group you will be part of). 
The work force diversity is lacking (and sometimes missing entirely).

Long answer:  Prior to working at PayPal, I had never worked at a call center (and I never intend to again) but this is probably one of the better call centers in the Phoenix area.  The campus is up-to-date, clean, has a nice gym and cafeteria, a parking structure, etc.  If I wanted to make a career out of customer service, I'd have probably stayed here.  I made some good friends and learned some valuable skills that led me to my next job.","That being said, I wouldn't recommend this as a good place to work for someone who has strong career ambitions or anything more than a high school diploma.  The company (at least at its operations centers in Chandler, Hunt Valley, and Omaha) doesn't place any value on formal education and pays poorly compared to its competitors.  Bring up your poor pay to management and get labeled as a whiner, so you might as well not even try (by the way, they won't negotiate salary with you from the onset either.  Nice try.) You'll also work some really strange hours (think Wednesday through Saturday) for several years before you get a more ""normal"" shift, if you ever get one.  The red tape and bureaucracy were unbearable at PayPal, and the company was quick to lay off employees after management changes occur (which, by the way, happens all the time).  Don't be fooled by the Phoenix Business Journal's 2014 ""Best Places to Work"" survey, either.  Management set aside time for employees to take the survey and coaxed employees into giving positive responses to the survey.  PayPal isn't listed as a top place to work on any other reputable employment publication websites.  This is probably a good place to work for some, but it wasn't for me.  I'd probably have looked elsewhere a few years ago if I knew that I'd be writing a review like the one I just did."

Various shift options are available (although management is soon changing that to only four basic shifts).,"Stats are more important than the customer. Stats are more important than BSA/AML Compliance regulations (agents are expected to work cases quickly and, if a case is taking too long, agents are told to ""cut it off"" instead of completing a thorough investigation). Stats are more important then the employee (i.e., even if the city is shut down due to a major snow day, employees are expected to be at work and may even be ""written up"" if they do not show up that day due to the weather). Stats remain the same over the course of years even if the tasks change and become much more complicated. Even if an entire segment of a department is struggling with stats, management will not reconsider numbers or take into account the type of work that is being done. Instead, they will have meetings where employees are told that management ""may have to fire the majority of the department"" if the stats aren't met. Tenured phone agents are held to stats of people in different (easier) segments to ""challenge"" them, then when they are unable to meet those stats, they are denied a bonus because they ""didn't meet the requirements of their peers"". The department I am in (BSA/AML Compliance is grossly underpaid. I make $16/hr and just received an offer letter from a local bank for over $24/hr.

Your computer screens are recorded from the moment you login to the moment you logoff. It's your supervisor's job to review your actions/interactions weekly and ding you whenever a mistake is made; for example replying to an email sent to the team while you're clocked into a productive task. This power can and will be used against you. If your supervisor wants you gone they will monitor everything until they find something to write you up on.

The internal promotion/application system is bad. You pick 5 jobs you'd like and whenever a position opens up, they look at everyone who has that job in their #1 spot and whoever has the current highest stats will get picked without an interview. So if you transfer into a job that's not your strong suit you will be trapped in that position until you leave the company if you never out-perform your coworkers. We had three senior agent positions open in our department and all three positions went to people outside of the department with no experience in our field. So it was over a year before they were of any use to us as Senior Agents on the team.

There is so much back-stabbing they could film a reality TV show there. One of my coworkers was late for work one day and forgot to clock in. When he realized this he emailed the supervisor saying he was late and forgot to clock in and asked her to edit his timecard. He didn't know for sure so he gave an approximate time and she made the adjustment. She then looked at the timestamp of his badge swipe at the front doors and saw it was a few minutes after the time he told her. So she fired him for trying to scam the company out of a few minutes of paid time. I was fired because I sent an email, stats for our team, while clocked into a ""productive task"". I know of people who were fired because they clocked out to break before closing out of the case they were working on.

They seemed very determined to get rid of me.  They use Medalia surveys for customer satisfaction metrics and it is junk science at best.  I had many surveys that should have been appealed, but upper management did nothing.  Nobody uses common sense.  They put me on an action plan and I was doing quite well, but the let me go regardless on some trivial issues.  The main goal was to get rid of me as I was making about twice the salary of an average agent.  If you are hiring on to the call center, my advice is to beware.  You get wrote up constantly and micromanaged to the point where the stress is unbearable.  The metrics they hold you to is almost unreachable.

Product teams ends up getting all the credit / promotions for the work done by engineering team. This is depressing and sad.

Very traditional management style. ""Yes Sir / Madam"" is most welcome. If there is any dis agreement or alternate view points, ideas are not fought, people who brought them up will be under the bus.

Frequent re-orgs and lack of accountability at management level is just annoying. Huge mistakes by management are simply ignored / rewarded. Engineers pay the price almost always by putting in long hours and weekends to cover up for the mistakes done by management."

- Excellent work life balance (working from home, etc), if not one of the best in SG that promotes this.
- Great salary and benefits.
- Exposure to latest technology and fintech industry leader.","- At times, overengineering design and solution. It's better to think design and solution that are simple yet extensible rather than thinking on how to come up with a silver bullet solution. That silver bullet might be useless when facing against the change on requirements.
- It's a big and distributed company, so expect overhead in their process.
- Legacy codes are terrible (because of the way previous engineers wrote it not because of language), which causing a misconception and argument on C++ vs Java. Both languages are good if being used properly and both can be terrible if they aren't written properly.
- It can be harsh at times during restructuring period.
- Blaming culture is everywhere (esp, across departments), you must know how to cover your back. Issue or failure will always be there. Rather than point the finger at someone, it's better to deal with the issues and learn from it. After all, you are trying to achieve the same goal."

4039,PayPal,Used to be a great company to work for.,2015-11-19,1.0,Customer Solutions,"Nice Facility, Good parking situation","High Turnover, Poor Management, Unrealistic Expectations, Unprofessional mid level management, No transparency, Employees have no voice. 

PayPal works hard to promote it's work environment and culture during the quarter leading up to the time the ""Best Place to Work"" survey is taken. Following the survey, there are a large number of terminations. The company is not growing in physical size/Employee capacity but yet are constantly hiring. It's common practice for both Team Leaders and Group Leaders to have favorites and hold grudges. Management is always saying they're looking for motivated people and for people to take charge of projects. The reality of this situation is that they put these motivated people into Supervisor internships with a promise of a permanent spot only put them back on the floor in their previous position with no compensation for any bonuses or incentives missed. Those people who are motivated enough to start projects to help their co-workers perform their jobs better are then despised by the Team Leaders because those employee's are doing the Team Leader's jobs. They say they want to make it easy for employees to get to the positions they want to be in and to move up in the company. The reality is that they have made the process so entirely convoluted and difficult that the people with the knowledge and skills for those positions are overlooked for an unqualified candidate.

A couple of years back, PayPal wasn't such a cut throat company to work for, management seemed to have a genuine care for their employees happiness and advancement within the company. Since the split from eBay was announced things took a turn for the worse, management no longer communicated important decisions to the employees, team leaders were turned against their teams and became puppets to corporate. If they voiced their opinion about corporate's decisions they were put on warning or terminated. This trickled down to every employee and created a very tense workplace with everyone fearing for their job. It was no longer enjoyable to show up to work and instead became very stressful. Seeing entire teams and droves of people get terminated after the ""Best Places to Work"" survey was taken doesn't help with the feeling of dread either. Unfortunately this company is managing themselves into the ground and refuse to see that for themselves. Again, used to be an amazing place to work but really became a stressful mess after the eBay/PayPal split was announced."

* Now, if you are here, you either can't make it to the top-tier or you made a wrong choice in choosing a ""secure"" job

There's not much room for growth unless you want to move into management; otherwise, you can bounce from department to department and hope to find something that works for you. It's unfortunate that they don't want to utilize the talents of their employees to the fullest.

4123,PayPal,"Extreme politics, arrogant middle-management and bureaucratic",2015-09-25,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Most people are friendly, good work-life balance, some teams have decent work. If you love booze, you can party!","1) I can see politics and favouritism everywhere. There are only 2 kinds of people here: 'workers' and 'talkers'. People who do the hard work are literally treated like throw-away tissue-papers. But people who do all the talking are considered rockstars. I know people who do absolutely nothing, talk to the 'workers' in the team and when it comes to meetings, talk about the work that the 'workers' do and eventually they get promoted. The 'workers' have to fight really-hard for their career growth. If you are a quality engineer and know a little bit about the end-to-end of the product you are testing and if you have great communication skills, then PayPal is the place to be in. Forget about testing, you don't have to do that. The 'workers' will take the blame in case something breaks, but you can have a ball here, with people showering praises for the work that you weren't even involved in.

2) As a direct result of the favouritism shown to a selected set of people, they start to think they are God-level. So they start to become arrogant. I have seen mails and code reviews exchanged with sparks of arrogance thrown in (even if they don't know what the heck they are talking about). This creates conflict and in result, the good workers start leaving the company."

You can put some work experience in your resume and that is all. 
Salary is good if you are full-timer/director levels. 
Flexible schedule, but this gets annoying since people are too laid back sometimes (aka family errands).","Where do I even begin?
Very political place. Nothing gets done. Nothing gets shipped.
No design culture. Every designer acts like a product manager/architect; thus design direction gets diluted- design starts and ends with a really ugly, clunky MVP. 

No design emphasis. Everything is either really rushed or slow (never gets shipped).
Design has no voice in the company that we always get slapped by product business priorities (which changes every week). The leadership team is not transparent at all; you will suffer. Basically, everyone is a design lead, director or some leadership level. 

If you are looking for an opportunity here (and is considering), I highly recommend avoiding this team."

Long time employees not being fairly comps stars for increased responsibilities while new hires with minimal responsibilities and liabilities are hire in at 9 to 10 ratio of current compensation. To maintain momentum in advancement thru the company you must become a corporate lackey, potentially compromising your beliefs and morals for advancement. It all feels very robotic and cold yet overall communication is terrible,  at even a team leader level(supervisor). Often leaving employees learning from customers.

Free gym.,"Two of the company values are ""Do the right thing"" and ""Be open, honest and direct"". Sounds good, but it is apparently to be ignoring by everyone from team lead and up. Discriminating people for having a disability by giving them a hard time when they are off sick with the flu is not doing the right thing. People with disabilities can get the flu just like any other person. And sending them to a disciplinary hearing (yes that's what they call it) with the message that it's because of concerns about the other health issues and that this might cause extra sick days in the future is certainly not the right thing. Especially not if said person simply had the flu and did not take a single minute off regarding this disability. Furthermore, later on denying that this comment wasn't made is not being honest and punishment through false accusations and a bad performance review for being open and direct about seeking legal advice is unacceptable. None of the values have been followed in this case. 
Other than that it is ridiculous to expect grown ups to constantly show off how well the are at their job by making them boast about in the meetings and thro laughable competitions. We are adults, not children who need a sticker from the teacher. Just leave us alone so we can do the actual job. Some of talk about doing their job more than actually doing it, and are rewarded for it with condescending praise. Yes, great value that. Oh by the way, winning these competitions will result in little more than a pat on the back. Not really worth spending your time on, especially if you are being hounded to reach a high amount of productivity. Also, stop trying to dictate what people do in their free time by openly frowning upon them not spending it on work related activities and nights out that aren't even team related and that we have to pay for ourselves. This is ""stimulated"" in a very pushy manner. Some people have a life outside of work. It's supposed to be a company, not a cult, and nobody can join in every single time. Especially not if they have to pay for it. If I could give zero stars, I would."

There are many smart people who believe they are the smartest person in the world whose view should be accepted as right for everyone and who expect to be treated as if their talent is best in the world.  Additionally, poorly selected managers with no support drive quality talent out of the organization.  There is little support for new employee''s from management - they are expected to jump in, understanding from day one the matrixed operations of the company.  This has caused two results - huge ego's in the people who have been there for awhile and actually know what is going on and what teams / individuals to contact for projects and extremely helpful people who are equally confused but willing to help you figure out your issue because they are equally confused and hope to find answers themselves."

4200,PayPal,Software Engineer,2015-08-04,3.0,,Company is growing consistently and is definitely in thick of all things payments.,Legacy systems are at times difficult to work with. Test/Sandbox environment needs to be upgraded.

4203,PayPal,Principal Software Engineer,2015-07-29,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great work life balance.
- In general fairly motivating work env.
- Free coffee and snacks.
- Nice on site gym.","- Work becomes boring after a few years
- Not all co-workers are smart and motivated enough to excite you."
4204,PayPal,A Relaxing But Sometimes Frustrating Environment,2015-07-29,3.0,Software Engineer,"The package is very respectable given the amount of work you do. The compensation is quite good given that you're never expected to work startup hours and the benefits are solid (healthcare, 401k matching, etc) and come with a few nice perks (gym membership, free drinks). The work/life balance is good here, and the company is strong with a known brand and isn't prone to downsizing (not a lot of lay-offs). There are also a ton of free on campus events, so if you play your cards right, you can essentially eat for free.

Many of the people here have families, and this environment is very conducive to that","The company is incredibly slow and bureaucratic. Learning DOES NOT come easy here, especially with the massive amounts of poorly written legacy infrastructure bogging everybody down. Most of the time, you're learning how to deal with frustrating company-specific internal tools and processes rather than learning overall development skills that are applicable to other jobs. It's also far from a meritocracy. It's very hard to move up, and the levels are based more on your age and amount of experience rather than your actual skill. My biggest problem though is the outdated culture. The company is still struggling to adjust to a truly agile system, and a lot of the engineering base is unwilling to move from old technologies. There's a large focus on specialization here with very little emphasis on learning and growing. The company is still reeling from the old organizational structure of all of the engineers being split into QA and development, leaving it with many QA engineers who can barely write code and are unwilling to learn. There are also random company policies like internal code and hiring freezes that keep it from moving forward. The technical infrastructure is quite poor. Internal tools go down literally every day, making it very hard for developers to get work done. The code contribution process is weak overall. Version control isn't properly leveraged, a lot of ""hacks"" are pushed to production, code review isn't adequate a lot of the time; in short, a lot of the people here are frankly lazy and perfectly okay adding to the technical debt. There's also a lot of work that has been outsourced, which is unfortunate because outsourced code is usually completely awful and sometimes you have to stay up late to interface with the engineers overseas. Lastly, PayPal can be VERY political. There are a lot of people who would rather ""play the game"" instead of actually working. The word on the street is definitely true about the main San Jose campus.

In short, if you're someone who's ""got the fire"", PayPal is NOT the place for you. The learning opportunities are sparse, and it's hard to move up (get promoted) or sideways (join a different team and/or learn something new)."
4205,PayPal,"Fun company, lots of potential",2015-07-29,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Company culture is awesome.  Very easy to interface with other teams to get work done.

Targets were usually realistic and achievable. Enjoyed the international travel, too! back in 2006 it was fun, exciting with a start-up mentality. Still keep in touch with many friends I made there.","Large corporation politics, odd performance reviews and outdated technology. Some of the fun benefits and incentives disappeared over the years. Feedback and improvement suggestions remained unheard for the most part or took way too long to reach the right person/team or to get implemented."
4208,PayPal,It might be different there now...,2015-07-27,3.0,Senior Product Marketing Manager,"When I worked there, I had the privilege to work with some of the most wicked smart people in the valley. Most were very human, humble and eager to teach.","However, by the time I left, most of the wicked-smart/cool/fun people had bailed. Maybe it's changed since Marcus has left...?? Last time I checked though, the marketing teams were still headed up by people that were very much ""on-line"" focused accountants, that had little vision (or none)?, to support out of box experiential, off-line / retail marketing programs. It's a shame too. We were so close to so many great things, and it just seemed like PayPal marketing higher-ups got in the way of things. Meh."
4209,PayPal,Product Leader,2015-07-27,4.0,Product Lead,"PayPal is one of the more innovative and forward thinking companies, so as an employee you get to work on opportunities that has broad impact on a global economy.  The company has stayed a leader in emerging and digital commerce opportunities with continued growth in its customer base - consumers & merchant partners.

As you gain experience within the company, there are ample opportunities to explore other roles with management providing flexibility to rotate into different roles.  As a brand, PayPal is well know globally and is among the top employers in the US.","The company has grown in size across the years, making it very hierarchical and making decision making challenging most times.  There is also the culture of excessive meetings, power points as a way of communication that affects pace of execution.
As you grow in the organization, needing to be politically savvy is important to continue to elevate.
There is a the constant competing in priorities to support eBay inc and grow PayPal at the same time which is challenging for the leadership at PayPal. Hopefully with the spin off of PayPal as public company now, will allow it to operate independently to better prospects."
4210,PayPal,senior analyst,2015-07-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,really fun  place to work,nothing to feel bad about
4211,PayPal,Not bad overall,2015-07-27,4.0,Senior Manager,"Some opportunities to move around internationally (if you wait and push really hard), great and diverse people, flexible hours and ability to work remotely (great for parents), open culture where you can speak your mind, competitive salary for candidates with previous relevant experience, interesting industry which is constantly changing due to heated competition","Very frustrating if you do not happen to be working in the mothership in San Jose. The company claims it has a global mindset, but most of the decisions are skewed towards the US market, even though other markets show better promise and are growing much faster. You have to deal with too many decision makers who have no idea about the products & local customer needs, and keep on changing the company strategy every week just because it's cool to do a a new powerpoint about it. This is probably due to the fact that PayPal is now hiring more and more brand new MBA graduates instead of hiring street smart people or promoting experienced managers who proved their worth. Advice: If you want to be promoted at Paypal spend more time on your powerpoints rather than solving actual problems.

Fixing simple things take ages, don't even think about starting projects from the ground up: the only innovation these days is done through acquiring other startups. You'll hear a big PR when this happens, followed by a long radio silence as the acquired product dies a slow death... oops looks like those smart MBA guys forgot to think about how we could actually integrate and realistically scale this up.

Abysmal HR: you'll hear about them twice, when you join in to hand in your contract and when you leave (thought that's probably the same everywhere??)"

After that, all the employees are subject of a Big Brother experimentation, cameras everywhere, people that know exactly what you did or said or typed or bought, and most important, everything can be used against you by anyone with the title to do that. I don't know if all the multinational are doing that to control their employees (if yes, I don't wonna go to work for Google), but here in PP they do, and it is bad. ""Be a good sheep and never will happen to you..again"". OR, at the end, it has been all my imagination, and I am ok with that. Thus, PP is good."

Lots of great employee benefits, food, gym etc. It's not Google, but still pretty good.","Very long live to site cycles. Why does it take 2-3 years to update a product flow? Totally unacceptable. 
PayPal is exceptionally tight with hiring right now in certain divisions. In Product and Design, they are not adding head count and are scrutinizing every contract hire. 
Management did a poor job of providing transparency during the split from eBay. Any executive who says the split was ""not about the money"" is not sharing the full story. It was and is about the money. 
Laying off 2,000 employees was also about the money. It was not about ""operational efficiency"". It has had quite the opposite effect. 
Company priorities were not shared in a clear and effective way. Sure, we heard from Dan about his vision for PYPL going forward and that was clear enough. However it wasn't until last month that we as a product team had a clear picture of product priorities. This made planning and resource allocation like running in place.

Often promotions are handed out based on politics and if management likes you, not based on merit.  This causes people to be in places they shouldn't be. The office is very political and if you don't play the game properly you're out. I have worked in several different departments and it's pretty consistent amongst them all. The Directors have no idea what they're doing and decisions are often made without taking the teammate into consideration.

PayPal likes to boast how they're they number 1 place to work. What they don't tell you is that they coerced the employees into taking the Phoenix Business Journal survey and threatened that if they didn't get number 1 they'd not complete some of the requests made by employees. That's why if you look at any other ranking site, PayPal is nowhere to be found.

The pay is also terrible and unequal as it is based on politics and not merit. Management also has no idea what employees are doing what for the team. Hard work, dedication, and passion are often overlooked and not taken into consideration with reviews. 

PayPai is a disorganized mess and is moving backwards as there is no real leadership. Their attrition rate is very high as they do not pay employees enough to deal with the upset customers and shotty software used. I do not recommend this as a place to work."

- You are taken out of a scrum, and put into another and you lose all the rhythm that you've been trying to achieve over the time in a team. 
- Their rule of thumb - Don't promote until he has worked 3 years or more. 
- Salary - Unsatisfactory considering the good reputation it has with the outside world. 
- Very less young people which makes it hard to blend in because of the difference in thought process (within and outside of work). I think things have been changing now, but I would say that most of them are in mid 30's

4289,PayPal,Long timer at PayPal,2015-06-13,4.0,Member of Technical Staff I Software Engineer,PayPal treats its employees really well. Most of the folks I see around are decent individuals and  very accommodative. The culture promotes basic good behavior when interacting with others. The benefits and salary are much better than most other competitors. If you are in a good org there are opportunities to do decent amount of good amount of technical work.,The competition at PayPal is a bit unhealthy. There are certain cliques where they wont let you move up despite good work. Typical the modus operandi for that is to starve you from good work/projects and not let you succeed. You need to be politically savvy to change into a group that promotes good value oriented approach while giving promotions. In general going up in the game of thrones is not just a function of your skills and value but mostly your political acumen. Those who just do their job but do not spend time or do not have the org support to market their work will not receive kudos for their work. In general it's hard to find a win win situation to add value and succeed in your individual career.

In addition, I worked my way into management and it was completely corrupt towards the end. People were getting promotions because they were hired by friends not due to actual ability.

2). Great support from the professional services organization. Hands down some of the BEST Sales Engineers in the business. Very customer centric as well as innovative. 

3). Professional services management, while protective of their limited resources, is very proactive and engaged with the sales organization while accepting of feedback that will improve processes that drive efficiencies.

4). Many many opportunities to choose and pick from as a career, although hard to separate the wheat from the chaff.","1). You better build a network that can help you move around quickly. Many of my resources, management included, came and went during my brief tenure with the company. Literally a revolving door of movement into and out of and around the company, especially notable with David Marcus' departure and Carl Ichan's severing of PayPay from the eBay family. 

2). Leveraging SalesForce, the companies CRM tool, is a nightmare of redundant and useless data and meta data stacked on top of itself. At any given point you don't know who has a hand in the cookie jar when you are working with a prospective company. 

3). No synergy between business units, with 37 other sister companies you would think PayPal would realize the value of creating a ""One Face of PayPal"" approach. 

4). Once considered an innovative company I believe PayPal has moved to a more risk averse mentality and cannot match the innovators like Apple Pay that are moving into the market with alternate secure and streamlined  payment options."

Decision making is severely lacking. Even the most simple decisions take an insane amount of time. 

Upper management says all the right things, but middle management never follows through and nothing changes for the better.

Some of the AEs really do care about the merchant experience, and are not solely focused on their hefty commissions. Some of team leaders are really great and know what they are doing. The cafeteria food used to be awesome.","1)The compensation plans need to be reviewed and revised. Again and again. The market shifts, and companies and need to shift too. What worked 6 years ago to drive performance, won't necessarily work today. The  plans do not necessarily reward the right behavior and the people who work really hard to hit their quota when they've fallen behind still get the short end of the stick, despite their best efforts. The model is archaic at best and was managed by someone who really should not have ever been involved in the process. Their involvement was due to a terribly misplaced sense of trust...and the output was garbage and did not motivate or incentivize people to do their best. The feedback about this fell on deaf ears (see issue 3).  P-Club? That entire program is a joke, and seems like a free vacation for the leadership team when it's the front line people ""making it rain"" and bringing in the ""revenuuuuuuuuuuuuuue!"".

2)Work and life balance. Account executives are afraid to take time off, because it puts them behind and potentially on a performance improvement plan which can take many, many months to claw yourself out of, if you're lucky. So, though you've earned it, you can't take time off.

3)Feedback. It goes into a black hole. There once was a little survey that was put in place to collect real time feedback. The leadership team would review and respond to comments and it was starting to make a difference. 2 or 3 months later, with a massive change in the leadership team, that stopped and is rumored to come back sometime soon- almost a year later. So much for taking feedback seriously and implementing solutions with some degree of velocity. Thanks, Pulse survey!

4)Differing and sometimes unfair leadership practices. Some front line leaders (due their lack of professional development and lack of support from above) are afraid to take action on some people, for any number of reasons (the person is too nice, the person is too loud and scary, the person has something on me so I can't run the risk to my career, etc.). So- in some cases- noisy, toxic, too nice, or troublesome people stay around for far too long, even though they are not performing to standard thereby creating an environment of mistrust of the leadership team and their ""tenets"". Some of these people have since left but there are a lot of them still here. All things are not created equal- and that includes the use of the performance improvement plan. Leaders are allowed to be way too subjective in their application of it. Again, where is the trust?

5)Too often, when it does happen, the wrong people get promoted from within. AEs to trainers, trainers to managers, managers to directors. And the right people don't. Leaders (at all levels) are allowed the play favorites. It is demotivating to people, but they stick around for the paycheck. And the individuals with self-worth leave.

6)The culture is positively toxic here, abhorrent even, driven from the top down and perpetuated by lack of address. Sadly, this was not always the case. It was never perfect but was getting better. Most of the current ""executive"" (and I really do use the term loosely) leadership of the sales organization came from a couple of big banks, and had all worked together at some point in time and were all brought in to bring the band back together (see issue 4). Other leaders were brought in because they knew someone, or were promoted because they were buddies with someone on the leadership team. Other people were promoted because it was easier than going through the hiring process and would minimize some noise during a  massive shake-up. Boy's club? Check. (There have been very few female managers.... and look at the telesales leadership team today. How many women team leads, site leads, operations managers, directors, senior directors are there? So much for diversity). Inexperienced  ""leaders""? Check. Of the leaders that are still here, it's a clown-show....not one that inspires you to do your best. One particularly elitist leader, will regularly, loudly and proudly tell you about their prestigious school and their ""service"" and will show disdain at pretty much anything other than ivy league. You'll hear the same loud, show-off stories at every event  if you're in the club and get the invite. It's been said more than once that they only associate with people that can help further their career. So, ""bottom feeders"", forget about inclusion. Apparently there is an ""I"" in team.  It doesn't make us look up to him, or inspire us to follow his path. 

You would think with a company this size with such potential exposure, after several prior complaints about leadership inefficacy that someone would take notice, take affirmative action, protect the people bringing in the dollars that fund those paychecks but in fact, those leaders instead get promoted and get the benefit of a coach (this is a massive investment that should be invested in the front line)  and people that speak up or so called whistle-blowers are the ones that take the arrow from the exec quiver on those issues (see issues 4, 5 & 6). Which brings me to my next concern to call out for people looking to join the sales team, or PayPal for that matter. Human Resources, has zero human to it (see issues 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). At all. Please do not expect them to help you or even take you seriously. They are there to protect the most senior of leaders. That's it. They are the next most dysfunctional attendee to this party. The HR senior leader refuses to engage on escalated issues therefore rendering complete paralysis to the team managers. Issues go for months and months without response or action and when things hit critical mass, the individuals escalating beyond for any type of intervention and support get the boot. And do not think to escalate to any senior execs either. Your issue will get pushed back down to the person you've raised concerns about and you will be at the mercy of their wrath....which, of course, is to get the boot and keep their reputation tidy.

In short, to anyone doing their due diligence right now (be glad you did) please do your homework before you leave another environment to come here or even look to start your career here. Ask around your network, get the scoop not from the recruiter trying to sell you on utopia...but the real deal.  If you aspire to receive recognition, support, career growth and a healthy environment- this isn't it. You likely won't be developed (the leaders who are supposed to be developing you aren't even developed). You probably won't see the benefit of promotion from within (but your leader's BFF might!). You may not even be supported by your leader, or your leader's leader and definitely not your leaders' leader's leader or beyond. There are better places to cut your teeth on than here. You can do better."

If you're looking for a quick resume booster, it's great. If you're looking to build a career, look elsewhere.

Pay is substandard for most fields not handling calls. If you have 5 years to give and aren't concerned about the low pay, it's great - you can have PayPal reimburse a good chunk of your schooling and maybe a professional certification or two, then get your sabbatical (4 weeks paid leave, granted every 5 years of service) and jump ship. By the time you've been here for 5 years you've got enough experience to easily make 50% higher salary elsewhere.

Unlike what is published officially most work (case and risk reviews) is actually done in China nowadays, which means that at least the European offices don't really have to do much other than being present.

On the other hand over 99% of all workflow gets outsourced to companies in Tunisia, the Philippines and China. At the same time the Managing Directors tour all around Europe and receive prizes for creating underpaid jobs..

This company is actually a Luxembourg registered bank, at the same time it is unbelievable how much sensitive customer information is lost through their outsourcing activities. I was using the service before, but since working there would never trust them with my personal information again.

If you are looking for a easy and unchallenging job and can life with the fact that its quiet badly paid this might be a good company for you.

When I was working there we were judged on how the customer rated us.
Who is going to give you a good rating if you work in the ""limitations"" department and the only customers you get are already irate about their account being locked (most of the time we weren't even able to remove the lock because other departments were way behind schedule). So we had Irate customers with no means of helping them because another department wasn't able to handle their work load. We were judged on the customer reviews that were out of our control.

A customer is given a survey about how you handled their call, it does not matter how polite and sincere you are, people are going to give you a bad rating when you are unable to resolve the issue with the result they wanted (due to PayPal's system). You can coat bad news with anything you want, they are still going to be angry their account is locked and give bad ratings.

2. The code base is largely ancient and with varying quality. Although there has been company-wide efforts for migration and cleanup, there is still a long way to go.
3. The quality of the middle managers (senior managers, director levels) varies a lot. Some are really soul-less, who simply take the order from above without much consideration of nuturing the people, or really care about what customer need.

Management is a firm believer in getting ""fresh new blood"" all the time to do their bidding. What is worse is all the employees working in the firm are blinded and believe the management's opinion without questions. No one has the guts to be a whistle-blower. And if someone does - they get thrown out for asking too many questions.

There are several employees who are more qualified for a certain position that do not have degrees that don't even receive an opportunity to interview.  It became extremely frustrating.

New employees are generally not considered eligible for “meets expectations” ratings at their initial six month review. 

Because it is used to allocate the annual bonus pool for technical staff, the ranking system creates perverse workplace incentives. (Think: “Game of Thrones”.) Senior managers make the final ranking decisions in a closed meeting. Visibility and perception are heavily weighted. Some allege favoritism. It is not uncommon for the rating assigned by your immediate manager to be reduced by at least one level.

There are many disgruntled employees at PayPal. The cynicism and negativity can be overwhelming at times."

Most senior executives are on the same page with us grunts and they advocate for organizational change (it's slow, but it IS happening). Things like ""Customer Driven Innovation Program"" are teaching managers how to actually think like a customers, which they've never done on their own before.

The benefits (health, free stuff, etc.) are great, and our cafeteria in San Jose was awesome (but in the other branches, not so much). I didn't get a chance to do the Employee Stock Purchase Program but I hear its super good too.","The Product Owners are a thick layer of ""dead wood"" middle management, as one person described it. Often, there are POs that have crazy amounts of control over just ONE webpage sometimes, so it's impossible to change anything on the site because they need to protect their jobs and the jobs of their direct reports. (And yes, they still wonder why we have so many different login screens and Web flow visual designs...couldn't be because the POs refuse to talk to each other, could it? No, ofcourse not.). They also push out features without ever knowing/researching true user needs, or even understanding their own technology. Frustrating!

The big ""transformation"" programs are a smokescreen. Many teams aren't doing proper Agile (bad story estimation, splitting/merging stories arbitrarily, cooking performance numbers, fudging or ignoring progress surveys), and some POs aren't even Agile trained even though it is required now. I've heard rumors of POs sending their employees to take trainings for them but I can say 100% if thats true or not. It wouldnt surprise me though."

Now they have become just another greedy organization.  Ps. no I was not fired. Even if the company makes billions of dollars in revenue, don't expect any Christmas bonus. You took too long providing their customers, who made their company all that money, excellent customer service and you are punished in return for taking the extra minute by receiving zero bonus.

In other places I've worked at, you set measurable objective goals at the beginning of the period. At the end of the period you can say with confidence you met or not met your goals or perhaps exceeded your goals, and you are evaluated accordingly. It makes sense!

At PayPal you get ""compared"" to other employees in your organization. And when you ask your manager to explain why you got the rating you got, it is never an objective, measurable, pass/fail goals.

It is a well known ""secret"" that managers are forced to evaluate their team based on a bell curve, so even if you have a lot of superstars on your team, the manager is going to have to single one or a couple out to be given a ""sub par"" evaluation.

The PayPal Debit card. Long story short, My brother was killed by the phoenix police department. I had a hard time dealing with this, and I was meet with 3 days of paid time off, if I had the paid time off to match the time off. Then began the struggle. I had to go through FMLA and battle with the 3rd party disability leave company that eBay uses to handle their disability claims. I won that battle, and when I came back, ""ready"" as much as their disability company would allow me to be(read as intensive counseling, and soul searching.) I cam back, and resumed employment.

Shortly after(maybe a week or two), I went out with a friend who wanted to talk about my loss. I ended up spending entirely too much(220$ on my bar tab exclusively). When I went to use my PayPal Debit card(which was recommended by my employer as a way to get familiar with company products), It was declined. I did the same thing that any other red blooded american would do, and I called the number on the back of my card. Now I was frustrated, but in relatively good spirits, all thins considered. After the bad representative I spoke with basically stated, there is nothing she will do to help me, I said, I cant believe you would not try to help me, because I help customers like this every day. That's when the call took a turn for the worse, instead of trying to resolve my problem, the rep I spoke with went about capturing as much non-payment related info as they could about my employement there, and filed a claim with their manager.

Two weeks later, I was terminated saying that, ""My candor outside of work was not congruent with the image PayPal wanted to present to its clients""

For the record, I have no ill will towards the rep that resulted in my inproper termination.

Common answer is, even though your a rock star you just got promoted so even though you should be XX rank, you are going to have to wait another year (focal) to get promoted.

What the new senior management has been doing as part of a drive to redesign the company is to eliminate certain units, redesign some and grow a chosen few. The method of implementation however has not been to layoff employees, but it has been to create a very hostile work environment in specific groups and departments to encourage attrition. And in some cases where individuals do not leave in a few months - as a last resort, some employees get specifically targeted at each level where in a situation would be created for them that pushes them to leave. They would find themselves in a situation where a new construct requires a different skill set. Or their existing jobs may suddenly require them to work in a different location owing to a new drive in which every member of a single functional unit is to be sitting in the same office. Hence they would either end up in a situation in which they may be fired by finding some excuses for poor performance, or they get fed up and leave on their own if they act first.

What is also unfortunate is in such a environment, nepotism, racism and favoritism tends be very rampant as everyone tries to save their own skin"

2) People have devised acronyms for almost anything. So don't be alarmed if you find someone saying, ""XYZ should have been designed as ABC unlike BOS. It would have increased SPT."" Too many acronyms in one sentence, eh? But you should read an internal email. People will behave like this is some general knowledge you should know.

3) For India primary location is Chennai: although an office was started recently in Bangalore , most of the work is still done in Chennai. For a guy from northern part of India, I find it very difficult to live here.

4) Lack of techies: I had expected that there would be an abundance of geeky people here as it's a tech company. But I was hugely disappointed. Being a techie myself I don't find anyone interested enough to discuss something technical.

5) Lack of concern for employees: I have to be on on-call support every alternate weekend. For those weekends I can't plan any trip. I have to even carry my laptop even when I want to go to movies. This was fine if this happened once in a while. But every alternate weekend, WTF. So I started to stop caring for my work and live my life peacefully (read, being irresponsible). Please note here that this situation could not have come if they have hired enough number of people for the job!

6) Mostly unmotivated workforce: The average age of the company must be over 30. With numbers so skewed towards middle aged people, you can't expect much enthusiasm. People come and go like government offices.

7)Too many meetings: Really? Did you need a meeting to decide how many meetings should there be per week? Can't it be discussed as one of the topics in one of those meetings? Who likes all these lengthy and boring meetings anyway? Well.. you get the idea.

Company's forced rating mechanism ensures poor co-operation amongst team members as each tries to ensure his or her position within the company. Very high employee attrition rate, and very frequent re-orgs (at least twice a year) that lead to inefficiency and churn. Quality of data is very poor and no two sources ever match.

Job stability.","I have worked at PayPal for going on 8 years and have not been able to move up the ladder. It is very difficult to move within the company because 20-50 people will apply for 1 position. And, unless you know someone already doing that job who is willing to refer you, your chances of getting the job are slim...it's more about ""who"" you know than ""what"" you know. The jobs are so monotonous that they're simply not challenging enough, so unless you're close to retiring and just need a job to get you by until then, this may not be the place for you. The technology is outdated and management keeps saying they are going to improve on it, but have yet to follow through on the promise...they have been promising that since I started my first day on the job. It's a very micromanaged workplace. Never used to be that way. I used to love coming into work every day. Then they cracked down on the stats and introduced a stupid ""development plan"" that doesn't seem to get you anywhere in the company; I have never understood the purpose of the development plan. They say management looks at it, but I have never know them to. If you work extra hard, it only yields a pat on the back. They are more strict on dress code in Chandler than they are in Omaha, which doesn't make much sense given Omaha is the corp. headquarters. So, they are focused on appearance/attire, but allow employees to act immature and be noisy which carries over to the customers on the phone; this would NOT be tolerated in Omaha --that only gives the customers a bad perception of PayPal. There is nothing for employee loyalty or retention."

Too many architects, directors and VPs.
Many projects get started but do not really come to fruition or even road tested.
Process heavy and agile practices/expectations misunderstood at many levels.
Many leaders do not necessarily understand domains that they own beside how they can take advantage of it to move up/out to the next level.
Some key leaders think that PayPal is quite bloated. Even then, whatever the work force that was trimmed in 2012 for PayPal to be lean and fast, the growth in Bangalore and Chennai seems to replace far beyond those numbers.
Nepotism and selected consuls seem to exist. Some leaders force fit key roles with people from their previous companies regardless of qualifications.
Some San Jose teams seem to be constantly catching up due to difficulties in getting requisitions approved while Bangalore and Chennai seem have problem filling up their requisitions, which no one really questions. Most San Jose folks treat the work-life balance as academics."

No proper knowledge transfer programs for new hires and no proper documentation for new hires. While there are some good articles, they are scattered on so many different websites that while searching for something you will feel like you are on a treasure hunt, and believe me you will feel same kind of joy when you find something worthy!!
While the whole world have moved to modern technologies which are easier to handle and more intuitive to work with it still uses cgi implementation using C++. In my opinion not more than 1% of people in Paypal Chennai know how the whole system works, right from the frontend to the backend, I don't know about the other offices.
There is so much mixup of different technologies, so much of real work done on patches and by porting software, that you might get a feel that if ever someone sends Paypal code as an entry to some collage making competition, no other team will have a slightest chance of winning.
You have to work with a crowd of people where you won't find inspired by anyone. This is especially a bad scenario for you if you are in early stage of your career and you want to have a mentor.
Moving from one team to another is very difficult, unless of course if you have something to blackmail, like another job offer.
At last the most important thing, it will entrap you with all the joys I mentioned in Pros, make you a worthless person who doesn't know anything about the latest technologies, who does not fulfill any of the criteria of a good software engineer.

Call center jobs are stressful in general. Depending on your department the benefits are based on surveys from customers, which are inconsistent and hard to control.

I did not experience this for the first few years when I joined - at that time it was a thriving environment, but this is what the company has become - and it shows as internal quality has gone down and we are not up on the newest/best technologies.

Onboarding/training is non-existent.  It's up to you to figure things out. The ramp-up to being a productive employee takes several months and you're placed in to situations where you must make decisions without understanding how something works.

-Tuition Reimbursement
They pay up to 5,000 a year for work related courses

-Organized workplace
The most organized place that I have ever worked.

- Healthcare

-Corporate Environment (a lot of parties to boost morale)
They spend a lot of money on making sure the workplace is fun.  It does help boost stressful days.  They will rent different entertainment equipment and throw themed parties. This could be expected almost every month.

-Free Drinks
They have soda machines with free drinks.  Great.

- Great promotions
If you meet your time and quality, you can move up quick.  Really quick.","The position was a call center position.  
You should already know that dealing with call centers, there are going to be angry customers almost daily. That isn't the problem , the problem is management's idea of how well you handled the call.

-Unfair Quality Assurance scoring when dealing with unruly customers
There are times when you could literally be cursed at and called names by customers.  Customers will call in screaming profanities at the top of their lungs in some cases.  Most companies allow you to disconnect the call after a fair warning.  However, Paypal's QA will always tell you that you could have done more and give you a low score. It's very unreasonable since QA scoring affects potential promotions and pay.

-Call times should be aligned with specific calls
You are judged by the amount of time you spend on the call.  It is true that you take many calls a day, however the calls do not always offset. The system should factor in more leniency for calls types that may be be longer.  You may get a lot of the same calls in a day and those call types are almost impossible to make within a certain time.  Two long calls could mean the difference of a promotion or even your job.

-Managers are EXTREMELY lazy and dismissive.
Some customers will ask for managers, even after you tell them everything that you possibly can.  Situations such as these are to be expected.  However, there are times when managers will be very unhelpful.  Some will help, some will tell you to go back and reiterate what you've already said to the customer, some will duck, some will tell you to go to another manager and some will have attitudes that you've bothered them. It's a waste of time for you and the customer.  

-Quality and Time Policy
Simply put, you are subject to ""corrective action"" if you don't meet both.  This is wrong for all of the reasons mentioned above.

-Lateness Policy is very unreasonable
They do not tolerate lateness, which is fine.  Being late could mean 1 minute, which is also fine. You are considered late if you are not logged in to your computer within 1 minute after your official start time.  The problem here is, if you are late... you get marked.  If you get two marks within 6 months, you are put on a sort of first and final.  That means if you log into your computer 1 minute late more than twice from the long span of say..Jan to July, you could potentially lose your job.

Its unreasonable especially during winter when there is snow and ice. (This policy could have changed since my departure)"

One of the best places for Payments domain knowledge.
Know how not to build software (there is so much learning that you have once you work here)
There were very few competitors that gave Paypal a big first mover advantage.
A great place to grow skills.","You may never get proper positive recognition for your work.
You won't get relevant feedback for your actions.  Everything is deemed confidential that noone is supposed to utter a word on who said what about you in any of the appraisal meetings.
If you work in Chennai, your promotions almost always never happens.  This is a personal experience.
If you work in Chennai, your performance is compared with folks in San Jose.  Good in theory but bad in practice since the whole the senior management sitting in San Jose mostly decides all the appraisals. Don't expect a lot of participation from Chennai in senior management.
The management in Chennai has very little authority when it comes to your career options or survival in the company.  Or perhaps, they have no stakes in the matter (there is no transparency at work).
There are so many managers within the PayPal organization, that don't represent a great model of management.  
eBay behaviours are mere statements and i have not seen them followed in spirit by most managers in my hierarchy.
There are so many senior folks that travel frequently from San Jose to Chennai.  The motivator for young engineers is onsite travel which gets affected  because of those travels.  
In PayPal, you decide the appraisal rating and then write the review for an employee based on the rating arrived at.  Really weird.  The funny thing is that the management insists on finishing the reviews from the lower level folks but never get it done for themselves.  Not a nice model when it is not practised at every level.
Some managers in San Jose just don't have the maturity to deal with people under them.  They are just not experienced to be global managers.  There have been a variety of contextual situations in support of this.
If you work in Chennai, expect to be given instructions from San Jose on what needs to be done."
5043,PayPal,You need to be careful when you work there,2012-04-10,2.0,,Good benefits. Great facilities. The company culture encourages you to network and make connections. Most people are willing to have a meeting to discuss an idea or explain what their group does.,"When I first joined the company, someone mentioned the ""30 day"" discussion. What I learned was that for no concrete reason, your manager can tell you that you have 30 (or more) days to find another position otherwise you will be packaged.  I work with a number of people who are strong performers that were given notice when they were in a previous group. If you do not ""fit"" with your group you will be squeezed out."

I have never seen anyone promoted in my 5 years. HR is invisible, perhaps they do not exist. If you have a bad supervisor your life is hell and there is nothing you can do about it because management does not listen. 

Management is completely incompetent. They make vague guesses as to company direction and do not listen at all to the people who actually do the work.  This last year has been a disaster. We have been forced to make thousands of pointless phone calls to customers though the actual people doing the work agreed unanimously it did more harm than good, finally after losing millions to fraudsters and completely alienating the staff, they have gone back to the original policy.

Pay Pal has a very real class system, and fraud agents, along with customer solutions are the untouchables.  Your supervisor is your slave driver in a very real way. If he or she is bad, too bad for you because his manager is going to do nothing.

The pay is okay but it never gets any better. For someone with a college degree, it is a very bad decision to work here. Personally I have a BS and have applied several times for internal openings and have heard nothing, not even a ""Thanks for applying"" from HR.

It is actually worse than what I have described. Do yourself a favor and do not work at PayPal Omaha."

Overall the quality of these people is poor resulting in many experienced people leaving for similar roles (not better) in other companies.  In some cases this is due to poor hiring by senior leadership and HR and in other cases it is due to hiring candidates with overinflated resumes.
