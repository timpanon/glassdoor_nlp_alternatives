45,PayU,Worst Place to work,2021-10-15,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Working from last 1 year, Lots of chaos and hustle, nothing is organised in PayU credit, No work life balance they have the tools but they don't know how to use them efficiently, no agile methodology is followed, thay randomly define the sprints without any sprint planning and tickets can be added to the sprint at any time during the sprint, there is no time defined when the sprint will end, sometime the sprint is closed after 2 months, there sprint name is also funny they name the sprint as AugSprint, AugSeptOctSprint.
There is no code coverage and they don't have integrated any code monitoring tool even the junkins get passed in just 1-2 minutes because they just used to generate the build and there is no test case in the code base, they don't have integrated the jira with the VCS. 


There is no defined release process, there is no defined git branching system, people create their own random branch to merge different features and then do a bignbang merge to develop branch which results in a huge number of conflicts.

The management is not even helpful they have not provided any WFH allowance/accessories they are providing chair only to the place where the office is and when office opens you have to return the chair back, they are providing the internet reimbursement upto 1500, however if you have joined 5th Nov the amount and the bill is 1000, then the 5 days money will be deducted from the 1000 and the reimbursement amount will only be 850, The HR asks for the sealed bill copy and the internet bull get reimbursed after 3 months, this is unfair because they are just trying to make difficulty for the employees, if a employee leaves in starting of Oct he will not get the internet bill reimbursementÂ of 3 months, such a shame to the management, the manager didn't talk to the team, not sure for what he get paid for?","They have the CICD, but they don't know how to use it.
They have the VCS but they are making it a mess, no branching system is followed.
They don't have any code monitoring tool
There UX/UX designers can't keep the consistency in the design widgets.
They don't know how the agile methodology is followed.
The manager doesn't talk to the team.
The reimbursement can be made only once in 3 months."

109,PayU,Production support team :- software engineer L3 Pune,2021-03-20,1.0,Production Support Engineer,I don't think there are any pros in working for PayU .. expect its lil bit known brand,"1 ) I worked in payu around one and half year . To be quite honest first 12 months went smoothly under our team lead .but he moved to another team and then came the current lead.. under qualified,egoistic,inexperienced person.

2) due to the current management pressure,mental harasment and inability to handle the team there were around 13 resignations from this team in last 9 to 10 months.Its hard to survive there for more than 6 months

3) This is a product base company they have 50+ product that needs to handle by support team and need atleast a year to understand properly. But current lead will want u to ready in just 10 days.(it took us year to get stable without any pressure.)

4) Currently there is so much pressure on this team that you are forced to work 11 hours a day. Please note that u won't be paid for extra hours as this is not official. U have to work on Saturday and Sunday even though you will have officially offday.. here as well u won't be paid anything extra. When you are asked to work extra for everyday ask them to send an official mail for this request.

5) HR team knows everything,  but they don't want to do anything about it.. they know there are more resignations in this team in last 10 months than last 5 years.  They simply don't want to help here.If you think you will reach out to the higher management.. it won't help as well... These people working here for year's and friends.. You think you are telling them in confidence but in reality it will be spread to everyone in their group in hours .

6) if you think this is a MNC and will have certain standards ,I am here to tell you it's not... After reading this you are still accepting the offer from payu in this team ,then you must need this job. U will have some money at the end but no mental stability."

2. Lots of learning","1. Management Layer treat you like a slave. Whatever good thing you do, they will never value you.
2. There is no mean of giving feedback to upper management if you are facing any issue. Then will not take any action.
3. Some people (At managerial level) who are working from long time behave like a Boss. They treat you as slave and give you lecture on policies however there is no policy like that in the company. They want you to work for more than 11 hours and even after doing that, they have no value for you.
4. People usually prefer late hour meeting. This should be avoided. They say that they have flexible working policy but in real you get lots of meeting in off office hours so no flexibility for you who want to spend personal hours with family.
5. They have come up with a policy ""No call / meeting on Wednesday"" but in reality you do have lots of meeting on Wednesday.
6. Sales team drive the engineering. You have to build the product in hurry. The want each and every product in a day. No priorities given to quality of code and good design.
7. HR is there to just arrange Friday fun activity. They are not there to help you as an employee if you are having any problem with your manager.
8. There are manager / Senior who are not following good coding practices. If you ask them to follow then they say we just need to solve the problem. keep aside good practices.
9. No software Engineering principle follow here while developing application. This is why they come up with a longer roadmap to redesign every thing. But in the end it will be a mess if we do not follow good practices.
10. There is a technical design review meeting happens every week. You get feedback and pointers to think of in that meeting. But your team manager ask you to ignore the feedback and force you to write the bad code."

Again, depending upon team, work at payU could be the most unproductive and stressful thing in your life.

Over-expectation in terms of work input.

Sadly, some teams at payU are hopelessly poor at evoking anything but demotivation.


**Be careful what team and under what manager you are getting hired.  A little background check would go a long way (believe me. With payU at least.)

Our product has been the most preferred way a buyer would love to checkout as a payment gateway, not just because of the discounts that we offer, but the ease of checkout that we provide. The trust that PayUmoney has gained among the merchants is tremendously appreciating. 

In such a short span of time PayUmoney has achieved remarkable heights and merchant acquisition team has always helped in creating secured payment system. This team has always proved that they all are a perfect example of hard work, determination and discipline.

We understand the importance of  ""Deed Approach"" "", which means that the product that we have created is not for the need or the greed of money, but it's a deed product through which we want to create that secured ecosystem through which any buyer or a merchant can blindly trust on the online payments. This way we are helping in contributing to the growth of this online industry by providing safe online transactions.",Nothing to share about it.

There are also some very good tech/business guys who will help you learn a lot during your stay.,"There is a lot of politics and since the company is expanding there are people fighting for role expansion, trying to take credit out of nothing. In the process, a lot of ""actually good"" guys lose out while the ones boasting in public get undeserved promotions and accolades. Also, there is no proper mapping of skills & roles due to which there are issues of non - technical guys holding technical positions and vice - versa. This ultimately affects the overall morale of the team as well as the internal communication. There is fragmentation among different departments and almost every department acts as if it is the sole one taking care of entire business. A lot of heads treat there co-workers poorly and often drag them back instead of supporting good efforts. You may find some of the least deserving guys heading very high positions in management."

The culture is amazing, people is collaborative and ready to help.
Most of the people working here is very smart.
