It took a toll on a physical and mental health. We worked for 13-14hrs everyday including weekends and holidays but still it was not enough for them and we were ill-treated all the time. People call at odd hours, off days and misbehave with you in the name of work. My mom was hospitalized and the day she was discharged I got a call from the Manager at 12 a.m. for a meeting. It is a very unethical company. It hires and fires as and when it likes and that too they do in bulk every month. Within 2months after I joined they said my role is not required anymore and then I was put into another team. If this did not happen, I would have lost my job within 2months. Do we leave our job and join here to be treated like this? My team and my managers were changed  6-7 times during my tenure. When we started WFH, we were asked to login at exactly 9:30 and there was no logout time. We were also asked to switch on our video and sit the whole day in front of the screen.

You get overpaid for the most invaluable work, especially if you have an IIM degree.","1. The leaders are overhyped internal gods who climbed up the ladder purely because they are a tad bit smarter and savvier than the rest, and knew how to talk their way through. These leaders would not survive elsewhere at a place where talent and meritocracy are norms. 
2. This is the quintessential nepotist company where friends, family and blood is promoted and given better opportunities by virtue of relationships. Meritocracy is absent altogether 
3. There is no learning coz your boss likely does not know much more than you. The basics of Human Resource’s are alien in this organisation. Reporting structures are arbitrary, based on neither experience or talent differential. 
4. Pay is outright unfair. As an IIM grad I got paid 2X-3X for the same job a non IIM grad performed. 
5. There is no training or development that helps employees develop or improve their skill set. Talking is the lone skill set most people in this organisation have
6. There is rampant sexism, derogatory jokes about women when the boys get together for drinks etc 
7. People in sales misuse travel approvals to claim unreasonable expenses. On the flip side, the company does not offer approval budgets that even cover basic accommodation in expensive cities forcing you to pull. 24 hour day to travel and return the same day. 
8. Leaders bark at employees like they’re somehow entitled to do so. 
9. Oh how could I forget the ++ culture. You send a mail to someone requesting something you need, and each person will tag someone else into the mail with a +.

1115,Paytm,Work depends on the team you are being hired for,2021-02-12,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"1. Some teams are doing amazing stuff
2. Work culture is not very formal and process based. Work speed/pace is good
3. You get to interact more across teams. If you are keen, you can pick up some learnings here.
4. Few folks are highly talented. If you have good fortune, you'll come across them/work alongside them.
5. Good place for freshers to get initial learning.
6. Good scope of learning for Web/JS developers
7. Good package if you are holding an existing good offer.
8. Some people here are quite genuine. People who'll actually have concern for you as a person.","This will be long. So hang on...

Web/Javascript Developers: Learning scope is good. You get to work in making hybrid frameworks and hybrid flows and learn a decent amount. Work pressure will be quite high.

App Developers: Very less technical growth for app developers in the Paytm Consumer app (They Paytm money app however has good scope for app developers though). The development process is is more focused on hurriedly completing features and not on making the native flows more sleek. New experimental stuff is just talked about and implemented in quite rare cases. Work pressure will be high.

BE developers: Technical growth depends on the team you are being hired for. Some teams do good work. Others do pretty much mediocre work. Work pressure also varies across teams

QA: Again technical growth depends on teams. Automation is handled by few select teams and a few select folks. Do inquire about the nature of your work from your HM before joining. (Although even your HM's words won't be a guarantee). Work pressure depends on teams, but is generally on the higher end.

Teams based out of Noida mostly focus on getting work done faster and that usually requires stretching beyond work hours in a good deal of sprints.

I would have given a 3 rating but here are the reasons I made it 2...

The company has punch in/punch out policy of 9 hours. HRs may escalate to your managers if your hours are low. Escalations might also happen if you have worked beyond office hours a lot for the previous month and are clocking lesser hours this month. But ultimately your manager can stand for you (if he/she chooses to) and defend your timings.

Company does not have much employee benefits

HR dept is non-cooperative. Even something as simple as requesting an address proof certificate does not get obliged. Any queries from the HR dept does not get answered in due time.

The company also has some weird IT policies wherein employees have to pay in some of the cases in case of any issue with their office laptops. I know of other companies where employees do not have to pay for similar issues with their laptops.

While moving out the company deducts recovery amounts from your salary if you are serving time lesser than your notice period. NOTE THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN EVEN IF YOUR MANAGER APPROVES TO LET YOU LEAVE BEFORE YOUR STIPULATED NOTICE PERIOD. The HR dept does not inform about such deductions and you get to know about it only after you get your final settlement. There will be no intimation about this anytime anywhere before the final settlement mail reaches you (which will generally be 1-2 months after you leave). You'll have no idea that they are going to deduce recovery amount from your salary before the final settlement."
1116,Paytm,Good to learn but poor for growth,2021-02-12,3.0,Software Engineer,The only pro is that they are using latest tech and since they have millions of hits in a hour you can learn how to scale and all.,"Even after working two years there you will feel like you are at the same position in your career where you were before joining paytm. Also there are no perks, on Diwali they don't have any bonus and all, they will give a Haldiram to you and that's it. Cafeteria is the worst.

1. Salary is always on time
2. For any paperwork you have portals 
3. Infrastructure is good online and offline","This list is rather long - 
1. There is a scolding/yelling culture. This practice is extremely normalized.
2. There is a lack of EQ in managers, heads, and leads. They are either not experts at what they do or too stiff to admit they don’t know any better.
3. There is bias. The culture of Clique thrives here. If you are an alumnus of the same college then you 'll be treated differently, same case is if you are from a common former employer.
4. Very toxic workplace. Within teams, they aren't inclusive when it comes to variety. The managers restrict if you try to experiment with something new ( because in some domain such as marketing you can't keep doing what's conventional)
5. There is no review system, no grievance, HRs don't get in touch with you to check-in.
6. Micromanagement is an issue. Consistent check-ins of your whereabouts for which Informal Whatsapp groups are made to check-in even if you are out for lunch break.
7. This isn't an employee-centric company. It thrives on what employees have created so far but fails to take care of them. So much so for the Linkedin branding but there is not an exhaustive process that makes sure that employees feel safe mentally - mental harassment is a thing. Higher management has no polite system to give feedback.
8. There is not employee engagement. Seems like a dud. Salary is the only motivation."

1542,Paytm,Don't join unless you're desperate,2020-07-03,1.0,Devops Engineer,"If you're coming from a good product based company, you'll be doing better than most of the folks having double your experience, so not much to learn. Also, comparatively, you'll perform well in the team, which will give you more appraisal (not necessarily any growth in career)

It is possible to get a good hike at the time of joining (depends on how you negotiate) as well as during appraisals (if you have good relations with your manager and HOD both)","Not employee friendly - Paytm only cares about their business and their own profits, doesn't bother whether you're sick or your health is being affected.

Policies are broken - Starting from offer letter to WFH policies to leave policies to FnF settlement, nothing is well defined. They'll twist their own words at their will.

Worst IT assets policy - First of all, you'll never get the laptops which gets your work done easily, instead, you'll get the laptop based on your level and time of stay in the company. Exceptions are there for some teams. Secondly, you'll also get charged for minor scratches/cracks while returning the laptop.

No focus on employee learning/growth - No benefits if you stay here long; Your growth will stagnate, you won't learn much, not possible to gain insights or deep dive into any technology given the pressure of work, most of which is ad-hoc. No access to any learning portal or certifications whatsoever.

Pay parity - they pay as per your experience in the industry, no matter your skills or relevance to the job role. There could be a huge pay parity between two people having the exact same responsibilities, just because of the seniority.

Corrupt rewards and recognition program - You'll find a few teams where every member gets an award no matter what they did, and some teams where saving even $1 million per month wouldn't be appreciated.

Late appraisals - Appraisal cycle is Jan-Dec. Reviews start from Jan/Feb, but appraisals usually happen around Jun-Jul, though pending arrear from April is paid altogether.

Poor benefits - Medical insurance and referral amount too low. Not enough parking for cars, a little better situation for two wheelers. Majority of the employees park outside, which is expensive/risky. No course/certifications reimbursements as well."

1) Management is very bad. Micro-Management is one thing, here managers have gone for Nano Micro Management. They will track every minute of your time.  In some time even Bathroom breaks will be timed.  

2) You have to complete 9 hours each day. Even though they do not have tasks for you. And even after completing 9 hours you are expected to be available 24*7, weekends and nights are all working basically.

3) They treat employees like slaves, if you are the favourite of your EM only then you will get everything otherwise you wont get any promotions or appraisals.

4) Best company for BootLickers as they can get promotions and appraisals without any talent or performance. people with 2 years experience are Senior Engineer here and 3-4 years experienced bootlickers can become Tech Leads. I think people with QA background can also become Senior Tech Lead.

5) HR and admins are the worst, let alone employees, they wont even treat you like human beings. They wont reply to the mails , wont pick up the calls or reply msgs. None of your queries get resolved. Sometimes we feel like even if we are standing in from they will act like they cant even see us.

6) Cafeteria is the biggest disappointment here. There are rats running around in cafeteria. There is no coffee machine in the CAFETERIA. Food is 3rd grade, and costs even more than the market price.

7)Their buildings are worst, 10 people sit on space which is meant for 5. Lifts never work, they are always under maintenance. You will never find a parking spot even if you come early. 

8) They tell you that you will have 2 months notice period but they can update it to 3 months, if you opt for going to a Foreign Country (You know which country it is) for ""training"" (not really!), they will ask you to serve 3 months of notice for going to a country for their own work.

9) They will say that their appraisal is done in April but the letter comes in August."

The constant power tussle between upper management is giving un-stability to the company.
There is no effort to keep employees happy and retain them. They will hire new people when you leave.

3.People are treated as slaves.Pathetic level of micromanagement.
4.You wont get your laptop even after 15 days of joining but still you are expected to it for 9 hours.
5.False hopes during interviews that we have work from home and stuff but on very first day they tell you that its not that they do here.
6.Laptops are very old i3 generation given to developers which hang like after every 2 seconds.

There is favouritism, people trying to cave their way in via some influential managers inside company, and every other sort of politics you can imagine.
- Middle management is literally the worst I have seen or heard of. There are managers who do nothing than berate people. Imagine a manager who has no idea of the inner workings of a project, always using a stick approach to get the job done, never giving credit. Many managers say even company CEO Vijay almost abuses them in meetings. UNPROFESSIONAL.  
- This place is more chaotic than a hurricane. They have no idea what they will do in next 15 days. Projects come and go like seasons. Employees are transferred from one sister company to another (One97 - paytm - paytmBank - Paytm Mall). You may be working on something super critical, only to come in next day and know that project is scrapped.
- Talk about employee perks - NIL. Benefits ? Negative. Employees do not even have proper seats to sit. There is huge space crunch. You leave your seat to go to the washroom, there is a 90% probability you're not getting it when u return. There have been fights between people over seating issues.
- You will almost certainly NOT get a seat in cafeteria if you want to have lunch on proper timings, it is over crowded, always.
- Parking is huge problem. Office is at very busy location in sector 2 Noida, you will never ever get to park in the office premises, there are only a limited number of spaces available. Only if you reach office before 9, you may get lucky. Otherwise you have to find a spot in local streets (very difficult), where your vehicle can be towed away anytime.
- HR is just a name here. It is absolutely useless. you make a referral ? HR will not reply. You have an issue with manager? - HR can do nothing about it."

2141,Paytm,Paytm Payments: Graveyard for Tech Guys,2018-08-02,1.0,Tech Lead,"I am strictly talking about the Tech Payment Gateway (PG) team here.
There aren't many pros that come to mind, few are:

1) Even if you are not good at technical implementation, but you can talk effectively and impress people in a discussion (design or product discussion). Then you can make very good career here, cause mostly these people just talk. Very little work is actually done here.

2) If you can keep your managers happy(not by work, mind you) and your manager is a powerful person within the hierarchy you will enjoy good appraisals/promotion etc.

3) You are  not only evaluated on your Tech capability, but also on how much in sync you are with your manager.","The list is endless:

1) The tech stack is pathetic, you will actually feel you skills deteriorating after working here for more than a year.

2) Half of the payments team work on Alibaba's platform which uses age old legacy tech and still on java 6 (yes thats right). There are no open source  frameworks used in platform.

3) IF you have more than 3-4 year of industry experience, absolutely stay away from here.

4) The work hours will be long and you might be expected to stay late even if you come in early. if you leave before 7:30 PM your manager will have a talk with you. doesn't matter if you come in early.

5) they call anytime during night to fix stupid issues which can wait till next morning.

6) The projects started rarely finish here, and most of the time you will be switched to some other work, before completing the previous one. 

7) Expectations from Tech Leads is that they will look into several project's management and also work as an individual contributer. Mostly end up burned out and leave.

8) Highly minial jobs like log analysis is give to less experienced folks and they get frustrated due to lack of coding exposure.

9) If a guy is working very well, he will not here any appreciation. But if his performance lacks even for one week (doesn't matter due to personal reason or what), someone will come and have a talk with you.

10) Constant micromanagement.

11) Employees are treated as naukars, even for a small expense approval you might have to beg to many senior people. I had to go to CTO for a 4000/- Rs. approval once.

I can go endlessly here... guys make a smart choice and stay away. 

They throw money to lure you in and then make your life miserable. No amount of money is worth the suffering."

- no respect given to employees. VSS regularly shouts at and abuses others and thinks everyone working at Paytm is his slave. Because of him the whole company's culture is like that as others follow his example too.
There are many more examples of how people are disrepected here but I'd not go into details.
- total micro-management by VSS and no decision making power with others. He even decides which coffee machine should be kept in the cafetaria, ha!
- blatant favouritism - VSS has a few that he likes and only those get all major projects, out of the line promotions and huge pay hikes. Likeness in VSS's books and not your work defines your graph at Paytm. Consequently, if he gets to dislike you, you're asked to leave and not report to office from next day.
-  No clarity and stability - Teams are changed frequently at VSS and management's whims and fancies with no regard to employee's wish or his experience. I've even seen Designers being asked to do Operations and HRs being made product managers.
- Anti-employee rules - HR rules are so anti-employee that you can't even imagine. There is even a clause that empowers the company to fire you for ANY CAUSE without any notice.
- Work is depressing to say the least. Everyone is just towing the line and has no clarity on what needs to be done.
- No sick leaves - if you get sick, poor you! Please avail off your casual and paid leaves.
- Different facilities and treatment based on your position and clout in the company"

I have been working in Paytm for almost 2 years now and enjoying every bit of it. Every company is different and so is Paytm. If you want to live a retired life, look somewhere else. If you have been spoiled by MNC's process oriented culture, look somewhere else. If you are looking for a job where work-life balance means 9-5 job, look somewhere else. If you want to be on rapid growth path, paytm is the place. If you want to upskill yourself, paytm is the place. If you have an idea which is not getting environment to sprout and become a product, come to paytm. If you have the fire to go beyond, look at paytm.

And coming to biz issues, Paytm takes a 'make money at all costs' approach. 'Only 10% of the people actually use cash back. We can use it to deceive people' is one of the common attitudes from the top management.

Fear, greed and entitlement and abuse are present in huge quantities in Paytm work atmosphere which can get hostile and toxic.

2. Work load is constant across every industry and i feel pity for those who say no work load. If that's the thing then I guess your company isn't doing any business. However, over here, smart approach is an applied science. We work hard and party harder!
3. There's nothing like Hierarchy! Strange isn't it! Well, what if i tell you that i had share a cup of tea with the CEO of the company just on the second week of joining. 
4. If you are creative, keep your workstation untidy and pin as many posters as you want to. 
5. Ain't satisfied with your work, talk to your Managers and they'll make sure they welcome your ideas and execute them.
6. Inexpensive food in mess. I mean where would you get a buffet platter at just 35. Though the food isn't that swanky delicious but yeah in a way it's pretty fine and yes, HYGIENIC.

This review is specifically about paytm. They have more HR and Product managers than entire engineering team.
