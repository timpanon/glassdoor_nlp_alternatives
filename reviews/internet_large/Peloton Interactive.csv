Overall easy job.","Mid to senior level leadership lacks transparency in communication. For several months, employees had a higher likelihood of finding out the future of the company via social media. 
There's a complete lack of financial responsibility amongst mid level leadership. Even after the layoffs, there's still frivolous spending.
Very questionable practices/decisions from senior leadership. Doing what's right should always trump what's 'easiest'. 
Inconsistent work/orders leads to disengagement amongst the team. As a leader, you're left on an island to figure out how to get your hourly employees hours.
Constant talk about growth opportunities, but no actual opportunity existed.
Consistent lack of HR support/follow through.
Corporate works Monday through Friday, but Field Ops works Tuesday through Saturday (creates an unnecessary gap in coverage and communication)."

Hopefully corporate reads this. 
Peloton you definitely gaslighted your employees. We were assured our jobs were safe. Delivering as many bikes as we could & fixing third party (xpo) mistakes. Customers were receiving bikes within a week at our location. For a fitness bike that cost over 1k customers expect white glove delivery not some amazon style delivery. Those 3rd party delivery people aren’t doing they’re job and that’s why Peloton will FAIL. Offering $200 off to customers currently who are dealing with shipping delays. Your issue wasn’t Peloton logistics! It’s the CEO and his decisions. You had to many people in higher up positions!! For instance our small team has 4 supervisors & 4 leads. Come on not necessary. Many warehouse have 1super and 2 leads for teams up to 200. Too much money waste.. I could go on but that will be too long."

After getting Covid, having all management - every level - just disappear from contact during the 3 weeks until being able to return. Careless and pretty hilarious they have made it this far.

There is a wide-range of personalities in management but my best experiences were with the ones who really cared about the company culture and making sure talent was recognized.

I’m the summer the job almost pays less than a part time job, hours are very hard to come by and it’s obvious they try to limit the hours per worker.

Unstable hours at times"

The company is growing and pay was really great! I loved my co workers and it was an all around great job","I was fired for dress code policy. Wearing the wrong type of black pants.  2 MONTHS AFTER I WAS TOLD. My manager was thee worst at communicating and setting any type of goal. No one in our warehouse had any idea what was going half the time. My manager also stole tip money that I got for staying later when our shelves were being installed. My supervisor was great, he actually listened and took what I said seriously. I was also written up cause I was using my phone while driving. BUT I HAVE TO! Regular delivery vans get a co pilot and they would use the phone to call customers and such. Master techs are alone and it’s super dangerous to pull over on the highway just to call a member. There needs to be a better system."
431,Peloton Interactive,The most fulfilling and challenging work of my career,2021-03-26,5.0,Manager,"-Team Members are supportive, kind, and push me beyond what I thought I could do. I feel supported across each milestone I approach. When I think ""I can't do this,"" I hear ""yes you can, and we'll help you get there."" Truly a team-centric culture, through and through–at all levels, tenures, and parts of the org. It doesn’t feel hierarchical, and I don’t need to go through layers of folks to connect with an exec. There is an openness, a willingness, and a shared humanity here. 
-The Mission: We are working at a company that is actively helping people *invest in themselves* during one of the most difficult periods of this generation. We are helping people form healthy habits, not based on an algorithm. I can high five folks in classes that I might never have connected with in real life (or online), feel moved by songs and genres I might never have listened to, and hear empowering messages of self love that I might never have absorbed otherwise. We get to work on this product and show people that they are worth investing in. We make it fun, we make it accessible, we make it inclusive, and we make it for the benefit of all—not for the benefit of advertisers. 
-DEI: The Peloton Pledge and our commitment to being an antiracist organization. I see this work happening internally every day with our programs and policies, I see it reflected in our content, and I see it reflected in our partnerships and how we invest in our communities. Also, as a trans person, I am feel extremely “seen” and supported. 
-Benefits: they are the best benefits I’ve ever had. 401K match, Carrot fertility that covers a significant amount, comprehensive healthcare—including mental health and trans benefits","-the pace is intense but I see leadership actively working on it
-typical growing pains of being a company that is not quite a start up and not quite a mature organization. we're in puberty and it feels uncomfortable!"

Suddenly they start digging and looking for something to write you up about and will look at all your tickets suddenly trying to target you and find something that they can try and say you did wrong. Management and leadership displays a facade of being “supportive and a family culture” to everyone when you’re in training. But as soon as you express your concerns about something inappropriate that they did, they will start to target you and try to get you fired. I initially liked starting my shifts everyday but now I dread it. Management/leadership is very shady and not to be trusted and they will stick together and go against the employee no matter what.

It's incredible especially with the high rate of unemployment and such a basic role. But the culture is pretentious and cold, hence tons of qualified candidates are turned down.

There are so many more things that are so wrong. Too much to type.  There is no work/life balance. People who have kids at home will never be home with them because of the crazy schedules. I never worked for a company who picks my schedule for me.

There are no walls between work areas to absorb background noise for calls.

Customers that are displeased with policies will send negative ratings that may go against your overall customer satisfaction score.  Management currently states there is no way of revising customer surveys to separate policy satisfaction versus the service the representative actually provided.

Pay is low to start (mid-30K)

Intranet help documents are poorly managed (old information isn't removed, new information is added on top of the old) and can be hard to obtain the most updated information quickly for members.

40 hours of time off every six months is not enough - You can have ONE vacation or prioritize your life carefully or you will have to go without pay.  


This is a good job for someone that's just starting a career, but not the best job for someone moving from one career to another.  I would recommend this job to young adults or recent graduates.  My friend's are mid-level career, such as myself.  This was a poor career move for me.   With that in mind, this should not deter anyone from applying here as it is truly the start of an amazing company!"
606,Peloton Interactive,Peloton Fails to Execute,2019-06-27,1.0,Sales Specialist,"The bike and treadmill are well designed products and the instructors are great and motivating customers, as well as keeping them engaged with the brand.","I had high hopes of a positive experience with Peloton, sadly that did not happen.  The company enables managers to create an uncomfortable atmosphere which to work in.  We were constantly berated for the smallest thing, such as a weight on the bike of a bike that was rotated by a customer that was not immediately returned to their company`s desired positioning.  Company leadership actually used expletives in conversation if the neatness of the store did not meet his exacting standards.  We were also instructed that the cameras were there to monitor us and to always make sure we were busy and to never sit down on the bench.  One of my co-workers that suffers from planter fasciitis was vebally reprimanded for sitting for just a brief moment once, after several hours on her feet.
During weekends, there was up to 7 of us on the sales floor.  And we all shared one laptop.  We all needed to communicate with our leads through SalesForce, being sure to send e-mails every 3 days to them.  And anytime they e-mailed us back or called us, we had to document it in SalesForce.  That would be fine if there was 2 or 3 computers for us to share.  Having to wait in a long line to use a computer at work to send out communications to customers is incredibly ineffecient.   Especially when you are also speaking with several walk-in leads/customers throughout the work day.    And then when you end up not being able to document everything in time for your dozens or hundreds of leads, the management team gives you a warning.  Bear in mind, there is also 2 hours plus a day spent cleaning by each employee.  With a checklist to document the cleaning that must be gone through 3 times a day.
The break room is located in the boiler room of the building, literally.
Meanwhile, our a co-worker made a racist comment to a customer, who loudly vocalized their disgust prior to exiting our store and that co-worker maintained their position and employment at Peloton.  It`s disgusting that somehow is tolerated and being a 100% up to date in SalesForce is not.  When an employee is relatively new they should give them coaching as well as some leeway in learning a new computer program; aside from ordering a couple more computers.
What is tragically ironic is that while there are incredibly high standards placed on retail employees, corporate fails to execute highly important matters.  Let`s take the $150 million dollar lawsuit with musical artists and their  record companies for one.  How does a company that streams classes to tens of thousands of homes forget to get clearance to use specific music from major artists ?  And when they decided to open 2 hours early on Black Friday, why was their new promotion of this in national ads or even on the local Facebook pages ?  Unsurprisingly, opening early did not yield very many extra customers.  
The company is too busy attempting to ""grow fast"" to execute on big picture issues that will make a big difference in them staying relevant and in business.  Peloton also continually sends out brand new ""field specialists"" to both customers homes and showrooms to assemble the bikes.  And because the company has them in such a rush, they often leave with bikes that wobble because the feet on the bottom are not properly aligned.  It was very frustrating demoing bikes for potential customers with a shaky bike.  A bike that would have been quite stable had the field specialist spent an extra 5 minutes installing it.  And as noted, the same thing happens with customers that just spent $2,500 total on their bikes, shoes and delivery.  So, you end up getting new customers calling the showroom and walking in to complain, rightfully so.  And if a customer lives ""too far"" from a warehouse, the delivery is outsourced to XPO Logistics.  This is a large company that delivers everything, so often times, a customer receives their bike from a driver that has never delivered a Peloton bike before and obviously has zero idea how to properly set it up and get it synced in with the customers Wi-Fi.

Lastly I`ll note what many other reviewers have noted; Peloton is very cliquey.  So, if the manager decides they don`t want you in the clique, they let you go for a very minor reason.  It`s supposed to be a serious business.  And at serious businesses, you allow your employees to work and get the job done.  In life, people have different personalities and that needs to be accepted in the workplace.  Particularly so, when customers are very pleased with an employees work."

- Worked like a dog with little to no recognition
- Terrible work-life balance. They say there is unlimited PTO, but that really only applies if your manager allows you to take time off.  If you get lucky and get a day approved you'll likely need to be answering emails and/or be on slack. This goes for regular after hours and on the weekends too. 
- HR team is a joke.  They have the tendency to overlook employee complaints/issues that will make more work for them. If you're unhappy they will just tell you to find a new job instead of being a confidential sounding board, offering conflict resolution meetings, or generally being helpful at all."

That being said, I only attach my name to something I truly believe in, and even though there are 8 million people in NYC, it's still too small of a town to be shady.

That being said, I love this company. I absolutely believe in the product(s) and company mission. We are truly offering a product that is changing people for the better and it shows with the communities our customers have built. The market adoption is out of this world and we're literally at the peak of being socially accepted as a noun when someone references live or on-demand (at home) spinning or running.

The people here are smart and passionate. The Engineers seem to love working so closely to hardware and vice versa. The pay is competitive, perks are great, and our CEO is genuinely a great guy who gets involved with our people regularly.

I truly feel lucky working here and look forward to seeing how we change the way people look/think about being healthy.","We had to annex a couple of floors because of our growth, but all the really good snacks are on floors 7 through 12."

650,Peloton Interactive,I would choose a better work environment over the money,2018-05-04,2.0,Retail Sales Associate,Excellent pay for work involved. Really fun product to sell. Home riders are awesome and after awhile I had not only met amazing people but made a lot of friends. They have meetings and include the whole company. I appreciated that. They don't mention it but offer reimbursement for training or certifications that you pay for outside of work. That was one thing I was most grateful for while working there. The first manager I had was very flexible and accommodating with hours.,"My experience was very similar to the review entitled ""cons outweigh the pros.""

When you are interviewing be really intentional about asking character and value questions of your immediate manager. During my time at Peloton, I met other managers and employees of different showrooms who seemed to have a more positive and encouraging experience than I did. 

Having said that during my time at Peloton I saw 2 people get fired. Both in a very similar way. Both top performers. I don't know if the manager felt threatened or just didn't jive with their personality or what. The manager would all the sudden start pointing out little things they did wrong that everyone in the showroom did and then start writing them up. I started taking pictures of how I did things so that way if my manager ever aimed at me I had proof. They do this so they don't have to pay as much unemployment when they fire you. The weird part is everyone knows what is going on but there's no way to do anything about it because conversations happen behind closed doors so if you are mistreated no one is there to defend you. I don't know how it was in other showrooms but it was like someone would be mistreated by a manager, everyone would know and just let that person barry themselves trying to figure out what to do. It was crazy to see it happen. HR was no help at all either. No exit interview. I don't know how all the inter-workings are supposed to work but I'm pretty sure that kind of stuff isn't ok. 

At the end of my time there I was getting bored. They started taking more and more control over what sales pros could do with their pipelines and offered little sales training. They talked about wanting to be the best sales organization in the world and then sent one of the execs around to the showroom and I kid you not, I heard him say, ""I don't really have any sales experience but they (other leadership) said that was a good thing."" How is that encouraging to a sales pro? After that, I realized they really think for the most part these bikes sell themselves and that I'm really just being babysat. How can you be creative and ""fail fast,"" when everything is dictated and controlled? 

Also, felt like managers were pretty fear driven to hit goals. Everytime an exec would stop by they were always so chill, even when they pitched occasionally. I felt more relaxed having them there. I remember thinking why does it have to be so intense when my manager and district manager are around?"

Healthy snacks are always available.","Peloton started out as my dream company to work for. That passion for the brand and my job quickly diminished with a change in management. I can't speak for all staff, but certainly my department didn't run by  the same company culture that made us fall in love with our jobs in the first place. 

Management can talk the talk, but in no way can they walk the walk. Part of the core values are to challenge the status quo, think critically, and have the autonomy to make our own decisions. If we failed, we were to fail fast and learn from the mistakes. This was supposed to help us grow and break barriers. Management would remind us of these values, but if you place them into practice and they aren't inline with their thoughts, ideas, and beliefs, you were seen as not adapting to the changes or not seeing the vision.

They have a top-down management style, although they would say it is bottom-up. There is an absence of transparency as to the changes going on and the proper support to be successful at your job. Everything is political. If you state your concerns or opinion, or do not share the same ideas, eventually you will be fired. They want a team of people who agree with them on everything. Management has lack of confidence with their ability to drive the business unless they surround themselves with a team of followers.

""Management"" and other employees are not qualified to train and develop other highly trained associates.

Discrimination of age is apparent in some locations as certain showrooms are only looking for inexperienced, under 30 and highly impressionable  employees.

- You will be challenged again and again. Lots of opportunities to take on projects if you're looking for them.

- Fast growth = growing pains. The company will take a while to figure out how to manage itself as a corporation, not necessarily a scrappy start up.
- So fast-paced it's easy to get left in the dust. You need to be prepared to work hard and deliver results, but also don't lose sight of what's coming next.
- When I was there, there wasn't a system for employee reviews. It was hard to tell if you were doing the right stuff and succeeding at it.
- Definitely some inter-company politics. Not a dealbreaker, but just know they're there. I see the word ""incestuous"" in other reviews. I'm not sure what that means, but it seems to point to spouses and significant others working for the company. That is true, but I never saw any issues with nepotism or favoritism.

They do not value employee ideas and feedback.  It is a very young (over confident and under-experienced) company.  The culture is catty, incestuous, and overall just uncomfortable.  Do not be fooled by the ping-pong table, free snacks, and modern open floor plan.  This company is a smoldering dumpster fire."

679,Peloton Interactive,Sales Associate,2016-05-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Best Company I have worked for! The environment is fun and competitive yet friendly! Its a plus that we get to ride in the window and get a work out in every once in a while!,The only con I can think of is working the weekends. However Its when you sell the most bikes so you actually end up wanting to work on the weekends.
