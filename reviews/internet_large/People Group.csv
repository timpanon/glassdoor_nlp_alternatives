willing to share (you typically don't get such easy access and support)

- This is a place you can call home; many employees have been here a long time which allows deep integration into the business and the ability to create pathways to success for others","No company is perfect. While we grow, there are things that are evolving (updating
technology, formalizing procedures, etc.) that come along with any
growing company. It's important to not get hung up on what's wrong, but to focus on
what is happening that is right and the progress in actions (not just words) that support
that. With this growth is an opportunity to define the future and the role you play in it.
That mindset is rewarded at People interactive."
