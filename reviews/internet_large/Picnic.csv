People are friendly; there's fun things to do at the hub, and people often chill for a bit before going home. Also, the hub parties are really good because somehow every hub seems to have someone who studied event planning at some point. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","The pay could be better. Also the scheduling is a bit weird. Scheduling is done by agreeing on sixteen hours you'll definitely be available to work per week... and if there are few shifts being claimed then those hours will automatically be scheduled to you. If there are lots of hours being claimed, then they won't... thus in the worst case scenario you could have to obsessively refresh the app to be first when the new shifts are made available, to be able to claim shifts."

- monotone and so boring. You will do the same task, sometimes many days in a row, for 10 hours.
- because of these 2 above things, most people only work 2-3 days a week, so this job doesn't have much possibility for full-time work.
- if you stop to talk for even 30 seconds, management will appear out of nowhere and force you to go back to work. You can't ever have any respite. Just work work work non-stop for 9-10 hours.
- every second of your existance is tracked. if your speed goes down, someone will be there to remind you to speed up. 
- If you have back pain forget about this job, you'll be in pain the whole day
- basically this job is the opposite of chill. you are treated like a robot with no time to stop, breathe and relax for even a minute. This is what got me the most. The lack of humanity. 
- if you forget your key tag twice you will be fired!! For forgetting your key tag!!! Which can be copied in 3 minutes!! Such lack of humanity and understanding.

In most low level jobs I have been, the vibe is sooo chill and slow. Here they separate you as much as possible and do the opposite of engaging communication. Now they introduced groups of the same people that can work together, so hopefully something changes."

The shoes they deliver are rustic and everyone must find a way to wear them. 
They are not interested in motivating staff in general so the environment is notoriously empty and it is clear that most of those who enter, resign in less than 6 month. 
On the other hand, they do not have a clear cleaning system specially in the area of fresh products and it gives the impression that they are not interested in emphasizing in this process that is also very important. 
The payment only change for cents and to have a fix contract is practically impossible.

Driven by key pillars ""Think, Dare & Do"", the company delivers up to expectations on each front. 

Friendly and easy going colleagues, flat organization and individual are given complete freedom to execute his or her own job. 

Picnic is a tech-driven company that strives to achieve technical/operational excellence by using the latest technology backed by the strong engineering team.

I have worked in many software companies in the Netherlands, and visited many, I can honestly say Picnic is one of the best.

There is the warm welcoming atmosphere, friendly people, very talented and skilled engineers, whom are also nice guys and gals at the same time.

Picnic also offers great technical challenges, and the development team keeps pulse on the latest trends, and takes what is necessary for the success.

There are occassionally technical knowledge sharing sessions where you can share your passion (hello Lars :), as well as have a vibrant discussion with your colleagues on the things they are passionate about.

Clean code, good design and architecture is what you find there people care about. Also you have a chance find Clojure minded colleagues there :) (should I reveal your name, F? :)

Picnic is also the unique company in a sense that it is good mix of both software and hardware, something you don't see often, and so you can make your hands dirty not only by writting code, but also joining the real aka physical part of the product to feel what it is behind the software, which I think is very valuable and makes the difference.

But really, there are only a few companies in the Netherlands which I could recommend to work, and Picnic is definitely one of them!

Last, but not least, very human like management and HR team. They really can support you in the difficult time, so you are not alone, and could expect the support when you need it! This is priceless!","Maybe encourage even more inter-team communication and collaboration, i.e. allow backend engineers to work on the data science, be involved in the deployment and production release, and visa verse.

- nice colleagues
- free lunches
- nice office building","If you are a developer, you should know that the Company is a super-market, NOT a technology company. Developers here provide features, not expertise to the business (you will be support of it at most). The bad:

- excessive and long code reviews with focus on personal style of leads
- priorities are changed weekly
- 0 compensation for extrra hours
- CTO neglects development team
- CEO pushes people around on weekly calls
- very little support if you come from another country
-salary is way below average"
101,Picnic,Great tech team with high quality standards,2018-03-04,4.0,Data Engineer,"Strong development team of experienced engineers . There is always someone willing to help and happy to share their perspective on a  challenging task.  The development pace and structure varies per product, however there is an established peer review process that contributes to a stable production sailing  and keeps the technical debt at bay.",Long backlog  and shifting priorities which requires extra effort to not compromise on quality and/or completeness of the features.

- lack of structure in some areas"
103,Picnic,Non-stop exploitation and lies,2018-02-17,1.0,Software Developer,"Great and fun team
Free lunch","During recruitment, the CTO paints a picture of a great company, but you can see through his lies and fake smile.
On the first day of work, you can see developers who look as if they have been sleeping well for a while.
A week later they put you to work on something completely different from what was promised to you and tell you that will be your new project. No onboarding, but the deadlines must be met.
A month later you are pulled into doing operations all the time. When you complain you cannot be a developer and operate the systems at the same time the CTO ""jokingly"" tells you to keep working during the weekend.
If you complain they tell you that working for Picnic is a privilege.

That what Picnic is: lies, stress and a very bad pay."
104,Picnic,Employee exploitation without shame,2018-01-30,1.0,Software Engineer,"Workaholics do work on weekends so you don't have to.
Lots of automation in software engineering processes.","Management lies to employees.
Lack of communication between teams.
Fake flat organization (everything is decided by an inaccessible inner circle)."
105,Picnic,No work-life balance,2018-01-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work is not overly exciting but it's OK. Friendly coworkers, new office and, company pays for lunch.","If you like to have a personal life outside of the office, stay away from Picnic.  After-hours and even  working on weekends  is normal,  and sometimes, the only way to meet your deadlines.  Why? Because management does this constantly, so you must keep up."
106,Picnic,Software Developer,2018-01-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Team is very hard-working and committed to making the company succeed. Open culture - numbers and figures are shared with everyone. You really get to learn a lot of the different aspects of the company.,"The hype unfortunately does not live up to its expectation. There is almost 0 opportunities to grow in the company, especially as a developer. Even the older guys which have been around since the start appear stuck doing the same job I do."
107,Picnic,No growth possibilities,2018-01-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Rapidly growing organisation, young and international team","No internal career possibilities, office is divided over different locations"

Lots of highly capable colleagues.","Scale up requires agility, flexibility. Currently, this could go smoother, but any real scale-up will find these issues. Confident we'll overcome them."
109,Picnic,It all goes great... Until your first day at work!,2017-05-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Some people there are really talented and you can learn a lot from them
- Free lunch","- Chaotic organization
- Unprofessional HR who, although are Dutch, do not know the Dutch laws 
- They do not provide any sort of facilities (simplest example: Microsoft Office - Employees use a cracked illegal version)
- They have a lot to work on the management side
- They lied about the working hours stating that it starts from 9 and ends at 6 which is against the law"
