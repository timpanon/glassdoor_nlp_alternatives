All the employees are leaving because of poor working conditions during covid. Company is making profit still they not only deducted our variable salary but also no increment for 2019. They even threatened to fire during covid and used the fear as a tool to make employees work 14 hour a day. They even fired a female employee who complaint against her manager because he used to call her in odd hours or late night for work status. We even worked on Diwali and Christmas because manager shamelessly asked us to do.

Mean while Pine is getting unicorn title , 2B doller evaluation  and bla bla. Top management takes 14M doller of esops and so on. But for low raking employees they have lemons.

Upper management only wants new product launches , no focus on quality, incomplete products are launched with known bugs  bcj deadlines are very short. All manager wants to please their boss only so they agree to whatever timeline is given.


All the person who have got offer from PineLabs please think twice before you join, because you might end up under a lunatic manager whose team has left  because of him.

2) Unrealistic expectations from the employees.
3) Toxic work culture, you'd be expected to put in 14 hours a day, including the weekends.
4) Spineless HR ; They would do what the senior managers from the technology department would ask them to do. You can not go to them with your grievances and expect a resolution. The HR also don't stand by their words. 
5) They would try to lure you with a good pay package, but don't fall for it. I haven't seen a company with this high variable to fixed component ratio. And they would mess up your variable at the end of the year if you are not in the good books of your manager (it can fall anywhere in the range of 0-30%).

I was a part of sales team where my reporting Manager only talks about himself and his goal to be the no. 1 which is good  but cost us our peace coz of realistic target in unrealistic no. Of days which added to immense pressure to my fellow team mates . 
New joinees are not spared at all ..there is no difference in an old and new employee... targets will remain the same whatsoever
Training is given but in a shabby manner where ppl wonder and are not sure whether will this product sell in the market...
Basically no mercy ....and the organisation wants justification of the salary from day 1 or they will screw ur happiness
HR doesn't have hold at all ...their responsibilities are only hire candidates. No employee  retention program
