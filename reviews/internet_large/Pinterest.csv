3,Pinterest,Vile organization in its death spiral,2022-04-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"An exorbitant amount of money is spent on appearances so lots of great gifts, virtual events, and phony Glassdoor reviews to lure you in","Sadistic, organized group bullying and harassment against high performing individuals, especially those from marginalized backgrounds, is not only rampant, it is also sanctioned and perpetuated by HR. They won't just stop at sabotaging your work and trying to embarrass you, they'll also give your phone number out, spy on you, and gaslight you into oblivion. As you may imagine, this takes a lot of time. No real impactful work is being done because anyone with talent is being targeted by disordered individuals for extreme abuse and degradation. That's why there is so much turn over and so many headlines about how toxic the culture is. That's why the product is so buggy, junky, and boring. People are literally recruited to this company for the sole purpose of being preyed upon by the most miserable creatures on earth. The things I saw in my brief and traumatic stint in this joke of an organization could be the plot to a sci-fi film. The money will run out eventually, Pinterest, and when the business fails spectacularly it will be the least you deserve."

I could see some managers been a partner to his/her team. Always trying to help the team grow and have a good performance. But, I experienced myself manager(s) doing the opposite what a manager should do: making people feel miserable bc they're not perfect and still learning and some abuse of power as well.

41,Pinterest,Sinking ship,2022-01-13,1.0,Product Designer,Not any pros anymore unfortunately,Lack of logical/solid product strategy.  Leadership doesn’t understand the product and make the worse decisions. There is absolutely no room to advance career wise.

Benefits are good, worklife balance is very good. Compensation is OK.","Some take having a good worklife balance and unlimited PTO too literally and milk it. This is generally accepted.

52,Pinterest,Some of the most brilliant people I've worked with,2021-12-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Brilliant people, usually very kind and personable too
- A CEO that has great values: humble, smart, kind (although big introvert) prefers to do it right rather than fast... rare in tech. 
- A fantastic culture : the company (and the people in it) care about the impact Pinterest has on the world.
- Some great events (like Knitcon, an annual conference focused on learning new hobbies from colleagues)
- Very competitive compensation

Competitive Salaries - Perhaps slightly above the average
Interesting perks - Aside from the benefits. (Compensation packages, etc..)

Growth: Scalable roles - Once inside, is to plan your career path. Plenty of growth opportunities


Product: Quite unique narrative, different from what you have out there. 

Development: Everything is in development which brings an insane amount of possibilities to grow, learn and change everything around you.

Management: Experienced and engage, although very sales oriented.","There is no catering on-site - As we are all WFH, not a big problem.
(But you have some beers around and some exceptions to order food)

The workload is quite heavy - Crazy pace, specially joining during Q4. 

Start-up mentality - Many things still to develop. (Policies in place, Platform, Support, Technology, etc...)
This can drive you nuts or make you thrill. It is up to you! :)

Recognition and Rewards should be improved and more present - This will help cross-collaboration between teams.

Everything seems to be ""in a rush"" leaving no time to proactivity and self development.

Joining during COVID is hard, but joining in Q4 during COVID is even worst."

Everyone else needs to figure out as they go and hard to know where you stand. Perfs are structured so that they can be arbitrary. Everyone is scared, watching their back and looking out for #1. Saw multiple employees leave due to burnouts, breakdowns, and mental health issues. It's all smoke and mirrors. Work their people like dogs as well. Seems like they just keeping hiring from Google and expecting that anyone not from Google will just figure the systems out with no training. Total PIP culture and lets dead weight just coast as long as they are comfortable with feeling terrible day in day out."

109,Pinterest,Truly a traumatic experience. Still recovering from my time there.,2021-05-12,1.0,G&A,"I was one of the first employees in my region, and setting up the company in the early days was fantastic. Everybody seemed so kind, humble and hands-off. I'd worked at several other Silicon Valley companies before, and was really surprised with how down to earth everybody at Pinterest was in comparison. The product was also great, and I felt very proud to represent such a great brand.","As time went on, I had to work alongside and deal with the results of terrible senior management decisions. It was an open joke about the C-level turn-over. High profile new hires would join, only to leave less than 12 months later. Every single week another email would come through - ""X has decided to leave to explore new opportunities"". It created a really uneasy feeling. As a result there was no faith in management's decision making. 

Management favorites were given pay-rises and promotions ahead of people with longer tenure, with no clear rationale as to why. Old-boy network behavior happened all the TIME - i.e. Sales leaders taking only the male sales staff on golf trips, whilst the females were left to make the restaurant bookings. I personally witnessed two senior female leaders either fired or demoted as a result of taking maternity leaves that were considered indulgently long (despite being within the legal limit). It was honestly very traumatic. People were often given management responsibilities without the pay rise or title, only to then be made to reinterview for their job and demoted with no recognition.

After 5 years I left, and it was a hard decision as I had a lot of wonderful co-workers there. But I now feel free, and it's amazing the Stockholm Syndrome you realise you had after you leave a toxic environment. I have since been contacted by Pinterest twice to come back for new roles, but I wouldn't do it to myself. And I've advised close friends to avoid it too. The company needs a lot of work to resolve their deep rooted problems."

SEXISM:You have gross white men ""mansplaining"" to younger professional women that they're not being taken seriously or invited to client meetings because of how they dress is paired with the company-wide sexual misconduct issues where multiple women have come out of being harassed.
HOMOPHOBIA: Since when is it cool to mock a fellow coworker to his face (or even behind their back) by using ""gay voice"" and limp wristed gestures? Straight white head of department also made slurs at a company offsite too.
LACK OF DIVERSITY: Tone deaf speeches from upper management about race and inclusion. Being scolded at for speaking in Spanish in the halls. Literally one black person on my very large team - everyone else being straight and white.
FAVORITISM: If you're not kissing your managers rear end every day you'll be left out of meetings and projects. Manager picked 3 favorites and ignored everyone else - didn't schedule one-on-one's, include us on projects or manage check-ins for anyone else.
RUDE PEOPLE: It's a work environment, I get that you have to be on good behavior, but so many people are fake. Really sweet to each other in group meetings to show face, but then huddle to talk negatively or make fun of another coworker. Maybe that's just office politics, but it's pretty terrible."

Pulse surveys are a joke. Many teams are getting poor results, but the follow up actions aren't good enough.
- There are deep cultural problems and HR lacks severe empathy in driving real cultural change and they aren't driving the right behaviors to make the company better. Minorities are leaving the company at an alarming rate.
- Lack of accountability: processes and OKRs are constantly changing, so you don't know what to focus on or what the new process is. Also see note above re: pulse results.

At Pinterest, there were lots of opportunity to make impact, culture within our team was excellent since we had full control of hiring, perks are decent, and I like Ben as a leader since he displays a lot of empathy.","Pay and perks are a bit behind industry, we can be more thoughtful about the quality of the product we ship, and certain orgs have leaders that are not just incompetent leaders, but are also awful human beings. Despite 1-2 years of feedback to surface the issues and 100% of some teams churning, those leaders end up staying and HR seems to do absolutely nothing. It's heartbreaking since Pinterest has a lot of potential, and it sucks to watch superstar teams dissolve solely due to bad leadership.

If you're going to work here, heavily vet the org you're going into (ideally from someone in that org you trust) because it can either be a great place to work or work life can seriously suck without any hope of change."

191,Pinterest,Toxic and demotivating work environment,2020-05-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Regional offices seem to have a better culture than HQ
- Free lunch/dinner
- Onsite workout, crafting classes (studio nights, knit con)","- Uncaring and unmotivating middle/upper management - Most employees are seen as expendable for the bottom line. The underlying culture is ""get in line or get out"" if you don't like how the business is run. If you are a seller, you are given higher and higher sales targets that become increasingly more stressful and unattainable. If you're on a sales XFN team, you are blamed for all missed revenue opportunities, and you can expect the director of your org to scream at your team about how your team is a disappointment. 
- Ineffective HR - All concerns have fallen on deaf ears, whether raised through Pulse, group meetings, 1:1 meetings with HR/People experience. I now fully understand the fact that HR's mandate is to protect the company, and not the employees. HR's solution will be to tell you to find another job if you're truly that unhappy. 
- (Org dependent) Stagnation in career growth. I've seen that promotions have rarely been based on merit, but rather department optics or if someone has been severely mis-leveled coming into this company. Inter-company career transitions are also highly discouraged. As a result, there is high attrition of top talent as they feel they aren't valued for their work, stuck in the same role for years, and have to look outside the company to find the next step in their career.
- Toxic work environment. Management say they care about culture in all hands meetings and department wide emails, but in reality, the culture they breed is one that is founded in fear. The value ""care with candor"" has become a way for management to CANDIDLY tell you everything that you do ""wrong"" based on benchmarks that change weekly or even daily, and if you CARE about retaining your job, you should work harder and longer hours against an ever moving target to make sure that our org leaders look good in front of Ben."

- Nominally good values that are once in a while backed up by actual action (KnitCon)","I'm sure from the outside Pinterest seems like a fun, collaborative, creative place to work, and its company size gives off the impression that it's going to have a startupy feel. After 1.5 years there I can unequivocally say that while this is the story that is advertised internally as well, in day to day life, the direct opposite is true. This was by far the most toxic work environment I have ever been a part of. A culture of passive-aggressiveness and at times complete disrespect for colleagues that are deemed ""inferior"" is rampant. Teams that should be working together are actively pitted against one another by management. Bullying by superiors is not only common but is basically expected as a norm. Promotions are almost never based on merit, but generally instead on whatever optics need to be pushed that month. Feedback is constantly ignored or met with empty promises that no one is ever held accountable for (or, at worst, with ""if you're unhappy you can leave"" or even actual firings/removals from teams if a manager finds you ""difficult""). It's not a huge majority of people that are the worst offenders of this behavior, but the major issue is that the larger company seems to be content to allow them to act this way, which in turn enables lesser offenders to become worse when they see that there are no consequences. At this point, it seems like the company is propped up by revolving door of competent and ambitious people producing some good work that others end up taking credit for until they either become fed up with the toxic culture or are pushed out once they can no longer be used."
193,Pinterest,Unhealthy work environment,2020-04-15,2.0,Sales,The food is good and the architecture/design of the office is cool,"Toxic work environment. The staff isn't the most friendly unless you are in the inner circle. It has a ""mean girls"" or ""highschool"" vibe. Just like most major companies, they pretend to be fun and carefree. However, at the end of the day, they are extremely money hungry and quota focused."
194,Pinterest,"Fun company, great mission!",2020-04-08,5.0,Partner Manager,Working at Pinterest you're surrounded by really talented people. Everyone is driven and aligned with the company mission. It's the first place I've worked where people feel really good about where the company is headed. Consumers have a unique mindset when they come to Pinterest and the company has done a great job embracing that and providing additional tools for consumers.,Things can move a bit slowly as it relates to internal navigation. Some times there are too many cooks in the kitchen on certain projects. Internal vs external hiring and promotions/team changes. There isnt a standard practice for this and certain situations that you think are the same are handled completely differently. Need more process in place where there's less gray area

There is constant change on the people team where new processes, definitions, roles, projects are constantly being pushed down the manager's throats without much explanation to why the change is better. The perf cycle changes this time around is yet another change we have to deliver as managers and manage unnecessary turnover

needed, but otherwise working weekends is minimal, people respect vacations and minimal email responses required at night

Actually really compelling insights about what people are into personally vs the face they put out into the world. Strong hire with Andrea Mallard at CMO.,"1. Compelling narrative but does not play out in reality for most advertisers, making it actually a hard product to sell.
2. Stagnating growth in US and lack of male audience requires a decent amount of spinning
3. Sales leadership is all over the place, they solve missing revenue goals by endless reorgs, which is leading to mass attrition of sales people. They are highly distractable by the latest big “deal” and fail do not have a solid plan in place to diversify revenue or focus on the big picture.
4. As a seller, it’s feast or famine. Revenue targets are often irrational leading often based on ambition rather than reality to a demotivated sales force. Compared to competitors, I would say this is one of the worst companies to work for if you like compensation stability. Pinterest is young, but not so young that they should have this much trouble setting realistic goals."

222,Pinterest,Inspired Everyday,2019-05-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pinterest is one of the best jobs I've had! The company has an amazing work-life balance, and is very flexible for people with families. It's not uncommon to see people leaving at 4pm to go pick up their kids, working from home on Wednesdays, etc.

For career mobility, it seems like managers are generally supportive of people exploring different paths. I've noticed that managers are much more receptive to internal candidates than I've seen at other companies, so it's a great place to go if you want to try something new (though you still need to go through interviews and be solid performer).

On culture, people joke about Pinterest being ""too nice"", but I find it refreshing to work with people who genuinely care about me as a person, and will go out of their way to help. I love coming to work everyday because of the people on my team! The workplace, pincuisine, and security teams are also wonderful and seem really happy, which I think speaks to how well Pinterest treats employees across the company.","Some orgs are better than others in terms of management, work-life balance and career mobility, so it really depends on your manager/leader of the org (which I guess happens as we get bigger). We can also be slow to let go of underperformers.

Compensation and benefits are competitive, but not astounding. However, worklife balance and not commuting to South Bay make up for that easily."
223,Pinterest,"Good Company Mission, but Too Bad it's not Embraced Internally",2019-05-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- If you get stuck with a toxic team, the bright side is that a good portion of the company has really some of the kindest, smartest people I've ever encountered.
- I love that the company has Knitcon, which is truly worth looking forward to every year!
- Food, health benefits, etc. are pretty good!
- I continue to be inspired by Ben and the company mission.","- Ineffective HR department - do not overcomplicate your life by trying to resolve issues internally. If you're facing harassment, move on to another company. If you're facing discrimination, you too should move on. Retaliation? It's rampant and fairly widely accepted so again, move on. It doesn't matter if you have written proof and 23984 witnesses. It doesn't matter if the perpetrator is a bad leader and incompetent at his/ her job. Pinterest. Doesn't. Care.
- Absolutely zero transparency as to how compensation is determined at hiring & merit. The definitions & criteria seem to change based on the candidate & recruiting cycle.
- So much ""unconscious bias"" (what Pinterest calls it) within the company that every time I hear a mid-level manager challenge a female's technical ability or say some bizarre gender-stereotyping or racial comment, I think that Pinterest as a company should really start calling it ""conscious bias"" because Pinterest continues to turn a blind eye despite multiple complaints. Like I said above, you're better off quitting.
- Pinterest is still relatively new and so unfortunately, you might get stuck with a ""manager"" who essentially hit the jackpot by being an early employee at the company and rose through the (small) ranks because of that fact alone. As a result, you have a lot of leaders who are just unfortunately some of the worst managers by standard definitions and... you unfortunately can't do anything about it because no one reads quarterly surveys on managers (Pulse surveys). 
- Zero accountability by leaders to make sure that they're creating a culture internally that is reflective of the company mission."

Workplace bullying is essentially institutionalized here, where senior leaders continue to turn a blind eye at mid-level managers, who are some of the most inexperienced, abusive managers I’ve ever come across in my career. Fear of retaliation is a genuine concern here as well, so going to HR is basically not an option unless you’re at your breaking point where you’re okay quitting if things go more south."
235,Pinterest,Scrambling to ipo,2019-02-07,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice location, delicious food and average medical benefits on par with most tech companies 
Most colleagues are very nice people and genuinely interested in doing good for our users
Generally good work life balance for most teams","The company is scrambling to ipo likely this year but moving really slowly towards this goal and not being transparent at all about what’s happening. 

To make their multiplier look good they have also been doing a bunch of restructuring and significant pay cuts on various teams. They really screwed some teams over by justifying these pay cuts as industry benchmarking. Very short sighted in my opinion because they are punishing employees for being loyal and doing well and the people affected are really disappointed in the company. 

Pretty sure a lot of people are going to quit once they ipo. Everyone is just hanging around to see how much their options are worth. Most people think their options will be worth less than what they were promised at the point of joining the company yet the recruiters still use this as a perk to attract new hires."

WLB is the price you pay to work at the most coveted places here in the valley. Or you can join a mediocre company, sit and relax, rest and vest while yearning for exciting challenges at work - that never seem to come buy. You can tell yourself that since you have work life balance, you don't need to enjoy work and learning.

But then comes Pinterest, that takes the best of both worlds and creates a culture that I, personally have never seen. Pinterest's culture shows us that in order to work in an organization consisting of some of the smartest people in the valley, you don't have to compromise on personal life. The WLB hits a sweet spot here where you can have immense impact due to the small size of the company - and yet go home on time and relax with your family. People are very nice here - too nice I think! We used to have a cultural fit interview round until very recently. I also know of brilliant jerks who were fired simply because they were not nice to people.

268,Pinterest,Such a shame,2018-06-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"I honestly had been obsessed with this company before joining. I was so happy to be there, and was there for 4+ years. I was proud to share that I worked there. I loved what we could do for our partners and the potential as a company. I met some incredible people there during my time.","I honestly thought I made a mistake about 3 weeks in. I was heartbroken that it ended up being what it was. Smart people but too worried about their individual impact vs the impact as a company or team. Many passive aggressive personalities. Focus on the negative and what you don't do right vs what you actually are good at. I feel ike most people felt worst about themselves working there than they ever had. This was the most ironic but sad part. Very limited upward mobility and if you are in a remote office, nearly none. Its hard to imagine them as a global company, when people 3 hours away feel completely disconnected.
The new Google leadership is like a complete disconnection from the core values of the company and seem to be overwhelmed with that they need to achieve but unwilling to show any weakness. 
I was always inspired by Ben and Evan, but wish so much that they were more in touch with the reality of the issues of the company. Oh, and HR seems to not give a crap about anyone."

- You'll never work for a company where users love the product more; Pinners LOVE Pinterest
- Opportunity to focus on the bleeding edge in the space (ads, consumer product, design, etc.), everyday
- Urban campus setup. All the benefits of a large tech company, conveniently next to CalTrain / in SoMa.","For context, via consulting / FTE roles I have worked at over 15 companies in a 10 year career. 

Pinterest was, by far, the most political, disorganized and lost organization I've ever encountered. My comments are more for the Ads team, than the core experience group--but each week/month/quarter brought an endless stream of reorganizations, reprioritizations and re-buzzwords.  It's a product that has a very clear fit and need within the marketing landscape--but is forever mired in internal resource fights, personality clashes and confusion.  One day you're chasing what Facebook just did, the next what Google just did, the next what we talked about 6 months ago but no one can seem to remember.

Every week starts out with identifying organizational misalignments. And rather than spend your week building toward something. Thinking about where to go next. You'd spend your week fire-fighting the crisis of the day.  If you're looking to expel a lot of energy managing political cycles that never seem to go anywhere, this is the place for you.

I learned more in two years at Pinterest than I did anywhere else--It was one of the most diverse and challenging roles in my life. But I'll probably look at it as the worse epoch in my career.  When I worked there, every time I interacted with another alum--they'd always start with, ""Is it still crazy?""

My answer was always Yes."

277,Pinterest,Horrible place to grow,2018-02-25,1.0,Software Developer,"- Pay is pretty good and slightly above industry
- Benefits are good (401k match would be nice at any level)
- Not super stressful, you won't be working weekends or late nights","- Lots of managers who are promoted from within who are horrible at basic management skills. 
- Kool aid stronger then any other company I've worked at. A lot of people here really think Pinterest is fundamental different then other companies in the Bay Area and that Pinterest is really ""making the world a better place."" I didn't know a company making a social bookmarking service was better then a company that is working on healthcare. 
- Lots of infighting, the reason this company hasn't done anything in the last few years is because all the orgs are fighting against each other for metric wins. 
- Racist coworkers. I think in 4 to 5 companies I've been at, I've never heard such racist remarks at a company. Tried reporting it but the problem with Pinterest is that so many people are friends with the CEO and just get a pass. Doesn't matter that you have a record of it in slack or 3 other coworkers also complained and left. 
- Very passive aggressive culture. 

The truth is, Pinterest is doing ok on the business side but it's overselling it's value to it's employees in order to generate hype and keep people instead of fixing issues. From the engineering side, the tech debt here is so bad from bad leadership you won't grow very much. 

I would be very careful about coming to Pinterest with the IPO right around the corner. Once this company has its IPO, the fire will die overnight. The mythical chance of getting rich overnight is keeping a lot of employees around despite bad management and poor engineering leadership. 

Just ask yourself: How many people are really passionate about this company vs how many people are passionate about just making a quick buck and leaving. If you work here you probably know the answer to that. This company will have to change significantly if it wants to be around for another 5 - 10 years. Currently I'm not confident in leadership's ability to adapt to those changes. 

and lastly, the metrics for this company aren't even that great. It's growing which is good but it's growth and revenue numbers are far under what they need to be to prove it's valuation. This is not a 12b company and the market will adjust for it."

Obviously, YMMV depending on what team you're on and what you do, but my day-to-day work experience is generally positive.  I don't work with a bunch of a**holes, I get to work on things that I enjoy, and I don't have anyone breathing down my neck to kill myself in the name of artificial deadlines.  For junior engineers, Pinterest seems to be a pretty good place to be.  There are a lot of problems to solve and a lot of smart people to learn from.

However, more senior people who come in are struck by some of the stupid engineering decisions that were made in the early days of the company and the complete inertia that seems to surround the notion of changing these things.  It also seems that people who have only been here a year or less are still drinking the kool-aid, but the longer you stay, the more you start to wonder about the emperor's wardrobe.

Whether or not Pinterest is a good choice for YOU depends very much on what is important to you in a job.  If you just want a place to come hang out for a few years, do some work and collect your paycheck, and maybe learn a few things along the way, you can do that here.  If you've still got that idealist fire in your eyes and you want to go work on something special, or if you want to go somewhere that you can make a big impact, think twice before you come here.  It might work out for you, but you might also end up very disappointed.","- Very average base pay, no bonuses.
- No 401k match. 
- Codebase is drowning in technical debt.
- CEO is an amateur who has outlived his usefulness.
- Some engineering teams are perpetually understaffed and others get all the love.
- Overall product / company direction sometimes feels like a boat without a rudder.
- Too much focus on doing things that look good on the surface but lack real impact.

---
Most of the executive team has been replaced with industry veterans over the past couple of years, but we still have a CEO who is learning on the job and who is eventually going to become the albatross around Pinterest's neck.  The other reviews which talk about how he can't handle criticism are all spot-on; he does a fine job of coming across as a genuine, caring individual, but all of that goes out the window if you disagree with him.  If Pinterest is to have any chance to become all of the things that he says that it can be, Ben needs to step aside and let a more professional captain run the ship.

I'd like to be more positive about Pinterest, but the fact is that so many people here just seem to be going through the motions for one reason or another that any lingering effects there might have been from drinking that cup of kool-aid when I started working here have long since worn off.  Outside of a few small teams, there's not much technical innovation going on, engineering direction is always changing, and it really has gone from something to be excited about to just another job, which means there's no longer anything special about Pinterest that separates it from any of the hundreds of other companies in the bay area that an engineer could work for.  It's a job.  It pays the rent.

It should serve as a wake-up call to management that every quarter, the percentage of engineers that expect to still be working at the company 12 months from now keeps going down.  Yet nothing seems to change."
283,Pinterest,great culture,2017-12-28,5.0,Data Analyst,"As Pinterest has matured as a business, it has become more focused on profitability and execution, but at the same time retained a very friendly and warm culture.","There are really no negatives to speak of, aside from the fact that sometimes people can be ""too nice"" at the expense of ensuring scalable and robust engineering systems."

Benefits are great, especially for a pre-IPO company, and the perks are nice.  The food, beverages, and snacks are great.  Generous time off (take as much as you need to recharge), and a non-hierarchical management make this place stand out.

I love that the CEO, Co-Founder, and other Sr. Leaders are accessible, and that there's a weekly Q&A where we can ask questions and get updates on the company.","Sometimes the need to get consensus slows things down a little, but on the other hand it also helps us avoid a lot of rework when people aren't bought in."

302,Pinterest,Amazing Company -- Far Exceeded Expectations,2017-08-02,5.0,Product Manager,"I came to Pinterest to learn. I have learned at a much faster rate than anticipated for a few reasons.

1) People are incredibly talented. My manager and peers are best-in-class. I learn how products are built the 'right' way.

2) Culture of collaboration. My projects require deep cross-functional coordination. Everyone is onboard with this and is willing to help and lend support where needed. I don't get the ""schedule time with me next week"" thing -- if I have a question, someone will take the time to help.

3) People are genuinely nice. It's amazing how much you can accomplish and learn when you don't have to worry about self-promoting, ego-driven a-holes. I love that folks are low-drama, mission-driven, and marching in the same direction.

Along with the professional development, I've also thoroughly enjoyed many other aspects of the job / company culture.

1) Leadership is very strong. Ben is a very inspiring, conscientious, intelligent CEO.

2) Pinterest cares about diversity. Like, actually cares. It's not propaganda -- we are a thought leader in the industry and it shows in the makeup of folks we hire.

3) Work-life balance is great. Folks are focused and GSD. But there's not an expectation that you need to kill yourself.

4) Perks :) Food, snacks, games, gym, music room, +++","I disagree with a few of the product ""bets"" that we are making. The company has a huge growth trajectory -- we've reached product-market fit and there's low-hanging fruit everywhere. We can grow 2-4x by just investing more in what we're already doing. Every company needs to innovate, but I worry that we are too focused on disruptive innovation when we could be focusing more on bringing our core product to more people, in more locales."

The mission is part of our every day and we are expected to live and breathe it. Experiencing the product in our lives and being Pinners ourselves helps us think about the end users and make the product better for those who make us successful. Here's what I LOVE about this culture.
-Super smart, down-to-Earth, friendly people. Everyone is willing to roll up their sleeves to help one another accomplish their goals. Collaboration is key and there's a lot of cross functional work that takes place. ""Knitting"" with other departments is part of who we are.
-Transparent leadership. Q&A with founders every Friday sets the tone for open, honest communication across the company. It makes you want to go the extra mile to help the company succeed.
-Work/life balance. People not only respect that you have responsibility outside of the office but that you are a person with interests, too. It's engrained in the culture that you get out and try new things, explore the world, do what you love and be who you are in order to be the best and most productive.
-Equity packages make you a true owner of the company. Your success is the company's success and it makes you work just that much harder.
-Outlook for the company is strong. We are constantly compared to the Google's and Facebook's of the world and it's often hard to keep up but just being in that category given our size is a compliment.
-On-staff chefs with breakfast, lunch and dinner daily at HQ.
-Dog friendly: so many cute pups to play with as needed
-Social company: the expectation is that you get to know your co-workers and it makes being a part of a growing organization so much fun because you get to enjoy time in and out of the office with great people.","Not many, honestly. But for sake of balanced feedback:
-Growing pains. Pinterest is growing fast and there are moments where it's clear that new process is needed where it's never existed before. It's an opportunity to impact change and make things better but can also be frustrating.
-You're thrown right in. Everyone is willing to help but it's really up to you to determine your path here and carve out your place.
-Salaries are a tad lower than typical market value. Equity packages help make up for it but if you're in it for your base this may not be the right time to join a company of this size."

And there's a drive and hustle there - people stepping into different roles and wearing hats as needed to get sh*t done. Very little ego, just drive.",Nothing significant that I haven't seen much worse elsewhere.

While this review is mainly negative the company does have sparks of people who are great to work with and will help with your professional development however these people seem to be leaving more and more and are being drowned out with people who are here to build their personal brand and leave.","- Lots of middle to upper management who are very inexperienced and do not understand what being a good manager entails. Often leaving lower management who are more experienced (but not early employees) left to deal with a lot of the issues. 

- Confusing promotion cycle that is used to promote favorites rather than as a guide to evaluate employees for each level. 

- Feedback system that gives little to no feedback besides fluffy words to make you feel good. Leaving areas for growth hard to determine. 

- A culture that promotes being authentic but often times people are too scared to give real feedback (or don't know how to do so without being rude) leading to an overly passive aggressive culture.

- Too many people feeling they need to be clued into everything going on, leading to decisions that take sometimes 6 months to a year to get going. Actually this is so bad at Pinterest we created two teams whose whole purpose is to show us brainstorming videos but not actually ever ship anything. 

- Mobile culture that doesn't believe in writing tests but complains about regressions.

- We do not understand how to evaluate good work on its own unless it comes with a dashboard with blue colors.

 All in all we haven't shipped anything of value in over a year. We take on bring projects that often times are solutions to a problem that doesn't exist. Management loves to show us videos of what Pinterest could be but will never take any steps to actually making it that way. 

If this is a company where you want to just come in and sit and do a few PRs a month, maybe do some experiments on changing the color of a button then come join Pinterest. You will find it very easy to work here even if that means in 3 to 4 years the company might not be around anymore.

If you want to come and do hard work, figure out how make things scale, influence organizations or ship bolder product initiatives realize Pinterest will not care about that work and will not support you in trying to do that."

Management shuffle every few weeks, reorganization of Engineering, Design and Product. Huge employee churn with many highly technical individual contributors leaving the company for better places like Facebook and Google.

Fact is even though international growth looks pretty okay, the revenue is lagging behind very badly and it is very hard for employees to justify the lofty valuations. Management seems to think that all problems can be solved by management change / reorganization, and they have mistreated many valuable individual contributors that have left the company. The commerce initiative has also failed and the fallout is spectacular.

This company is great for early employees that became middle managers. Most of them are clawing their way to stick around, stepping on others, because it is very hard for them to find similar positions at other more respected companies.

Our engineering leadership is now led by either professional managers from second tier companies that lack technical depth, old employees that are just clocking in and out daily to keep their positions, or medaled professors that have very little practical know-how.

Key observation: asking the question doesn't mean enforcing the behavior. ""No"" is perfectly a great answer! This is recently proven by our President's action to making sweeping changes to the entire engineering organization and admitting no technical folks were consulted in the decision.

This reminds us of the dramatic downfall of our previous sales organization also orchestrated by the same person. Was he supposed to earn our trust after that last debacle?

Also what about the mistakes by our chief product guy? He seems to be another company insider with no product vision. Is our president distracting attention away from the main culprit by removing others under him?"

351,Pinterest,"Good for College Grads, Pause for Experienced",2016-07-07,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pinterest does a good job of recruiting a steady stream of quality industry IC pros and some of the most apt college grads.

The college grads are forming one of those networks that will help them throughout their career. It's impressive how well they've bonded and work together. Projecting a little bit, it's possible their network will be Pinterest's version of the Google and Facebook networks of early out of college employees. Pinterest is at a good point for young talent to take on reasonably large project areas and see a good chunk of what it takes to run a company. Very good job to take in the first few years of a career.

Overall there's a good foundation for what could be a great job. The company baseline definitely cares about its employees. The perks are good with frequent team happy hours, nice quarterly offsites, quality local and healthy food. The goals and pace of the company enable a good work life balance. Compensation is competitive and reasonably structured.","There are far more cons than I would have expected for a company that is doing as well as Pinterest is externally. I think it is a core product that resonates with a large audience, but these problems will hold Pinterest back from becoming more than it is.

The quality of management in engineering is mind bogglingly poor. It hits a level of incompetence I haven't seen at any of my previous companies. I've seen individually bad managers who soured their piece of the company before, but this is systematic. The exceptions are two leaders (previous managers from Google) who do a good job - but they are not enough to turn the tide and keep the other managers inline. I wish we were measuring good v. great, but we're measuring incompetent v. good.

I agree with the other reviewers on discrimination and political infighting. That definitely happens, it's just a matter of how close you are to it within the company. My estimate is about a quarter of engineers are pretty close to it. Those are just the byproducts of the above stated problem. Other symptoms include teams out of sync, a low experiment/product success rate, unreliable data, unclear seniority levels, regular reorgs, people leaving without announcing or goodbye send offs, low psychological safety index, haphazard product innovation, and wild variations in resourcing compared to project size.

For an experienced engineer, I would personally recommend waiting for a VP of engineering to be hired before joining. They'll have a direct impact on solving/aggravating the above problem."

It makes it easy for new employees to quickly ramp up and for long-time employees to continue to grow. It makes me excited to come into work every day.

The company's values are in the right place. I truly believe that more diverse teams build better products, and Pinterest is making investments in recruiting and inclusion that will pay off for years to come.

The best part is that none of this comes at the expense of the awesome technology that we continue to pioneer at breathtaking pace. Our visual search team is way ahead of everyone else, and even Apple itself is envious of our work on AsyncDisplayKit.

As Pinterest grows and matures, working here will become more routine, and the people who made this company great will gradually depart to take on new adventures. But that hasn't happened yet.

- Strong growth in terms of both users and revenue
- Product that people love and their eyes light up when you tell them where you work
- Company is still small enough where it is easy for someone to come in and have a big impact
- Great work life balance
- Warm friendly culture","- Co-founders claim to not have an inner-circle, but both of them are introverts. I've never seen them go out of their way to talk to or get to know employees outside of their inner-circle. Even when the CEO used to move desks frequently and I sat next to him for a month, he never once spoke a word to anyone else working in the pod. And that is exactly how you end up with an inner circle...
- Product team has had a lot of failures (Placed Pins, Q&A, Conversations, Digest, Library, etc). Reason for these failures are because the product team promotes PMs that are good at talking a big game and telling leadership exactly what they want to hear. However, PMs that have a different approach or think differently from leadership, but are great at executing against goals and delivering successful features/projects, have left, been sidelined, or pushed out. Talk & ideas are cheap, product leadership should reward the PMs that can demonstrate they are consistently able to execute and deliver.

- Product Management does not have a clear vision on how to direct company goals resulting in never ending planning sessions with no clear execution record.

- Growth Management is incompetent.  No accountability after 7 months of mismanagement.

- Infrastructure reorganization and disposal of long time employees that have contributed significantly.  Mistrust through management favoritism.

- Bogus Chief titles and Head/Director titles.  Hypocritical about maintaining a flat culture.  Results don't matter, special relationships with leadership matter more.

- Nobody is technical at the top.  Company has outgrew them long ago.  Retained for unclear reasons.

- CEO haven't outgrew himself.  Multiple layers of Product Management leadership that are mandating product direction, it takes about 5 layers of humans before it gets to the staff that are executing.  Plus a CEO still micromanaging product directions through hunches."

Impact on Projects - As a product engineer, you're able to have a lot of say in how the product changes and grows. Each product team is made up of ~10 people and owns a large portion of the product. Engineers are heavily involved in prioritizing projects for the team, and are involved from the beginning with the design and implementation of projects. 

Growth - the company is growing really quickly. There are plenty of negatives to that, but overall it's a great sign for the outlook of the company. It also leads to more opportunities to rise quickly in the company and to be a leader.","The main cons are problems that are standard with a growing company. As the company grows, there is some churn with employees at all levels.

• Paying an ‘external diversity company’ with zero prior experience in recruiting or technology to educate company about ‘how to hire a diverse workforce’.

• Discarding innovations around how to actually push process & get things done because of leaders feeling threatened by more competent and seasoned IC employees.

• Focusing leadership energy on building up cases against those they should be guiding vs actually ‘leading’ them to evolve the product to the world [note: mostly white male managers of major teams including Eng, Design, Recruiting, HR, PM, PR]

395,Pinterest,highlight of my career so far with humble and brilliant colleagues who don't play politics,2015-12-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Typical employee is a rare combination of humble but brilliant. 
- Have highest confidence in leadership, and willingness to do bold things (on both product and things like diversity) make you proud to work there.
- Working on a huge problem (discovery) 
- Benefits of a startup (ownership, lack of red tape) but few of the downsides (stable funding, excellent comp/benefits).
- Compared to any of my past companies, including Google (where I worked for 6+ years) there is a refreshing lack of politics. A combination of a) plenty of work to go around, and b) an above-average maturity, means no one empire-building. Also, and I can't emphasize this enough, the culture of humility means people really shy away from kissing-up to management or shameless self-promotion. You're rewarded for being modest and heads-down in getting your work done. 
- The difference between working on a product that people love vs. one they need (Google, Uber, etc). When I've been asked where I work and say Pinterest, I've almost without exception received incredibly positive reactions. This seems like a vain motivating factor, but I think it's actually a decent litmus test for whether you're working on something worthwhile. We all spend too much time at work, so hopefully it's something that's creating real value in people's lives. With Google, people appreciated the utility and was amazed by the technology, but I seldom saw that expressed as love. Now I get lots of ""I LOVE Pinterest"" and some example of how it helped them with some aspiration: starting a project, organizing a trip on their bucket list, making a meal for family/friends or getting ideas for some major life moment (a growing family, getting married, turning a first house/apt into a cozy home, etc). It's hard to put a quantify the value of how that sort of regular positive feedback gives you a sense of working on something worthwhile.","- Employees are almost too nice, although after a year+ I haven't noticed it having a decidedly negative impact, leading to tolerance of low performers or lack of product execution"

You are recognized for working hard and making an impact. And the people you get to work with are smart and humble and genuinely want to be around each other all of the time. 

Of course Pinterest has its bumps. It wouldn’t be a startup if there weren’t any bumps. The management team works hard to keep Pinterest’s culture strong by eliminating toxic and unhealthy situations. As a result some of the teams as of late, are stronger than ever.

But they are often very out of touch with the data and technical issues to effectively deal with product problems.

Acquihires might be the only way Pinterest have been able to attract talent in recent quarters, but instead of scaling up productivity these players are brewing a very toxic and disruptive environment.  Plenty of management shuffle is also going on at the non-technical leadership level and the future is very uncertain now.  Given both the technical debt at the leadership level and the preference structure of product, design, engineering, Pinterest might not be a very good place for developing engineering careers.

Average engineer ability higher than other outlets in SF and valley
Still relatively small","Very young team
Somewhat inflexible organization"
405,Pinterest,Great people + product,2015-12-16,5.0,Senior Manager,"The people, product, and opportunity here are amazing. Despite what some former and disgruntled employees have to say, Pinterest is a low politics place if you're focused on continually improving the product and culture.  There are strong core values guiding the company and this is the most transparent company I've worked at in 15 years in the valley.","We're a a dynamic and fast growing company so there are bound to be bumps in the road.  If you're not comfortable with ambiguity or change, there are bigger companies you should consider."
406,Pinterest,Great place to work!,2015-12-14,5.0,Software Engineer,"Really interesting technical problems plus smart, fun, and nice coworkers building a product so many people love - what more could I ask for? Find out below:",Snacks could be #more #better.
407,Pinterest,Great Culture / tech and Inspiring vision,2015-12-13,4.0,Engineering,"- inspiring and visionary founding team and service
- compelling business model.
- deep technical cred bringing balance b/w tech, product and design
- collaborative, learning and tolerant culture
- work with some of the smartest and humble people around","- sometimes can be too nice of a place
- balancing between adolescence and grownup stage"
408,Pinterest,I'm obsessed with this company,2015-12-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pinterest is a company that truly cares about people - from our co founders all the way down to my direct manager. We operate with a sense of maturity that allows us to move fast and at the same time, focus on the details. Promotion and review cycles every 6 months are opportunities to grow and see your impact. We spend a lot of time knitting with our teams outside of the office and many of my co workers have become life long friends. We have a huge opportunity in the market place and I'm excited every day to come to work. It's been 2+ years for me here and I couldn't imagine being anywhere else.","All startups have growing pains and I've been other places where those challenges weren't worth sticking around. I think we could do a better job at rallying our company around the wins our individual teams see every day. We're pretty heads down and do a lot of good work, so spending more time sharing and celebrating those wins together. Also, this might be minor, but we've opened up a new space and it would be great if we could have the team all together in one building. Real estate in SF is tough, so having an urban campus is better than commuting to MTV."
409,Pinterest,Amazing place to work - friendly people and challenging work,2015-12-11,5.0,,"- Amazing work environment with spaces to work in the open with your team, quiet spaces to focus and informal areas to mix it up.  Inevitably, you run into others in these different spaces and conversations lead to creative problem solving sessions.
- Challenging work.  The company is growing fast and there's a ton to do.  If you want an opportunity to step right into a job that you'll have an immediate impact, this is the right place for you.
- People are smart and motivated without being jerks.  The team I work on genuinely care about each other, which makes it easier to have hard conversations because I can trust that there are no hidden agendas or bad intent.
- People that use Pinterest love it.  It's rare to work at a company that has a product that is so loved by the community of people that use it.  It makes it fun to talk about with family, friends and strangers.","- Leadership churn
- Multiple offices in San Francisco makes it hard to stay connected.  There are things like Slack and Google Hangouts, but nothing beats talking to someone in person, which is getting harder as the company grows."
410,Pinterest,Overall - a great place to work,2015-12-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Genuinely nice people.
Technical challenges that rival Google's with 1/100th of the engineers working on them.  
Great monetary trajectory.  
Maturity of eng organization.  
Lack of arrogance at all levels.",Lack of arrogance can also lead to lack of confidence and willingness to take risks.
411,Pinterest,Best job I've ever had.,2015-12-09,5.0,Partner Operations Specialist,"Everyone who works at Pinterest truly cares about the product and loves the company, especially management. Pinterest invests in employees long-term success as well as cultural development.",Growing fast so there are inevitably some growing pains.
412,Pinterest,Humble and motivated,2015-12-09,5.0,,"Very capable, motivated, and humble engineers, especially ICs. We've had our ups and downs but in general the bar has stayed high, and the quality of people brought onboard is terrific. Varies from team to team, but in my experience you can ship things as soon as they're ready, so long as you have a plan for an experiment (design changes are harder, though). I've found lots of opportunities to learn from co-workers and work across eng teams. Enthusiasm for open sourcing. Great new building. Engineering restructures in 2015 help organization move fast. Ben really cares about building a healthy culture, listening to employees, improving based on his feedback etc. Product has incredible potential, which in general keeps the company moving and inspired, and negates many of the concerns.","For better or for worse, company is product and design driven. As an engineer, you have to convince yourself that at its core, there is impressive technology built here powering the ship. Once you get down to the eng. manager and IC level, company is innovative from a technology standpoint. But don't expect all-hands to give in-depth kudos or highlights or even any particular acknowledgement of the engineering work done here. Focus is all on product, users, design. External engineering brand suffers, as a result."
413,Pinterest,Pinterest is great to work at,2015-12-09,5.0,Software Engineer,"Very humble and smart employees on all of the teams at Pinterest
Teams are super collaborative especially between eng, design, and design
Able to have a ton of impact on products and even prototype and ship your own ideas",Being split between multiple buildings has been a pain point for engineering and the company in general
414,Pinterest,Better than ever,2015-12-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great product. Our users love the product when they get it.
- Great company culture.
- Product/Design/Eng work closely to make things happen. It's not one single party's play, compare to Google/Apple.",- In the past we didn't do a great job to get rid of low performers. But we are fixing this and I am super happy to see the change.
415,Pinterest,"Great company, good people, opportunty for those willing to take it",2015-12-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's rare to get an opportunity to work on a project that will change the world and make people's everyday lives better. That also comes with pressure to execute and lots of opinions. If you're ready to work and collaborate there is a lot off opportunity to take the ball and run with it, to put your fingerprints on what will be global household name. The culture and community is generally one of caring and respect which also comes with the downside that confrontation can be difficult but we're learning how to deal with that without loosing our soul. This isn't easy work but it's satisfying.","There has been disorganization and unclear objectives in the past but leadership is striving to cleanup the focus and put the whole company on one singular mission, it won't be a quick fix but they've made it a clear priority. The 'urban campus' can be a bit exhausting when you have to ping pong between buildings. Pinterest is growing so quickly that it can take months to find out that someone actually owns part of the product you're working on or concerned with. The product review process can be inefficient and frustrating but overall it's a positive. Management can parachute in with high priority distractions but it's also your job to push back and they are willing to hear it."
416,Pinterest,"Great people, terrible management",2015-11-26,2.0,Software Engineer,"Coworkers are some of the greatest people I've known, both professionally and personally. I have learned so much from them. They are what made my time at Pinterest worthwhile.

The product is interesting and exciting.","Besides the CEO, laughably terrible management. Engineering leaders are incredibly weak in every aspect: technically, people management, product management, etc. The company is completely and utterly directionless. Not surprisingly the product quality is quickly declining."
417,Pinterest,Pinterest,2015-10-20,3.0,,Culture is awesome and people are very friendly.,Many growing pains . Lots of confusion about the direction of the product
418,Pinterest,Big impact. Rewarding work. Best company in SF.,2015-09-01,5.0,,"- Fast-paced environment with emphasis on getting things done
- Lots of opportunity for career advancement. Pinterest prioritizes employee development and there's fluidity throughout the org, so no one gets ""stuck"" in one role/team
- High impact across the board. Ratio of users to employees is awesome. My individual work influences millions of people everyday 
- Authentic, humble culture. People are incredibly nice and sincere","- Open office, so it's easy to get distracted with fun people and activities around all the time
- No hot breakfast"
419,Pinterest,Engineering culture sucks,2015-08-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The company tries to have fun events from time to time (such as a company-wide conference).,"There is not much flexibility in the work for engineers. Also, there is very little chance to work on something that is very impactful. Poor engineering quality compared to more engineering-driven companies such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter."
420,Pinterest,Opinions of pinterest from a former pinployee,2015-07-27,2.0,Software Engineer,"Amazing talent, fast pace, awesome CEO, great potential in the market, cool technology stack, fun environment, employees well cared for.","Bad upper management (but not the CEO, he's awesome), chronic disorganization, internal politics are completely opaque, very young workforce lacks some degree of insight."
421,Pinterest,"So far, I love it here.",2015-04-25,5.0,Somewhere In Engineering,"- Smart people
- Good work-life balance.
- Lots of interesting (both in a good way and a bad way) things to work on.
- Tremendous upside both intellectually and financially.
- The product is actually cool once you cast off the stereotype that it's just for middle-aged white women in Kansas.","- Food is average at best
- No gym
- Onboarding process for new engineers needs work, but it's getting better.
- Company plan for shedding the initial stereotypes is not clear.
- The office floor plan / open layout / lighting sucks.
- There are some stupid political undertones brewing in the engineering org.  I suppose that's inevitable, though, as the company grows."
422,Pinterest,What I came to the Bay looking for,2015-03-21,5.0,Software Engineer,"There is a truly unique atmosphere at Pinterest. With one of the cofounders being a designer, and the company heavily invested in engineering, it is equal parts creativity and data. As we scale out and grow internationally, the team is filling up with high-talent engineers from Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Google, etc. I came from none of the above.
    As an engineer, one of the cool new features of on-boarding is being able to choose what division of the company you want to work for (Platform, Growth, Monetization, etc). The company constantly seeks to foster creativity. For example, I thought of an idea of an automated tool that would save lots of time, so I spent the next week building out a prototype and then demoing it in front of the entire company at our Friday Q&A. Bring your ideas!
    But what I love the most, is the purposeful lack of holier-than-thou employees. The Bay Area is full of them, and we avoid them like the plague. At Pinterest you find unnaturally intelligent, yet humble and likable people trying to build a product to make people's lives better.
    Of course the pay is competitive, the equity is enticing, and the office is rad.",Sometimes the food isn't that great. Those days I just eat less and play more foosball (its competitive).
423,Pinterest,Hands down the best company I've ever worked for,2015-01-21,5.0,,"-I bring my authentic self to work and I genuinely love being there every day.
-My ideas are heard, big or small
-I'm making an impact in a way I was never able to at larger companies and with a company that I believe WILL BE massive.  I get to help it get there.  Insane.  Once in a lifetime.
-The people are warm, funny, humble and smart as hell
-I learn and grow and get better personally and professionally every day that I'm here.  I couldn't say that before I came to Pinterest.
-It's collaborative.  
-It's fun.  We laugh a lot while managing to get a ton accomplished. 
-Diversity is of huge importance and continues to be a top priority.","If I had to think of a con, I'd say that we aren't yet in a position to match on 401k but I expect that to change as the company grows and becomes profitable."
424,Pinterest,Best company I've ever worked for,2014-12-17,5.0,Software Engineer,"I've been working here for a year now, and a full-time female engineer, and I have so many positive things to say
- awesome working environment. everyone is really friendly, helpful, and intelligent yet humble
- intelligent engineering
- very unique data set: the interest graph of connections millions of users to billions of objects
- great opportunity for career growth
- use data to make decisions
- huge impact (engineering to user ratio)
- always innovating: when a process is slow/lacking, improvements are made in a timely manner
- great vision
- users love our product and so do I (honestly, that makes a huge difference!)
- transparent about upcoming features, company direction, etc.
- always analyzing, getting feedback and trying to improve
- dedicated staff to diversity and inclusion

I love coming into the office everyday and working on really interesting technical challenges.",Would love to see more female engineers join the company.
425,Pinterest,Disappointing (especially for women),2014-12-12,1.0,,"Nice office, fun team activities",Not a good place for women: only one woman on the leadership team and women struggle to be successful in many teams. engineers do not seem to care (or use) the product.
426,Pinterest,Best place so far,2014-12-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Unlimited PTO, friendly co-workers, opportunities to make a difference.","As with all tech companies I've worked for, sometimes you spin your wheels waiting for other teams."
427,Pinterest,Great place to work,2014-11-20,5.0,Software Engineer,"* Great work life balance, especially compared to other startups in the valley (looking at you Uber)
* Very high potential. Pinterest can monetize users extremely well since it knows their interests and can deliver targeted advertising. It also has strong user traction and is on track to surpass Twitter in terms of U.S. MAUs sometime in the next year. Based on that Pinterest could easily be at a 30B+ valuation in a couple years
* Not any politics. The culture is friendly and collaborative and there has not been any politics that I've seen
* Company puts a big emphasis on getting feedback from employees about what is working and what isn't & then acting on that feedback
* Leadership team is very transparent. There is a weekly Q&A with the CEO and bi-weekly lunches where the leadership team presents high level strategy.","* Company is spread across multiple buildings which makes it hard to meet people outside of your org (i.e. engineering, partners, etc)
* They have equity refreshes (which is awesome), but the difference between the refresh for top performers and average performers is negligible (which is bad if you're a top performer)"
428,Pinterest,Happy Employee,2014-11-15,5.0,Software Engineer,"We are at a stage in our company where we have a lot of interesting problems to tackle. We are small enough that our culture is still very start-up like, including the fact that we move really fast.

· Lots of new graduate hires to give you a fresh perspective and keep you grounded

- Plan for monetization looks solid.
- ""Rands"" seems like a solid hire to help solve the cultural problems.","- So many conflicting directions: Quarterly Goals, Various Company Wide Initiatives
- Certain teams are balancing both waterfall and agile methodologies
- Golden Handcuffs keep a lot of unhappy people working there.
- Lack of diversity on a lot of teams.  More female engineers than at a lot of other places, but not enough especially for our demographic.
- A lot of people in upper management positions have done things not in the interest of Pinners or Pinterest to be where they are.
- Authenticity is a core company value, but speaking your mind gets you on the ____lists.
- Not enough investment in Engineers"
434,Pinterest,5 stars to the product and the people working here. 3 starts to the board. Overall 4 stars,2014-06-04,4.0,,Pinterest is a great product. I believe it will change people's life. That's why I am still working here.,The board kept raising fund for too many times. Many employees are frustrated because their shares were diluted severely in the last few rounds of fundraising. The cost to exercise options got higher too.............
435,Pinterest,Best company I've worked for,2014-06-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people here are smart, passionate, and nice.  The culture is collaborative and there are tons of possibilities for impact, learning, and growth.  The leadership team recognizes the value of a strong culture and have significantly invested in our people, particularly compared to other companies at our stage.","Sometimes we could move faster than we do.  Given the collaborative culture, there's a balance to strike between discussion and debate and decision and action.  We can improve in this area, though I think that progress is already underway."

- Amazing culture
- CEO is already outstanding and getting better.
- Huge upside for both your career and financial situation

Knowing people at other companies at a similar stage (Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Square...), there is no better place to work than Pinterest.","It's a startup, so things change quickly. Don't be surprised if the thing you're working on today isn't what you're working on tomorrow.  The company doesn't deal with low performers quickly enough and coddles creative types too much."
437,Pinterest,"Great product, smart engineers, but lots of politics in engineering",2014-05-16,3.0,Software Engineer,Most of engineers are smart and great. They are willing to work on exciting things without thinking about promotion. And product is fun to work on.,"Too much politics in engineering part. A small amount of engineers (some managers as well) are not putting pinners first. Instead of contributing code, they are playing politics and delivering very negative culture here. Engineers who want to work on impactful things are very hard to get chance to if projects are against the interests of these people."
438,Pinterest,Best engineering company I've worked for,2014-05-16,5.0,Software Engineer,"There's been a lot of external talk about Pinterest not being engineering driven. That's completely false. The caliber of engineering talent that i've seen here is just beyond amazing. This shines in many ways, and I think unfortunately we've been so buttoned down building an amazing product, that we haven't had the time to go externally promote ourselves. Then again, I would describe the eng org, the way I would describe Ben - low-key, shy, but brilliant. As an engineer that has done pretty much everything from startups to big companies, I can say that there is no place else I'd rather work.","It's a startup. We work hard and often have to figure what works best. It sometimes takes a few rounds, but when we do it feels like its essential and natural extension of the culture."
439,Pinterest,Build the next big tech company and improve people's lives,2014-05-14,5.0,Product Manager,"Pinterest may be the most misunderstood tech company of all time. If you think it's just about weddings and cupcakes, take another look. Pinterest is about discovery and we are building the ultimate recommendation engine. Pinterest is to interests as Facebook is to friends, and there's just a ton of opportunity to connect people to the things they love.  Just imagine being one of the first few hundred employees of Facebook or Google - this place is a rocketship and with this comes all kinds of exciting projects (if you're bored, you're doing it wrong).

As a company, we often say our biggest problem is that we're too nice. The collaboration is incredible - everyone makes time for everyone else, no matter the job title. The culture of creativity is totally contagious. And what's awesome is we're still such a young company that we get to set the culture we want, whether creating a new initiative or club, or even adding a new type of space to the office. The San Francisco office is a great place to work, and the benefits (lunch & dinner, Caltrain pass, etc) are great.

At the same time, Pinterest isn't for everyone. If you want to work on big problems, if you want to build something meaningful that's used by everyone in the world, if you like working with creative and inspiring people - Pinterest is the place for you. If you're motivated by money, if you want things to be handed to you on a silver platter, if you don't like ambiguity, or if you want a fancy job title and meaningless promotions every year, PLEASE do not apply.

There is also our leaders, Ben and Evan. Hear them talk and you will be totally inspired - they are usually the ones that make people realize this opportunity to work on something much bigger than yourself. They also love candid feedback and are totally accessible .",Typical for a company growing so quickly: Lots of ambiguity. Still figuring out management and how to work across teams the most effectively. Don't always move as quickly as we want.
