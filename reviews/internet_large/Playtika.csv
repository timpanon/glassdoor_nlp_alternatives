8,Playtika,Stay Away,2022-03-29,1.0,Product Manager,- Nice offices and perks,"- Highly political environment, backstabbing micro managing VPs and senior executives

- Forget about promotions if you were hired after 2015, Playtika takes care of the senior execs who were with them since the early 2010s only.

- 7 Product Managers for one game? PMs don't have product autonomy, they are slaves who simply carry out tasks and do what they're told by Sales & Marketing and VPs. No room to innovate and lead products end to end

- Toxic meetings, lack of communication, terrible working hours.

- Low pay compared to industry"

Really good pay (by local standards, they are out-staffing and hiring Eastern Euro developers for obvious reasons, but still).

Some really tech-savvy senior staff, lots of knowledgeable people to get best-practices and stuff like that from.","They love to give you a tonne of overtimes, which admittedly are compensated with an extra few days of vacation, and as you sit working night shift in the office you will also get a good free dinner there, but in my opinion having a normal life is more important. All of this due to a rat-race to outperform their competitors in terms of in-game features, mini-games, etc.

The product is highly addictive brain-dead social ""casino"" game (it is not an online casino where you can win money, it's a cow-clicker designed to siphon money out of not so smart people, who are willing to pay real money to spin (literally) some slot machine of their computer screen).

They will fire you if they don't see any extra enthusiasm on meetings, ""not a team player"", even if your job performance is actually good"

81,Playtika,Stressful yet full of learning working environment,2021-11-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great perks and benefits, especially the health insurance and yearly well-being benefits. 
The working environment encourages a lot of learning from one employee to another and since the organization is divided into game studios, it feels like a startup environment rather than a big company which I really appreciated. 
Great products and ideas are born inside each studio and it’s something the company can really be proud of and brag about.","Very hierarchical (IDF style), management is super into themselves and not paying enough attention to their employees’ needs. Lots of politics in different management levels rather than pure professionalism.
Game studios are constantly fighting to exceed expectations which are quite often too ambitious and putting lots of pressure on the game owners which then translates to daily and even hourly stress and pressure on their directors that expect performance to be enhanced on an hourly basis - many times this leads to A/B testings that are interrupted before completion and constant changes to monetization calendar and live-ops that don’t allow to fully learn and get conclusions and insights - what’s functioning well and what’s not? 
Many times there was a feeling of implementing changes just for the sake of doing something when the business results are below expectations, just to show the management tried it all, rather than actually doing so from a learning perspective. The results proved this doesn’t work most of the times and in retrospect the management keep saying “hey, but at least we tried”.
Each business unit (game studio) feels much isolated and not connected to other business units. Most people in the company don’t know other employees from other studios. 
Since before Covid there are no weekly Happy Hours and the company recently tries to compensate for that with live concerts by famous Israeli musicians, which is nice on the one hand but also should not be taken naively as it’s mainly done to attract more interest in the company from outside."

- there is a constant pressure which basically translates in a very stressful environment
- the idea of work-life balance exists just in theory; For Developers in Playtika, it's just a myth
- you are on-call 24 hours out of 7 days, and you are NOT paid for this. On-call is not scheduled like in any other company; You are only paid for the time of interventions during on-call; Managers decide how much time you've spent fixing an issue - which is not always similar to reality. And yes, you may be called at 4AM.
- some of the peers in higher positions don't deserve their roles because they lack professionalism 
- you are encouraged to not express your opinions and believes if they are not aligned with the company's vision; They will threat you; Some people were fired over night; Lying is strongly encouraged
- most of the development work is distributed like this: 70% yaml/xml/json configuration writing, 10% writing code, 20% devops/deployments
- because of the configuration work, the job itself is repetitive, leaving no evolution options
- salaries are not distributed similarly for people with same responsibilities on the same positions; there are differences from 30% to 70%
- even during pandemic times, they constantly explore legal possibilities to request people to the offices
- total lack of transparency from the HR and management, towards the employees and the people who take part at interviews."

If you come with examples of companies that allow their employees to work from home the whole year they'll give you examples of companies that demand the employees to come to the office (Totally plausible but not in this industry, the people giving those answers are out of this sphere so it's no shame they don't understand the privilege developers have in those unfortunate times and that there are always greener fields on the other side of the fence)

- Social events
- Insurance, RRSPs
- There used to be lots of amazing people working there, not many remain
- Learned a great deal on various software and technologies","- Management wants to make sure to keep an eye on you, what you access, how much time you actually spend on working, so they've implemented lots of security on their network inside the office, on their laptops that you use for work, and certain software accesses, which actually just end up causing major issues with your workflow and slow you down.

- If you dare disagreeing with HQ (in Israel) or people from their office who work in MTL regarding their infrastructure and their management, even if you have valid points and concerns, you will likely get fired or receive warnings from HR. It has happened repeatedly over the past year. Anything that you mention will be brushed off otherwise, unless it matches their agenda.

- Playtika loves to pretend that they're the best company to work at, punctuated by pretty mottos and extravagant trips for PR purposes, but it's all a lot of fluff. Don't be fooled. Management from HQ absolutely does NOT care about you and has no empathy for their employees in this office.

- Many of the great workers who made the office amazing either were fired (30 or so of them at the beginning of 2020, before COVID19) or left during the past couple years, which coincidences with HQ tightening their grip on the studio.

- In relation to some points above, they highly discourage work from home, even in this era of COVID19, where many companies are considering to simply make the switch to work from home full-time. Why do you think? Because they cannot keep an eye on you as easily, you're using your own home network, they cannot see you physically, and it does not create nearly as good PR as having a bunch of people smiling for pictures in the office when food arrives."

Japan office does a localized version of the game, but there is no knowledge sharing or interaction from the head office (we are left to run blind). 

The entire operation is completely revenue focused. There is no focus on the end user or the game experience. The company only cares about revenue and the number of users.

Philosophy is work hard, play hard and it's a pleasure everyday going to work!",I will update this advice as soon as I get one. For now I am searching really hard but surrounded by great people doing a fantastic job is not easy to find something bad...

Very closed minded and rigid leadership at corporate.  Studios outside of corporate tend to not be kept in the loop or included in decisions.  Culture is driven by corporate, but they don't understand different cultures."
316,Playtika,Was a great place to work.,2016-07-08,5.0,,"Stable, and the culture was the best of any place I have ever worked. Great people and a really fun atmosphere and getting to work on a game that is very successful.",-not much development of new games or new ideas

319,Playtika,Comfortable but complacent,2016-05-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people are pretty interesting and mostly fun to be around. The company has plenty of resources to make things happen if they really need to. Because of that, there's basically no ""crunch time"" situations where you have to work insane hours.","There's nothing exciting or engaging about the job itself, so you better find the actual work enthralling or this job will become a 9-5 caricature very quickly. Technical decisions are made with very little forethought, often because of business objectives. Never enough time to complete business objectives, and the office politics are a bit much."

325,Playtika,"Fantastic Colleagues, Fun Tasks, Amazing Environment",2015-09-30,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Every person on staff is brilliant, easy to talk to, and encouraging! You'll really love coming into work and will leave the day knowing you accomplished something good. In my history of employment, I have never worked in a place where I loved working with every person till Playtika Santa Monica. The middle management folks are sincerely supportive of their staff and do their best to help you reach your career goals. The company fosters a true work life balance and assists everyone in living a healthy lifestyle. With that said, not all the snacks are super healthy but there certainly are great options for the health conscious. You will not regret working here and will only ask yourself, why didn't I get my foot in the door here earlier?","Not really many or anything serious. The open floor isn't for everyone and it can at times be difficult to really focus. The sprints are somewhat aggressive, so it can be intimidating for those that can't handle a little pressure. Playtika has an abundance of happy people, along with a good number of intensely nice and ecstatic people, thus, it might not be a good fit for the melancholy. Middle management is also very good, which can be a negative because you don't want them to leave, but that means there really isn't a way to go up the ladder."
326,Playtika,Great place to work!,2015-09-16,5.0,Senior Producer,Playtika has been an amazing place to grow and excel. Your ideas are always valued and respectively considered.,"We have an extremely successful product with a very dedicated user group. With new features, we always have to be weary of alienating this group."
327,Playtika,Good place to work,2015-09-16,4.0,Software Engineer,"Relatively small dev teams, so everyone plays an important role.  The heads of the engineering teams are world class.  Playtika's greatest strength is its office culture.  The people here are great and a large reason I've remained at the company. Nice perks- free lunch 2x a week and free massages.  Santa Monica is an unbeatable location.",Communication between dev & product teams needs improvement.  Data driven to a fault:  glaring customer service/experience issues can get put on the back log if they don't noticeably effect the bottom line.  It seems unlikely the studio will ever get to make a new game.
328,Playtika,Happy Hour Galore,2015-09-15,4.0,Marketing,"Smart team, a week off for Christmas, fully stocked kitchen, free lunches, and great happy hours!","Hours can be long, but time off is really flexible."

332,Playtika,Receptionist,2015-04-26,5.0,Front Desk Receptionist,"I think the best way to describe Playtika, is to call it family.
Everyone is so friendly and caring, it feels like home.
I literally come to work with a smile each and every day.
Playtika has a young & cool vibe, that expresses in every aspect of the company,
from the design of the offices, through ALL its employees, to the awesome company events.
I don't find it necessary to say much, come and see for yourselves.",might be weird but  I can't find any.

334,Playtika,Fast growing company with good culture!,2015-04-20,5.0,,"Talented people around you, responsive management, friendly atmosphere.
Ability to develop professional and personal skills.
Nice office with relax room, comfortable work conditions, corporate parties are awesome, happy hours, good compensation + benefits.",Can't think of any cons.
335,Playtika,Great company to work for!!,2015-04-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Amazing and talented people to work with, great atmosphere. 
I have worked for a lot of other Hi tech companies in the past, but never got such great benefits such as bonuses, company events, gift cards etc. 
Fun vibe, dynamic and enriching",Since this is an online company we always need to be conacted which means working over time or working from home at some level
336,Playtika,Best job I have ever had.,2015-04-07,5.0,,"Playtika SM has an amazing, one of a kind culture. Great benefits include weekly massages, biweekly lunches, random ice cream socials, happy hours, and kick-butt holiday parties. Awesome open floor seating plan and a cool office space. Job security is nice too.",I can't think of any cons.
337,Playtika,Great company to work at!,2015-04-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Top notch people, highly professional with great minds, dynamic and young company, everyone can bring their opinion, great welfare, they know how to throw amazing events!","The pace is very rapid and intensive and things are going really fast, which is not a bad thing but it's not suitable for everyone.."
338,Playtika,Sharp People & Great Culture,2015-03-03,5.0,Software Engineer,"The people at Playtika are, in my consideration, one of the company's biggest assets. Almost everybody hired in the Santa Monica office is extremely capable. Everybody is task-oriented and brings no egos to the table. The culture in the office is really great too - happy hours, twice-a-week catering, and a general stream of work-appropriate silliness abounds.

The products themselves are pretty successful too, which helps in terms of job security and company stability. There are usually interesting things to work on, with very few menial tasks. Management seems to have their heads on straight in making good long-term decisions for the company.","Overtime creeps in more often than I think many here would like. While there isn't a culture of overtime, it's used too frequently when plans are made for the future. Communication breaks down from time to time as well, causing occasional confusion and conflicting requirements. Finally, some of the company's efforts to be flexible in planning gets frustrating as there are too many last-minute changes for my taste."
339,Playtika,Ineffective company with one quite profitable product,2015-02-24,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Salary (and of course bonuses),
Interesting and complex development tasks","Incompetent/lazy non-specialist stuff (IL side),
Non-technical stuff is really quite far from IT (products, marketing, all those VPs of whatever),
Quite ineffective process (critical emails can be answered for months, or not answered at all even with regural pinging),"
