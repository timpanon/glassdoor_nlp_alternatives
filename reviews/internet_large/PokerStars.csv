162,PokerStars,Rules of the company are against you,2020-06-12,2.0,Customer Service Representative,"-3 euros per day for for lunch
-yearly bonus
-competitions and lotteries where you can win money ( up to 1000 euros). Weekly poker tournaments in the office where you can win 50 euros for 1st place and so on. This is by far the biggest plus of the company, not only you can have fun, but you can also earn some cash.
-snacks in the kitchen","Biggest one - MICROMANAGEMENT. You have 4 targets, and when you cannot achieve one of them -you get penalized immediately and it significantly reduced your bonus. All of these targets are not made to improve your performance, yet they are instruments to pay as less bonus as possible and to micromanage you. For example:
- Csats. If a publisher asks for a casino bonus and you deny him (because he is not eligible) and he gives you a Dsat (obviously) - you cannot appeal it. You get few of these- you lose your bonus and your manager has an intercourse with your brain. No one uses surveys as a method to actually improve agents performance, it is purely a tool to reduce your bonus 
- AHT. Do you want to have 2( or even 3) livechats opened with completely different questions(it can be payments and poker specific question, good luck not being confused) + you have to do emails at the same time and like this during all 10 hours of your night shift and you are expected to solve this chat issue within 1 minute? You got it. And if you fail? Welcome to the lovely conversation with you r manager and... .it will also affect your bonus 
- Work time. This one has the best system. If you took even 1 minute more break than you are allowed (system doesn't count your break time, you need to set an timer on your mobile to count how much time you have), you whole days parameter is negative. If you decide on next day to work without breaks to compensate that fail - you can't, because it counts each day individually. If you fail this target 2 days of the whole month - guess what, you have a 1on1 wjth your manager AND it affects your bonus (of course). Zero tolerance on that one too. 

In the end you realise real fast that no one in the history of the company has achieved a maximum bonus due to these issues, so expect to get a minimum, maximum a mid bonus.

VALUES. There is a fanatical approach to core values of the company. You cannot FORCE someone to be helpful to other colleagues, or to bring a new idea - it comes naturally. Yet manager will ask on every monthly 1 on 1 what have you done to improve your values. Because of that such a good beginning became yet another instrument of pressure"

Knowing your work is being used and enjoyed by hundreds of thousand of people is rewarding. Benefits are decent.","In many roles, there are few opportunities for advancement. They talk about training, but the budget is never there. If you want to take courses to improve your professional skills you will end up paying for them yourself.

Many managers do not come from software development, and they don't know what they don't know. They have been unable to put together processes that work, or hire for specific development management roles that are badly needed, so it can be a chaotic workplace. 

They still compensate people like it is 2010. 

The catered lunch was a huge benefit, but that is gone now. 

The Richmond Hill location is car dependent. The office is too small for the number of people working there, people are crowded together. 

It seems that the company changes hands every year, so there is a feeling of instability. New executives sweep in with grandiose plans, disrupt everything, then they are gone, but the disruption is there to stay."

316,PokerStars,"""StarsGroup"" A household name in Europe, propitious work location in the making (in India).",2018-07-31,3.0,Security Services Verification's Specialist,"""Great organisation that houses people with kaleidoscopic talents, who are all very approachable and cordial."" 

- The workplace provides tremendous opportunities to grow both, personally and professionally and has infinite potential of being ""The best"" e-Gaming company to work at. 

- In comparison to other locations, the Indian Office (where i have had an opportunity to work at) has opened up quite recently and is under a sedative progressing curve.

**As William Raduchel said : ""Don't pick a job, Pick a Boss.""

- Line Manager Mr. Emmanuel Jakkula is undeniably one of the most fun people to work, and have a conversation with. He is encouraging, erudite and edifying. He extends numerous opportunities for his team to grow and always fortifies confidence, plus skills at work. 

(If you are in a dilemma whether to work at Stars Group or not )

I would just re-quote Mr. William Raduchel: 
""Don't pick the job. Pick a Boss."" *Endow yourself an opportunity to work with Mr. Emmanuel and Co.*

Besides Emmanuel, there are many more fun people to work with at Stars Group, India. 

- The Stars Group employees are in true meaning, worthy of being called the ""Stars."" Though based in various locations and working from different time zones, everyone i have met  or spoken to (approx 500+ people, in my one year tenure) have a unique character and amiable attitude.","- There is no Reward and Recognition program as of now, except just an yearly bonus / compensation. Which is not something good enough to retain the best talent. (Especially for those employees who like a pat on their back, when they achieve something good at work.)

- You are going to find your basic requests taking unbearable amounts of time for approvals. (Some times also leave approvals)

- Though the best people at work are questioned for their silliest of mistakes.  (Which is good in a way)

- The depressing part is: People frequently committing blunders haven't improvised their work in a long long time. 

 **Right after few months in my tenure, I had witnessed a few people committing serious errors and till my last day (Almost a year) at work,  the same people still continued pulling off their Blunders at work. 

Thought the Management is quite aware of it, themselves (In my perspective) they have probably never addressed the personnel seriously about the flaws which is why they still continue to commit blunders even after a year.

This particularly brings down the motivation of others, who toil day_in-day_out to improvise their work and achieve results for the team.

- Though most of the staff is quite friendly, a few are inconsiderate enough to deny you on your face for any sort of help.

(This again is not hidden, yet the management has failed to  annihilate such attitude from the staff. Which has promptly, portrayed the image of these people being, Management's Favorites which frustrates the rest because these are the same personnel who also commit errors. ) And it only makes sense for such people still being on board, that either they are really Management's favorites or the Management doesn't care about the rest having a hard time because of few."

lack of communication, management simply does not care, people are demotivated,  decisions are made without any explanation, some departments do not have any targets, goals (sic!), in order to get promotion you have to know people your experience or skills are not important. 
But the most terrible is that no one cares, do what I will tell you or leave.... 
You can see that the mentality of 'village people', there is no spirit, there are no opportunities to progress and you are unable to plan anything....in fact they had a problem to plan marketing plans and budget for 2017 being already in 2017. it's ridiculous but even start up they have better structure  and it is better organised.

There is a real buzz around them which is infectious and it really drives the company.

The benefits are decent although no longer the best in the industry. These could probably do with a refresh although still better than a lot of places on the Isle of Man.

Subsidised lunch and free fruit and snacks.

Summer and Christmas parties.

The various celebrations throughout the year.","Being such a dynamic company, you would think that we would have cutting edge technology although this is not the case. There are processes and procedures in place that mean it is actually very difficult to implement new systems. There is, of course,  a risk with new technology although being market leaders and trying to attract the best candidates is difficult and poses a greater risk, in my opinion. We need to demonstrate that we are global leaders and there are pockets within the business that are still very archaic in their approach to new technology.

There seems to be a real difference in how Ops operates versus the rest of the business. Obviously this is due to the nature of customer support and the need for shift work, although more could perhaps be done to align the flexibility that is afforded to the rest of the business. 

Free food - this is both a pro and a con. Sometimes you just don't have the willpower and reach for the endless supply of chocolate and cans of pop. There seems to be no plans to change this although a basic read over stress, willpower and decisions shows that it's a bad mix to throw in unhealthy, sugar-loaded drinks and snacks.

Very competitive salary and benefits (likely to change soon as the company is cutting costs everywhere after becoming public).

Multicultural environment, many bright, interesting and fun people 

Working hours/location can be flexible depending on position (i.e. working from home, no set start time)

Staff are given opportunities to openly provide feedback (but it does not necessarily gets noticed)","Once a blue-chip, people-focused company became cutting costs-focused.

A public company purchased from the previous owners for a large sum of borrowed money, that now it needs to pay back. This is proving difficult if even possible at all, so things are looking a bit gloomy at the moment.

Talented people and company veterans are leaving or being made redundant.

Very limited career progression for most employees despite management's claims.

Staff relationships can be toxic; morale has worsened over the years, same with work quality and professionalism 

Work schedule in Operations department (the biggest in the company) is not designed for the convenience of employees and can be very hectic. Requirements and processes are becoming more ""robotic""."

In addition, management is swamped with numbers and reports and have very little time left to actually 'manage' their agents. This used to be very different in the past, as managers kept a very good relationship with agents and were widely available.

Training is another great issue and has been neglected very much over the last few years. What's missing is some 'hands on' training session and engaged trainers. 

I see this place mostly as a starting point. Most hard working people are then moving on to workplaces that have a more relaxed and open minded work strategy. Dublin is still a hot spot for many online companies. Unfortunately I would no longer recommend working here."

478,PokerStars,Treats employees like a commodity,2015-02-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"While I give Amaya one star it is not all bad, I enjoyed most of my time there and the work environment is reasonably good. I also met a lot of people I respect and who I enjoyed spending time with. If you are the kind of person who likes to get stuff done people will generally stay out of your way and let you do it. Can be good for acquiring new skills and personal growth.","By far my biggest issue with Amaya is that they do no appreciate their employees. I've seen the token emails from upper management and speeches at meetings claiming otherwise but all other evidence paints a different picture. One thing that stuck out to me is that they often complain about how much salaries cost when they do not pay that well. The way it was worded it seemed like they thought of employees were nuisances that were tolerated rather than valued parts of the company. 

The standard way they deal with what they view as cost heavy offices is to lay people off. I have witnessed many layoffs in multiple offices. In each case it was reasonable that some needed to happen but Amaya jumps to layoffs far too quickly and easily. In between mass layoff a number of individual removals happened as well. Even in offices that were profitable and short staffed. 

One of the ways they go about layoffs is to pick some role or business area and decide that it is no longer necessary. So they fire people of type x regardless of how valuable they are or the damage it does to an office or business area of the company. Then a few months or even weeks later they realize that they actually need those people, beg one or more to come back and start hiring for those roles again. The people let go were generally hardworking skilled employees, this was not a performance issue. This has happened several times. In one case they let go of everyone who knew how to maintain a critical system then had to beg to get the weakest member of that team to come back. The better people were not interested.  Amaya was not short of money at the time and as far as I understand they never have been.

To me that says loud and clear ""We don't care about employees"", and shows a poor understanding of how to run a company. 

As a result most of the really good people have left and a significant number of people who remain are toxic or borderline toxic or are buddies with someone higher up or both. There are still some great people but the number of people who were unpleasant to deal with, or be around, and who do well in the company because they know how to play politics or have a buddy network was a big issue for me. 

Another area of problems is anything to do with creating or running software systems. None of the systems Amaya are currently using were built by the original team of founders and early hires. They were all bought through acquisitions. This has caused a disconnect where upper management does not understand how build and maintain the scale of software systems they own. The company's original sms lotto platform was a simple and small project compared to what they have acquired. Because of their success with that small system and the short time the original team spent in the product development phase the executives seem to have grown an ingrained lack of understanding of serious software development. They assume everything should be as easy and smooth as that first small project.

Because the executives do not understand software development but run a software product company they hire and appoint proxies to manage the software teams for them. How can a person without skill in software know how to recognize that skill in someone else? They cannot. Creating software is a hugely complex endeavor and it takes real knowledge and skill to tell the difference between someone who puts on a good show and someone who actually knows what they are doing. Because of this middle and lower management is fairly weak, and there are a significant number of people in positions of power that are there almost entirely because they know how to put on a show and play politics, and do not have the management skills, people skills, or software skills to excel. The worst managers I have worked with in my career are currently at Amaya. 

Finishing up pay is below average for the caliber of people, staff are expected to go the extra mile but not given much in return, there are no bonuses, taking time off is frowned upon, and work life balance is not great."

480,PokerStars,"Generous, caring and challenging",2015-01-07,5.0,General & Administration,"If you love poker there's no better place to be. The company is the clear market leader for good reason; it is obsessive about creating the best possible player experience and customer service, which is a source of great pride among the workforce. The company cares equally for its staff and is genuinely interested in constantly improving the workplace experience. The open door policy is less of a policy and more of an ethos; there's no-one you cannot reach out to and speak to with freedom and honesty. The pay and benefits are very generous.",It feels a little backward in terms of organizational development and best practice. The company is having to grow up very fast to keep up with it's exponential growth and feels quite slow (some may say completely resistant) to adapt to changing work practices and technology. Much of the technology we need to rely on to work efficiently and effectively is homemade and way past it's shelf-life.

Management is almost entirely focused on the business side, they only care about what is happening in operations when it gets in the way of some business plan. Lay people off frequently. Who gets ahead is mostly about politics and putting on a show for senior management, regardless of what is actually happening.

Upper management does not respect or value employees, they treat them like replaceable cogs, pay is not great, there are some really poor managers especially the higher up they are. Communication and direction in the company is severely lacking or if it does exist is not genuine. 

It is an unstable company both from a keeping your job point of view and what you will be working on next, project changes priorities etc. The work environment was good for a while but has gone down hill and does not look likely to improve. HR is ineffective and petty. Your value to the company depends mostly on who you are buddies with.

This is a software company but the senior management do not understand software, software developers or technology in general."
