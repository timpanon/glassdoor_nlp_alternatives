5. employees who actually work on fields give services and support to the clients getting salary much much lesser than they deserve and people who are sitting in AC's are get paid for doing nothing just deciding some stupid policies

6. Higher management need to ask middle management people take them in consideration before applying and implementing some stupid policies just because you are from some well known foriegn college's that doesn't means you know everything.

7. Just look at the retention rate and understand why customers are not happy.

Immature leadership - Most leaders in this company are also early employees and they are close friends of founders. Some of them are really insecure and follow whatever CEO says. CEO himself is a bit clueless and does not know what he really wants. He changes his direction every quarter and hence entire company moves from chasing one goal to another without completing any of them

630,Practo Technologies,Bad work culture,2016-07-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Salary is very reasonable for Bangalore. It can be better if HR can give us sodexos and make salary structure more tax efficient,"Worst work culture. Practo is a dead place, nobody ever smiles and company treats you like slave labour. It is very common to be asked to work on holidays. Though you will still not get your due hikes or promotions unless you are close to founders or early employees.

One seemingly good thing about this company is that one founder does a regular company wide question and answer session. However they have managed to make a complete joke of that as well. He is afraid to take direct questions and hence moderates them through slido. That approach is already a joke and they make it worse by deleting any tough question what so ever. Also once they delete it, a witch hunt starts to find and confront the person who actually asked that question publicly.

In general this company is not doing well and has no real strategic direction. Practo is not safe on their core products and are facing competition there but instead of getting those right first, management is asking us to build more and more new products. Recently a very good product was shut down without any notice to that team and I do not know if same can happen to project I am currently working on. Nobody knows including my manager."

Some managers are really bad who are not of the age group and don't match the frequency of the team mates.
Lots of immediate firing is happening too without any notice or hint that someone is performing bad. Firing is going to happen each quarter.
They form new teams to make new products which are totally useless instead of improving the existing code base and products.
They say that work hours are flexible and good but when you leave after 8 hours, they will comment that you go early without completing and will take it out during reviews directly.
Mangers and Team leads never tell you directly about your performance, they will spill it out always in the review no matter how much effort you put in.

No proper amenities provided. 
Cafeteria food is really bad. Nothing is available nearby.
New office is like a call center. Everyone sits together.

Practo is a health app, but the company itself doesn't provide any health facilities in the office.
Even the sick bay or the sleeping cells are locked. No doctor or medi kit. Least interested about the employees health."

Some managers just have 3-4 years of experience and they have been given senior positions because they suck up to founders. They frankly are very bad managers but that does not matter to leadership.

That is a great opportunity for startups.,"Biggest fault of this company is that only one person controls everything and company change its directions every three months. I have spent about an year here and have already seen 5 major strategic changes in direction till now. I am not confident that current path we are on will not be changed soon. Founders have literally no clue and move from one place to another with no focus.

You can not take old leadership on face value here. Their favorite method of salary negotiation is agreeing and then refusing to honor their commitments. This has happened with variable salaries as well as ESOPs where people have been asked to take 50-60% cuts from promised quantities, take it or leave it scenario.

Culture is really bad, founder wants people to work 24 by 7 but does not care about culture. He shouts on people and people reporting to him shout on their reportees. You see fights happening every single day with so much tension and stress in air.

Lots of ego. All old guys except second founder have lots of ego. Main founder needs to have the last word every single time and will shout at you and attack you personally if need be. Logic does not matter, what matters is whether he wins the argument or not.

Last word, do not join this company, you will regret it."

There are a lot of companies in this sector but none who can match the scale. Some competitors got big funding recently though.,"This company is top down unethical. Promises mean nothing and are regularly broken, people are randomly hired and fired, it is very common to have stock options halved or reduced or not given at all. Most common excuse is that founder does not want you to get stocks on current valuation but on a future round of valuation. They conveniently skip this part during salary discussions where all queries on esop policies are met with same response, trust us to do the right thing. Many friends of mine trusted and now regret.

This company has no strategic thinking, this is ironic as the very first thing you will hear once you join practo is how ceo is a big thinker. Nobody will tell you that he is also a petulant child who has two faces - one face when he needs you and other face is his real face. He routinely gets upset if he is pushed back even a little bit on his frequent changes and it is very common to see him shouting on some or the other poor soul in his glass cabin.

This company works on his whims and if you do not fall in line you will be shouted down till you give up. People who have survived have either actually become part of this cult or are pretending to do so

This company has zero respect for work life balance. In other technology companies you are expected to be in office on holidays and late nights if you are needed but here you are also needed in office on holidays just for show so that founders can feel secure about how they are running the company

Work culture is very bad. Instead of looking at reasons why people do not feel motivated the method is to publicly humiliate them till they give up. Practo also does not know what it really wants to do and main founder keeps on changing tactics every few weeks. Reason behind most of these changes is almost always ceo said so and by the time we execute that change strategy changes again with exact same reason - ceo said so"

PR management is good","Bad HR: they are worst part of this company. how bad, post reading this, you can imagine what would worse than below look like

No perks/no work life balance: Free fruits and chips were removed as part of cost cutting. Cafetaria is bad and does not work on saturdays or sundays. ACs are switched off on saturday and sunday and after 9 pm but if you are not in office on saturdays and sundays you get shouted at

Bad culture: Practo had great culture 3 years back, it was like a college. That culture has been lost. People shout on each other frequently and most of my team works not because they love what they are doing but because they are under artifical pressure to stay busy

Frequent changes in vision: Founder changes his direction every 2-3 months. He has no conviction in directions he is providing to 2000+ people and is out of his depth when it comes to running a company of this size

Frequent insults: CEO frequently insults entire groups of teams publicly for doing exactly what he asked them to do 2 months back. His vision is to do everything in healthcare and hence every two months there is new thing to do or new direction to take for an existing product. Of course practo has not done anything well

Frequent firings and changes: Because there is no stable plan and there are frequent changes of vision, frequent firings and changes are very common

Mute leadership: Nobody is able to push back regardless of how correct they are or how wrong CEO is. CEO has to win the argument at any cost.

Employee firings have become everyday news. At the same time, there keep hiring freshers for bigger packages. I know people who are not under performers but were fired. 

Decisions are one sided, too few people have too much authority in things. Many inexperienced people are in very higher positions, not that it is uncommon in startups. There are quite some hot headed early employees with a couple of years of experience who are senior developers or team leads.

Work has become monotonous a long time back. There are some new projects most of which go no where. If you become well acquainted with some code base, chances are that you always stay in the same team. I don't think there's much scope to grow your technical expertise in this company.

3) employees are frustrated, they abuse and humiliate everyone, just so that talent leaves and they remain dominant
4) people from premier engineering college suffer the most, they are out under inferior people, paid less salary than even the fresh recruits, and subjected to heavy work load
5) no new learning, php is outdated technology, yet they make your work on it and hamper your career."

If we dont come to office and question them, then we are screwed in our appraisals....The best part is appraisal is for namesake, just ur sales performance matters and not ur potential to perform at next well...its just a stupid method to promote people!! Only the metrics matter!! Someone please please make them realize how important is EQ to succeed and manage people/teams when they reach a responsible managerial position. The middle management is sooo short sighted to mention the least!!! 

Especially sales teams are treated like machines when only signing up clients is more important than the sales person struggle itself(mind that im not writing this as im an under performer, Ive been consistently among the top 20 tsm's in practo since last 6-8 months) But its saddening that manager threatens me that ill lose my job if i dont perform even in 1 month and targets just keep increasing and increasing and we are treated just like sign up machines!!"

773,Practo Technologies,Great place to work at!,2014-08-26,5.0,LetsKeepItAnonymous,"So far so great!

1. Hectic but Lovable
My stint at Practo so far has been amazing. It gets a little hectic but the work is so interesting and worthy that you would not feel tired, even for a second. The working Saturday (which has just recently been made as OFF day) has never been able to bother me, mostly because of the way more energetic set of peers and more importantly the non-melancholy nature of the job. 

2. Mature management/wonderful peers: 
You would find most of the senior management (most of them in late 20s or early 30s), are way down to earth but at the same time equally aggressive and passionate. I have literally seen even disruptive ideas being welcomed.
Coming to peers, I do not know how Practo finds these workalcoholic people who feel good about nightouts in the office. Almost every other night I see the VP engineering doing a night-out in the office. you see that and I think you automatically get an adrenalin boost, by seeing so much passion. Not even the top management but even most of the married peers of mine are equally passionate towards what they do and that automatically inspires you to give your best!

3. The perfect learning place: 
Most of my prior career has been at an MNC, wherein I used to get the free snacks and process-oriented work (mentioned as cons in some reviews), but hardly a few months at Practo , I feel to have learnt so much as I wouldnt have imagined even in years of my MNC stint.","So far nothing major.
Working Saturdays could have been a pain for some (although trust me, an interesting work and culture makes it worth it), but it has been done away with recently.
So I guess no other trivial pain-points for anyone.
Sometimes I miss the Gym, garden etc facilities of my previous MNC company.

About some other cons mentioned by other people such as no snacks, slow internet etc, please grow up!"
