Found them very arrogant.

One of the problem with their offers , they add hypothetical amount as bonus in your CTC which makes offer very attractive, but truth is once you join and check the same in workday there will huge difference. 
There is no culture in india as they are new, so every team is working in different mode.

Priceline prides itself on being lean, unfortunately this also extends to how it compensates its employees. I've talked to others who've felt the same.

*No meritocracy

*Lack of passion
I truly get the feeling that many IC's and managers lack passion/ownership in their work, possibly due to being undercompensated, or underrecognized or its a vicious circle where they lose interest because the people around them have already lost it.

* Lack of technical product management
Product managers have narrow views for features as they're not technical enough to see more feature possibilities which leads to lack of growth."

Have a lot of internal tools to support your work, especially on the data side. 

Decent benefits and PTO policy.","You have to tip toe around leadership. Lots of politics.

No training for future leaders and managers. You only get management training once you become a manager so people in a ""lead"" position get no training on mentoring or coaching.

Too many meetings. People would set up meetings to decide what they were going to meet about. I had to block off my calendar in 1–2 hour increments to make it look like my schedule was full in order to get a day of work in with no meetings.

There are some toxic leaders from c-suite down to managers. People were hired without being interviewed because they had worked previously with a c-suite employee. There was an entire team that was having difficulty with their manager and HR did nothing about it and put the blame back on the ICs. ICs are never asked to review or give feedback on their manager.

Design team was extremely under-resourced for years. Some teams had 1 designer to 3–4 PMs. The designers had to rush through their work and many times had to forgo research to move quickly. The design team has had a very high turnover rate and in 2019 about 6 designers left in a 6 month period. Design has felt under valued at Priceline for a very long time."

1) Someone focused on leveling up and becoming a better engineer via learning modern practices. Despite the scale the company operates at, you won’t grow here. Hacky and bad code is more than acceptable here as long as it gets the job done. 
2) Someone who values collaboration and a supportive culture. Soft skills are not valued at Priceline, you’ll see engineers get promoted who are relatively good at what they do but have zero soft skills and as such make terrible people to work with. Management is well aware of these deficiencies and yet does nothing to improve these people or promote better people. Its also hard to get help from teammates if you are struggling, there’s a strong lone wolf culture.

If you’re a decent engineer and are looking for a 9-5 where you won’t be bothered too much Priceline is fine, just don’t go there to be inspired by your coworkers, the culture or the mission."

The company is highly supportive of initiative and brainstorming.

Dress code, attitude and protocol are part of a relaxed workplace while still expecting the best of everyone.   The office is an open door and floor plan environment where everyone is encouraged to collaborate, idea share, and think across teams, all in the spirit of being the best travel deal makers.  Period. Leadership is just as much a part of the open office and invites everyone to chat at any time with whatever the thought.

I have been with the company for nearly 15 years.  I have seen veterans stay and newbies come and go.  The company is what you make it and has a good reputation of rewarding those who stay.  Personally, I have needed the support of flexible work days, and I know that my demonstrated dedication has earned me that privilege.  People looking for a place to have a long term career should consider Priceline.  There are always opening for new positions in many departments.","In recent years, we lost a noticeable number of veterans when upper leadership changed, changing the goals and priorities of some of the departments.

Left in the wake are a bunch of good people either let go, or quit in justified disgust.  
HR personnel are gutless to do anything about it, but then again, in their defense, they are also in fear of their jobs.   Privately, they will acknowledge what's happening is wrong, but publicly can't or are unwilling to interfere, even though that is their job - pathetic!

He stands up at meetings telling everyone how ""wonderful"" everything is, when everyone knows that they are not.  Not one word about what the company is doing to overcome the struggling areas or changing to improve the organization.

The CTO, who has been there 2 years now, has completely disassembled the technology department, wiped out all job satisfaction that anyone has had, and created an environment where no one wants to be there.  I watched as new developers, filled with energy and excitement became beaten down and discouraged, leaving the company after only 1 year of service.  This guy is an inflexible tyrant that doesn't care what anyone on his staff has to say unless it's an ""ata-boy boss!"".  If you're going to work for this idiot, bring plenty of chap stick.

The company itself hires incredible people that are a treat to work with.  Holiday time is good, pay is decent enough.  The office culture will favor one type of personality over another, and if you fit in then work is going to be a party.","The lack of communication across departments is staggering.  It's incredibly frustrating to watch most people and teams completely in their own bubble, too afraid to lose standing or power by sharing what they know and what they can do.  The office culture will favor one type of personality over another, and if you don't fit in you'll be frustrated and lonely. 

Vertical movement is basically impossible.  People change titles from time to time but the structure of the company is such that a small number of feature team leaders constantly battle over how to do things."

So many leadership changes in recent years crippled the culture and some senior staff that were brought in immediately asserted dominance rather than nurturing the talent they had.  It went from a place that cared about employees to a totally results driven workplace, and in such a lean environment (which seemed like it kept getting leaner), burnout started to occur more frequently than it did in years past. Management decisions also, in many cases but not all, keeps the business a step behind it's competitors as well as the group companies. The lack of willingness to take risks is part of that. It's become a place that is obsessed with contributing to the stock price and growing it's bottom line rather than promoting innovation in it's tech, design, brand, etc. It's also a place that really favors bringing in new talent instead of promoting perfectly qualified and motivated employees to new positions. This has caused many pain points because of how lean the teams are and many times employees leave or are let go with so much knowledge of their systems or business that was never properly shared, and it is also a slap in the face to many employees that then see that they aren't getting recognition for their work and maybe aren't being valued."

Lack of career growth. There is very little opportunities to move up in the organization or even laterally.
