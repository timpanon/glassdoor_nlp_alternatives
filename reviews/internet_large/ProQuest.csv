125,ProQuest,Professional Sales People - This may not be the place for you,2019-02-15,1.0,Sales,Account manager level sales teams are doing their best under poor sales leadership.  Great bunch of sales people doing their best to promote ProQuest.,"Sales management is not from the library space and doesn't understand the challenges facing account managers.  It's all about the forecast and closing business, but this request comes with no guidance or support- only criticism.  

This private business made a decision a few years ago to abandon library relationships and put sales leadership in place that manages via a bully mentality.  Every sales decision a front line sales person needs to make must be approved by a micromanaging approval process that sometimes takes weeks to get a response on.  When sales don't meet expectations, there is no advise from management because they are not interested in ""excuses""  The North American upper managements answer to quota misses is to restructure and blame the shortfalls on inherited staff from previous sales management.  This practice is done to show the CEO that they are making changes and buy time.  And all this is at a cost of relationships and lost business due to trust issues with a provider.    

At one time ProQuest had a reputation as a thought leader in the library space.  Providing thoughtful and well planned releases of platforms and content.  What they have developed over the past 2-3 years is a coverup for what should have been fixed 5-10 years ago.  Platform management is a sham and search results are so poor that most libraries rely on discovery services and avoid native platform shortfalls.  ProQuest has lost so much key content that they've had to develop a ""content diversity"" market campaign to keep libraries interested.  Its really nonsense as most of the content they are adding has little value and a low impact factor.  With only a handful a key titles, its only a matter of time before those move to an aggregator with a solid sales management team.

Commission plan is a joke, they will tell you how much money you can make if you overachieve quota by 10-15%.   What they fail to realize is, that quota is set at 4-6% growth rate YoY, this means an AM has to do 15-20% above target to see any real money.  And if you don't maintain that level of selling you go into a ""liability balance"" which means you owe the company for providing millions of dollars in revenue.  The commission plan is based on YTD sales, if you fall behind you will never see a commission check even if you land a large deal.  Great sales people have left the company because of this terrible - profit driven - compensation plan.  

We can only hope this family owned business wakes up one day and fires the upper management or the company is driven down so much it is sold to someone who can grow it again.  Really sad to see such a great company in the hands of poor leadership that is only interested in their future.  Most of these guys will move on in a year or two and leave the company in shambles."
126,ProQuest,Senior leadership's direction does not inspire confidence.,2019-02-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Great team members.  On site managers are great and easy to work with. 


-You'll get to work on some of the best products within the industry that win awards year after year. 


-Relaxed office culture.


-Healthcare benefits and 401k matching are pretty solid.


-Time off and vacation benefits are above standard. 


-Work from home benefits were good while they lasted.","-Upper management and the senior leadership team are often aloof and unaware of the issues employees on the ground face, especially when it's a result of their new plans or policies.


-Unless you are in Ann Arbor, you may as well not even exist. Plans and policies get rolled out that are given little foresight or thought for the impact that they might have on other locations. 


-HR often feels like they are indifferent or incapable of dealing with even the most trivial HR issues that need to be addressed. 


-Work from home benefits were unceremoniously taken away from employees with little notice in one division, specifically because leadership felt ""this was the best way forward.""  Despite many of these employees remotely working on several over-performing and award winning products for years without issues, leadership ended it overnight and justified it with personal feelings, not data. The attrition that this move is causing has eroded morale down to the bone, those that remain are quickly looking for an exit. 


-If you're expecting pay that meets the DC market average, good luck. PQ has for years paid bellow market average in the DC area but this was often ignored by employees due to the previously very generous and flexible work from home arrangements that were made with individual managers with director approval. 


-The bonus and merit schedules have never been clearly defined or laid out

PQ has a terrible Sales Management Team!  They do not values their salespeople and continuously re-organize the sales teams.  The current Sales leadership has made making commission or goal nearly impossible and they will continue to tell you that you should run your territory as ""your own business"".  Yeah, right, except every little discount needs to be approved by at least two layers of management which takes negotiating and closing sales out of the sales reps. hands and you make very little on any sale now.

If you like being treated like a child then take a sales job here.  If you go out drinking with your manager you may be okay for a while as well.

You better hope PQ does not buy the current company you work for...they will say all the right things at the beginning then slowly ruin your company and fire you and everyone else.  Yes, the Glassdoor reviews were correct, even though we were told to ignore them because they were just from disgruntled employees.

Applying for an internal job is also a burden.  As a current employee applying for other positions in the company I was treated like any other candidate, in fact the recruiter that did my preliminary interview was on contract in another state and had no clue what I did with the company.  I was sent an automated message from HR that the position I interviewed for was being cancelled.  What a joke!  A company that pretends to ""value"" its employees can't even tell a current employee that a position they interviewed for was no longer being filled by a real person!

If you are a good sales person I highly recommend you NOT consider PQ.  They will suck the life out of you and ruin your spirit with their unrealistic goals, lack of commission and terrible senior management.  If you are a yes man and like being treated poorly then give it a shot.

Don't believe the Forbes voted us in the top 100 or whatever they claim, I am sure that was paid for as everyone on the Sales Teams were miserable."

Any problem that said worker has is either not solved or swept under the rug; furthermore, contributions and long-term relationships built with clients generally go unnoticed and are certainly not rewarded. Finally, the annual review process and reward structure is rigged so that few receive better than an average or acceptable rating and bonus.

No longer the top player in the industry and the industry is not growing."
210,ProQuest,Dereliction of duty,2016-07-28,2.0,,"— People: There are some great folks who work at PQ, and that makes the difference between packing up and leaving and sticking it out a while longer. 

— Time off / Pay: Could be better on the pay front, but all in all, solid pay for the work and excellent time off.

— Atmosphere: You'd never know we're on a sinking ship; people are generally happy, and it's a fairly stress-free environment that makes it fun especially during group activities.","— HR: What HR? When I began working there, they promised regular meetings to discuss career paths, opportunities. That evaporated within the first six months. I don't think anyone working there could name two people that work in HR, let alone what they do for us besides put on middling parties around the holidays. There is a general malaise toward HR, an apathy run rampant throughout the company that they don't care about the employees. I rarely saw them do anything to challenge these notions in my time there.

— Glut of senior management: While there are some good people in these positions, of course, overall, the company is saturated with Yes Men. It's become a bit of a joke, really. Someone announces a layoff (or, layoffs), and then two new vice presidents are announced a week later, their positions a mystery to the rest of us. (Senior VP of Southern Indiana Sales?) We never meet these people, and they rarely come in with fresh viewpoints. Instead, they want to please, not to leave their mark, and nothing actually changes. We get a lot of wind about changes coming, but they don't. They haven't in my nearly 5 years of experience. No one takes the time to really understand what the problems of the company are, or how they can actually be addressed. They come, they get better jobs, they leave, and the cycle repeats. And the best part: No one seems to care. This is a stopping point. If someone comes in with great viewpoints, with a desire to turn things around (and these people do exist), they're blocked by people who have no desire for these changes, for this hard work. And, eventually, their dreams of change die, too.

— Blind devotion to the past / Stumbling toward the future: Having a company with a large population of employees who have worked there for 15/20+ years is...tough. Absolutely nothing against them, and good on them for keeping their positions for so long, but these people, generally, are not who management should be listening to...and yet they ARE who they listen to. Folks in the same position for decades don't generally have input into what could be done to cut through overly complex and antediluvian processes. Yet, that is who they want. Turnover sucks, but it's part of building a business up, which is what PQ claims they want. The best thing they could do would be to cut what isn't working, combine positions, make people reapply, and try to bring new, fresh blood in. A sweeping layoff is not what I'm saying, but adhering to the past simply to adhere to it is the cause of a great deal of woes in this company, and a reason why so many people leave. Take, for instance, a director who has been in the position for decades, who doesn't understand the technology their team works directly with, doesn't understand, really, what the future goals are, and sews discord because they believe senior leadership is coming for them. How is that a good environment? People get protective of their work, as they tend to be, but when aren't backing that up with results, with good leadership...it drives people away. There is no vision, there can't be, when people complain about how good it used to be, rather than ask how they can make it better. Which leads me to...

— Mass migration of talent: Pretty simple, really...If you want to have a better company, you try to hold on to these talented new hires. Instead, PQ systematically makes it impossible to move around the company, offers almost nothing in the way of support, and is surprised when people with talent leave in droves for companies in the same city with a far better understanding of what it is employees want...how a company should treat them and grow. 

— Toxic everything: No exit interviews, no meetings to discuss future possibilities, internal politics like whoa, and middling (I mean middling) performances by upper management. Nuff said."

The VP at the time had the nerve to tell me that it was not the ""norm"" to stay at a job for more than two years. Beware that this company does not look highly at employee retention.

Many others continue to exit on their own due to frustration with fragmented decisions and lack of communication with/from upper management. For fear of losing their positions, those that stay are left to swallow their tongues and pretend to understand and agree with the usefulness, or lack thereof, of various company-wide initiatives and directives, too many of which have little or no relevance or value to them specifically or to the departments in which they work.

Very poor at staff retention and career progression.

And they serve libraries, supporting education and learning. I think that's a wonderful business to be in.","ProQuest just chewed up and spat out the smaller companies they merged with. What were once fun, engaging places to work became just orphaned cogs of a very big droning machine. Once ProQuest came on board, the whole tenor of our office changed to one of drudgery and dread. Now people just keep their heads down lest they be lopped off. And it was a struggle just to keep our products alive and our small but loyal customer base served. PQ didn't really care about what we did because our revenues weren't as high as theirs. They have no appreciation for niche markets and niche products."
318,ProQuest,Poor Management,2013-10-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,A good day to day atmosphere; friendly people.,"A revolving door of senior management has seen an inflow of inexperienced Vice Presidents from outside of the business, which has not had good results. Staff at the lowest level do vital work for the business but are frequently poorly paid. Reorganizations in recent years have seen key staff leave the organization without being replaced, resulting in areas of the business being ""de-skilled"", bad decisions being made, and parts of the business being allowed to drift into decline."
319,ProQuest,a good starting place,2013-10-28,3.0,Product Marketing Manager,good place to learn all aspects of functional area,"no work/life balance, constant change, difficult to get monetarily rewarded for contribution"
320,ProQuest,"Some good benefits, but low pay and not enough respect for lower level employees makes us feel like cogs in a machine",2013-10-20,2.0,Editor I,"The benefits are decent (I guess), with some flex time","I can't make ends meet on what I get paid. What they call merit increases barely cover cost of living increase - for singles without a family to support, but not for those with family to support. Very hard to get a promotion in spite of high productivity. Repetitive work, low pay, lots of group think, offshoring work, micromanagement = low morale = high employee turnover."
321,ProQuest,"Good company, low pay",2013-10-11,3.0,Editor II,"Flex-time, decent medical benefits, industry leader in academic research products, multiple products within organization allow for lateral development opportunities, management makes a point to get those further down the food chain well informed of company direction and status.",Low pay and often menial work as well as a tendency for silos to form and little effort from the company to help with skills development.
322,ProQuest,"Little direction, low morale, bureacratic processes",2013-10-06,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some very smart people, trying to do some cool things","Office morale was  very low. Existing staff were forced to work on unpleasant legacy code while cool new projects are outsourced to outsiders. Long meetings, little direction from management and no drive to create or protect an engineering culture or agile process. Bureaucracy has seeped in from the parent company driving morale down. Also attracting and retaining talent was very difficult because of low pay grades"
323,ProQuest,Short lived enthusiasm,2013-08-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Smart folks at the ground lever trying to make some technological breakthroughs and push forward. We have some GREAT talent here.,"* Local leadership is powerless over ProQuest to get Salaries bolstered
* Hiring alot of sub-par people as of late, due to lack of funding from ProQuest
* Product/Program Management is a joke - they are directionless and only intent on satisfying ProQuest - not making great software for our clients/patrons
* Problems keeping the talented"
324,ProQuest,The Serials Solutions division of ProQuest is changing,2013-08-15,3.0,,Serials Solutions is under new leadership who appear to be evaluating the company for areas of improvement. They seem to genuinely be trying to boost employee morale.,Serials Solutions location in Fremont is less than desirable; the drawbridge makes travel difficult and the area is prone to overly aggressive bicyclists. Some may view these features of the neighborhood as desirable.
325,ProQuest,Lots of Empty Promises,2013-07-31,3.0,,"Good benefits from day one, some very good people that work for the company.",Too many useless process and forms that must be completed that do nothing but delay getting anything done.
326,ProQuest,"ProQuest treats you well when there's excess cash, worrisome when they just hit the base goal, or lower.",2013-07-26,3.0,Software Engineer III,"stable company, proper promotion time frame, acquitted pay for surrounding industry, flexible work/family balance.","Lack of transparency in other depts, excessive documentation, large layoffs every 2-3 years, heavy reliance on foreign contractors"
327,ProQuest,great place to work,2013-07-22,3.0,Purchasing,top of the line technology in use at this company. They are always looking to improve. Wearing jeans and being in a comfortable environment is a great per. The pay is pretty good as well.,management is out of touch with team when it comes to rewarding and admonishment. Direct supervisors are not given chance to improve and stay the same rather than grow.
328,ProQuest,Pretty Good...And Improving,2013-06-23,4.0,Technology,"Nice work/life balance
Flexibility to work remotely as needed
Friendly people
Complementry coffee bar with Starbucks
Interesting problems to solve, and technolgoies to use","Heavy reliance on foreign contractors (both on-site and off-shore)
Not enough knowlege-sharing, mentorship, and mobility amongst technology teams.  
Seems like junior staff don't get a chance for development or promotion."
329,ProQuest,Wasn't my last career,2013-06-20,3.0,Sales,From day one had benefits and perks. Loved my job (as long as it lasted) which wasn't long. I was in sales and spoke to Librarians all day which was challenging but fun.,"Management was horrible. The left hand never knew what the right hand was doing. And if they did they never informed sales. Was told during corporate meetings not to worry about a lay off. WRONG. Half of the sales force was laid off without a reason. When they choice which people to lay off-they said there is no rhyme or reason but ""we didn't just pick names out of a hat."" REALLY then what did you do? How did they actually come up with who was laid off."
330,ProQuest,Great People and Tech Culture,2013-05-25,4.0,Project Lead,"Fun, cool products.  Good work/life balance.  Lots of fun and varied technology and very smart people.",Typical raise pool was in line with cost of living adjustment.  You had to get promoted to get ahead of the game in terms of pay.
331,ProQuest,Get In or Get Out,2013-03-25,2.0,Technology,Interesting work in publishing in a good Ann Arbor location.  Salary was fairly comparable for similar type of work in the surrounding area.,"Very click-ish people who wear an air of arrogance.  Resistant to change if ideas come from an new source  -- not part of the inner circle of the various groups.  If you're not able to find a way into the 'group', then you won't make it very far."
332,ProQuest,Good place to work,2013-03-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some great benefits that include 401k, medical
Plenty of time off with vacation, Sick/Personal
Opportunity for advancement
Very competitive salaries

Moving in the right direction.
Work life balance is great and very flexible skills.","Legacy code needs to truly be addressed (rewritten)
Priorities need to be consistent
Proquest needs to let SerSol do what it does and stop distracting them from random tasks."
334,ProQuest,"Great people, but trying to find their way as a company",2013-03-07,4.0,Director,"Great people, good pay, family atmosphere","constant budget cutting, hesitant to invest in areas other than key product."
335,ProQuest,Wouldn't recommend - not a true software company.,2013-02-15,2.0,Software Developer,"Salaries are competitive, can't think of anything else.","Mostly a sales company, does not understand or think like engineers. Does not innovate.
Takes no risks, very slow reaction to market forces due to the concept of rigorous, unfounded ""budgets"".
Antiquated and useless review systems (SuccessFactors for example).
Management doesn't know what it's doing."
336,ProQuest,Top down management style preventing the company from making obvious process changes,2012-12-12,1.0,Project Manager,"- People in the trenches are good natured and want to deliver
- There is recognition at the C-level on the need for change","- Politics at the VP level preventing progress; True leadership/real experience is rare
- Focus on managing the message to Sr Mgmt and hiding the true state of the world
- Extreme favoritism"
337,ProQuest,I Need a New Job,2012-09-14,2.0,Content Acquisitions,The occasional person is nice. Okay as a last resort for new graduates.,I don't make enough to cover the bills. My department has more cliques than a high school and is 1/10 of the size. I keep getting assignments that are new to me but cause me to be yelled at because action wasn't taken years ago. Also I'm working in a basement with no windows; We call it the dungeon.
338,ProQuest,Not quite a nice as it used to be,2012-08-25,3.0,Senior Developer,"Collegiate atmosphere, reasonable office, laid back working conditions and generally nice people. There are some interesting projects and for a junior there is opportunity to take on responsibility and progress.",Over the course of the last ten years there has been a lot of restructuring and cost-cutting which has dented the enthusiasm of some of the shop floor staff. Developers have been promoted on the basis of ambition not ability leading to some bad technical decisions being made by individuals carrying more technical responsibility than they are really capable of dealing with. Salaries are only okay.
339,ProQuest,Nice People,2012-08-14,4.0,,"- Nice people.  
- Interaction with many different departments
- Fine for a year or two if you are starting your career","- Career advancement opportunities are limited
- Compensation"
340,ProQuest,Surrounded by enthusiastic co-workers and a mess of a management structure,2012-05-18,2.0,,"There is a ton of work ethic in everyone, and people truly take pride in what they do.  I certainly did.  Salaries were a bit low, but benefits are competent.  It's a very friendly environment to work in.","I have never seen such a bi-polar mess in management as this company displays.  Seemingly constant changes in team structures and reporting make it feel like they're throwing random ideas at a wall to see what sticks.  This has, unfortunately, led to losing too many valuable employees."
341,ProQuest,Good to learn new business in fascinating industry.,2012-04-17,4.0,,"Overseas group is fantastic.  Good people, opportunities to make a difference.  Management will allow creative thinking although not always acting on suggestions made.","Senior management too far away from workers and what's going on in company.  Fear factor among middle management (afraid to admit to anything negative; blame shifting, etc.)."
342,ProQuest,"Not inspiring, forgettable.",2012-02-12,2.0,,Great location and a lot of talented contributors in the Engineering organization. The space is interesting and can present interesting problems to solve.,"No career or personal advancement opportunities for the employees/contributors. Ineffective Director and Executive level leadership throughout the company that prefers hand-wringing over solving problems that are solvable.They're behind the times on compensation, culture and trends resulting in difficulties in retaining and attracting talent."
343,ProQuest,Not a bad place to work,2012-01-22,3.0,,Good people. Large company offers room for growth and promotion. Stable and secure. Great office environment. Some very bright coworkers. Good benefits and reasonable pay.,"Sometimes too political. Half of the employees are ""lifers"". Bad management is never replaced with better management."
344,ProQuest,"Not the best, not the worst.",2012-01-16,2.0,,Company has respect for your work/life balance.  Adequate time-off is give and management is very understanding towards time-off requests.  Benefits are good.,"Company's management is very ""top-down.""  If you are new employee, your voice is not really considered, much less, heard.  There is very little room for promotion or advancement, nor is the company very interested in helping you further your career.  Promotions are given based solely on seniority, performance, capabilities, and dedication is not considered.  Upper management is out of reach, regardless of how hard you work it is not recognized.  Sometimes a simple ""thank you"" would be appreciated."
345,ProQuest,why did I stay so long,2011-12-22,1.0,Software Developer,if like funky Fremont that would the only positive thing about this place. Nothing negative about the worker bees their is just the mgt in the kindness terms sucks.,"First of all, I feel so guillty for waiting so long to post something. It was just such an uplifting feeling being away from working there and being at real company where hard work and  technical excellence was actcually appreciated.  Maybe I could have prevented some poor soul from experiencing something literally that sucks the joy of life from your soul. Do you enjoy being demeaned on a daily basis, clueless mgt, then this is the place for you. But, wait maybe I can save another soul from despair. They are hiring again I have seen. Do yourself a favor and pass on by this snake pit."
346,ProQuest,"Very corporate, political environment.",2011-11-16,3.0,Director,Great benefits and a focus on good customer service.,Management did always keep employees informed of important decisions.

348,ProQuest,"Has big ideas, still needs big changes - seems to be working on it",2011-09-15,4.0,,"No lack of interesting work - very smart folks to work with
Has proved that it can weather economic ups & downs
Positioning itself - technically & functionally - for the future
TRYING to make the big changes needed","Groups tend to  be siloed
Lack of leadership & coordination over the years has taken its toll
Still making short-sighted sales decisions"
349,ProQuest,Great Leadership,2011-07-26,4.0,,I agree that we're heading in the right direction.  Some very good leadership and exciting new products.  The future is bright!,Some nay-sayers in the organization.  There are many of us that want to focus on the future - not live in the past.
