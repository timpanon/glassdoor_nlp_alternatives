This is a well run company on a mission to change the industry, and it's a fun place to learn and grow. Very transparent culture focused on employee growth and customer success.",None that i can think of.

6,PubMatic,Deadbeat,2022-01-21,2.0,Senior Account Manager,"- Good work-life balance.
- Awesome if you want to coast
- Pay increase vaguely in line with inflation
-Internet, Phone stipend","It's a funny one, the company market itself well but there are key issues that limit growth. Demand is an issue and continues to be the elephant in the room. 

Not just the low fill rates <1% but also the lack of accountability across demand 'sales' teams. They tend to work on % growth rather than focusing on sourced PMP deals is so extremely hard to gauge individual contribution. The demand team is now the largest team in EMEA but it's impossible to understand their contribution as Salesforce isn't used for this team. Product knowledge amongst this team is also weak, they often struggle to pitch new areas and fail to close and execute strategic supply path deals globally. 

PubMatic is hemorrhaging talented staff, post-IPO this makes sense, it's natural, however, the company needs one of the new areas to make money. CTV technology and subsequent revenue are embryonic. Audience and data, again a lot of marketing talk but limited revenue. Retail Media, the same. Legacy product is pretty good, new product areas the company struggles with.
Why not acquire a company to springboard one of these focus areas?

If you're looking for guidance and career development, this place isn't for you. What the global HR team discusses sounds good but is rarely executed locally. In fact, HR doesn't act on issues - maintenance of a status quo or sorts is preferred. 

If you're smart you can move away from the gaze into a role that doesn't really get much attention whereby you can turn up, send out some slack messages, reply all on a few emails and then call it a day. The reply-all email culture is depressing.

Hire more people mentality - Hiring more people doesn't make you drive more revenue or grow."
7,PubMatic,"Was golden organization, now corrupted management",2022-01-18,2.0,Techlead,"Good starting salary
Good medical benefits
Easy reachability to HR, admin, Finance team.
Heaven for short term employees.","Not for long term employees. Company only lay red carpet for new joiners. They never look into employees who worked here for long time. So good company to stay 2-3 years not more than that.
upper level management only work for getting moved to RWC and get green card. After getting green card they left organization. None of the upper level management think about the company, They only concord about their own benefits. 
Very top level technical management, corrupted everything by playing politics.
Current changes in HR team makes this organization unfriendly place to work.
None of the above mentioned things were not there 5 years back. 
Note: Even I mentioned this is the company for short term employment, my remarks are not from short term experience. I worked here for a decade."

Two things that set the company apart are – a) the technical innovation and b) learning opportunities. The recent Hackathon was a classic example of innovation. The engineers are building highly scalable systems and the learning and development team is constantly cross training the engineers in new skill sets. There is high level of business awareness amongst the team members, which enables better knowledge and faster product development. I love the team here and I love working at PubMatic.",No cons.

26,PubMatic,Review  of Company,2021-07-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Best Place to work here,No cons as such here
27,PubMatic,Comfort over talent,2021-07-08,2.0,Business Development,"- CEO is dynamic and focused on growing the business
- Good work life balance and good office locations
- Great transparency as to what the business is doing in terms of revenue and growth achievements
- Handful of genuinely talented people but that number is going down as they are moving on","- Multiple people working here for years and the reason they are here is not necessarily because of talent or ambition but because of the personal relationships they have built. They are also very set in their ways and oppose change as it might affect their positioning within the company

- Couple of teams are extremely well protected and even if your job might be dependant on their success, they are very rarely questioned about their contribution to the business

- International business is very different to the US one and run by a handful of people. If you are in with them then great, otherwise you just sit as an outsider with very little power to influence positive change

- Career development is positioned as 'what you can do in the next 6 months for the company' as opposed to 'this is what you have accomplished and this is what you can accomplish when given more responsibilities'

- Incredibly annoying reply all email culture. Birthdays, anniversaries, everything is addressed by replying to the entire company. It is very forced and just clutters peoples inbox and drives focus away from the actual job

- People managers in general have no decision making power unless your manager is part of the 'in crew' then you might get somewhere. Also seems to be very little thought put into hiring managers. Reporting lines are more about convenience than actual skillset of a manager to lead a team"

Intelligent CEO
Some wonderful people to work with here and there","There are execs at the company who have a pattern of bullying, harassing, and manipulating women. They also use classic abuser tactics to silence victims from voicing concerns or even leaving the company.

""It will be bad for your brand if you were to leave during an IPO"" - Fear mongering

 ""You don't want people to think you left because you couldn't hack it"" - Victim shaming

""You're being to emotional about this, and it will undermine your credibility"" - Blame shifting and invalidating

""I've talked with the person about this,but give me time"" while doing nothing but informing the person who then retaliates - grooming/regrooming.

“There seems to be a misunderstanding or miscommunication . X person didn’t mean Y”  - gaslighting/invalidating 

""Women tend to be more emotional about these types of things(to third parties)"" - Victim blaming

""Those who have had issues in the past were out to get the person"" - Victim blaming.

This has been a long-running, and well-documented issue however victims are told to move on without any accountability for perpetrators or enablers, without any truth-telling, or without confronting the damage done to people's careers and mental health. Until the audience is actually confronted, it will just be a regular encore performance."

Unlimited vacation policy, fully stocked kitchen, free lunch twice a week, and a robust recognition and award system for good work helps make this a great place to work.",Decision making around promotions is often sketchy and poorly made; the wrong supervisor can make your experience hell and senior execs tend to micromanage.
89,PubMatic,Global Leader,2019-08-01,5.0,Senior Level,PubMatic has continued to iterate and is now one of the top global companies providing technology and services to publishers.  It's pretty amazing really to see  companies that started in the early days of internet advertising and have adapted to the changing dynamics of the industry.  It takes keen leadership to be able to adjust business models and grow AND remain profitable.,It is very difficult in the digital advertising ecosystem to be focused.  Opportunities arise all the time and the company needs to focus on the highest value drivers.

4.  Not extreme work pressure. Work pressure is fair, at times things need to be done urgently. 
5.  Well, spend, team outings.","1.  In house promoted management. Almost all teams have directors, who once joined as interns when PubMatic was a startup and made it to high positions in just about 10years. No outside world exposure. Most have frog-of-the-well mentality with no ability to think outside office politics. Expecting managers being interested in your career development will be lofty thoughts.
2. Don't be surprised to see a 6-7 yrs experienced person as manager. Crappy team vision is inevitable.
3. HR is frugal. With sudden awful policies like - 
      -> not celebrating birthdays of people on notice period. Save money on gift cards.
      -> Eat away peoples tenure award money, just because they are on notice period.

Employee engagement activities are good","A lot of internal politics in Mid management level. Middle level managers have their favorites and they favor them so much that others in the team lose confidence and look out for opportunities elsewhere. 

This attitude is quite seen in EMEA where one employee gets whatever he wants (allowed to work from India for months while get paid in Pounds, Bonused on best performing region, given credit for other's work etc.) while others who work more than the favorite person but in background are not recognized as they are not the Favorite person. 
Favorite person is highlighted so much that it feel that all the work in this company is done by that one person.
The favoritism is upto such an extent that people are recognized for just doing their work and that too reactive work (when client complains).
Training is one part this company does worst. Favorite person never trians anyone properly and then shows others that that persons knows nothing and always comes to him for help.... such is the favoritism that working in London office had become difficult.

163,PubMatic,Customer Success Review,2017-07-22,2.0,Customer Success Manager,"PubMatic's NY office offers a fun outing or event each month, in addition to free lunches on Mondays and Thursdays, random happy hours in the office, a summer outing, and a holiday party. The office has a ping pong table and a wellness room.  

There is a lot to learn in regard to programmatic tech if you like, and their Pub University features hundreds of training and tech videos/presentations for you to peruse as you like. 

You can also get promoted without doing a really great job or having management skills just so you'll stick around.","The communication between teams is not great, despite some awesome weekly training sessions. The CSM team is stifled and not able to service customers as other departments handle a lot of issues such as tech and troubleshooting, reporting requests, and overall demand issues. The clients are typically great but what you can do for them is severely limited and really relies on their inventory and the whims of various DSPs and exchanges.

The NY office is an odd atmosphere and didn't feel open or friendly. Feels cliquish and HR doesn't do much to change it, only add to the isolating feel."
164,PubMatic,Programmatic Leader,2017-07-20,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Lots of learning, fast paced,",not too many cons here
165,PubMatic,It Comes From the Top...,2017-06-20,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The pay and benefits at PubMatic are great -- definitely better than industry standard, as long as you negotiate well for yourself up front. If you work here, your coworkers will make the day for you nearly every day. Our culture at PubMatic is easily the best I've seen in the business, especially in comparison with similar companies (Rubicon, Index, AppNexus). You'll make friends here, and you'll be sad if you see some go, but it's a sense of pride to see people move on and grow...which takes me into the cons.","There's little to no growth opportunity in most departments at PubMatic. They claim that you'll be eligible for promotions, but in order for those to happen, your manager will probably have to leave first. The leadership team isn't going anywhere (although if you ask me, there are several who could stand to at least change their attitudes), which means there's no movement for senior management and it all trickles down from there. In my time here the only upward movement has happened when someone quit or was fired. And I can't say which one was more frequent. The lack of opportunity for growth means that when there is a rare position open, it's more likely to go to whoever will say ""yes"" to their manager more often. Don't even think of pushing back against the will of management or even asking questions out of turn. If you're outspoken about anything, you'll never move up in this company. 

The ""faces"" of PubMatic -- Rajeev and Kirk -- could not be more different from each other, but thankfully Rajeev tempers Kirk and his ego most of the time. It's unfortunate that someone with all of his connections treats his employees with such disregard for their feelings; he could really help people to grow but he chooses to allow people to fear crossing him. And it doesn't help that he's got HR in his pocket. If either one of them takes a dislike to you, they'll make your life a living hell -- until you either quit, or they find a reason to fire you. It's easier to play the game until you've got enough experience here to get poached by another company. 

I'm not saying don't take the job. It's a great job. I'm happy enough here. But there are people that you need to avoid at all costs, unless you're kissing their butts."

A good CEO rallies his troops so they stick. Head of Engg. is a photography expert rather than anything. 

- They have/had about a handful employees who have stuck around for the love of the company, and they believed for the longest time.  These employees were team leads for engineering and UX teams, got promoted but some of them either left, or were let go.  There are still some folks sticking around, praying something may happen.","Type a search on google, for “hire and fire policy” and PubMatic shows up 5th on the ranking.  Just imagine!!

I saw several phases of PubMatic and the best was back in 2010-2012, when the company was always striving to do better, the competition wasn’t as fierce, the product and engineering leadership was strong and their teams were focussed. Based on personal differences and maybe some insubordination, the C-Level started to remove seasoned director level product and engineering managers and get new crop, which continued to become bad news for team managers, leads and their employees, as the focus was how to keep aligning to the company’s vision, not what the customer needs were."

If you are in a support role, they will overwork you (under the pretext of efficiency) till you quit. You can be moved under any manager based on management feedback, whether it makes sense or not.
2. HR and the CEO have no insight of ground levels. They just take feedback from VP++. Some of the VPs have too many individual reportees and they dont really know / understand what each person / team does. 
3. HR is negligent of the problems faced by employees. E.g. one of the VPs had about 6-7 turnovers in his team for director levels and HR did nothing to prevent them from happening.
4. Customer Success roles are for namesake. Ops teams end up lifting all the burden and teams keep blaming each other for client failure.

- Communication between teams and with the company overall is very poor.

- Execution of new product launches and GTM material often fall short and are delayed to the market. 

- Wouldn't recommend to engineers. You'll work on your code, but won't be exposed to market feedback to understand the true value of what you're working on. 

- 30%+ annual voluntary attrition rate. It's created gaps through out the comapny that aren't being back filled. Instead of hiring the best possible candidates management positions are often offered to in-experienced employees to keep them from leaving.

Recently I was given a award and i got a mail asking to collect money from HR, then after a few days from that I have put down my resignation papers and serving notice period.
When I went to collect Money/Coupon from HR they denied saying that we will not give reward money to notice period employees
Following are the  words said by HR , Since you have broken your commitment by resigning ((as if i have given a commitment to work here life long) we also  break our commitment.

Also when i quoted them the rule book and said there is no rule like that , they say its our interpretation(rule book talks about only bonus  , and interpretation is ""any reward is a bonus"").

217,PubMatic,Strong player in the programmatic space,2016-03-16,4.0,Account Executive,"I learned a ton about the programmatic space working at PubMatic.  Given the industry it is in, there is a lot of new technology continuously being developed - PubMatic is consistently ahead of the game when it comes to innovation.  The rapidly growing technology in this space requires employees to be self motivators - the company highly rewards those that work hard.  That being said, there are so many smart individuals that are willing to sit down and help you get up to speed if you have any questions.

Using PubMatic as a name got me a lot of meetings.  The company is very well regarded in the space, especially the CEO Rajeev.  As long as you know the platform well and can explain why it is a good fit for the company you are speaking with, it is not a hard sell.  The internal sales team works very hard to support you and keep your clients happy once you get a deal across the line.","Morale is pretty low at the moment.

Most of the people hired in the last 6-9 months are A+.,Tons of growing pains that are expected. The company is going through the transition from a startup to a leading company in a large space.  Many of the early guard are leaving which creates some gaps in rescues and drama. There are also some miss-hires happening as well as the company learns the right profile at this stage.
257,PubMatic,My time with PubMatic,2015-09-16,4.0,Varied,"I launched the UK office of PubMatic (and Europe with the then VP) and served with them for a little under four years.

The Pro's of PubMatic, like most businesses, are the people. It doesn't really matter what brand people work for as long as there is commonality of thought and purpose. We had a cracking team and as far as I know very little has changed since I've left. The same people, generally, are there and they are a tight team that battles to win everything they set their mind to. As a satellite office it is self-managing with very little day-to-day interference/input from HQ which is exceptionally refreshing in the adtech sector.

As a European business I suggest PubMatic is one people should aspire to work for. Not because it is holistic this, or proprietary that, but because it is a progressive business in a very busy industry that will allow motivated, smart, stubborn and focussed people to grow and make some real changes in industry as a person, not an employee number, a lot more than if they'd simply picked a ""big-name"" to work for, I suggest.

As with all companies you get out what you put in, PubMatic is one of those companies. Sit back and your ride will be as bumpy as you'd expect; give it a good crack and you will do well here.

Would I work there again based on what I know now; yes.","This really depends on what type of person you are as nothing is the same for everyone. 

PubMatic is in a constant state of growth, development, change and restructure as such there are changes (some big...some small) and with all growth there comes pains, so prepare for them as they're there. Realise what you're trying to achieve and the pains are quite bearable and certainly not unique to PubMatic.

There are no real unique ""cons"" about working at PubMatic that you'd not get anywhere else so there's little point in going through them; I'm not perfect neither are they."

Those who have graduated from PubMatic are smarter and better off for it. Used to be some pretty amazing people working there. Most have moved on now, of course. And we came away from the experience feeling this great bond that comes from going into battle together.","I held off writing a review for a very long time, but after the post that mentioned the inappropriate relationship between the executive and the employee that continually gets promoted out of cycle, was obviously deliberately yanked, I thought it was finally time to put my thoughts to paper. I just couldn't get another alert for yet another phony cheerily positive review written by HR and think that someone might believe that dreck. This company is the worst and these actions are indicative of the lack of moral compass with which it operates. I've worked for some pretty rotten companies in my day but not like this. I literally felt sick coming to work. Processes upon processes, no one taking ownership, everyone working their own agenda, lack of direction and no communication - it starts at the very top and  spreads all the way down to the bottom throughout all of the offices like a disease. The continuous display of vanity, poor choices and inability to listen to what everyone else (especially your biggest customers) is saying have made this company fall further and further behind its competitors. They claim to be a product lead company but they can't keep a product team in place and seem to produce no products. Publishers are going elsewhere. The people at the top appear to be more concerned with putting ""took this company to an exit"" on their resumes than actually running a successful business and the employees suffer and leave. HR clearly stated at the beginning of the year that their primary goal was to make PubMatic the ""Best Place to Work"". Try making it not a horrible sickening place to work. Try working on employee retention. Someone else said in a previous post that it was like suffering every day. Yes. It. Was."
263,PubMatic,Long honest review,2015-09-03,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everybody knows that this company is not the best to work for. Though, I work in PubMatic long enough to know also that the bad reviews written here, without argumenting anything, are not reliable as well as the extremely positive ones.

Let's be fair. 

PubMatic have many pros:
- it is a known tech company, and working here means getting exposed to latest technologies, key contacts in the market, industry updates and trend, with consistent inputs upcoming from everywhere every day. Presence at industry events, conferences, round table. Learning is certainly not missing.

- there is a lot of flexibility, you can work from home, no strickt working hours, as long as there is no productivity lack. Everyone manages his time without mandatory strickt rules and flexibility is always encouraged.

- PubMatic is global and allow you to have international breath. It is true that at the moment internal travels across offices are freezed, but events and client meetings abroad are possible.","Let's make a distinction here:

There are cons for the entire organization, and cons different from office to office.

Cons valid everywhere are mainly related to the reaction the business is having to the current bad company trend.

No more training travels, no more open positions.
The employees are overloaded. 
Ticket system and escalation systems simply don't work and tickets are not picked up for weeks and weeks.

Working across 6 time zones, 8 countries, 8 different cultures, is challenging. The most challenging part is the relationship with all the backend functions. Usually companies outsource those functions but in PubMatic they are internal, have their own KPIs and have power to impact the in market teams and their targets. This makes difficult to work properly as the company struggle to be competitive in the market. Operations have long and long and slow process to do everything, people in those teams are demotivated and not partecipating. Take it or leave it. You report client complains, and wait for the process to be complete. You get frustrated but it is not the end of the world and at the end it is not your company.

Different is the case if you ask about the culture.

PubMatic have offices in US and India,  in London, Germany, France, Italy, Stockholm etc etc...

The culture in the company is different according to the office, because the culture is not corporate, is defined by senior and middle management and it s local.

If you talk with the emplyees in Germany they would tell you that the culture is amazing, because the German country manager is considered one of the best managers to work for. This is a win.

If you talk with the employees in India, especially in Operations, they would tell you that PubMatic is the worst company they have been working for. That's because the management is hated. This is a loss.

If you talk to the employees in London you would get positive review from those reporting into the UK country manager who is highly respected and loved, while the others reporting into other leaders would tell you the opposite because those leaders are hated in the office. Simple as that. 

Not the best company to work for. Not the worst. Just a corporate company, with some bad managers, in a fab industry, in a bad moment."

266,PubMatic,Bring Transparency and Vision to Center Stage,2015-08-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are so many career opportunities at PubMatic and the company does a good job promoting first-time managers from within. 

PubMatic employees are generally good people and I made a lot sincere of friends there. 

You can make a lot of industry connections at PubMatic, especially if you are in a client facing role. They have a lot of great customers who appreciate the partnership and the upside PubMatic brings to the table.  I really loved my customers and the relationships we built.","The turn over is a problem that should come front and center. Due to turn over, some people's morale can swing up and down. It's hard when colleagues and respected leaders leave the business in such a big exodus. The turn-over rate is just tremendous and customers bring it up all the time. ""You are my 5th account manager in 1 year."" Due to lack of staffing, people are generally over worked and get stressed. In this type of economy, it's silly that PubMatic cannot fulfill open headcount. Retain the top employees not by offering promotion or raises, but by listening to their feedback and putting it in to action.

There is a lack of operational discipline in the business overall. In order to get something done for a customer, people often have to loop-in 5 people who sit in different time zones. Escalations management becomes a core part of sales people's jobs and most sellers just don't know how to project manage well. Commanding people's attention in order to resolve customer challenges becomes burdensome and places an undue tax on the teams."

273,PubMatic,Great Company to work for!,2015-08-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"One of the best interview process to filter exactly the candidate they are looking for, great cozy work environment. Work hard, play hard environment. All in all, nobody is micro managing but no need for it if you are an adult and understand your responsibilities. Well positioned in the AdTech ecosystem and with 700 employees globally, definitely not a new name in the market.","Nothing majorly wrong with this company, other than the fact that even though you are a part of a global organisation - it still feels like a startup in AU with not many heads in the office. One has to come prepared to hit the ground running, with support from various teams. Not a PubMatic only issue, have seen this with many organisations happen before on a massive growth incline."
274,PubMatic,Dont waste your time,2015-07-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Free food - that's it!,"Open desk model that does not foster collaboration - it is a very quiet, unapproachable, unfriendly, untrustworthy, headphones on everyone environment. Their way to approach employees is set up to be a revolving door - one in one out, and not really caring to connect with the employees.  They have extreme amounts of turnover (voluntary and involuntary. people are there less than 10 months), which is felt amongst all employees, however they are not doing anything about. Their benefits are not comparable to market, especially around new parents. Any candidate that walks in, can see this isn't your typical high tech lively environment. They made mandatory 1:1 weekly meetings in 2015, which fosters lack of trust and micro management."

I was surprised at first by the amount of current employees that had bad things to say, but having experienced it first hand the stories are all very true. This company is mis-managed and plays favorites with people in positions of leadership that don't have the technical skills to back them up. Collaboration is non-existent and forced when it does occur. Work/life balance is non-existent for the people not in Director roles or workers who seem to have more weight in working from home or taking PTO from seniority. Very biased and unproductive working environment. Technology architecture is a nightmare so even with the best developers the way they built their product makes getting anything done virtually impossible."

Very low visibility of the roadmap: Almost noone can explain what we are doing in the next 3 months.
Pathetic Product management: Most common driving factor for features brought into the roadmap fall into the two categories:
1. Clones of features:  Just because a competitor has the feature
2. Ransom notes: Just because a big customer has asked for it.

Substandard Agile practices:  A case study of how agile should NOT be done. People get stuck into glass ceiling due to vertical groups.

The CEO is clearly a bright guy with a very strong personality, but is lacking some basic management skills and is in the wrong role at the company.  A number of good people have left or were pushed out because of him.

I found myself working early in the morning and late at night (calls with India).  Business trips were crappy marathon working sessions.  Bad home/life balance for me.

311,PubMatic,Growth & Opportunity,2015-02-02,5.0,,"PubMatic is at the center of some huge trends and a very fast growing industry – depending on what you are looking for, this can be good or bad.  First, the good…

When a company is growing at the type of rates that PubMatic is growing at, the amount of responsibility that becomes available on a daily basis is massive.  There are constantly new challenges that need to get solved, and due to the velocity, those challenges aren’t neatly given to certain individuals based on org structure and title.  Responsibility and opportunity is up for grabs to those who are willing to step up.  This is possible because of the growth rates – I’ve worked for slower growing companies and it’s not the case.  If you are looking to truly own something and see it through, PubMatic is likely a good fit.  

To be successful in an environment like this, it’s important that you have access to as many business metrics and as much executive thinking as possible (if you are expected to own sr. level projects, then you need to have access to sr. level thinking as well).  The amount of data and transparency into the company’s strategy that is provided by the executive team is phenomenal.  I’ve never been at a company that shares as openly as PubMatic.  This is important to me as I’m trying to learn how a company is run and want to understand how key decisions are made.  One caveat… it takes some effort to learn the systems and understand how to access the data, but once you learn, everything is available.  Not everyone at the company is willing to put in this effort – and that’s their loss.  Note: the company is working on simplifying this, but my point remains the same.","A mentor of mine once told me that the difference between lower level contributors and higher level contributors is the complexity of the problems they are asked to deal with.  When you are a manager, problems are handed down to you in neatly organized bite-sized chunks (which isn’t the case for a VP).  As mentioned above, the fast growth of the company often results in individuals being asked to solve complex cross-functional challenges larger than their “title” or experience level may justify.  Depending on who you are, this may sound like a growth opportunity or an overly daunting task.  It’s important to know where you fit on this spectrum to understand if PubMatic is a good place for you.

PubMatic is a bit chaotic.  In my mind, this is good.  This is a result of the growth and exactly what I want to be in the middle of.  Nevertheless, if process and order are your bag, then keep this in mind.

In short, PubMatic is a place for people who want to be a part of building something.  Building is messy, frustrating and challenging, but it’s also more rewarding.  If you want to join something that is already built and you become a part of a culture that is already solidified, then PubMatic is not the place for you."
312,PubMatic,"Challenging, rewarding, fun work environment",2015-01-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you are looking for a challenging, complex, thought-provoking work environment, PubMatic is the place for you. The company & its leadership reward employees that do good work, and that are proactive in making PubMatic successful. Over the last year I have seen a transformation for the better; in the past it may have been hard to speak your mind and make a change for the better. That said, I truly believe the leadership team is dedicated to transparency & ""open door"" policy - encouraging input from everyone in the organization so that together we can all achieve more. 

There are some incredibly smart, talented hard working people at every level & every geo. A great company culture is all about its people at the end of the day, and we have the right ingredients in that regard. I also believe PubMatic is on a continued rise performance-wise; being in a market that is growing, and growing as a company yourself, have and will play a huge role in making PubMatic a great place to work. 

Some groups complain about being worked too hard and not being rewarded. I don't believe that's true now, even if it had been before. And I can tell you, having come from an extremely challenging work environment working 8am to 10pm on a regular basis, till 2 am on a semi-regular basis, with extreme stress and demands, this is nowhere near there. It's all relative. Yes, if you want a 9-5, don't work here. Join a 10K person corporation.","There are some growing pains at the company - difficulty to find the right information, lack of superb training, poor information sharing across groups, but I believe leadership is taking all the right steps to fix this. There have been some mis-steps in 2014, but I see leadership holding themselves accountable and making this a priority for 2015.

And it's not all on leadership! There are also some incredible talented people taking this upon themselves to make a difference from the bottom up. And guess, they will succeed!!

Free lunch (although the quality of food is below par - but at times its good)

Exit process was very smooth","Work - The work there is never stimulating. You are superficially ""encouraged"" to be ""bold"" and ""innovative"" during exploration stages. But whenever it comes to implementation, it is the tried and tested backwards methods. The engineering team in Pune is extremely shoddy, clinging on to antiquated technologies and frameworks. They are not open to any suggestions or quality of life improvements.

Management - The mangers I dealt with or observed ranged from micro managers to completely clueless managers. When it comes to taking strategic decisions, they would lose their spine. But when it comes to minuscule things like setting a curfew period on table tennis, they will show over the top zeal. Boot licking goes on to such lengths that I am surprised they are not walking around with brown noses. There a couple of decent managers, but they are not higher up in the food chain (no surprises there).

Shift of power - Major projects are moving to the US offices (no surprise given the  quality of engineers in Pune) - which leaves very little to do here in Pune."

2. Don't care about employees at all - this results in A players leaving who they they are unable to retain. The C players usually get fired or resort to politics to stay employed. This has resulted in a build up of B players and C players who are fighting to stay afloat.
3. Very high level of chaos and distrust. A lot of people make decisions with the aim of not getting fired rather than doing what is best for the company. Some resort to finger pointing which is distracting and unproductive

324,PubMatic,An enterprise focused company running too fast to care for its employees.,2014-11-20,3.0,Anonymous Employee,This is global company with lots of people traveling around world offices bringing energy.

The politics are multi-layered and make your head spin.  The working environment is pressurized and extremely negative and there is little respect for the junior members of the offices.  This seems to be true in all local offices which again tells you the negativity is born from the top.  
Their values are purported to be about leadership, integrity, teamwork, and bias towards action - it is quite literally the total opposite - teamwork is discouraged, problem solving doesn't happen, mistakes are hidden and left to breed further technical screw ups, exec team do NOT know how to lead (by example or otherwise), and integrity?  Give me a break."
326,PubMatic,Software Engineer,2014-11-05,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great development opportunities and nice work culture,Too much focus on revenue and small company
327,PubMatic,"If you didn't have the India Engineers giving 4+ Stars, Pubmatic's going average would be a 1 star.",2014-11-04,1.0,Sales,Wearing 5 hats can give you the experience that in other companies would take 2 times the time.  1 year at Pubmatic equals 2 years energy output.  Too bad you can't write that on your resume for your next job.,"1.  Mostly B players work at this company.  I'd say 10% are actually industry experts and most of that 10% leave.  Highly inflated roles were given to very junior people given in 2013 after high turnover.  B players don't like to hire or manage A players.  It makes them feel threatened.  So you start noticing the B players hire C players to keep them under control. Imagine trying to do your job well with a bunch of B & C players managing you or that you rely on.  
2.  High turnover creates a constant flow of bad energy.  In both the NYC and the bay area office the pendulum swung back and forth from either a lot of finger pointing or on the other side of the spectrum just outright ignoring problems.  People would leave if they were an A player.  And B and C players would step in and threaten to leave to get raises since the A players caused resource constraints. (once again causing highly inflated roles to junior people).
3.  India, offshore (basically outsourced) engineering.  Never work for a company that uses offsite resources to this degree. This is a clear sign that the company is cheap. At one point, 1/2 of the company was in India, 150+.  Now it is about 1/3.  The cultural differences are astounding and made getting anything complete brutal.  If your company wants to hire 4 people for the price of 1 in a country where they are order takers and not problem solvers (especially in engineering and product), you will notice a paralysis of product advancement.  Hence why every other SSP has eclipsed Pubmatic.
4.  Executive Team is missing the mark.  CEO is inexperienced in the C-suite game.  CEO's in the industry are lightyears ahead of him.  A CEO of a company is part of the brand, part of the perspective, a evangelist and thought leader.  This is not the case here.  That's ok though, I guess some CEOs have to learn as they go.  Thankfully he and his brother are the biggest investors otherwise I believe he'd have been pushed out long ago.
The President is a good evangelist and thought leader, however he is more of the face of Pubmatic than in touch with what goes on internally or with his employees. The CTO has created a product full of bandaids that he is the only person that knows the answer to, and sadly if he went missing, the entire product would go with him.  HR could fix a lot of these issues, but she's in over her head.  Another example of someone who is learning as she goes making many mistakes, sweeping major HR issues under the rug and running to executives with things that she should be keeping private.

As PubMatic provides sophisticated and pioneering solutions, there are always plenty of opportunities to work with top clients, develop invaluable new skills and be involved in innovative new ideas and projects.","The company is growing at a staggering rate and so runs the risk of losing some of its character as it becomes more corporate.

The work is either intense and stressful (if you're on the big accounts) or tedious and boring (if on the smaller accounts).

Considering they basically robbed every single person of the money with the acquisition where they really did not negotiate in a good faith, they could have at least made people happy.

If you do research on your own YES programmatic is growing BUT there's not a lot of money in SSP.  PubMatic is no longer just a premium publisher partner they have more lower tier accounts in reality and a handful of actual premium publishers.

This may be the norm in this industry, but at Pubmatic, management expects everyone to be available 24-7 because most projects and deadlines are arbitrary and unplanned. Even when crazy deadlines are met and client projects are miraculously completed within unreasonable timeframes, there is little to no appreciation from management. Also, there's no vacation policy which is sold as ""unlimited vacation."" The reality is that vacation time is  discouraged."

369,PubMatic,Satisfied with the people and the work pressure. But lack of creativity and quality at work.,2011-10-30,4.0,Senior Web Developer,Good People and very friendly. Easy attitude and access to the senior management. Hard working team and a fun place to work. Lots of work and new projects coming to you throughout the year.,"Quality of work and creativity at work is minimum. Developer satisfaction is a concern, since the working process is very loose and un-professional. Vision is a concern with the company, since outside engineering the growth of the company is very limited."
