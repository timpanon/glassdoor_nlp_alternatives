2,Quantcast,Amazing Learning Experience,2022-03-15,5.0,Systems Engineer Intern,Quantcast offered me an amazing learning experience during my time there as a Systems Engineer Intern. I learned the ins and outs of how a big tech company works as well as have amazing mentors to guide my to be as successful as I can during my time there.,The only con was things were difficult being an intern during a pandemic and the support was a little lacking because of things having to be 100% virtual
3,Quantcast,A well established ad-tech company,2022-01-14,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,Tech is challenging. Friendly and multi national team. Lots of perks! Remote working and office both available.,Ad tech is hard to grasb. Getting promotion is also challenging.
4,Quantcast,Fading star,2021-12-26,2.0,Analyst,"Mostly friendly colleagues and are willing to share their knowledge
Some teams have great WLB, but client facing roles including client services and analytics aren't so lucky
Some great org level diversity and inclusion initiatives led by passionate employees.
Constantly playing catchup game with other industry players.","Extremely high employee turnover rate on all levels: ELT down to entry level. This should be a MAJOR red flag to anyone considering to join. The industry and the company is facing major challenges and uncertainty from larger players. A lot of HR are new (again red flag) and are clueless in retaining talent or understanding the market. The recent years have shifted many of the best employees out and new talent standards have gone down. 

If you do decide to join after considering all of the above, make sure you negotiate a signing bonus. The stock options offer is worthless (company valuation supposedly actually went down a couple years ago). TC (Total compensation) is below average as a result of this compared to other tech firms."

Love the monthly All-Hands from Konrad...very transparent and approachable CEO and some incredible new C-Level hires.

25,Quantcast,Quantcast helped me survive the pandemic!,2021-05-21,5.0,Technical Account Strategist,"Quantcast hired me when I was laid off at the beginning of pandemic. Coming from a different industry meant that I had to learn from scratch. My remote onboarding process was amazing from the first day. Training content is very well organized in WorkRamp & Confluence which means you can effectively self-train yourself. I was also working closely with my manager and my ""buddy"" to make sure I stayed on track. 

This company is full of people willing to help one another. I had numerous shadowing session with people from my department as well as Rev Ops, Sales, Account Management etc. The collaboration between teams is incredible! 

I wish this was my first job, it's a great stepping stone for your career. Quantcast invests heavily in ongoing training (powered by awesome marketing digital experts – U of. Digital). Training Opportunities are honestly amazing. If you are hungry to learn and able to understand technical concepts this is the place for you! As a TAS you should also be detailed oriented and well organized. This is not an easy job but everybody around is willing to help, so you never feel like you’re alone. This place is full of smart & nice people!

Minor point would be that Quantcast is growing so gradually going through some changes in org and the way it works. This can lead to some legacy solutions lacking ownership and ambiguity in decision making."

31,Quantcast,"A Toxic Cesspool of Lies, Fear, and Irreversible Damage - Stay Away!",2021-04-12,1.0,AdOps Associate,You could basically live at the office as work-life didn't exist.,"I was hesitant to write a review on this company, as the fear it made me feel every day truly followed me for years. I reported to a mentally unstable woman with a brain injury, which wouldn't have been a problem had she not lied to our overall managers and HR about the most insane things to keep the focus off the fact she was useless while making the rest of us work 15-hour days. She blew through employees like they were dandelion seeds. However, shortly after I left, I heard that her house of cards came tumbling down (not to mention she was married to three different guys across two years, claiming she was abused and would talk about her personal life as if any of us cared about her pathological lying). Completely unprofessional and uncomfortable. The Sales team was a revolving door of panicked, verbally-abused, blinded-by-lies folks who wanted to advance their careers but ended up blemishing their resumés with a blip because nothing they did could keep them off a PIP and ultimate boot. 
There was a definite ""in-crowd"" of old-timers that kept their heads down and their mouths shut, and after a few months it became clear why . . . pay was just decent enough to stay through the abuse and advancement became inevitable given the steady rate of attrition. 
The office environment felt like a mortuary. You could hear a pin drop, the somberness of everyone was palpable, and you were expected to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner at your desk or you were given dirty looks by either people who were just as miserable as you, or were trying to have ammunition in their back pocket to keep the light off of themselves. Typical work hours were 8 am-6 pm and even then, the first person to leave either snuck out pretending to go use the restroom so as to not be seen as ""that person"", or used a doctor's appointment as an excuse to leave at a normal time.

I would be remiss to say I don't still have nightmares every once in a while about this company. I wake up in a cold sweat, out of breath, and thankful that it was a nightmare and that I never have to step foot in there again."

We were selling prospecting campaigns when in reality, we were selling brand campaigns with some retargeting impressions snuck in that drove 99% of the conversions so clients were led to believe we drove a ton of results when that simply wasn’t true.

49,Quantcast,A great springboard to someplace else,2021-01-29,3.0,Account Executive,"As a lower-level employee, it's a great place to learn the industry and develop your skills to then finally, leverage your title to move vertically to another company. There are some amazing people at the lower levels of the company and one or two gems as you move up the company ladder, but sadly it gets worse as you move up the chain. 

Pre-COVID, the office had great catered lunches and all the snacks I could want, however that will most likely never return as budgets have contracted significantly.

My Advice if you don't want to read the rest: Get in, get paid, get out somewhere better. The stock options are worthless","The majority of problems at Quantcast come down to too little, too late. The company has been stagnant for years and will be left behind by better players in the space in a year or two. 

Product: 
Quantcast has consistently been 2-4 years behind key competitors (MediaMath, TTD, etc) in most regards. Leadership consistently makes poor decisions on what trends to hop on, typically opting to pass on things, and instead focus on our outdated managed service offering. A quick list of trends they have almost completely missed the boat on: Self-Serve, CTV/OTT, dCPM pricing, TRANSPARENCY, and Incrementality. 

They have recently released a self-serve platform that initially showed promise as it poised to be a cheaper alternative to incumbent platforms like TTD, but it's been mired in delays and positioning issues. At this point, it's not a cheaper solution to democratize programmatic advertising, but just another platform with similar pricing to TTD but lacking in many key features. Management moves the goalposts on what an 'Ideal Client"" looks like for self-serve, that the reps selling it never have time to build their prospecting books and start getting traction in the market. 

On the managed service side, the product works really well, but instead of delivering truly incredible performance, we charge triple industry standard margin and deliver average performance. Pricing on a flat CPM is awful in this case, as the company is incentivized to purchase gutter-tier inventory after getting a conversion to backfill guaranteed impressions and make the company more money. Every client should be asking for site delivery reports with EXACT impression counts, and audit them your self. 

Management:
The overall quality of management at QC is poor at best. Many sales managers don't know how to motivate their team beyond telling them to ""send more emails"" and micro-managing their activities in general. In the worst cases, some managers are wholly incompetent, having never taken the time to learn the product or industry, and at in other times, extremely shady. Certain managers will skew incrementality tests via incorrect methodology to ensure good results. 

Additionally, another issue is forecasting, and this issue goes all the way to the top. Each quarter we are asked to forecast our pipeline 3-6 months out. When the individual numbers don't add up to the company goal, they will force reps to lie on the forecast by putting estimated revenue against sales that has no chance of closing, then act surprised when the quota generated out of it isn't achieved."

Engineers come first and leadership tends not to care about the rest. Product people are valued, but everyone else is a third class citizen. I also witnessed nepotism in other departments as well; even Customer Success, Sales, and HR played major favorites. There is a TON of lip service and hypocrisy from leadership. CEO, Konrad, is smart, but is pretty far out of touch from his employees. Peter Day is a good CTO, but again, doesn't really appreciate even the most dedicated non-Engineers/Product people. I witnessed 3 rounds of layoffs during my time at Quantcast. Talented people (many of whom happened to be people from under-represented groups), with important skill sets and large contributions to the business were laid off, with complete disregard to the value they brought to the company - as long as they weren't Engineers, they were disposable.

72,Quantcast,Incredible culture - Not much growth,2020-06-27,4.0,Account Executive,"The usual tech company pros - Free Food, Health Insurance etc. 

The biggest pro being the culture though, it’s a buzz word now days but Quantcast’s culture is one of the best I’ve worked in. There are some great minds in the business and everyone is on the same page in terms of help and support, due to the smaller size it’s almost a small family atmosphere. It makes it easy to go into work everyday.

Very good leaders at low/middle management too.

Some good tech and innovation in terms of delivery in the industry. 

So much learning early on, you will also get involved in every part of the sales process from start to finish.","Although the business has been around since 2006, it’s still has a start up feel in some respects. Lots of manual requirements, learning on the fly and mass cross team collaboration always needed. I think the growth has stagnated a bit in the last 2-5 years. This also being reflected on the ability to move up professionally, less opportunity to move as the teams don’t tend to grow quickly and are quite small. If you have 3-5 years experience behind you already then you may get frustrated if you want to kick on.

The UK office tends to see prioritisation due to revenue distribution (understandable). However it means the Dublin office does tend to suffer a bit with late product updates and as shown in Covid, it was one of the first to be massively impacted with C-Level decisions."
73,Quantcast,"Decent place to work, but very little chance for progression",2020-06-22,3.0,Senior Ae,"Great working environment with supportive line and middle management. Majority of people are genuine and want everyone to succeed.

Good learning environment for new AE's, would recommend to BDR/Jr AE

Free Food and Snacks with a good work life balance

Support to try new tactic's if you can come up with a process.

Potential with a new product offering, if the pricing and use models are set correctly.

I really enjoyed working there for a long time.","There seems to be a disconnect between the US/UK Field and the rest of the markets. I understand that is where a lot of our business wins come from but many working in other markets feel they are second tier. This is evident in less tech capabilities in markets outside of US and UK. It makes the sale a lot more difficult.

There is virtually no possibilities of promotion into management, most AE roles will suit BDR/Junior AE level but I would nor recommend joining if you have a few years selling behind you. 

Poor handling of current Covid situation. First was a change in compensation structure, then pay cut's and then a cut in hours. This was coupled with un-realistic targets for the corresponding period, also there was very little factoring in the reduced hour's never mind the drop in client spending. Effectively in the business unit I was in, it was an accepted and acknowledged (by management) fact that no commission would be paid due to the format of the new compensation plan and unrealistic targets. (due to the current climate). This is not something I blame on the middle management directing our business but instead goes right to the top of management.

76,Quantcast,Short Term Job,2020-05-10,1.0,Account Executive,"Smart people in certain aspects of the company - free food.

Two stars for culture only because the reps I've met here are amazing.","Quantcast has been on a continual decline as other competitors continue to innovate (validated through Google trends). Their business model is extremely behind the times, price gouging clients for a “managed service”, and selling customers unnecessary packages stating that prospecting will find “net-new clients.” 

Outside of them being a revolving door for top tier sales talent, validated through the average tenure of account executives on LinkedIn, they continuously raise quota expectations quarter over quarter. Do you like working harder for the same amount (or less) money quarter over quarter? If so, this is the job for you.

Additionally, their sales process is screwed. Since the industry is in consolidation, the majority of accounts that are of value are in either in existing AE’s names or have an approved agency of record that you as a new AE can’t touch. This significantly hinders your ability to create “net-new” conversations, that by the way factor into your quota.

Also, if you're struggling to schedule pitches you’ll have your back seat “sales” managers waffle between two levers. Do more outbound (total volume), or be more tailored in your outreach. If overall outreach numbers decrease, which they track and hound through SFDC, they’ll inquire why. If you’re doing a bunch of activity, but not setting meetings, the inverse will apply, and they’ll scold you for lack of tailored outreach – overall a lose-lose. There are only a few managers I’ve seen that care for their employees and don’t “back-seat” sell are and the internal director only cares about topline revenue, not solid sales practices (never run an incrementality test here), misleading AE’s on promotions, and burning bridges with past long term employees.

All in all – take this job for an external promotion from an SMB rep or SDR, and for the first quarter’s guaranteed quota. Negotiate your salary, they pay 75-85k, don’t offer 401k match and offer diluted useless equity for a company that will never IPO. Look to leave after a year, year and a half - at that point they will have hiked your quota so high anyway, that you’ll be making less money than you were when you started."

Leading self-service DSPs like The Trade Desk, DV360, and others have taken significant marketshare and frankly, it's too late. We were probably the best in direct response, but that ""super power"" is quickly eroding with the shutdown of cookie-based targeting in Chrome 2 years from now.  No one wants to acknowledge that internally which is mind-blowing. 

The talent of Quantcast is on a noticeable decline. We no longer can recruit and retain the best talent. Most of the best talent has left or is in the process of leaving.  Big-ego legacy employees are left who are consistently underachieving and resting on their laurels, letting their ""reputations"" do the talking.  Someone should tell these people that just because you've been here for 4-5 years, doesn't mean you're special. The SF sales floor is a bunch of bros  (diversity and inclusion?) who should be told that being promoted to a manager role doesn't mean anything when you're hemorraghing talent left and right. You're the just ones left on the Titanic while the ship is taking on water. 

Politics, politics, politics. Countless leaders on the sales and AM side have been booted, some for good reasons. Others were killed for poor reasons or ELT settling vendettas. When you see good leaders punted because they took a stand for what was right, it shows you how  dysfunctional the company is. If you're a current leader in the commercial org, watch out. It can and statistically is probably going to happen you. Look up the number of commercial regimes since 2016. The average lifetime is 1-1.5 years? That's not adapting for the better.

82,Quantcast,Ready to take off again,2020-01-26,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Company Outlook: 
Quantcast enjoyed tremendous growth before 2016 but the growth plateaued in the last three years, much of it could be attributed to the changing digital ad tech landscape and the increasing lack of product-market fit. However, there is convincing evidence that our new suite of products is heading for a promising direction and we have a clear mission and a clear strategy to execute that mission. The entire product and engineering orgs have been working hard in 2019 and we are starting to see some results: our customers love our new beta product. 2020 will be an exciting time for Quantcast.

Personal Growth & Impact:
We have a fairly small engineering team for the size of the problem Quantcast is trying to solve. As an engineer, you will certainly have a large impact on the product and the company. Your peers also tend to be really smart and collaborative. 

Benefits:
Pay is quite competitive for engineering, especially after the pay bump in early 2019. Standard bay-area tech company snacks and catered lunch. Dinner reimbursement if work past 7. Pool table, ping-pong, arcade, game room, office yoga/meditation/subsidized massage. Really nice rooftop. Good work-life balance.","For any company that wants to shift product directions, there is likely pain during the transition. Much of the pain was felt in 2018 and 2019 as evident in other reviews. There is also the common risk of working in a pre-IPO private company: your stock options can worth millions if Quantcast can beat out competitions like TTD, or nothing if it fails to execute its mission."

I've observed time & time again isolated incidents where people are desperate to hit their goals in sales, product, etc. Instead of communicating pain points and working to solve these issues, people sometimes choose to either emote their stress & frustration onto others. Or, worst yet, don't give constructive direct feedback where needed. 

Quantcast needs to solve this problem and it starts with executive leadership in the way they treat their senior managers which trickles down to their managers then their direct reports. We can hold our people accountable & help our teams adapt to change in a positively constructive way.  It doesn't matter if we engineer or provide the best digital programmatic products & services for our customers. If we don't address the unneeded stress, Quantcast will continue to lose talented individuals who will get fed up with the struggle. I've seen it happen. People who are stretched thin don't need an excuse to leave. Recognize these people and reward their behavior. Don't push more onto them or ignore resourcing needs.

We are a company heading in a very exciting direction. Konrad & Peter Day are leading an initiative to make Quantcast top of class in their industry and it will happen."

-Really great audience insights and stories around data can be told.

-You are forced to source all your new business which can hone your outbound skillset.","-Chief People Officer, Chief Revenue Officer, Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Operating Officer all left in under one year and were never replaced - what does this tell you about an organizations structure and vision for the future?
-No demand generation. They laid off the entire marketing team who to be fair, did no work, and never replaced with a marketing team that generates leads.
-Clients can cancel contracts at any time due to factors out of your control such as performance or internal budget cuts.
-Lack of brand awareness.
-Too many people doing the jobs of 3 or 4 in what should be 1 and being overworked.
-Highly unrealistic quotas. For example, if you get a big RFP or a client tends to spend a certain amount per quarter, this will raise your quota whether or not a contract is signed.
-Terrible compensation plans. To be totally honest, very few people actually hit quota and you have no greater incentive to bring in more money quarter after quarter. For example, say your quota is $500k one quarter and $800k the next quarter. Say your target pay out is $15k/quarter. You would still need to hit 100% of that number to get the same total payout, despite the fact that you are bringing in significantly more money each quarter. It makes zero sense and accelerators are very flawed and only work if you hit over 100% of what is usually an impossible quota.
-The food is not very good most days. 
-Clients are never happy about a lack of click conversions. 
-Most of the top performers quit and the few that are left are actively interviewing for new roles despite what management believes. 
-CFO is totally over his head thinking he can understand what the sales team is going through and is not genuine."
92,Quantcast,"A good stepping stone, but get ready for the Sunday Scaries",2019-09-18,2.0,Account Manager,"Varying but good opportunities to grow your career, particularly if you start at an entry-level position and have the work ethic and chops to stand apart from the crowd. 

Incredible people, although many of the best are leaving. The urgency to backfill these positions is evident with the recent AE and AM backfill hires.

I had positive experiences with my direct managers and directors and could depend on them for support in my role. But when a company's trajectory shifts from becoming a unicorn to SOS, opportunities to get promoted are limited even if they advocate on your behalf.

There are decent perks (including catered food) and a work-life balance that gets out the door by 7 pm. But, this varies significantly by your team and is often sugar-coated by the many AMs that escaped their countless all-nighters working at agencies as digital media planners.

The occasional opportunity to be in a room with C-level execs that will inspire you with their life experiences and industry knowledge. 

There are decent diversity and inclusion programs that make an impact inside and outside of Quantcast, but there is much work to do to soften the ""Tech Bro"" culture that dominates the sales floor.","A product that provides little-to-no value paired with sales managers that encourage AEs/AMs to withhold key data that their clients expect. Quantcast's mission is to ""help brands grow in the AI era,"" which translates to Account Executives pushing their bread-and-butter display advertising product on any inexperienced marketer. 

Quantcast reporting over-inflates its impact. AMs are advised to cherry-pick data, restrict access to reports in the user dashboard, and ""curate"" site delivery reports that show where clients' ad revenue is being spent. A/B and incrementally test show little to no impact. It's hard to pitch a huge budget increase when you know, deep down, that your product is not delivering what your client wholeheartedly believes it is. But that isn't as hard as the day that your client catches on and starts asking the hard questions that you have been dreading to receive in your inbox since the day they signed on. Don't worry, your AE will scramble to sell through another deal. Rinse, repeat. 

Pair this with unrealistic sales goals, and it makes sense why Quantcast's attrition rate is so high in the sales and account management organizations that work most closely with its product. To give Quantcast credit, this isn't only an issue inside of their walls but is present in the AdTech industry as a whole. Hold off, keep looking, and seek out companies that offer a product that provides the value it promises. It's easier to sell something you believe in."

Every year there is a new reorg or beta team setup that they claim is going to fix all of the issues, but these reorgs are led by the same people who made the decisions before and therefore will never fix the fundamental problems. The field west sales team is the worst of it and the teams around them suffer because of their behavior. Management duplicates work several times over by creating Gdocs and various trackers because they are so incapable of using their own management tools.

Personally, I feel I've grown as a engineer in my time at Quantcast, directly through engagement with peers (smart people).

Challenging problems - web-scale advertising challenges - 3 billion request per second - 20PB processed a day - how can we do this better than everyone?

Great perks - all meals catered (rare for London), strong social culture (and budget for offsite activities) - Relaxed office culture - access to all the toys AWS has to offer.","Struggling to scale to the next level. Real reasons for this unknown, but from an engineering perspective it seems like we've had 2/3 years of high engineer turnover, particularly in middle level management. That, plus a few weak product decisions. 2018 has seen a big change in engineering and product leadership. Lets see what happens..."

- The impact, scope of problems and type of challenges you get exposed to are pretty unparalleled across the industry. You work on the same category of problems the top 1% at Google work on. 
- You have a lot of freedom to work on the problems you like, and engineering managers are asked to not assign people to projects they dislike, or won't make them grow
- Quantcast invests in engineer's growth. The management culture here is such that projects and services push people out of their comfort zone so they can learn. Company compensates for workshops, seminars and training material
- Work life balance is pretty great. Working from home is pretty common, and there's never pressure towards working over time.  
- Steady revenue; company has been profitable without raising capital since forever
- Quantcast is an ethical ad-tech company. We don't do the bad stuff the big names do.","- Compensation doesn't compete with the companies stealing talent from us (Google, Facebook, Uber, etc.)

Leadership is smart but doesn't seem to connect with or understand the problems at the ground level, leading to some pretty debilitating decisions. I also think our market position relative to big walled gardens and flexible DSP/DMP solutions is questionable at best. We keep trying to be bigger and bigger and bigger without getting any of the basics right (in fact those basics appear to be getting worse), thinking we can market our way out of a ditch when the market has no tailwinds for us to jump on.

- Free lunch and a fully stocked kitchen

- Phone reimbursement, commuter benefits","Leadership. A significant portion of the executives and managers we have in place lack the experience and empathy needed to be effective. They do not value the talent they have on their teams, are disrespectful when challenged or when recommendations are made that are not what they want and lack trust in the general population to get ""the job done"". The company has been in a constant flux for more than 2 years now and while change is necessary, the constant change weighs down employees' abilities to build concrete year-over-year strategies and anticipate the needs of the business. We are constantly in ""heads-down"" mode and rarely do we have the opportunity to come up for air before the next wave hits.

Unified culture. The company is 11 years old and just put company values in place. None of the values are centered around the value of its people (employees).

I.e. even if you are at the top tier of performers, you will NOT get promoted OR get a raise. As a result, many of these high performers end up leaving. 
- Company goals are constantly getting reworked. There is also no transparency into who is actually deciding what direction the company is going in. Projects that you'll start working on in the beginning of the year will get completely halted, and you'll have to pivot. This happens about 4-5x a year (and that's being generous).

Having come from much larger organisations, it's been great to see the company grow over this time. Given where the company is at in terms of it's long term strategy and potential IPO, there's obviously challenges along the way but in my experience, that comes with every company no matter the size.
Pros:
Culture - the Dublin culture is 2nd to none and has often been called out by the company as a model to follow. Everyday I get to work with extremely smart, ambitious people who are all pushing for the same goal - no politics here which is great
Product - for any working in advertising, digital or otherwise, you'll get the chance to work on a solution that really does provide value to our customers and compete with the likes of Facebook & Google.
Development - I've had the chance to personally develop both from a skills and career perspective here, and also see others on various teams progress into more senior roles, with some moving into management. I genuinely believe that the things you'll learn here are difficult to come by elsewhere and will stand to anyones long term career.
Benefits - all the standard benefits or working with a Dublin tech company are here, with a regular Friday beer cart always great to bring the teams together.","Like any company our size and aiming for significant growth and IPO, change is an inevitable part of the job.

Excellent relationships with clients and some agencies.

Nicely located offices around the world. Never in the dodgy outskirts, always in the centre near the media agencies and other tech companies.

A good technology base to build from.","1/ Terrible exec leadership.
CEO is struggling with the job, focusing on details and flying relentlessly for quick local fixes instead of looking at the big picture. The CEO hasn't built a vision of the company and has failed to define what Quantcast should stand for, leaving space for infighting within his team and flavor-of-the-moment company statements. Impossible to rally behind. Every major decision (hires, restructures, investments) has been bad.
SVP of engineering: promotes a very negative culture and no partnership with the Product team. A massive issue for a tech company. Suffocates innovation from junior team members and more senior alike if it doesn't go with what he is thinking. 
SVP of Product: very bright but not a product org leader. The quality of the product team and the lack of products (not features) is a testament of that. Needs to build products for the market and abandon the things that none wants.
CMO: chief of buzzwords and no action. A lot of talk, a lot of selfies, a change of colours and logos, shooting ambulances to build his brand, but what is the effect for Quantcast? Where are the positive business outcomes? 90% of his team has churned in less than 6 months. Staff giggles when he is talking at the all hands.

2/ Product not up to scratch
Advertising: Falling behind the competition in terms of results for clients, budget share, consideration and features. Failed to take the mobile turn.
Measurement: will struggle as Google Analytics ups its game and the DMPs become simpler. Will end up being a quick fix solution for small, spammy websites.
Data: the cornerstone of Quantcast's position is that it sees users hundred's of times of month. But according to the internal analysts, this is a lie. And more stringent privacy laws around the world + tracking blocks will put an end to this.

3/ Vision
Where is it?

4/ Spirit 
Most employees are looking around.
None challenges the leadership or senior management. 
Employees internally are making fun of the leadership and the company positioning (the recent shift to AI was perceived as a farce and is the subject of endless memes)"

171,Quantcast,"Looks slick from the outside, but chaotic and frustrating in reality",2018-02-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some nice people work here. 

The tech was exciting back in 2014. 

Free lunches. 

Everyone got a free Amazon Echo to distract us from the reality of the situation. 

Work life balance is good because most people no longer see the upside of overworking themselves when another restructure is on the horozon.","Redundancies & attrition - company performance is very poor, but to tackle this, they've decided to let a number of quality, experienced people go in all offices and departments. The brain drain at all levels and departments is severe. A lot of senior product, marketing, operations and engineering people have moved on and not been replaced.

Poor leadership - at all levels. From the CEO who has overseen every bad decision in recent years, to shockingly poor middle management. Management is only interested in managing up unfortunately. Very few people have been promoted from within and they are usually bad choices.

Salary and package is not competitive. The company does compete with Google/Facebook/LinkedIn for comparable roles. As a result, questionable hires are made as the truly great people go to those companies instead.

Game of Thrones (executive edition) - a fun game to play is to look at the leadership page on the UK site, and compare it to the leadership page on the US site. Oh look, there's a VP of Engineering on the UK site, but not the US site. That's another casualty in unending turnover in executive leadership. I love that they fire members of the leadership teams but forget to remove them from the international sites. There is constant turmoil at the top and this filters down in various manners of unpleasantness as the average workers deal with the fallout of yet another restructure initiated by a bruised ego.

Questionable positioning - oh hey, we're an ""AI"" company now. We were a programmatic/machine learning/RTB company over the past 10 years. Interesting that the new CMO shows up, throws his favourite marketing buzzwords into the mix and that's our direction now. Does no-one else see that the CMO is busier promoting himself instead of the company? A rebrand is the lowest of the low hanging fruit and an easy win for him.

Learning & Development - forget about it. There is nothing happening on that front. Unless you are very junior, you will learn nothing to add to your experience. All new experience and skills are hired externally. Be very careful about joining Quantcast as an experienced hire, unless you are excellent at political game playing. 

Stagnant product - has not been updated in many years. The market has passed the company by and QC has done nothing to address concerns around transparency, pricing, margins, brand safety and also nothing in adapting product suitability for the markets in which it is sold. This is worse in EMEA than in the US.

Promotion process - it's painful. Too many times, good people are passed over and instead they promote the unqualified person that was friends with a manager in their old company. It ends up in a cross departmental political shouting match where managers from one department shout down the promotion choices of another department. Absolutely infuriating.

Workflows and restructures - daily workflow is not clear and changes all the time. Entire departments have been in a constant state of re-organisation for years so the goalposts are constantly shifting. This is not a stable company.

Changing the company focus - the old products may as well be dead as the focus of the company is shifting to something else. That means all remaining resources are working on this new vision and all the existing products are likely to stagnate further."

The company has been losing people in the last two years. Instead of addressing the problem, it keeps using re-orgs as the excuse for the high employees turnover. 

Leadership
Each member of the leadership team is a parody of himself/herself: product who has not launched a single product in years, HR who is rude to the staff and loves gossiping, engineering who does not understand the technology, marketing who promotes only himself and talks in buzzwords.

Change is a constant. If you aren't changing (or growing) you are dead. Ad tech is ever evolving, changing, re-orging, etc. It's how you handle change that really matters and sets you apart as a true leader. 

QC is beyond terrible at communicating change management. Something that is extremely important for culture and the well being of employees. The lack of transparency is so disheartening.

During my time at Quantcast, I saw three reorgs that directly affected my role. This causes you to move laterally vs making steps to advance your career. 

Middle Management is laughable. They have no experience and are given no training to be successful in the role. If you are unlucky and have a manager who cares more about their personal agenda and advancement, you will soon be fired or blamed for any mistake that happens. Or they will just take credit for your work.

Finger pointing and blaming others happens constantly and is not looked to be a negative for managers. Instead of working together on a common goal, you will find the excuse ""that's not part of my responsibilities"", and then play the blame game on teammates all day long.

181,Quantcast,Toxic culture but some people like it,2017-11-01,1.0,Anonymous,They have free food and snacks,"- Top and middle management are ineffective and opaque to employees; they just want to feel good about themselves

- It's a wonder how they manage to get employees to trust in their vision. The company mission was not easy to visualize. Not many people seem to understand.

- As an engineer, it is unlikely that you will learn hottest skillsets of the time. Quantcast does some machine learning but it is not the AI powerhouse as some reviewers call it. Nor is it the best company to learn distributed systems. They say ""big data"" but it's not that hot (or hard) anymore.

- Because of the above, the breadth and depth of your skillset can vary depending on your team. Some people get in as very good engineers and leave as bad engineers. It's hard to translate the skills you use at Quantcast to those required by other companies, and even if you get lucky, it's even more difficult to be the most sought-after assets. If you want to do cool things, you must be at companies working on the hottest problems. If you want to build core skillsets, you must be at companies with a variety of learning opportunities. Quantcast is not the strongest in either one of those.

- Work is all politics. Engineers (especially ML engineers) do nothing interesting due to bottlenecks from office politics and favoritism by managers

- Some managers don't care about wellbeing of their subordinates. They want to feel powerful and that's why they stay. Some of them are new and are not trained well. Some of them don't have people skills. Some simply follow the books and don't know how to manage people. Good ones who care either become one of those bad ones, or leave early.

- Programmatic advertising (imho) passed its peak and hence almost no upward potential for your career from company growth. So don't expect to grow as the company scales; if you imagine Airbnb, the chances are you are wrong.

- Some products have rooms to improve and it's possible to do better. But no one wants to speak up because telling the truth will make people angry. The culture is set in such a way that any critical thinking on their product is not welcome. Flatter may not help the company, but it will help you.

- On the same line as above, if you still want to join, you must pretend problems don't exist so that the management, 30000 feet above the ground, wouldn't notice it. If you care too much, you won't do well at Quantcast. If managers can't feel good about themselves because you question them, they will blame you for everything that is or is not an issue.

- Every moment of post-mortem is a grilling session. For those who don't know what post-mortem is, it's a meeting in which people should go over any past issues (e.g. server failures). Some managers at Quantcast use it to blame engineers who work for other managers they don't get along with. Being good at blaming and embarrassing engineers is a must.

- Fraternity culture. Heavy drinking, heavy hangout. If you enjoy it, this can be an advantage. But remember that give or take exceptions, post-work drinking somewhat relates to your ""performance"" - it happens in many places and Quantcast doesn't look like an exception. You have to get in the right group otherwise your life can be hard. Well, same is true for many other companies. Quantcast is one of them that doesn't address the problem correctly.

- Favoritism is conspicuous. And it hurts. Won't get into much details here because it can feel serious. Just know that it can hurt your feelings and trigger you to leave. Enough said on this.

- The performance review is scheduled so that your politics is rewarded at least as much as results. Regardless of how much results you deliver, you will not be promoted unless managers approve your ""sphere of influence"". Easy to write down but implemented differently at every company. Quantcast seems to use this principle very politically and consequently wrong people get promoted while good people leave.

- The company celebrates meetings. More time is spent on meetings than doing work. There were a sizable number of people who start the conversation by ""let's schedule a meeting"", or ""let's meet to prepare for the standup"".  There were meetings, and pre-meetings, and meetings for meetings. And of course, how often you schedule meetings is one way to measure your influence.

- Meetings might look bad for engineers who need to focus, but since there's not much engineering to the product, selling (yes, selling) your product to non-engineers (e.g. ops, sales) takes higher priority. So if you like selling your product to people at your own company, this may not be that bad. Some people love it, and their perspectives should be respected as well.

- Middle management doesn't want to address issues in their technology in fear of exposing themselves to blame. It is possible to wonder if the management would rather have engineers sit around than do something. This is probably due to lack of trust in their culture.

- Couple of managers love to show off their power. These people have been at Quantcast for a very long time and contributed to building their culture. They can be really rude if they feel their authorities are challenged. If you can hurt your self-esteem by having your manager being extremely rude to you, make sure you get a good person to manage you. Some people (as in many other places in the world) go to work to simply ""feel powerful"".

- They don't pay well. They can tell candidates to take a paycut to work at Quantcast because everyone is getting paid less for ""amazing work"". You can guess how wonderful the work environment would be at a company that doesn't want to ""invest"" in you. Do extensive cost-benefit analysis on whether the ""awesome work"" at Quantcast is worth your paycut.

- Too many layers of management. Due to the intense office politics across the company and the kind of people it attracts, lots of engineers want to shift to management. The company promotes them to keep them, who are then coached by existing (toxic) managers."

The technology is very impressive and there is a lot to wow your customers. If you want to get into real time advertising, Quantcast is very advanced. However the strategy for growth renders the quality of the solution completely pointless. 

The sales methodology and sales training is excellent. If only the sales team and the managers put that into real practice instead of just repeating the keywords like parrots!","Quantcast has a bad track record when it comes to managing people. I had seen negative reviews before I joined, and I heard negative feedback from my personal network including recruiting agencies. The team I interviewed with for sales convinced me it would be just fine. Little did I know that it was going to be such a mess. 

Here's what I struggled with: 
- Don't get fooled by the titles! A sales manager is in reality an account executive in charge of new business.
- Inexperienced managers who have never worked outside of Ireland but need to cover areas like DACH, Southern Europe or Israel and have no clue 
- No territory policy : I ran a report in Salesforce which showed me that just before someone joins the company, the other AEs put the ""juicy"" accounts under their name and sit on them just by principle. 
- This means that new people are not allocated a fair and relevant patch, and are left with either cold accounts or accounts with no budget. 
- This also means that sales people are fighting for the same accounts and it fosters a culture of mistrust. 
- Managers refuse to discuss the territory issues and will beat you on the head about your quotas even though you have a dry patch. 
- If you join as an AE, you may eventually be promoted to senior AE, but after that it's limbo. Teams are too small to require more managers, and there is no career path to a field role. 

Since I left, the SDR programme seems to have been scrapped. some markets have been closed down and a large number of people in leadership roles have left (voluntarily or not). 

When it comes to people, everyone is smart and capable. But here's very little recognition from managers: they put more value on someone who's been in the company for 15 months than on someone who brings  more sales experience.  It's very difficult to change the way things are done, however hard the sales enablement team tries (and God knows they try and they're good). 

Cases of bullying are frequent. Usually brushed under the carpet. It's particularly true in the local offices in continental Europe. 

Commissions are not calculated on the amount of the deal you closed. They're calculated based on the budget invoiced to the customer and paid on a quarterly basis in the following quarter. EX: your Q1 commissions (Jan to March) will be paid in May. Bear that in mind. 

HR is a joke with no insight into what people do, no exit interview for terminated contracts, and an apparent disregard for churn. They seem to live under the delusion that there are hundreds of candidates queuing at the door."

Lack of support - understaffed and unapproachable HR teams and directors, very few actual policies, managers and team members that are too busy, scared or apathetic to help, new employees thrown in the deep end and it's sink or swim.

I had a great experience working here - the people are bright, young, driven, and kind. Additionally, there are great perks such as 3 free meals per day, weekly happy hours, and a great culture. The management team at Quantcast is of the highest quality - particularly with recent changes to top management and the new CFO, I have a lot a confidence in the future of Quantcast. I believe that the company has a great vision and is focusing on making the right changes to stay at the top of the industry. In true SF style, the work hours are very reasonable and work-life balance is a top priority.",There were some organizational changes at the company over the past year at all levels - this led to some confusion and decreases in morale on some teams
207,Quantcast,Good people in a good company,2017-05-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Quantcast's product is excellent and most certainly at the forefront of the ad-tech world. 

While standing at just over 900 people worldwide, the Dublin office in particular still has a great start-up vibe with small teams. 

You are surrounded by incredibly smart and driven people. Quantcast has attracted the people in the tech community who do not want to be another little cog in a big wheel. They have joined to make an impact, to be a part of something bigger. 

Due to the size of the org; you have the opp to have a lot of exposure to aspects of the business and the senior leaders themselves, that you typically wouldn't expect to have. 

Culture focused; everyone is very focused on keeping a great culture in Quantcast; from the infamous ""beer cart"" to monthly off-sites and new hire inductions, there is a big push on fun, inclusion and diversity.  We celebrate different cultures, ideas and thoughts and regularly push internal and external events to drive awareness of these. 

You're well looked after in terms of food, onsite perks, office off sites and nights out and the office itself is really nice. Work hard, play hard is exactly what happens here.","Typical challenges facing a pre-ipo company with a relatively flat org structure; a lot of self-managed teams, who work with a lot of responsibility on their shoulders.

A company/boat that was built on the foundation of being the best ever and an incredible experience. That all was true and was an amazing culture and company until the Titanic/Quantcast hit an iceberg in 2016. Since then the company has gone completely downhill with awful managers/captains that have no way of navigating the ship and will literally throw their employees overboard to survive and save their own face. 

This is the sad truth of what has become of a once amazing place to work. The problem doesn't even start with upper management, it ends there, but the real problem is middle management that have created an extremely unpleasant work environment and an extremely toxic overall culture.

Well-rounded internal employee feedback systems.
Fun and kind co-workers. 
Good perks. Compensated phone bill. 
Excellent core product. Quantcast has a different and effective prospecting product compared to competitors. 
Built for long term success.
Highly aspirational company that compares itself to Google and Facebook.","Poor, immature sales management. Success at Quantcast depends on your manager. If you have a strong, well-respected manager who has been with the company for years, they will fight for your promotions and compensation increases, manage up into sales leadership. If you have a weak manager, they will sell you down the river to save their job and you can forget about getting a promotion. I have been lied to multiple times by my manager. Promotion cycles are all about which manager can yell the loudest and beat their chests the hardest making ""calibration meetings"" nothing more than ego trips for sales managers trying to promote themselves. Poor managers are making employees leave in droves. There are unprofessional managers who have said/done things that they should be fired for and nothing was done. 

New executive sales management. The country club of ad sales executives arrived 6-9 months ago. Veteran group and well-connected in the ad world. But, the lack of knowledge they have about Quantcast is alarming. Some well-respected sales leaders have been pushed out.  

Re-orgs. Quantcast is obsessed with reorganizing their teams and pretending that nothing happened. 

Automates everything which ends up breaking things. Quantcast has a habit of trying to automate systems that are half-baked by its engineering teams. The result is a suboptimal internal product that ends up hurting the business. 

Sales training is a mixed bag."

- Highly aspirational (wants to become the next Google or Facebook)","- Quantcast is going through major growing pains, including multiple reorgs that have caused instability in the customer facing orgs driven by new sales leadership, who all come to Quantcast because they know someone. They, in turn, bring their friends to fill senior roles without having much context in the industry. 
- Products are constantly being released without being tested, causing tension between sales and product/engineering. 
- Everyone is more than willing to point the finger at another team when something is wrong, instead of working together to fix it.
- Mediocrity is rewarded, especially for folks who are highly political. Middle management is really young, and many managers have no interest in learning the products or in learning to manage. It's easy to get away with doing the bare minimum.
- Despite all of Quantcast's boasting about being the next Facebook or Google, our benefits don't even include 401k matching."
224,Quantcast,"Great place to work overall, mid-management could improve",2017-03-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall I've had a very positive experience at Quantcast. Compared to other companies I've worked for, the people here stand out as being especially smart, kind, and motivated to help the company succeed. Since arriving at QC, I've felt empowered as an individual contributor to notice a problem and take on a project to fix it. Personally, I've observed that taking initiative like this is applauded and generally rewarded. This certainly does not happen 100% of the time but it is much more common than at the two other tech companies I've worked for.","The main criticism I have is that there can be a lot of disorganization on high level initiatives that seems to stem from poor communication at the mid-manager level. It seems that managers on various teams do not talk to each other enough and there ends up being overlapping work or poor execution due to a misunderstanding of how another team operates. It's frustrating to find yourself in the middle of this and discover some work you were doing is not going to be used because the manager wasn't doing their job.

Another strong criticism is that there is no 401k matching at all. I like Quantcast but refusing to provide any 401k matching just isn't classy. As another reviewer pointed out, Quantcast cannot claim to be on par with companies like Facebook and Google without this."

My boss asked for feedback regarding how to make processes more efficient, but when I provided it my boss felt I was complaining. There is too much responsibility on the Customer Success Division since the reorganization. The Account Executive and Account Manager will not do their jobs or give you misinformation, but the Customer Success Specialist is blamed for their mistakes.

- sales product training role has been open for more than a year which is proof that the company doesn't invest in training and development. There are also no indications that the role will be back-filled anytime soon.
- lack of support and investments in non-core territories (non-UK). There is for example no trade marketing budget available for emerging markets - full stop.
- very weak middle management that prefers bullying tactics over open and constructive dialogue with the people that are in the trenches.
- zero strategy planning.
- slacker culture (specifically among middle managers).
- very bleak outlook when looking at a possible IPO (no headcount to grow the bottom-line, massive client churn, no self-service product...)

Tenure is short here and I've seen so many good people go. Due to the company's reorg the CSS role was created and the responsibilities are to carry out the 'behind the scenes' work around campaign build and setup.

There is a lot of dead weight in terms of teams, projects, and lousy people that should just be trimmed. The company has been hemorrhaging top engineering talent for a long time and it's only going to keep getting worse as teams are trying to do too much for the talent they have left.

Very old school and outdated management style from the way people are managed down to the metrics & expectations.  This begins with less than accurate expectations set through the interview process.  The culture in most offices is not a very lively one, and one where there is a ""head down"" attitude.  Management gets in their people's way by trying to take away individuality and promote a machine like ""one-size fits all"" environment.  Not enough internal promotion at the management level.  The pay is very much below industry & tech standards.  Engineering is the only department that is valued.  This company could and should be so much better, but management gets in their own way.

Quantcast reinforces this by investing a lot into employee happiness (happy hours, catered meals, corporate outings, team building, onboarding events, etc.) and upper management seems to genuinely care that everyone feels like they are a part of the team and helping to build something great. 

As an example, the CEO still takes time to personally talk to all new hires, which is crazy for a 800+ employee, global company. I met him quickly at a remote office and when I was visiting the corporate headquarters, he remembered me and stopped what he was doing to have a conversation with me in the hall.

261,Quantcast,Day to day can be great; organizational structure is severely lacking,2016-04-18,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free lunch and dinner - we just got a healthier caterer, so the food's now even higher-quality than it was before.

Teammates - depending on which team you're on, you can spend your entire day working with brilliant, friendly people.

The product - people at Quantcast joke that we all drank the Kool-Aid when we started, but we really do have an excellent product, and people at QC are genuinely excited about maintaining the quality of what we sell.

Collaboration - QC has very little in the way of office politics. There will always be some, but the vast majority of people here have no interest in manipulating or stabbing you in the back in order to get ahead. We're all working towards the same goal, and most people you interact with will be highly supportive of you.","The re-org - it's been mentioned in other reviews, but there was recently a re-org of the entire sales/client operations side of the business, and it's gone terribly. There's a lot of bitterness and a lot of attrition, particularly from top performers.

Attrition - in general, people stay at Quantcast an average of about two years, which means that we tend to cycle behaviors every two years as well, since nobody is around to remind us that we already tried something and either failed/didn't like it.

Middle management - having a good manager can make or break your career at Quantcast. If you have a good manager, they will look out for your career growth, advocate for you, and help you find your passions. If you have a bad manager, you will have no idea how you're doing until you hit annual review, at which point it will be too late for you to make any changes that can affect your chances of a promotion or raise.

Money - we're underpaid. The fact that we have catered food helps soften it, though.

Workload - we're trying to scale while keeping headcount low, which means that everybody is stretched thin while we figure out how to become more efficient. This will probably last a while."

Fun happy hours.","The engineering culture seemed reminiscent of the much debated culture of amazon, in which everyone down to the individual contributor level must take responsibility of development work, QA, hiring, product management, client support, requirement gathering, and prioritization of multiple projects. It felt like the engineers were stretched far too thin which in turn created not only bad products but large waves of attrition. 

Also, they seem to have difficulty with appropriate resource allocation, in that they assign people to projects that don't cater to their strengths or approve teams who insist on spending their work hours building and supporting crazy things outside the scope of adTech (think Atlassian products...).   The lack of organization between product, client support, and engineering made it very hard to get anything done here. I hope they have since or will change their methods."

CEO amongst other executives lead by example and are respected.

In general, it's a great place to work.","Lack of authority and accountability: 

We reward people that go beyond what's asked of them. We reward people for good, positive behavior, however, when it comes to people NOT doing their job, NOT doing what's asked or expected of them and NOT acting appropriately, there is a complete lack of consequences and accountability.

Example: Leadership asks the entire organization to use a tool to communicate. Only half the people use it and the rest disregard request with no repercussion or worry of authority. 

Lack of communication:

We under-communicate, both across departments and vertically. The channels to communicate aren't defined along as are the expectations as to who should be communicating. Everything, whether we added a new executive to the team, added a new feature to the product, or announced a major partnership is under-communicated from top to bottom and side to side.

Konrad and his senior management team are amazingly talented and caring people. I would not bet against them.","Be wary of the reviews you see here. They explicitly ask their employees to review them on Glassdoor so the reviews are likely biased. 

The culture of the sales team is exerting a stronger and stronger influence on the culture of the company as a whole. This may be a good thing or bad thing depending on where you sit.

You can hear a needle drop most days in the office and ""fun"" really isn't permitted. They love to pretend like everyone has fun, but as soon as you do it's seen as ""goofing off"".
The interview process was absurd - throughout they will compare themselves to Google and after a gauntlet of phone interviews, they will bring you in for a 4-6 hour day interview where you will meet with at least 4-6 different people. They will then five you a taxing ""homework assignment"" that they will expect you to complete by the next day (i.e. stay up all night after your current day job to complete). If they like you, they will then give you an exam of some kind and have you come back in to give a presentation.
Very little room to be yourself and have a personality. If you have weekly commitments outside of work, get ready to miss them. Your manager will complain to their bosses that you are not a ""team player"" and you'll most likely be reprimanded and/or fired."

The quality of the people who work here, professionally and personally, is one of the things that makes me look forward to going into work each day. The people are not just smart people, they're good people.

The technical challenges are considerable. There are a lot of tricky problems to solve here. This is very cool.

The management is clearly trying to build a long-running concern (not a pump-and-dump startup), with constant attention to continually improving how they do business. The management appears genuinely concerned about providing ongoing career growth (and rewarding it). This is a more ""grown-up"" start up than many: with much of the playfulness, but less of the actual insanity I've noted so much of elsewhere.

I love the catered lunch--not just for the nutritious, mostly yummy food, but for the easy opportunity to socialize with clever, funny, friendly people.","The growing population of employees means you may need to wait for the bathroom. ;)

The usual growing pains associated with a start-up, including hiccups when balancing cost-control and expansion, or when scaling organizational structures as the company grows. I do think we're mostly doing a good job here.

Sometimes the workload is a bit much (see: ""start-up""), but we are trying to hire....

There could be more transparency about the organizational structure. It can be hard to figure out what group works on what and where to find them.

We make money in marketing, which is less cool than making money in building solar panels or curing cancer."

There is no professional with other department. Sales, finance and CS team is a mess. There is no support with other department but mostly the blame game. There is a huge lack of corporate processes which should be consistence, effective, accuracy and timely. Everything is manual and pretty much broken. I was trained to email Sales and Finance and just wait for something to happen. It's a black-hole because I am constantly not meeting my client's request and target due to others delay action.

- Some teams have broad and undefined set of responsibilities. They lack focus. Makes working chaotic. 
- A few teams are over-worked and have high attrition rates. One of the ways management tries to solve this problem is by offering a monthly cash award which is rotated among members of all teams. It does very little to solve the underlying issues. 
- Considerable amont of technical debt. Management needs to address this concern. 
- Management does not do enough to gain feedback from employees. Non existent 1:1 meetings with managers. Not enough importance is given to career development.

2) I think people can be a little too focused on compensation as a reason to work and put in extra effort. That sounds naive, but in some places the internal reason might be 'wanting to change the world' etc but in the internet advertising space, that is just not going to be the case

There is a great sense of purpose and optimism at Quantcast to carry out the company's shared vision.

Our ops team is massively overworked and seems to burn out within 6 months and either quit or transfer, while other teams have great retention.
* some people do write massive hadoop jobs, but you might end up coding interface / workflow logic to interface with salesforce or an ad server.  This is neither interesting nor exciting.
* It's fair to say there are very exciting and interesting technologies being built inside quantcast, but the important question is if you will be working on them.
* though it varies by team, it's fair to say that managers take little interest in career development of employees.
* someone below claimed stock options are generous.  That's simply wrong.  Engineers hired now will get a stock option package that pays out roughly $120k after taxes per billion dollars earned in a liquidity event if fully vested.  Financially, you're probably better off going to Google.  Upper management also seems to massively overestimate the value of stock options and we've had a ton of turnover of people who made quantcast a worse company for leaving.
* most importantly... more than 1/2 the company has quit in the last 16 months since our previous employee photo.  Including the cto who is an amazing technologist.  Management rarely discusses this with employees and doesn't seem to care to retain people.  This is worst in the engineering department through true across the company.  To quantcast's credit, when engineers quit I was almost always really sad to see the person leave.  The majority were definitely not bad hires.  Plus,  with our internal hadoop variant there is an enormous learning curve for engineers and it really hurts when people who understand all the internal systems keep leaving.
* the only direct effort to increase retainment is by moving salary to bonus and not paying it out until late April so that if an employee leaves before then he or she effectively forfeits 10% of his or her salary for the previous year."

The company has retained its relatively flat structure, resulting in approachable management and timely decision-making process. The company has industry-leading technology and continues to grow its intellectual property portfolio.

Catered lunches and dinners are a definite plus.","Although a secondary factor in accepting a position with the company, salary and benefits are not as competitive as other companies/startups I have worked for. That said, I expect this to change as the company grows and becomes even more profitable. The recruiting team is solid but there is lack of HR presence."

The CEO is awesome.","Office space is a bit crowded. There's also not a lot of incentive to work really hard except for your personal satisfaction (which in my case is enough, but thought I'd put it out there). Interestingly, a lot of people stay long hours."
