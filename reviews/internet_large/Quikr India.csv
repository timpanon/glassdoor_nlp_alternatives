15,Quikr India,Terminated without any reason and justification to just save the notice period salary,2021-12-11,1.0,Zonal Sales Head,Before covid management was highly professional but not poorest i ever seen in quikr,"Hi All,
I am writing this email in response to the mail of termination I have received. 
While it is shocking such an action has been taken against me, what is even more shocking is the way it is been done. Importantly, I have not been given a proper reason for the termination. 
I am not accepting a termination from the organization for the below reasons and if not revoked and my employment reinstated, I will go to the courts to get justice to what I believe is an outright unfair treatment. 
No clear and definite reason for my termination has been given.
If there is any allegation against me, the same has neither been discussed with me nor have I been given any opportunity to express my side of the story. 
I have been with the organization for 6 plus with a track record of excellent performance working under different leadership including those who have been very senior in the organization. Never once have I been reprimanded or given any intimation of a less than acceptable behaviour ever from my end. 
In a sales management role managing multiple teams, I have always driven the team hard towards the goal to meet the objectives the organization sets from time to time. In all of these years of successfully managing a team, I have not had any formal complaint against me that has been brought to the notice of the Organization from anyone has worked with me in the present or past.
If the organization feels that I have committed something that is unacceptable, I expect the same to be discussed with me in a manner I feel there is an opportunity for me to explain my side. If a serious action like termination of services is done without a proper justification, I feel it is completely unfair and unjustified on the part of the organization. 
I have also written a mail on explanation for 11 points that I have raised. There is no answer from anyone from the organization for that email. 
In short, I expect the organization to look at this objectively, share with me the actual reason why such a decision has been made and an opportunity should be given in a proper forum for me to express my side of the story."

People who lead tech teams will have no idea about your work, don't even think of appreciations. 

Tech stack - They are still stuck into the world of java and not ready to experiment with anything new. 

You will never talk to the architects unless they are leading your team.

You must complete 45 working hours in a week, or regularisation requests go to your manager. They just want you to sit for 9 hours a day irrespective of work.

Company's location - It is located in a village behind manyata tech park. Although when they call you for interview they will say they are inside manyata.

Never trust your managers they are only who will do bad politics to make you getting kicked out from the company.
Field work can be extended to more than 12 hours..firstly they will call you up in the morning by 8 and then they expect you to leave after 9.
No personal space given to new employees by which if you don't start doing proper sales they will use abusive language and tell you to resign the job everyday.
They will hold your salary if you havnt completed your target and if taken a leave they will cut your salary without informing you.
There is no HR or Senior Person where you can complaint about any type to misbehavior of your manager.
No bike convenience will come even they had mentioned in the offer letter.
At last don't resign between a month if you do that then be ready your salary will never come.

Every one is encouraged to think out of the box, and think with big picture in mind. The level of detailing that goes in some products is deep, concise, and accurate; often they are not expressed just in JIRA but also in  DB schema and  pseudo-code.  Big O, Data Structure,  Elasticsearch, Redis, BigQuery, Rabbit MQ, Laravel, Zend, Angular, React, Node JS, Java Play Framework, API, Google Indexing  are not just buzzwords - developers actually code, and use these frameworks. 
The QA's tech sophistication is also high with QA being encouraged to even fix bugs. It is not uncommon for a technically qualified QA to indulge in lot of Java/Javascript coding, and get encouraged to code in some core modules! So startupsily open cultured!
 
This has a set of very friendly colleagues, and managers  (with a few ""Servant Leaders"" in the midst) who are very amiable, task -focused, and take ownership. This is one of the best places for both freshers and seniors to work as both get instant exposure to market (during the daily scrum briefings, and twice-a-week-release), and free to propose different stack or use the existing tech stack with guidance from other colleagues.
The culture that flows from the top oozes of  integrative mix of Razor focus + Flexibility, freedom, Taking Ownership, Risk Taking, Trust and a bit of chaos. 
At all levels there is hard-core task execution focus and at the same time fairness and how to... This is the best combination you can get at all levels : {Tough as nails leadership that challenge you from current thinking, but fair enough to set achievable deadlines},  {razor focus on priorities, but enough wisdom and flexibility to try out unknown unknowns}, {Demanding,  but fair with good level of trust, and one who is willing to go the extra mile for you}! You are open to disagree and propose a better plan of action and that is encouraged! One of the focus point now is speed with good design and coding. New Development Processes are being introduced, and enthusiastically (almost avariciously) accepted. The team is young and very open to new methods, and good in taking ownership.","There are not that many engineering processes, but this is being rapidly built, and adopted. 
At times new features get added and old gets deprioritized, but this is also changing with good predictable road-map being built.  
Sometimes with so many verticals under one umbrella, the coordination for task execution could prove challenging."

423,Quikr India,Just a jumping pad,2016-02-13,1.0,Senior User Experience Designer,"Pay is great, they will be able to match the highest in the industry for tech, product and design roles. Lots to learn if you are a fresher or have one year of experience.","Work is monotonous, and pretty much below par than what you would be expecting unless you are in top management. The mid management also complain of lack of power to execute things well. The CEO wants to see things implemented (no matter what)... the pressure is at the grass root level to implement software, stay up the nights and finish the job."
424,Quikr India,Poor vision and ethics,2016-02-09,1.0,Business Team,"Fast enviorment, scope of experimentation and lot of data to play with especially for tech, product and analytics role. Other roles are totally worthless here.",Most data/ analytics shown to outer world and investors is fake. Want ad is created as soon as someone posts an ad to bump up the numbers. Most of the data on Quikr's platform is junk.
425,Quikr India,Good pay however you may not want to stay for long,2016-02-08,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"1. They will pay you whatever you ask for. I think this is a great reason to join this company.
2. Since the environment is fast paced, you will learn more about the domain you are in.
3. You get to work in a startup :-)
4. The company has it's own campus.","I worked in the mobile application team for around 9 months. APMs and Testers drive the development which is sad.

The cons are as follows:

1. Everything is developed for web first, and not mobile adaptable. A lot of fixes are done on mobile app side which actually should be driven by API side. For example, I have never seen discounts being hard coded in Android code in any other company.
2. If you finish your work first, you will get more work.
3. If you are good at talking, you may get less work since you over-explain your small work at standup meetings.
4. Testing team is horrible. Only manual testing is done. Bugs are assigned randomly. There is no performance testing - memory testing - automated testing - these are unheard things for the testing team.
5. The mobile application end product is poor - it has a lot of stuff from users perspective which one user (in his lifetime) can never need (specially at a point of time). Creating different experiences for all the categories into one application is a really bad idea.
6. Product management team consists of one APM (overseen by a PM) who is usually a fresher or one year experienced. The APMs have the unpaired power to control a developer (on an average 5 year experience guy) and tell him what to do and by when should it be done. The overall architecture of the application is terrible.
7. The application as a whole has a lot of analytics built in - more than you ever need. Approximately five to six libraries go in for analytics.
8.  The design team (web designers) are heavily paid to portray themselves as  mobile app designers. 
9. There is a huge disparity in salary and job roles. A principle engineer does the same thing as software engineer. Additionally, a 8 year experience guy may be earning only as much (or less) than a 4 year experience guy... this causes the workplace to be a very jealous environment.
10. Exit Policies: On exiting the company - you do not get a relieving letter and last month salary. They claim to process this only after 45 days of you being relieved from the company. I have NEVER in my life seen a company that takes 45 days for giving a no due / relieving letter. On the contrary, if you join the company - you should produce the relieving letter of previous employer without fail within 7 days of joining!. I know a bunch of folks who exited the company and have never got their last month's hard earned salary and relieving letter."

428,Quikr India,No Job Guarantee!!,2015-12-29,1.0,Senior Executive,New structure!! New office.,"Hi 
I'm ex employee of quikr. I was hired for the role of senior executive I joined in on Dec 7-12-2015. For process real estate on the day one I was trained only for 1hr and later hours I was asked to bud with the company agents with any knowledge about the process. They are no proper trainers nor training managers people who are know for quality provide training for the new agents that you there is no proper training process. The environment is hopeless. People don't give respect to each other they act like dogs and pigs. Worst company which I have I have experienced in my life. I suggest people who are planning to join this company not think of also. Its is hopeless organization with no proper management. And also u don't have job security about your job whenever you are asked to you a have to leave without any notice.

If you are in the organisation... it's time to leave..
