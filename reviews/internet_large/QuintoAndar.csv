15,QuintoAndar,Great opportunity!,2018-12-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- WeÂ´re focused on doing something that the market has never seen, so that gives you the opportunity to think about different processes and ways to do your job - you wouldn't find that in just any company. 

- In here, the best idea is the one that we implement, so it doesn't matter you level or experience, if you have a great project and you prove that it'll solve one of our problems, you'll be able to structure it and see it happening

- You'll have the opportunity to think. We don't do stuff only because it's cool, we have a mindset of solving big problems, and in my experience that made me a lot more racional and structured when I think about new tasks or projects 

- We care about our people and you'll see it daily. More than partners, I have friends in here and that makes work something nice. I come here with a big smile knowing that I'll make a difference on someone elses day.","- For sure, we still have a long way to structure our processes, we are learning and iterating every single day - and sometimes I have a feeling that we could plan a bit more 

- Everything happens very fast, so if you're used to slow processes you'll probably find it hard to addapt - things change within hours and that demands a positive vision of change from our teams :) 

- We still have a lot of problems to solve! And obviously we cannot attack all of them at once... So you have to be patient and aquire the mindset of solving what's biggest and have the biggest impact 

Despite the fact the we have a lot to improve, that only makes us more motivated to keep on going and thinking things in a way most companies woundn't :)"

+ Challenging. We are the first company to offer an end to end rental experience, and there is no one we can copy or benchmark in most of what we do. You have to be good, and you have to work hard if you want to succeed.
+ Brutal transparency. Everyone is surprisingly honest and give feedback about everyone else's work and about what's happening at the company. Radical candor is an everyday reality.","- This is a fast paced environment. DO NOT COME if what you want is an organized structure, a stable career plan and just sitting on your desk from 9 to 5."
