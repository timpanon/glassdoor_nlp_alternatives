76,Rakuten,"1 Year Later, Stayed Away",2018-09-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Catered breakfast, lunch, and dinner delivery. Corporate communications tries hard to create family events, speaker series, fun activities. There are talented people who unfortunately have their efforts squandered by bureaucracy. If you are a Rakuten-lifer this company is for you. If you want to hide and not do work, you can do that too. If you want to grow and have headhunters call you because you are valuable, this is not for you.","I can't say it better than ""Black Hole for your career"" with 160+ helpful clicks. It's apparent which voices are real and which are manufactured by HR.  After leaving Rakuten, I found the discontent and nonsense I had to deal with everyday was actually abnormal in the Bay Area. I'm happy I left, and I am cheering on employees voicing their opinions and making moves to leave. 

While no one is forcing you to be mistreated or to accept low market pay as other reviews say, no one is also yanking you out when all the negatives put you down in spirit and energy, causing you to care less and less about your career. 

- Lack of mentorship with HR being enforcement only: I wish I could say there are mentors and counselors like the other large startups have adopted, but you're on your own to navigate politics, bureaucracy, and constant reorganizations until the only people left are politicians and administrators. Don't try to voice your real opinion, because that will just roll up to management who want to avoid conflict and not solve issues.

- There is a sense of distrust between Japanese and American employees. One is there to run the show, and the rest of us just work there and have little say. This was the case in my frequent conference calls and Powerpoints back and forth. Department leaders did not want to take risks, and we are blamed for the lack of results from budget meetings.

- Archaic and cookie cutter promotion and evaluation system. When you are told by HR during orientation that getting a 3/5 is ""pretty good"" and you are doing your job, it makes you wonder how low the standards are.

- Alarming how many people leave but no one says anything and pretends that person was never here. So many from HR, recruiting, sales, IT have left because we're dealing with new names each time. I know a handful of employees who never made it past 4 months. At least the market forgives after reading the Glassdoor.

- Lack of diversity and women in leadership. This may have changed but when I was there, women were not represented at the C-level or at all among the dozens of companies Rakuten owned

- Too many managers and overhead and not enough individual contributors or people who did the real work. I never saw college graduates ever

- Confusion about working hours and working from home: Is the work day 9 to 5 or is it 9 to 6. Different policies about working from home across various companies, to know what the real rule is. 

- Watching video recordings during morning meetings. It's more engaging if it was live. To Americans, it seems like 1984. Get with the times."

The CEO is fantastic. He's approachable, honest,  consistent and charismatic 

There's upward mobility and an open door policy for any c-level executive. Having access to the c-suite at any time for mentoring is priceless and plentiful. I'm using c-suite as a figure of speech. The floor plans are flat and open and in any of our offices you'll be sitting right next to CEO, COO, CFO, etc 

You can go to business school and still not pay for the level of mentoring you'll receive just by sitting and having lunch with one of the execs","Sales and account management hires are often straight out of college or have limited work experience. This places a generous burden on colleagues and team leaders to train for the basics. 

The company's direction changes often and swiftly due to acquisitions. What was once an affiliate marketing company then became an omni company, having acquired Search, Display, metrics (measured success), social media marketing and AI.  The industry is ever-changing and thus the company must pivot to remain fresh and relevant but often the directives are murky and the support staff (HR, legal, finance, tech and operations) are not well equipped to support the new initiatives due to lack of lead-in time or resources"

Leadership isn't very receptive to feedback and communication is oftentimes poor. There's miscommunication between Japan and US that obstructs business progress in the Americas. Things can change very fast, simply based off of a unilateral decision-making process. 

Employees have no drive and motivation to work hard, because the company is lacking in strong leadership to provide employees with a cohesive vision to fight for. People come in late and leave early all the time. 

I would recommend anybody looking into joining Rakuten to steer clear unless they want their career to fall into a black hole, at least until leadership changes."

81,Rakuten,Management,2018-08-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The Rakuten of today is an amazing growth opportunity that allows talented, creative and career minded professionals the opportunity to grow and flourish. 

One of the top five e-commerce companies in the world, it's US headquarters is based in San Mateo - a nice middle point in the Valley between San Jose and San Francisco.

Once was a somewhat scattered collection of several seperate e-commerce companies, there is a new Rakuten One strategy being implemented globally - including re-branding and building synergies across all companies - whether its Viber (the WhatsAp of EMEA ), consumer e-commerce sites, financial tech, e-commerce data services, Rakuten Coin, AI, travel, fashion, Lyft (we have a piece of that market too), e-books, mobile...too many e-commerce growth opportunities to name.

Rakuten is also making acquisitions (three since I've been here - just less than a year).

It's a great environment for someone who wants to learn how to scale businesses, create and solidify customer offerings, build and unite businesses, and grow.

If your talented, you will be recognized and move to the top of the line.

This is truly an global company with worldwide opportunities.  Rakuten is a $12 billion plus high growth company - there are only a few companies if the Valley at Rakuten's size with Rakuten's global growth opportunities.","The Rakuten One strategy is not for everyone.  Some employees of acquired companies wish to keep their old ways, resist change, dig in.  Hence natural conflict takes a high degree of collaboration to resolve.

As a company born in Japan, Rakuten has certain cultural ways that are not for everyone (or new the the Valley).  Some employees make fun of our weekly all hands (conducted globally), our inspirational comments from the CEO and other founders, the respect and care for our workplace, and our willingness to help non-performing employees a chance to hang-on a little longer and try to improve rather than your too typical Valley company  cut and run approach.

The Rakuten One strategy also means changes - reorganizations, consolidations, new training programs, new ways of recruiting, common ways of paying and measuring performance.  Change is sometimes difficult for some people.  And some people are afraid they will be passed by with this movement.

Our co-workers from Japan are sometimes slow to adapt to Valley/US tech norms, and often break the rules with side bars conversations in Japanese (where an English speaking/writing company).  This makes some people uncomfortable, especially those with less experience working in culturally diverse environments.

Transparent and far-reaching communication is in it's just beginning stage (as before individual companies did not uniformly share information or opportunities between themselves)."

Management is hired/placed without true consideration into their ability to manage and cultural fit so bad management trickles down to everyone below, causing a lot of frustration and disappointment. Rakuten really underpays compared to the SF market, which equals to low quality hires (if you're looking for more money than you're making currently, don't go here). Because of the low quality hires or difficulty in hiring, they keep transferring people from Japan or Europe to run the US office.

93,Rakuten,Rakuten (Credit card and Financial Division),2018-06-27,1.0,Software Engineer,"These are the pros:
1) No need to have management or technical skill to be executive or manager. 
2) If you are hired in Japan and assigned to US as 100% of managers here in Crimson House West, you have additional benefits:
- They rent luxurious house in popular places like Redhood city
- They pay your car loan. Believe me, they can sell the car and get the money if they are assigned to return to Japan
- In Japan, HR do not verify your credentials like if you really have Scrum Certification.
- Managers do not need to care if the project will fail because you will never get fired and you can always blame your team. It is because they only care to meet the schedule. If the project is wrong or the tasks are unrealistic, it is not manager fault since their bosses know that they do not have technical or business skills. The faults are always the team members. So you are 100% safe if you are from Japan.","You will not be promoted if you are MBA from good schools or competent engineer . I will explain why. (MBA means graduated in administrative courses)
1) The projects are mostly technically wrong. If you try to correct, you will be bullied by the managers. It is because, you will show to the president that the project is wrong and impact in all the US management. So if you try to correct, you will be excluded from the team. 
2) Since the project is wrong and it will fail, the MBA and engineer will be blamed. So no way to escape. 
3) MBA must approve all the wrong decisions because all the legacy of current problems are caused by the actual managers and leaders and they want to hide from the president. 
4) Again, employees with MBA will be blamed. And you have to confirm that it was your idea and you were incapable to find the problems.
5) The managers are bullies because it is the only way to make to respect them (by fear). In case you don't do what they tell you to do: a) If you was assigned from Japan, probably you will be assigned back to Japan and never again assigned to US again. b) If you are US employee, you will be fired or invited to leave very quick. After you leave the company, all the current problems will be assigned to you. It is how they survives and hides the problem. So they are always hiring new employees.
6) Evaluations. they evaluate your performance in 1 to 7 scale. Here is the problem, you work very hard to try to meet impossible goal and of course you will fail in something like deadline. They will give you 1, no matter how many times you worked until late or at home. 
7) Only way to be promoted is to enter in their circle. It means you have to support them and act like them. If you can't be like them, you will probably be target to their bullying and get fired, blamed,.... Therefore, competent people does not fit under their management.

Unfortunately, Rakuten manager profile are:
- bad education background or education not related to the business like graduation in education, philosophy , music school, ex-pilot( yes pilot)
- Dubious credentials. When they were employed in Rakuten (5 years ago). HR did not check the authenticity of their credentials. E.g. They will believe in you if you tell in the interview that you are graduated in Harvard or have Scrum Master certification.
- Not ethical and honest
- They do not hesitate in blame someone for their faults.

Ps.: Japan Rakuten Card is worst. They are the source of current management in Card US. It means the source of issue may be in Japan side.

 
 Those problem explains the high turnover of very good employees and also why US employees have low salary.
It also explain why the president thinks the US employees are lazy. But, I don't know if the president does not know it. ( If he knows, then. something is very wrong)"

During my time there, I barely interacted with any of the senior-leadership. They visited only once and don't really care about you.

106,Rakuten,Never Again,2017-12-27,1.0,,The benefits are pretty good. Their dress code is pretty casual which is really nice.,"This is one of the most inflexible jobs I've ever had. I worked there for less than a year, went on lunch less than 10 times because I was always overloaded. The one time I did go out to lunch, I was bombarded with phone calls from my boss demanding that I come back ASAP. I literally had to sprint back to take care of some BS request she gave me 0 notice on. 
The people here are EXTREMELY cliquey. Like, Mean Girls cliquey. Like, they actually wanted to dress up as the Mean Girls Clique for the Halloween office party. People barely talk to eachother in the break room because it's not the type of office environment where you get to know your colleagues. Your team makes zero effort at bonding outside of the office. 
For the time I worked there, they offered ZERO training. None. Nada. After four months, I had to reach out to HR and actually ask them if they could take time out of THEIR schedules to explain to us what it is all the sectors of our company do. No, your crappy online training doesn't count. Give us hands on experience and let us learn about it instead of a click-through presentation that HR put together with a voiceover. 
They tell you that you can build your own position and pave your own path, but it's the most bogus thing I have ever heard. I would avoid them at all cost and look elsewhere. The people there are not going to be your friends, you will hardly ever get out of the office, you'll work long hours and weekends, your management team doesn't care about you and aside from the ""Happy Hour"" where everybody stands in their little cliques, you won't get much entertainment out of the office. 
When I was considering relocating, they said it was not available. They did this for myself and another person in the office. Then they turned around and offered it to others on our teams. They also say that working from home is not an option, but it is a job that LITERALLY half of the staff does from home. It's BS. Don't tell us that we can't work from home when half of our managers and colleagues do on a daily basis. If you're going to offer the flexibility to some, you need to offer it to all."

-- There is a mandatory company all-hands EVERY monday morning at 9:00am. It has been told to all of us that this meeting is more important than an emergency trip visit. You must attend or else you will get shamed and a talking to by the ""loose zoo animals""/HR.
--There is absolutely no future for your career if you are female in this company
--HR loves to involve legal in every decision. In fact the top two people in Rakuten HR will often consult them to go to the bathroom. They are ATTACHED at the hip. STEER CLEAR

Therefore, little upward mobility can be expected when yourboss has no idea what you've been working on or what improvements you've made unless you shout it from the top of your lungs. 
VERY little focus on supporting departments. Unless you're on the client services team, don't expect to get included in any company events, such as Symposium or Off-site. Events like this should be open to more teams to build trust and equality between the departments - and not to mention help educate us on the industry itself.

121,Rakuten,"Great Place To Work, Could Be Better",2017-04-30,4.0,Member Service Representative,"Aside from the catered meals and benefits you'll see listed in other reviews, it genuinely is a nice place to work. People are always very friendly and things tend to go smoothly everyday until Quarter 4 hits, but even then things are manageable and stress levels are almost nonexistent.","Before I get into  these I want to clarify something: Based on the reviews I'm reading San Francisco and Beloit are two VERY different places. San Franciso is the corporate end of the company, and Beloit is the Member Services end, where work seems more laid back and life is easy going so long as you do what is expected of you.

Moving on, there are some legitimate concerns I have working here. One of which is how critical I see some people be of others' mistakes. The best thing to do when you see someone make one is to let them know so they don't do it again and then life goes on. However, when you work here you can get in trouble for doing that. If you have an issue with someone or you believe they should be doing something differently, you are supposed to report it to their supervisor. That's understandable. However, sometimes this feedback is not passed along, and the situation remains unchanged. 

Then, some people tend to think that the person they work with just isn't fit for the job in some ways, and in some scenarios I've seen it cause them to be somewhat ostracized, all because some feedback isn't reported. 

Another issue is between Tier 1 and Tier 2 representatives. Basically, if an issue with a member can't be handled by a Tier 1 rep, they are supposed to send it to Tier 2 which has their own process of handling member inquiries. The issue arises when Tier 2 submits feedback to Tier 1 saying that they could have technically handled it themselves, or they were missing some information before escalating the ticket to them. Feedback is all fine and good, but I've seen some Tier 2 reps be far too critical of certain mistakes. And then there comes a point when most Tier 2 reps will stop submitting feedback because it doesn't reach the Tier 1 rep or the rep keeps making the same mistakes with no recourse or reprimand. On the other side of the coin,  Tier 1 has this sort of an deep-seeded animosity for Tier 2 because of how critical they can be over small things that leads them to ignore even valid and constructive feedback that could save them some hair-pulling during Quality Reviews. It's hard to get into it without going into heavy details, but the gist of it is that Tier 1 and Tier 2 are like two siblings arguing and poking one another in the back of the car while Management is driving the car, unaware of it all.

Despite these things, it's still a great place to work and we all tend to get along unless you get involved with stupid, petty office drama. I've been there, and I can say it's best to just avoid it as much as possible. Nothing but grief comes from it. Gossip is gossip, but don't get personally involved with anything or it could cost you or others their jobs."

The environment at Ebates is very relaxing, welcoming, and friendly. The office has an open floor plan, which makes it easy to build rapport with your supervisors and people of higher authority.

125,Rakuten,Pave your own path!,2017-04-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I wanted to jump online and add a quick/brief review of my experience at Rakuten Marketing. I have worked for the company for over 4 years, and have been able to guide my career in the direction that best benefits me. The company has always been done a great job of supporting people who deliver and its great to be able to use that to your advantage!

I browsed through a few of the reviews prior to deciding to post, and would like to make a point about sealing your own fate. Many of the people who have left the company, were simply not the right fit (based on my experience in the SLC office). They lacked the drive to learn and believed that their prior experience was superior enough to get them through. Ad Tech is a fast, evolving industry and to keep up, you have to be on top of your game. The review titled 'Good Riddance' came from a prior Sales Representative who struggled within the industry, and the company. Due to this, he had a bad experience with other knowledgable employees who tried to guide him in what they believed was a better direction.  (Note* I work in a department that does not interact with Sales, so my opinion is neutral).

The company has great benefits, and supports you when you need flexibility. You'll often be fed, taken out and flown about to events both nationally and internationally.

My advice  - If you are a person who is naturally driven, likes a challenge and can be trusted to exceed the goals you are set, then this company will work great for you. If you thrive in an environment where you need guidance and the stability of a slow industry then perhaps it is not for you.","There are growing pains! Rakuten Marketing consists of 5 or 6 Ad Tech companies, all with different offerings. Anytime you try to merge like this, it will be a bumpy path.

Salary bumps are beginning to slow down due to growth of company and some under performing employees

Communication needs to improve between ALL offices."

Ton of layoffs and also heard bunch of sales guys left. No opportunity. No differentiation in the market."
134,Rakuten,Good Riddance,2017-04-03,1.0,Sales,"I've never worked with a greater group of coworkers. Many have turned into some of my best friends. 
Benefits (especially health insurance) are phenomenal 
Monday breakfasts, Wednesday & Friday lunches
Nice office location","God grief, where do I start? Extremely top heavy organization with TONS of churn (employees and clients). Here are a few of the top reasons you won't want to touch this company with a 10 foot stick, especially if you're in sales. 

1. Rakuten Marketing (RM) has the worst client attrition of any company I've ever worked for. You'll be told that it's more a product of the industry or the way you're selling your deals (sales is always blamed) but rarely will you hear upper management, or the Customer Success/Optimization teams take responsibility for the amount of clients they lose. Be prepared to work 6 months to close a deal, another 3 months to launch the campaign, another 60 days after it launches to actually get paid...only to have the client give you the middle finger and leave for a competitor just as you're commission starts building.

2. Speaking of compensation, the new comp plan released this year (yep, it changes annually) requires a PHD to understand. When RM has to purchase a 3rd party Salesforce software to calculate your commissions and how you're pacing on your quota, and that software ends up not being able to actually work with all the contingencies and exceptions written into the plan, its a good sign the plan is designed to fail. This is the third compensation plan I've had since starting at RM, every single plan has taken money out of my pocket or made it more difficult to make money. 

3. Furthermore, comp plans at RM are just pipe dreams and everyone knows it. OTE's and ""realistic earnings"" at RM are just fancy dreams thrown around that don't actually carry any weight. You'll need to take them with a grain of salt and understand they are BEST CASE SCENARIO. Unfortunately, the norm at RM is WORST CASE SCENARIO. This CS rep drops the ball here, that media buyer drives margins into the ground there, this client doesn't believe our reporting, that client can't get tags installed, on and on and on. The amount of variables that play into your pay AFTER you do your job selling a deal is mind boggling and straight up crippling to your earning potential.

4. Perhaps the most insulting part of your experience at RM will be the mysterious ""law"" that upper management and HR cooked up that requires you to clock in/out. On top of this cumbersome and insulting policy will be the instability in pay period hours, salary check amounts, pay dates, HR systems, etc. Your salary should be the most stable part of your job, a set amount of money paid out on a set group of dates to cover very fixed personal expenses. When your employer starts messing with this as often and in such frustrating ways as RM, it causes serious issues (finance issues, morale issues, etc). You will, for all intents and purposes, be an hourly employee at RM. Chances are you'll feel the same way as I did: I worked too hard and accomplished too much in my career for my company to levy such a petty and disrespectful policy simply because upper management doesn't trust the sales team. 

5. Between how independently and selfishly each department operates, and with how many companies RM has acquired, you'll find RM employees to be extremely uncooperative outside of the immediate department they work in. To the point where it was impossible to complete mundane tasks without facing immense and stifling opposition. It has been the greatest mystery of my professional career that personalities as angry, impatient, selfish, greedy, hostile, unfriendly, antagonistic, and intimidating actually exist and thrive in RM's culture (mostly on the Media Buying, Ad-ops, and CS team). I can't count the amount of times I was belittled, disrespected, or blacklisted by an entire team if I came across as new, needy, inexperienced, or if I sold a deal that wasn't do-it-in-your-sleep easy to fulfill. And I was a top performer, imagine how the struggling AE's are treated. Most of the companies I've worked for reprimanded these personalities and in many cases let them go. At RM, they're rewarded and promoted. 

6. Putting personalities aside, you'll find very few clients who actually feel like the level of service, knowledge, and skill from their client team is up to par. Each team has their own metrics they care about, and aligning those metrics with the client’s expectations isn’t a thought that seems to cross anyone’s mind at RM. As a sales person, if you care at all about your commission or saving face with your clients you'll have to essentially manage every part of the post-sales process (which isn't actually in your job description). From Account Managers playing video games during client kick-off calls to Media Buyers straight up forgetting to launch campaigns and using questionable (read: dishonest) buying methods, it’s considered just plain stupid on the sales team to not manage every step of every process of every one of your clients, even far beyond where the sales job should be (and technically is by a job description) finished. 

7. Last but certainly not least, it is common knowledge and a shared sentiment among the sales team that upper management does not have your back. In fact, the relationship sales has with most departments/teams at RM and especially upper management is contentious at best. Its a hostile environment when sales' budget rolls up to a GM who seems to be bent on ridding his company of any decent sales talent."
135,Rakuten,SF Tech's Best Kept Secret,2017-03-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Coworkers are really nice and approachable people. The management treats everyone with a very high level of respect.

136,Rakuten,Wonderful Coworkers - Awful Management,2017-03-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I've worked at Rakuten Marketing for about 3 years and I stayed so long because of my coworkers. These people are some of the best in the industry - also really awesome people. The company also provides decent benefits and snacks every day. Drinkshare happy hour every Thursday.,"Management is terrible. They do not care about the people actually doing the day-to-day hard work. The pay is well below market value. Don't expect to get a promotion or raise even when you deserve it because the company is trying to cut costs. Lower level employees are hourly at very low base salaries, but are eligible for overtime. Don't expect overtime without a fight."

138,Rakuten,Member Service Representative,2017-03-08,2.0,Member Service Representative,"It's a great company as far as the growth coming up, but it's slow coming. There are free lunches and snacks during your shift and good benefits such as healthcare and 401(k). The culture is very laid back and you are trusted to your job without micromanagement.","While the culture is to not be micromanaged, some of the supervisors tend to micromanage and try to take control of more than what's needed. I feel like if you are ""buddies"" with the director, you basically get away with anything and you tend to get handed more projects/opportunities because of this. 

Bringing up issues with your supervisor tend to be overlooked a lot. Nothing ever seems to get resolved as far as a better incentive program or making the employees feel more valued/respected. 

The system they have as far as quota is jacked because some supervisors put agents on projects which can make their numbers higher or they have another agent helping with training (making your numbers lower) yet you're expected to still make the same exact quota as an agent who had been working without interruptions their entire shift. They say it's been taken into consideration but it's not because you still get it reported without notes in your QR."

Should be in politics!,"Tell employees they're entitled to a bonus then  make up an excuse to not give it. All the other warehouses have perks, this one does not. Give you a vacation and sick days and take them back. Make employees clean the bldg. And bathrooms. Safety issues. If you're great at brown nosing , they will keep you over people that actually work. High turnaround. Lots of nepotism. Good luck with getting a raise or anything your entitled to. Talk to the group like children while reminding everyone continuously they are replaceable and should be lucky to be there! All of this while making you work 6 days a week to barely make 40 hrs. If they don't like you they will nitpick until you quit.  They can't keep anyone there . They truly don't care! What a waste of time."

Rakuten has some excellent people working for them at the entry and middle level. Senior staff is also very smart and hard working.

New technology and ideas are always around, so there's plenty to learn about and work on. The office is conveniently located and also offers a pretty good view. There's also free lunches once a week year-round, and daily lunches during the Q4 Holidays. Happy hours come often and revolves around drinking (there's even a dedicated Ebates beer pong table), and it's fun to socialize after work hours.","Leadership is an all boys club. Little to no direction from directors and managers, but projects still get done because of the people working under them. Managers with inflated egos go around throwing fits to get their way, instead of an informed team making the decisions. Some managers don't even know how to manage. 
Project sharing between and within teams do not exist, leading to confusion, lack of cohesion, and lower quality work. Other problems that plague projects are: discussions and brainstorming are nonexistent, feedback from adjacent teams do not exist, managers with just a checklist and no knowledge of the project, and deadlines are not reasonable. The deadlines are either randomly set or due to some business obligation. Projects that should be taking months to produce something top notch are expected to be completed within half the time. The product? Shortcuts are taken, people work long hours, and releases are buggy. 
Best of all, despite the company being highly profitable with a very good outlook, many good people never reap the benefits. No promotions from within and salary negotiations aren't fair. It's very easy to see that upper management doesn't care about the culture."

Good work life balance. We have our peaks(like most places), but there's no expectation of year round crunch. You get out of this company as much as you put into it, if you really know how to own something and make it happen, you can do it here, with support all along the way. 

Funding isn't an issue here. Having worked for startups it's nice not worrying about my next paychecks. Our revenue is growing significantly YoY, and we're owned by Rakuten(think of them like the Amazon of Japan)","Rakuten really really likes older business models, and feels better about older IT policies. We had gmail and google apps implemented and it worked all the time. Going back to Outlook is a serious downgrade and has caused some problems in our ability to do our job. The IT team is great, the software they have to support? Not so much. 

Intranet and having to VPN in hasn't impacted my department yet, but there is even more concern around that. That way of working is outdated and unreliable.

The Japanese influence is there and both interesting and entertaining. The company as a whole has potential.,"This is where it all starts. Buy.com rebranded to Rakuten.com back in early 2013. Until mid 2014, issues regarding the rebranding still existed. Both consumers and businesses are not open to the change or the name. How does this translate to the work environment? More stress for everyone. Numbers that go up and down. Small teams that desperately need more people are unable to handle the influx of merchant demand. Sales has a harder time pitching. A number of top management left (albeit not due to issues but for their own personal reasons). This left more aggressive, and now-focused (as opposed to future focused) management in place.

Good benefits including some paid lunches each week and you cant forget the In-and-Out truck every month!  Don’t expect to coast but if you work hard, they will treat you well and Rakuten is a great company to have on your resume as they continue to make acquisitions and grow and you might even get to visit Japan since they send employees to Rakuten Japan to learn how things are done at the parent company.",Company has been going through a transition from Buy.com to Rakuten.com which included a pretty heavy change over in terms of the business model and philosophy.

Good learning opportunity. In my time there, I was able to learn a lot about how ecommerce sites operate, including managing manufacturer and merchant partnerships.
Decent perks. Company used to provide lunch everyday, and then it became twice a week (not sure what it is anymore). They would also have an In N Out truck that came out once a month, which was nice.
Nice people. For the most part, people are nice and genuine.","Lack of/Bad Direction. The CEO of the parent company, HIroshi Mikitani, is busy running a global company, of which Buy.com is a very small part. He seems to determine major strategy decisions based on a couple of his ""liaisons"" stationed in the company. Being on the front lines, there seemed to be a disconnect between ""Mickey's"" decisions and the actual US Market (Yes, Mr. MIkitani actually prefers to be addressed as ""Mickey"")
Weird culture. The company is a mix of OC culture (pretty fair on work/life balance) and Japanese culture (late hours, put in your face-time, don't leave til your boss leaves, etc). It partially depends on which group you're in.
Business is tough. Buy.com doesn't have much a differentiation from Amazon (1st party business) and eBay (marketplace business), and they definitely don't do either as well as the other guys. It's a difficult market to compete in.
Lots of turnover. Plenty of people moving on to greener pastures. If you stick around long enough, and have some talent/skill, you got a good chance of progressing. There's some politicking involved, but probably not more than the average company of similar size."

226,Rakuten,I love working here,2012-12-18,4.0,Marketing,"It seems that reviews on Linkshare are sparse- so I will try to be very thorough. I very much enjoy working at Linkshare. First of all, the company as whole tries very hard to be positive, to keep employee morale up, and to foster a fun environment to work. We have group outings (paid for by the company), karaoke nights, tons of office parties, and many have been known to break open a bottle of wine in the office on Fridays. It's seriously a fun place. 

If fun isn't your thing- Linkshare also has great people. You end up working with some of the nicest, friendliest folks you can imagine. They love to work but they don't foster annoying competitiveness, and they never put each other down. I can say its truly a team environment. My bosses are very understanding- they allow us to talk to them about any concerns we might have, they ask us about our career path, how they can help us grow, and always keep their ends of the bargain. We are often able to work from home, we get tons of vacation time, we get to go home on time most days (of course every job has busy seasons), and on the whole, I'd say work-life balance is a huge priority. I feel at home here. 

Another plus- at Linkshare, you can pretty much build your own job. If you decide you want to do something, and you pitch it to management, they will likely tell you to go for it. They will pay you to do it, and they'll support you along the way (as long as its actually something the company does of course). I know several people here who came up with great ideas, and now head up their own departments. Of course, they put in their time at the company (this didnt happen for them in one year) but they are definitely benefiting.","On the downside, there are some drawbacks. It's hard to grow at Linkshare if you have certain types of jobs. The company will often hire people from outside rather than promoting from within, which can be frustrating. I have seen people promoted from within, but I have also seen them hire from outside. I know company employees get very frustrated about that.

Another downside is the holiday schedule. Linkshare's busiest time of year is the holiday season- so don't expect to be ""off"" for christmas. Even though you are technically not in the office, your client can and will call you at any given time. That would be another hard thing about working at LInkshare. The point of our job is to please our clients, and its often difficult. Clients can be demanding (in any job) and they aren't very nice. I do feel defended by my bosses, but sometimes you just get caught in the line of fire. On those days, its hard to work here.

Another downside- it seems that there arent too many company-wide standards at linkshare. All departments run differently, so some departments may be benefiting in ways that others aren't. For example, in my department working from home is frowned upon. In other departments, employees work from home 3-4 days per week. It's really all dependant on your supervisor and his/her style. But it can be frustrating to watch others enjoy these perks, while you're not able to."

The pressure is on to do more with less.  Not too sure if new remote control management from Japan is capable of measuring up to the task they've been assigned.  They want to grow our company into the equivalent of Amazon... which while a nice goal is going to be harder than hard.  We'll see what happens."

It is the hardworking employees who are lower on the totem pole who make the company successful.  The extremely high turnover rate creates extra work for everyone and this all stems from the uncaring person at the top.
232,Rakuten,Change doesn't have to be painful,2012-05-16,3.0,,"eCommerce experience for your resume
Get to work with some good people
Informal work atmosphere
Company is located in a nice area of California","A lot of pressure and unrealistic expectations (goals, work hours, tasks, etc.) put on employees
Reputation amongst consumers is diminishing compared to competitors
Inability from management to guide and bring employees together under the parent company's (Rakuten) vision
Compensation and benefits are far less aggressive compared to competitors"
233,Rakuten,My how things have changed,2012-05-15,2.0,Marketing Specialist,"Fun, young coworkers
Fast paced, agile company
Learn Ecommerce","Employees not valued
Lack of direction
Lack of leadership and inexperience shows"
234,Rakuten,This is an environment where everything is reactive and not proactive. The technology is just slapped together haphazard,2012-05-15,3.0,,"Decent salary, casual dress, holiday parties are fun. Company is open about it's internal workings and finances. That is about it.",Very long hours. Projects and deployments could go for days straight with no breaks. Every project seems to need daily reocurring meetings. Very little vacation time and few sick days.  Management are clueless and suckups to upper management.
235,Rakuten,"Great work environment, great people to work with, and lots of opportunities for career growth",2012-01-19,4.0,Account Manager,"Dynamic work environment with lots of great, well rounded people",Benefits packages could improve a bit
236,Rakuten,Good experience to see how each department works together in building a strong outcome for customers.,2011-03-10,3.0,Client Development Manager,Working with many others outside your own department give you an understanding of how and what they do to give greater transparency.,I found it to be o the poorer side of how management treat their staff. This includes the infiltration of the parent company Rakuten and their pawns that run the show. If you're a Sales Executive and specifically going to be located in the NY office I strongly recommend you are able to handle being shouted at and talked about behind your back. This happens across the floor where everyone can see and hear.
237,Rakuten,"Challenging, good learning, lot of executive churn",2011-02-11,3.0,Director,"Fast paced (learn more here in 1 yr than at other places in 2-3 yrs)
Lot of transparency (weekly all company meeting w updates from all areas)
Metrics oriented approach","""C"" level team not really ""C"" level - they dont have executive authority or ability. Puts lot of stress on middle mgmt and individual contributors"
238,Rakuten,It's great,2010-10-21,5.0,,"dynamic, lots of responsiblity, strong parent company","lots of work, competition with other companies is fierce"
239,Rakuten,Awkward Senior Management,2010-05-11,2.0,,"A great working atmosphere between colleagues.  Morale is low, but the politics between workers is minimal.  Fast paced environment, with good cross-team support.",Senior management is not confident.  No trust of middle management or workforce.  Productivity metrics are invasive and hamper productivity.  Sales commission structure is a disincentive.  Cost cutting to the extreme makes morale bad and it is getting worse.
