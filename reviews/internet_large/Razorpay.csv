15,Razorpay,Employee care is a huge concern.,2022-02-26,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Chilled out work environment, decent pay, free lunch","I feel many folks here have been quite difficult to deal with and got a ""I don't care"", "" I am too important to respond to you or get back to you "" attitude.  I don't think many of them are""people's person""  or at least they don't believe in being kind and respectful with all of their colleagues. That's the biggest con I have experienced here. It's actually a trend here. Some people think they are way too important and got very less regard for others. HR department in particular is very painful to deal with. They seem to hate dealing with the employees. I thought that's what they get paid for but maybe I am wrong. Also, it will take you forever to get responses from Finance team. 

I don't feel secure here at all . Most of the people are in their own bubble and if you are too honest and say things that could potentially hurt their ego, you are in trouble. Razorpay may be doing well overall but there are aspects where they are quite backward imo. Employee care is definitely not a priority. It may seem ironical as there are benefits like free lunch, free food etc but it is what it is. Free food is not our priority.  Not mine at least."

4. Appraisals are for name sake they say they do restructuring according to market standard but even in promotion they give standard hikes.
5. You will be responsible for 1 or max 2 feature in a year because of there hierarchy taking all the time in discussion. And they believe in hot fix rather than permanent one taking all your time in on-calls.
6. They will ask you to understand each and every product in the company. For them company product is equals your career growth. They can pick this reason for giving you low hike.

84,Razorpay,I'm highly satisfied joining Razorpay,2021-09-03,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Before I go on to pros, let me give a brief overview. I used to work in a highly reputed MNC, and I was skeptical on joining a startup. But that's one of the best decisions I've made in my career. And the decision couldn't have been better choosing Razorpay.
1. They care for their employees. They host regular stress management/employee engagement/therapy sessions. So if you're stressed at work, they'll make sure to reduce it through fun online events (since office is closed due to covid).

2. They give you exactly that kinda work, that you love to do. I'm an ambitious millennial who's driven by work. I left my last job, simply because there wasn't enough work and the work that I used to do didn't excite me. It's not the case here. I absolutely love the work that I do. There are challenging complex problems I get to solve daily. It satisfies my zeal. So if you're a passionate coder like me, there are enough problems for you to keep your hunger satisfied. 

3. So now, about your learning curve. My manager not only wants to get the work done for the team, but wants me to keep on growing my knowledge. The company pushes everyone to do new courses, get certifications and so on. People who work here are one of the smartest people in the industry, so you learn a lot from your peers. And also, the work you do is on a broad spectrum, hence there's huge knowledge gain there.

4. The culture is amazing. People are super helpful... I've joined during covid times, hence not sure about office, but the management does what's needed to keep you entertained. We have gaming competitions, antaksharis, and so on... before every townhall, we have small concerts... In short, you're never bored.","There's Yin and Yan in everything, but in my tenure, I've not faced any cons... If I do face anything down the line, I'll make sure to comeback and update."

118,Razorpay,Becoming worst startup to work for,2021-04-28,1.0,Software Engineer,"- Friendly environment 
- Freedom to introduce new tech into the stack if you have enough knowledge about new 
- Politics doesn’t stay here for long
- Actions will be taken on management if they are not upto mark","- IT support staff is worse, they act like they are helping but they are not helping by any mean. Issues will be pending for months without any action.
- Lot of developers left in last 6 months and there are 10-20 orphan projects, nobody is taking care of those. Some random engineer will be assigned without any knowledge 
- No QA folks will be assigned, developers get asked to do QA, devops work and ends up in wasting 2-3 days for nothing. There is no new learning happening here.
- Beta environment is terrible and highly unstable, everyone in the team is aware of the issue but no one is taking from senior level engineers. It was asked in Tech all Hands on video call. Even CEO is not aligned with this ask, he upfront asked developers to take care of that job. He is ok with developers wasting their 2-3 days on QA work even if tech work is 1 day job. 
- HR will promise you while joining, that ESOPs will be allocated on day1. But ESOPs will not be granted on day 1. Management will wait for at least for 7-8 months. Problem is that, funding in that 7-8 period is not gonna help your money grow. This looks like cheap strategic work.
- In last 6 months 8 full timers & 1 contractor left and joined 5 contractors. This is degrading the quality of the company by big margin.
- 13 inch MacBook to developers and 15 inch to designers. Don’t understand why you can’t give 15” MacBook to developers when there is a ask."

Overall good engineering prowess within the company.

CTO has a great vision and is inspiring to work for.

Good hiring process, with which they're able to hire genuinely good talent.","The bias/preference and power the older engineering employees hold is very difficult to deal with. They act as if they're doing a favor by speaking to you and act as if their word is the gospel.

In general, management also turns a blind eye or in fact promotes this kind of behavior in the teams.

Overall, their ability to scale engineering hinges on an inclusive environment for new employees, and I feel they are not doing a good job around that."

4) We've esops portal but no option to exercise vested esops. Can only see details.
5) Growth is slow unlike in small startup. Opportunities of growth are slowed down because quality projects which can demonstrate your skills are not available all the time. So, you grow here with how fast is the tide in your team.
6) Tired of parking space issues. Have to pay and park in forum sometimes.
7) People don't use Slack responsibly. They keep tagging all day without knowing relevant POC.

There are some people in the company who have been here for some time and now they have done their part. They just come to office to pass time and take free salary.

People are unfriendly here. Most people who have been here from quite some time are not approachable. There are some people in the company who are always rude to you.

I am working with this company and I feel like moving on quickly from here because of the work culture issues, HR is highly untrained and only listen to favourite people which wants to remain in the company. Lot of core team member issues. Boss want his member to lick his shoes. He himself comes with unstable background and do not wish to continue in the longer run with this company. He knows nothing about industry and a poor leader.  Seen here only employees staying for more than a year who knows buttering well and believe me they only have sustained."

215,Razorpay,Great work culture,2018-02-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"• Culture!
• Open and Transparent: Barriers between teams are almost non-existent. Everyone in the company can be a part of any discussion all across the company.
• Work anytime, from anywhere.
• Everything is questioned and can be questioned by anyone. Everyone get's a say.
• Decisions are made in more of a democratic way. The management takes inputs from the team (at times even pushes the team to get involved) in almost all sort of decisions.
• A great office. A number of events (parties, outings etc) throughout the year. HR team really does take care of the team.","Not much to write here, just that employees have a limited choice of devices to pick from."
