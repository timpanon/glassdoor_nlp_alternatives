44,RentPath,Great place to begin but not to grow,2021-05-11,3.0,Anonymous Employee,RentPath offers good benefits and a lot of autonomy/work-life balance. There are a lot of really smart employees and it can be a fun environment to work in. They are willing to hire people without much experience so it can be a really great place to begin a career.,"They don't have much structure for onboarding so it can be overwhelming to be a new hire but if you are motivated to work independently and figure things out, you can learn a great deal. Leadership is hit or miss. Some are great but then there are the leaders who create a pretty toxic environment by being unprofessional, playing favorites or being political in their work-related decisions. Most of the leadership is stuck in their ways and micromanage and don't really welcome or implement feedback. They also don't really give raises or promote from within. Anyone I knew that sought growth in the form of a promotion or a raise ended up being turned down internally so they found an elevated role with higher pay elsewhere. Hopefully some of this will change now that we have become a part of Redfin."

78,RentPath,Great Company,2021-03-01,5.0,Sales Business Development Manager,I have nothing but great things to say about working for RentPath for the last two years. I have been encouraged to continue my growth and been given all the tools I need to succeed.,Rentpath went through a difficult 2020 with Covid and a purchase attempt blocked by the FTC but we seemed to have come out of it all better then ever and are on a great path in 2021
79,RentPath,Great Prospect; Needs Work,2021-02-28,4.0,Member of Product Team,"Speaking from my team: everyone (including the managers) is very genuine; no (intentional) toxicity, no ""tech bros"", and people are passionate about building good, right and inclusive products.
Fairly paid, good vacation policy & benefits.","The company has been through some turbulence over the past few years and the entire industry is generally not ""cool"", hence there were some difficulties attracting the most experienced AND skilled employees (many people here are smart or domain experts, but I'm speaking of people those excel in both), and this creates a bit vicious cycle. Hopefully this can be resolved with recent organizational change and we can get someone that is interested in help building a team."
80,RentPath,Great company to work for overall.,2021-02-27,5.0,SEO Manager,"I came from an agency background, and the positive change in work-life balance was a huge eye opener for me.

85,RentPath,Lots of Independence for Employees,2021-02-25,4.0,Senior Product Manager,"RentPath is a very non-hierarchical company where employees are empowered to make decisions and think strategically in their roles. This has given me ample opportunity to experiment and grow. The management style in my department is very supportive, and typically takes a coaching approach that promotes learning and development. This is the type of environment where I personally thrive. Employees are trusted to use their judgment and do their jobs appropriately.","Decentralized decision making is great as an individual employee, but it also means that different parts of the company are sometimes marching in different directions. Any kind of cross-functional project requires a lot of evangelizing at all levels, even if leadership is aligned. It can also be difficult to get work prioritized with other teams, and the process for doing is often unclear."
86,RentPath,Expect great things,2021-02-24,5.0,Director,New CEO Dhiren Fonseca is moving Rentpath forward in an amazing direction. Good Salary. Good Benefits. Ability and Encouragement to Innovate,2020 was a challenging year of change but nothing was really about 2020!

119,RentPath,A company run into the ground by incompetent leadership,2020-02-04,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,My coworkers are so wonderful.,"Since we are now going through Chapter 11 bankruptcy, now is a good time for anyone silly enough to buy the remains of this company to go back and read all the previous reviews that were dismissed by most as disgruntled employees. If I sound angry, I AM. This company is filled with hard workers that are having their livelihoods placed in jeopardy because RentPath and it’s investors have refused to get with the times. Our current situation is a culmination of a company that has repeatedly refused to learn the lessons right in front of them because of their own arrogance. Executive leaders that are offended when you have the gall to say hi to them in the hallway. The absolute nerve of you to walk with your nose in the air as your incompetence destroys a company  we the employees have worked hard to maintain throughout your terrible decisions. The open racism and refusal to diversify. Lack of communication and clear focus. RentPath is a living example of what happens when employees are not valued. I hope an MBA program somewhere does a case study on us and shows how bad management destroys companies. There is a MAJOR disconnect between management and employees, which is why nobody is surprised at our current situation. This is a company that has refused to innovate and move forward, and it has ALWAYS been this way. Fire everyone at the top and start over, but you won’t because RentPath is an arrogant company that has never valued the opinions of anyone below C level. CoStar is eating our lunch for one reason only: they value their employees. You allowed a startup with less than a TENTH of our resources to enter the multi family space and dominate us. If you’re an investor looking to buy us out, you have much work to do. The  culture needs a hard reboot. Start with the lowest employees, walk around and feel the embarrassment of a company where the majority of all minorities are segregated to ONE area. The greatest companies recognize the success in DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT.  If you’re an investor pay attention. If you’re a potential employee RUN. Current employees hit the Helpful button if you agree so that people reading these reviews won’t be fooled by the multitudes of fake reviews created."

Excellent co-workers","I felt that it was a toxic environment (the Portland, OR location). Constantly made me feel replaceable. The management is very reactive, and not really proactive. Whenever the software we use would fail (and it did a lot) it made for so much extra work with only bandaid solutions — which is why it happened a lot. The chain of command was far too centralized and made it much worse when managers weren’t available to put out fires. The job itself was far too easy. A lot of the content managers always say “we don’t write content, we just copy and paste it.” If you’re trying to use this job as a stepping stone to actually get into the digital media industry, don’t. The experience does not transfer well and very few people who have left the company had an easy time getting a new position elsewhere. I say this because if I had seen a review like this before I accepted a position here, I would’ve saved myself a lot of tears and lost time."

143,RentPath,An Easy Job but Beware,2019-05-17,1.0,Sales Executive,"Work from home. 
This core product is simple and easy to sell. 
Great paid time off. 
You can kind of run your day on your schedule.
The people (prospects/clients) in the field are amazing. 
Did I say this is an easy Sales Job?","In my opinion: 

You have to play crazy Politics. 

They will tell you can make 6 figures + in your interview. It’s a stretch. Unless the stars align. There are a lot of variables out of your control including who your direct supervisor favors. 

They don’t tell you how you get paid until you are out in the field. 

You are constantly behind in commission opportunity due to clients canceling due to things like low performance. This is out of your control. 

DSM’s are all over the place. 
One day it’s okay to be 2nd best in the market and the next day it’s tragedy that you didn’t sign a prospect because the prospect said you are well-known for low performance. 

You may be asked to spin the truth about the performance of their services. 

Seems like upper management is grasping at straws to move the company forward. 

One month they will allow you do certain things like give away free upgrades to sign clients. The next month there will be a company wide stop on this. The next month your boss will offer it again. 

They will tell you in your interview that you can give away cool swag to your prospects and clients. It’s basically pens and notepads. 

Use caution of joining small and medium markets.

My advice before joining is do your research and due diligence."

Poor managers with BAD or NO simply get traded from team to team while other managers have to re-apply and prove themselves.

He has little respect for sales,  and is combative with any feedback or suggestions that do not align with his beliefs.   There is obvious favoritism at play; the dysfunctional politics going on at every level is embarrassing.  There is a blind-spot as it relates to the current state of the product, and the company's response is to completely ignore it, and in turn repeat the same one-liners over and over.

171,RentPath,Losing valuable employees due to mismanagement.,2018-09-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"While at RentPath, I had the opportunity to work with some truly amazing individuals. I made lifelong friendships and business connections. The office is centrally located and parking/commuting options were great. My department was fine, but not great.","The sheer amount of drama, subterfuge, and deceit is amazing. I had many colleagues file HR complaints against their director -- nothing happened. Their department was full of angst and agitation simply because the supervisor was unpredictable and left unchecked for so long. This person did not treat their team with respect, but rather ruled the department with fear. They gave minimal direction and expected perfection, even after repeatedly changing directives under too-tight timelines. Unreasonable expectations all around. Sometimes this person would sign off on something, only to berate their employees when someone else expressed criticism. It was a wholly unpleasant experience even working with this person from another department. So many talented people have been driven out, let go, or simply left without anything to fall back on because the environment is so toxic."
172,RentPath,On the wrong path,2018-09-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great coworkers. Centrally located in Buckhead with direct access to Marta. Lots of opportunities to volunteer in the community (employees are provided with 3 volunteer days per year),"Sales:
Lack of support for sales employees. Sales employees are vital to this organization and are highly undervalued. Frequent changes to the commission/compensation plans make it less favorable for anyone in a sales role. 

Corporate office:
Low morale in the corporate office due to many layoffs and micromanagement. Ineffective performance review competencies. Merit increases were very late and not well communicated. Outdated PTO policies make it hard to take time off and use all available hours in a year (ETO does not roll over). Employee benefits and technology programs are extremely lacking for a digital company. No options for telecommuting except for IT department."
173,RentPath,Sales Executive,2018-09-10,3.0,Sales Executive,You can make good money.,You are threatened with your job consistently.
174,RentPath,Management Plays Favorites and The Blame Game,2018-08-22,2.0,,"The co-workers I had the priveledge to work with there. Outside of the management levels and a few people who were hired in the vein of being clones of management, the people I had the privilege to work with there are by far some of the smartest and most ambitious people I have met to this day. They were a joy to work with.","Where to start? There are so many things. 
On the work environment - You sit in an open environment, approximately 2 feet from your neighbor.
The floors are loud and there are never enough conference rooms for meetings. This would be tolerable if they actually allowed telecommuting days or some other way to escape the noise, however, they like to waffle back and forth on these as well. 

Speaking of things that your manager will more than likely waffle on:
The leadership teams are horrible at setting goals, and when they do the metrics are not based on any reality or research that I have been able to find.  It is typically numbers that management has pulled out of thin air, for metrics that they cannot explain to you. This includes deadlines of the likes of 'finish this in one month' for a project that has been attempted previously and taken others over two years to get it to a half-finished state. 

If you bring up concerns about these 'goals' then you will be told that is the way it is and you can do it or not. So be prepared to either work 80 hour weeks to get something half done.

Management is all about face time here. If you're not sitting at your desk, to them, you aren't working. 

On top of all this, prepare to be gaslit by your manager, anything and everything that you do will be wrong, even if you have done exactly what they have said. They will attempt to convince you that you are the absolute worst employee they have ever seen, and then proceed to put every failure from your entire group on your head. Whether or not you had anything to do with it. 

Teams are also driven by people who have little care for things that they don't find 'interesting' - whether or not they actually bring value to the company.  These individuals also tend to not have a background in what they are managing a team for and no care to actually learn how to do it properly, either on their own or from their employees. 

Seniority is given to people with flashy names on their resumes and MBAs, or how long they've been with the company, not people who have worked in the field before. Being with the company for a long time is not always a proxy for actually being good at what you do either.

Diversity - there is very little and what there was are being chased out by the company. It's becoming more and more difficult for anyone from a minority group to get anything done or promoted."
175,RentPath,Used to be a great company,2018-08-21,2.0,Sales Executive,"Home office, flexible schedule, great benefits.","Upper management does not foster team work environment. When issues arose and proper channels were taken to address the issue with upper management....the managers ignored the issues and nothing got resolved. Upper management played favorites. If you weren't a favorite you were micromanaged and constantly questioned. Local management needed MUCH more training on actually being a manager. Good sales people don't always equate to being good managers. Commission structure was constantly changing as well, which made it really difficult to budget."
176,RentPath,Absence of Leadership,2018-08-21,1.0,Product,"There are a good number of very talented individual contributors at RentPath. These individuals are very smart, have fantastic ideas and collaborate well. The office space is somewhat nice but a very open concept.","As the title suggests, leadership is nowhere to be found. You can find managers of things and of people, but you will be hard pressed to find a true leader within that organization. They do exist, but they are hard to find and are often-times limited in their exposure because they are good at leading by example. 

You need to send your management team to leadership training such as the Modern Servant Leader summit. I enjoy reading and listening to Ken Blanchard when he describes in more details the meaning behind quotes such as “We works a lot better than me.” and “Profits are the applause you get for taking care of your people.”. 

As someone who is reading this review, just know this…once you are in the cog, don’t worry about your career. It’s dead on arrival! The management at RentPath doesn’t concern themselves with such things as performance reviews. The organization, as a whole, completed far less than 50% of employee reviews after the completion deadline. Also, on that subject, please ask HR, when you have your first phone screen, when performance reviews will be and who will have your back when your manager doesn’t follow up or complete their end of the process. If it’s anything less than silence, then you know specifically you are being lied to. 

If RentPath will treat their existing employees that poorly, what makes you think they are not going to treat you the same. Please take the time, research the company, read these reviews for what they are worth and make an investment into yourself prior to jumping in blind. 

All companies have warts and all companies have their fair share of problems, but this company has a toxic culture and environment because HR has allowed this to happen. The CEO has a saying “See something, say something”.  Don’t, that’s all I’ll say."
177,RentPath,Pros and Cons,2018-08-05,3.0,Social Media Specialist,Fun and entertaining office culture. I really enjoyed coming to work everyday and getting to be around people who come from many different backgrounds and lifestyles. It makes for a fun day when the job itself is boring and repetitive.,"While the culture is fun, it is not thought out well. Dogs are cool, but not for everyone. Drinking is cool, but not for everyone. These events are fun but would never be discussed with everyone in the office to see how comfortable they were with it. No room for growth.

Lots of formed cliques especially with management and favorite employees. If you notice these replies to the reviews they are very combative and aggressive and reflect accurately and poorly on the culture and lack thereof. No career progression unless you're drinking the kool-aid or a friend of the CEO, lots of backstabbing and bullying. HR is useless and contradictory.

It doesn’t take in consideration that despite what sales rep can try, always some clients will cancel, and you will lose the full amount of the cancellation (component 1) plus in percentage (component 4). It doesn’t matter if the client was 5 years with the company nor if the account was transfer to the sales rep a couple of weeks before the drop game in. 
They sold me on the idea that the commission portion was 50% of your income with realistic expectations, changed the plan without increasing a penny on salaries. With 2018 new plan sales rep are making 30-50% less in commission than before and the car allowance are a joke.
The top sales rep have been “lucky” that they have many accounts share with a RAM and that’s why they are selling too much, too many unhappy sales rep on EDU with the new changes, and on top of that you will spend too many hours completing reports and the “New 1-on-1” that it should be an automated report from Salesforce maybe with some field to answer, not an hour back and forward to pull the info."

- Strong business and consumer visions
- Strong B2B leadership
- High-performance culture
- Value problem solvers

Just about every product and marketing team is growing at a rapid pace right now. In some ways, it can feel more like a startup with all of the new faces and new processes. For me, that is a pro. It's exciting to see.

I work in Marketing on a lean team working on several projects at a time.  Is the work easy? No. Am I glad I'm here? Absolutely. Everyone is challenged to do more and do better. Because of it, I have grown a lot in the past year. There is even a physical ""problem/solution"" box where anyone can identify a problem and recommend a solution they want to implement, and those ideas are discussed at team meetings. Doesn't get more solutions-oriented than that.","People succeed here when they see problems and solve them with a DIY, roll-up-your sleeves-and-fix-it attitude.

This is a great environment for learning. You get to be a big part of a growing thing.

I work from home once a week.

Overpriced product offerings that make it very difficult to sell, thus costing most sales executives $$. 

The company created a culture committee, but the committee is not inclusive of all race, therefore minorities still have no voice. The company is aware of this but still fail to address the situation.

While RentPath might have been a great place to work a few years ago, that is far from the truth today. The company is suffering from multiple challenges, internally and in the market space it sits. From an internal aspect, everything you can think of: extremely low moral, high turnover, unrealistic goals, micro management, passive aggressive behavior by managers (some who shouldn't be in the position to begin with), lack of any team building, rampant favoritism, outdated products which needs some serious reevaluation, and a complete lack of company direction and core initiatives. RentPath will continue to lose market share as long as certain people in management are in place. Anyone that once had a positive impact on the company, particularly the sales is long gone."

Their word is useless, because as soon as a rep is on target to make a good commission, they change the rules and put a new, lower paying plan into effect immediately, if not retroactively.

There is so much potential to have amazing products and a better culture!!! The collaboration between markets is awesome! Shifting from markets to districts was a great move. Moving out some of the old RSDs was very much needed! We have an amazing new leader in place in my region.,"They informed us today that in 2 days our commission plan will change. Things have been bad here for a while but that is what final pushed me to write this review. Do you realize this is your employee's livelihood? This is how they put food on their table? A little notice would have been nice. They tried to talk it up about how much better it would be but they failed to mention that even the top reps will not be making the same amount of money. If they tell you during an interview that you have potential to make so much money, do not believe them. I do not want anyone making the same mistake as me. We are being beat down by the competition and the ILS market is tough right now. RentPath has showed it's true colors during a time of difficulty. 

I am a firm believer that company culture trickles down. The morale since the new CEO took over has been horrible. Every person I looked up to in this company has left or been let go. The new employees just don't fit the mold. They are hiring whoever will take a job here. The new ""executive staff"" is just a bunch of elite people who could careless about the soul of this company. They do not want to be bothered with talking to the feet on the street. I truly hope our investors and CEO take a good hard look at the morale at this company before it is too late. I know it's about the numbers but you will soon be left with the bottom of the barrel when it comes to talent. Some old timer DSMs have hung around way too long and they have lost their passion for this company. Word to the wise, start asking the SEs how they truly feel about their direct report. When an executive comes to conduct local meetings, acknowledge the individuals who are hitting their goals and working to move the company forward. It is so frustrating to sit in a meeting getting harped on for not hitting your numbers when you're MORE than pulling your weight. A simple thank you goes a long way. It's very clear even the executives feel like they are on the hot seat."
240,RentPath,All good things come to an end.,2017-06-26,2.0,Customer Service,Comfortable working environment. Friendly co-workers. Easy access to speak with managers/supervisors. WAS a good starting place for corporate experience.,"When I first started, I enjoyed my position. The compensation was proportionate to the work load and the atmosphere friendly. As of late, company spending must have completely ceased. A ""spiff"" that was pitched as part of my salary was taken away, the work load is now unmanageable, and the expectations held of us are absolutely ridiculous. What started out as somewhat of a laid back job is now one I dread coming to every day. We are micromanaged, patronized, and now that everyone is fed up with being treated this way, people are  quitting left and right. Instead of hiring new reps, the unassigned markets have been dispersed to those remaining without question and without lack of adequate compensation. (A rate of $6 extra a day for maintaining metrics for 2+ people's jobs).  Some of the managers are looking out for us but have little to no power to change anything. 

When the new CEO started, he said one of his biggest goals was providing more transparency between departments. Unfortunately, he has succeeded in doing the exact opposite. That being said, the hot shots in upper management have no idea the day to day routine of the people keeping the company afloat. They sit on the throne and call the shots and expect everyone to shut up, do what they're told, and digest the lies that are being fed to us. The transparency is so far gone that our department directors don't even know what change is coming until they receive the corporate email blast.  

Lastly, there is no room for growth-- just department hopping which can only be done if you know someone from another team."

If you're thinking about working here then research and draw your own conclusion. Take a look at the Rentpath Facebook page. Look at the townhall meeting photos and notice who is on stage. Look at the employees chosen to represent Rentpath at conventions when it's time to make money. This is a very ""boys club"" company that still likes to send women with a certain look to meet potential clients while our competitors are kicking our rear ends with a simply better offering. Rentpath is in crisis mode and we don't realize how bad things have gotten because the old guard is still in place and the new CEO unfortunately has not done enough to clean house. The executives are sorely out of touch with anyone below the middle management level and seem to be in denial as to how bad employee morale is. The best talent are leaving in droves, and many areas have a hard time recruiting talent that's worth anything. Rentpath is a company with unlimited potential that will fail because of old ways of thinking, terrible morale, systematic discrimination of minorities, open nepotism and a counter intuitive company culture. Our most notorious competitor(we know who) is kicking our rear end with less money and people. Do you know why? They value employees that are smart, talented and love the company."

It seems at this point they're just throwing things to a wall to see what will stick.  Ideas are solicited but never implemented. Comp plans and quotas will change on you with hardly any notice, and with no consistency nationwide. They ask you every week to donate to their new cause (homelessness) while finding new creative ways to lower your pay. Poor communication, getting worse.

Management is more concerned about sales not the betterment of overall staff and culture; they dont have the best interest of employees and they're not teachable
Employees  are fearful of telling the truth on the surveys because management may retaliate 
Benefits aren't great
Some folks climb the corporate ladder and pull it right up (preventing others from getting ahead)
Certain people get promotions
Too many hippocrates and cutthroats"

Product is not as competitive 

This company has a lot of potential, but it is not hitting the mark when it comes to the competitiveness of the product and management.  There is high turn-over and the company is loosing great people due to poor managers who have no clear direction for their teams nor a sense of how to properly set them up for success.  I sometimes wonder if they are even given the proper resources to manage at their best or if they just don't care!  From my experience, management expects 100% from you, but fail to give it back and are quick to throw you under the bus if they feel threatened.  This is a great place if you choose to go with the flow of how things are being managed to collect a check."

Expectations for the Sales Team are sometimes unrealistic, and priorities seem to change on a whim without any insight given as to why or what the long-term goal is.  Administrative tasks take up a disproportionate amount of time. 

While there is a lot of talent in IT, senior IT management has a history of making some really questionable decisions regarding priorities and direction.

These relationships will begin to evolve into open displays of public affection. AND YOU BETTER KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT ABOUT IT !! IF you want to keep your job that is...... 

Don't even bother running to HR about any of this, because your manager will let you know IN ADVANCE that they will deny ANY and ALL wrong doings and in return make false claims about you and your daily work ethic.

Clients believed in the product/service they were being offered and were willing to spend the money.  Monthly sales competitions made it fun and rewards were always being given, spiffs for extra sales, it was fun/competitive and achievable.

NOW, it's all about the bottom line.  Nobody cares about what is REALLY going on in the markets or the sales people.  As long as the numbers look good, that is all that matters.  Now that the numbers don't look good, now that the clients are realizing we are squeezing their budgets dry and not getting anything more than they had in the past, now that quotas/goals have gone up so high they are barely able to be achieved, it's horrible.  You will have to pay out of pocket if you would like to take a client out to lunch or send them a small gift as there is no budget allowed for client relations.

Unattainable goals, crappy car allowance that hasn't changed in years, always being asked to sell more and more with very little training on new products that are released too soon before figuring out the bugs, senior management only cares about bottom line, will tell you ""they have your back"" but they don't."

The attrition and employee turnover of the sales team is horrible. They set unrealistic goals and then force people out when they don't hit them.

341,RentPath,"Great culture, great workforce, great company",2015-09-01,5.0,,"- Competitive benefits
- Steady career advancement
- Excellent community to be a part of
- Exciting goals and challenges to tackle

Rentpath is an excellent environment for ambitious, hard working professionals who want to make an impact. Participating in the effort to transform and win the rental space is extraordinarily rewarding when you know that your peers and management are all aligned with that goal in mind. It's easy to put in 100% when you know that you're part of an organization that's steadily moving toward achieving it's aims thanks in part to your efforts.

The office feels like an organic community. Events that, at other companies, are often treated as team-bonding chores and enjoyed ironically at best seem to be genuinely enjoyed and eagerly anticipated by the people here. Everyone is supportive and interested in you both as an individual and as a coworker.

There is never a shortage of healthy, guiltless snacks  to keep you fueled throughout the day. Office movie nights are organized for essentially every film you'd want to see throughout the year and board game nights with pizza give you space to have fun in the office.

Management is quick to recognize and reward hard work and talent. Managers will advocate for the members of their teams to ensure that everyone who wants it has the room and resources necessary to grow in the direction they want.

Overall, an excellent place to work.","- Occasional long hours
- Must adapt to frequent changes
- Many ongoing projects

Employees at Rentpath are not immune to the temptation to work extra long hours and it's not uncommon for more than one person to be in the office after 8:00 or 9:00. Free Lyft rides home from the office after 8:00 lessen the burden of a long night at work, though they do make it easier to succumb to the desire to spend all evening in the office.

While Rentpath is flexible and it's easy to come in late or leave during the day if you have a doctor's appointment or another chore that needs to be completed during the week, working from home is usually an ""if you need to"" accommodation rather than an ""if you want to"" option for the San Francisco office, excepting a large remote engineering team. If you need to be at home for whatever reason, no one will ask twice about your absence for that day as long as you give everyone a heads-up, but it's expected you'll be in the office if you can.

Management expects employees to strive for excellence, and settling for the status quo is discouraged. It's not uncommon to be promoted more than once in a year and have your responsibilities change more often than that, so for people looking for something routine and comfortable, a career at Rentpath may not be the best option."

All the C-level folks (including some Director-level employees) only care about political power and blaming each other when things go wrong; and a lot of projects go wrong, are left unfinished, or just not delivered altogether. The CTO isn't technical at all, and is in collusion with all but one of his Directors. Management has been around 8-12 years in the same position, and there is no upwards movement at all.  They got rid of middle management, which used to be the only good thing in management; but I guess middle management got the blame one too many times."

This makes a poor, miserly impression and impedes relationship-building with clients. Also, the internal CRM tool is a complete mess, slapped together by someone who left the company and never corrected.  A good crm tool is critical for planning, forecasting and strategizing. This needs to be cleaned up and professionally-executed, properly and immediately.

If you scroll past page 1 you can see all the real reviews that have been pushed to page 2 to hide. The president is the worst micro manager I have ever seen. Launch after launch of failed products and systems within the company have all been half baked and failed. There are major problems within the organization, all being at the top level and coming from one person. You cannot have a person that started out as a customer service rep running a billion dollar company.

Mismanagement, cut throat, unrealistic expectations. It's pretty much like a 4 year old with ADD runs the company. They ""roll out"" a decision one day, and the re-nig and take it back to be released at a later time. But that time never comes. They make promises they don't keep.  They ask for feedback but do nothing with it. They don't give regular reviews to help you manage your business, but they will be quick to threaten you without asking why. In the time I worked there I got 2 reviews in 1 week, but nothing the first year I worked there. 
They don't take accountability for the fact that they provide poor management, and if you struggle or a team mate struggles, they wash their hands of you. Turn over is 100% a year with this company and they are FINE with that. That alone should make you run away. 
The biggest complaint from our customers (apt communities) is that turnover is so HIGH, yet rentpath keeps moving with the mentatlity that this is the best way to run their business. This is a relationship based business, but it's common to have a new rep every couple of months. So people don't want to do business with you. It's a joke. 
They don't invest in training (the intial training is full of type-o's) and training doesn't even explain why you should sell certain products over others. 
Even management at the top constantly turns over. How they are blind to the taste this leaves in peoples mouths leads me to believe this company is run by deranged sociopaths."

Compensation - The pay is more than fair and the harder you work the more money you can make.
Opportunity - With a dynamic and growing company of this magnitude there always seems to be opportunity to move up or around in the organization to advance or change and try something new.  
Management - The managers do their best trying to convey the company plans and are very understanding and fair with their employee's","Fast Paced - It can be very hectic at times but it makes the days go by fast
The Office is moving to new location - They are moving to a spectacular new office with more perks and amenities that you know what to do with but this may make the drive challenging for some people
A lot of information at first - When I fist started working it seemed like my head was spinning with the amount of information you need to learn, but things quickly came into focus.

OMG ...the DROPS! If interviewing for a sales position ..ask about ""drops."" They don't tell you about them up front. You get a book of business upfront , but if an advertiser ""drops"" for any reason (sells out, management change, bad service, etc), then the salesperson has to ""cover the drop."" So, now, they not only have to make their monthly quota, but now also cover the drop, to make your full commission ...even if you didn't sell them ...even if the company had been getting paid on the account for years. You can't make money playing ""catchup to drops"".

I recently went out on maternity leave for 3 months due to a hard pregnancy.  When I left I was at 100% to my goal, but when I got back I discovered no one had worked my market and my numbers dipped down to 80%.  Upon returning they told me I had 1 month to turn it around - which isn't even realistically possible in that time frame.   In addition, the company caps your commission opportunity.

 If you work as a sales trainer you have real good job security because this company has around 600 employees and has gone through over 1,200 in the last two years.
The benefits are OK.  
Decent products but Zillow and Trulia will crush them, and the rest of the industry, when the merger is finished.","Turnover is over 100 percent a year.  Extremely high, even for a sales organization.  
The commission plan  for sales people resets every year.  This is OK if you have a bad year(providing they haven't fired you, remember over 100 turnover a year).  But if you have a good year they roll all your sales into your next years  goal but don't pay you an extra dime.  
Way, way too much work for a Sales Executive.  The company has almost no support for the sale staff.  Sales people end up doing everything from building ads to on-boarding customers.
My Director was incompetent and smarmy .  He was never in management before RentPath  and they promoted him twice.  He is the only sucker that would take the postilion. 
The CEO is a great bean counter but not much of a leader. In three years he addressed the whole organization 3 times.
The President is a megalomaniac that is more concerned about preserving her power that generating business.  She personally has to approve any discounts on contracts in an organization of over 600.

The sometimes lunches were a nice perk but not enough to outweigh some of the problems","There is a rot under the surface of the company that isn't readily apparent when you first get there but after about 3-6 months, you'll want to run.   Management is embarrassingly out of touch not only with the products we create, but the processes by which they create them and no amount of offering to show them seems to make a difference.  Managers tend to be friends who take care of one another over anyone else.  There is no safe place to air a concern about a bosses performance because they all talk and support one another.  Employees tend to feel trapped as a result and cannot move to different departments if they want to expand their skills because of this.   If management doesn't like you, they will find a reason to set you out the door, even if you are doing nothing wrong.  There is a constant fear of being walked out of the building with no explanation or notice.  Work and development plans don't seem to exist here and promotions when the come seem arbitrary.  If you need a paycheck and some line items on your resume,  come here, get them quickly and get out."

First, the ""cube city"" that you work in is difficult Being so close together is hard when certain people are loud or disruptive. Way too many meetings all the time. Beginning to feel like we were being micromanaged by the time I left. Goals set unreasonably high. Even when 90% of the team falls short of the goals, they refused to change them or acknowledge that they were too high. Training was subpar for the team I was on.

Because they typically don't know what they want and will use you as a test dummy to increase their skill growth.  Most managers are first-time managers and this cab play out badly with leading and taking responsibilities if there are failures.  It has been my 16+ years working experience - if the team fails its the managers fault.  Not the case with this company.  If the team fails, a fall-guy or gal is looked for.  Be sure you know how to duck.  There is a big culture of passing-the-buck at this company.  No one takes responsibly for mistakes.  Its always someone else did it.  This does not promote moral or loyalty within the confines of the company.  Everyone is basically scared all the time of losing their job.  Which, sadly, is the norm here in the US.  My advise is to learn to make a powerful friend that can assist and mentor you and give you great support. Wont come from your supervisors sadly.  They are scared too."

The company then went on to reduce the sales force by 35%, the graphics team by probably 80% and the administrative staff by 90%.  The remaining sales force was tasked with taking on considerably more work (both administrative and sales related activities) for LESS pay.  Don't be fooled by offers of excellent pay and benefits - the pay plan changes with the wind, and the benefits have been reduced considerably. As the company has gone to almost all internet (elimination of print is almost complete), they continue to ask the folks in the field to deliver manipulated numbers to the client.
