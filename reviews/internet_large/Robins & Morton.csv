Get in young with R&M as CoOp or intern or right out of college.  They will send you all over the country on their dime and you can grow your career quickly.","If you didn't join the company young you sometimes feel left out of ""the good ole boys club"".  

When it comes time to settle down you might have to look for options outside the company.   

Younger salary employees need more trips home than 3 year.  That is just not right when R&M is a ""Family"" company.  A trip home a month can recharge an employee and keep them interested in working on the road.  

Sometimes slow to promote or not provide a plan for future of employees. 

Some lack of continuity between branch offices."

203,Robins & Morton,Project Management,2017-07-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Progressive, yet grounded in core principles. Emphasis on safety, quality and continual improvement. Management cares about what employees have to say and contribute. It's not so much what they say as what they actually do which is refreshing. Leadership inspires respect, going the extra mile and doing the right thing both within and outside the organization - clients, designers, subcontractors, suppliers and other business affiliates. There is a definite willingness to place personnel where they can succeed and flourish. This can be in different roles, locations, departments, etc. A good blend of experienced builders and innovative newcomers to the industry. It's the real deal.","Though progressive in an overall sense, some lifetime employees (leaders) can have the mindset that the R&M way of 30 to 40 years is the only way and be slow to give consideration to change. Support can sometimes be lacking due to the ongoing struggle that every contractor has in controlling its overhead. Support departments (IT, Accounting) do not always perform with the same sense of urgency as the operations groups having to meet aggressive schedule demands."
204,Robins & Morton,Project Engineer,2017-07-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Senior Management is aware that Robins & Morton's continued success is wholly dependent on the happiness and continued development of its employees.  This is primarily demonstrated through training classes, bi annual reviews, and an open door policy to speak candidly with senior management.","Such is the case with many mid-large sized General Contractors, travel is to be expected.   Operations managers are constantly juggling project needs versus employee needs."
