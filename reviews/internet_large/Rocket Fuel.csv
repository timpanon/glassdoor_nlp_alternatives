3) Extremely low morale across teams. Barring a handful of employees, most of them are either new and clueless, or work only for 3-4 hours a day and spend the rest of time procrastinating or preparing for interviews
4) A lot of perks are going away. Understandably so, as they need to preserve cash for survival, but that leads to morale drop, and is a negative from an employee's PoV

Except for new grads, the corresponding total package is much-much-much less than that from Google, FB, LinkedIn, etc. If RF is really an engineer oriented company, should we pay our employees honestly and decently?
2. Much more shares are given to new hires for attraction, but few if any to the current employees. Maybe our current employees shouldn't feel unfair at all because ""the market has shifted""!!
3. Some people having good relationship with managements got promoted very fast, as causes a feeling of unfairness. (Senior manager? Director? Kidding me!?) Are our annual review mainly based on relationship? I knew a few hardworking employees never got promoted because they are not good at connection.  
4. RF keeps losing engineers, and lots of projects don't have owners, or their owners don't have sufficient understanding yet, as causes a few system outages already, and makes our system fragile. (Robustness considers both systems and people maintaining them!!)"

66,Rocket Fuel,A Confused Company,2017-02-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Generous ESPP structure (although it hasn't been realized yet due to cratering stock price)
Lunches
Focus on technology","The CEO has a favorite saying he repeats whenever the Company changes corporate strategy, which is often. “We’re on a boat all paddling in the same direction. If you don’t agree or don’t want to paddle, get off.”, or something to that effect. What he doesn’t say is that the boat you are paddling on is also sinking, and to keep it afloat, every so often he’ll toss a few folks off involuntarily to keep the boat from sinking [that day]. He doesn’t know how to fix the boat, so it keeps sinking, and the process repeats itself.

Simon Sinek has a great talk in which he says, “When we feel safe inside an organization, we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities”. You will not feel safe working here and those that currently work at Rocket Fuel know this. Most are putting in 50% effort. The market has rejected Rocket Fuel, as evidenced by a ~$2 stock price (5% of its high), and if the stock does not recover significantly more bad things will continue to happen within the Company.

The underlying technology at Rocket Fuel is good for a single purpose of playing the online advertising game. It uses machine learning algorithms to do so, most of which is above bar, some is not (think data). There’s lots of Company Kool-Aid to drink and there are smart people left, although the people that built Rocket Fuel and most of the people that worked there early-on are all gone but a few.

There have been endless bad investments, such as buying a DMP (which is not even sold or able to sold anymore), over-investing in brand solutions that the market didn’t want, spouting off about how we’re going to bring AI to other industries (yeah right), and on and on.

The prospects are bleak. Nobody will acquire Rocket Fuel since the business model sucks and they’re now an also-ran DSP. They now claim to be a predictive marketing blah blah blah. It’s just the latest in a string of attempts at differentiated positioning. Nothing has changed.

I loved my time at Rocket Fuel, well most of it, and have fond memories of building something great with great people. Unfortunately the dysfunction is too widespread at this point."

Many are very experienced and come from a Big 4 & industry background. My overall experience in each month-end close cycle is of a cohesive team that is organized, with each team member working hard & contributing to meet our reporting deadlines. Plus we have fun together & the team culture definitely prioritizes work life balance after busy periods & encourages rest/recovery with many understanding managers that make sure you take PTO (which is on a flexible time off policy). The accounting team specifically does a wonderful job living out one of our core values of ""Celebrating People Being Great"" demonstrated by the many milestones that we celebrate frequently (anniversaries, birthdays, baby showers, a job well done & etc)",-Business strategies & initiatives slow to produce results of growth (in terms of stock price etc) but heading in the right direction

96,Rocket Fuel,Rocket Fuel After A Yesr,2016-07-12,5.0,Client Services,"I joined the org right after a large downsize. The company morale was very low. After being here a year now I can see a slow but steady turn in the right direction. Having been part of turnarounds I can say with confidence that the CEO has a plan and is executing it fairly well. 

I can say for myself that this is the best company I have ever worked for. Very supportive of career goals and flexible in work schedule.

The amenities are what you would expect from an Ad Tech company. Very good. Lunch provided, snacks, social events etc...

I wouldn't stay here if I didn't think the company represented a huge opportunity and is positioned for success. This is that company. It may take some time but the technology the company has is industry leading and state of the art. Additionally, the product managers and engineers are improving it regularly.",The size of the company is a bit of a challenge. Integration of features from the former DMP into the DSP has been slow but steady. Once these are complete the already formidable platform will be dominant in many aspects.

* Older tools (Hipchat vs. Slack, etc.)
* Organizational inertia; certain processes hamper efficiency
* Some cultural things -- lack of due diligence regarding documentation, code cleanliness, bug report descriptiveness
* Some issues with upper-level management & strategy; does not affect day-to-day life but leaves one questioning the long-term future of the company"
98,Rocket Fuel,Run...,2016-07-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Not much positive to say about this company.,"News of Rocket Fuel's steadily plummeting stock prices can be easily found on the Internet.  Everything about this company portrays what another review mentions as a ""sinking ship"".  Poor financial standings led to a company wide layoff.  

The atmosphere here is horrific.  In the days leading up to the official announcement of the company's ""reorganization"", HR had printed severance papers sitting on the printer for the entire Finance department to view and worry about before HR frantically retrieved the documents.  For 2 long days, news about the layoff spiraled out of control before it was acknowledged by the CEO in a townhall meeting. 

The company has decent perks but even that is gradually changing to reflect the poor financial state of the company.  The options for snacks and drinks aren't the same as they once were a year ago and they will continue to plummet as the company scrambles to become a ""cash flow positive"" company.  

Overall outlook for the company is not promising."

If you are up for a challenge this is great place to be right now. Everyone has a chance to be significant part of turnaround story in many areas. New CEO not afraid to take risks, very supportive of new ideas and most important going through promises. Few extremely qualified managers in first circle of direct reports to CEO who actually help to facilitate this transformation. Nice perks in HQ and remote locations.","In some areas workload for many employees is up significantly in last 2 quarters.

110,Rocket Fuel,Company is in make or break stage,2016-04-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free food, snacks, and drinks. Beautiful buildings at HQ, CHI, SF, NY.

The new leadership is trying very hard but the headwinds are strong with this one.","Company strategy is all over the place. We want to focus on self serve but the product isn't easy to use. We want to grow our business but the infrastructure isn't scalable. We have business councils but there lacks accountability and the vision is still unclear. We need to invest in our technology but R&D is a mess. In a growing industry, our revenue growth is stagnant and the future here is very uncertain. Shareholder return is in the red for the past couple of years and cash is slowly drying up. With other companies in our space doing well, how do we continue to justify our existence in the market?

Too many forms of communication from e-staff and leadership. From bi-weekly townhalls, 15/5, weekly emails, 30/60/90 day plans, etc...the company is trying very hard to be transparent but there's so much noise going on it's tough to focus."
111,Rocket Fuel,"So much potential, despite plenty to work on",2016-04-19,4.0,Campaign Manager,"The people and the office. Those two are certainly the major highlights that I will miss from my time at Rocket Fuel. The closeness and “family-type” team that struggles to exist at the East Lansing office, is a nice change from other corporate offices (I say “struggles” due to hearing what it used to be like before the acquisition.) There are some very truly friendly, caring, and talented individuals that I worked with, they will be missed. The very detailed, elegant building with all its wood, stone, and earth tones, is such a nice look and feel; abstract from most tech companies that want to try to reach for some combination of industrial/tech/modern look. Rocket Fuel’s East Lansing office is one that makes you want to invite people to come have lunch with you, to show off where you work.

The perks: free lunch every day, snacks, drinks (yes both alcoholic & non), employee stock purchase plan coming down the line, and the 401K matching, were all nice Pros of Rocket Fuel as well. There are more perks at other offices (so be cautious of that when you read the “Perks & Benefits” section of their website, not all listed are at each office.)

The technology that Rocket Fuel has developed is certainly superior and underneath the radar of much of the competition…it has the ability to rise very soon to take the marketplace by force.","Low pay, poor management, and distance (for me at least). Despite the awesome talent in the East Lansing office, in the short time I was there I saw them proving themselves over and over, yet there is the overwhelming consensus of being underpaid. It does not take much work to see that one can be more fairly compensated with a salary a lot closer to market average at several dozen companies in the area. One can live on what Rocket Fuel pays its workers at other offices around the country, but several of the awesome people at this office have to have a second or side job in order to attempt to make up the difference. 

There seems to be an issue with promoting some into leadership positions based on who they know and not if they are actually good leaders or not."

1, Can't believe what manager says. They always change. They could promise you a lot when trying to hire you, and when it comes to fulfill the promises, heh-heh, good luck with that...

2, Very un-professional workmates. There are a few good guys in the company, but very rare ( many good people have chosen to left the company already). The rest either play politics or prolong the requests from others as long as possible. They could hire people because they are closer friends, they can layoff people because they don't like someones and think other people can threaten their *position*.

3, Managers, directors, even some VPs don't take the company as their own. They have no affiliation whatsoever with the company, all they want is to get well-paid. They don't respond positively to their employees.

Simply put, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.

P.S.: I have to make it clear: not everyone in the company is that terrible. Perhaps I'm un-lucky that most people I dealt with at RocketFuel are terrible."

- New employees are welcomed with a ton of old open tickets, that current employees keep tossing around. 
- Since the environment is complex/non-standard, there needs to be some time for training for the newbies (A Director of Technical Training of sorts). It's Not ok to let them figure it out by themselves, break something, and get admonished, as a way to learn. People will come and go (Or get vacations, get sick, etc), plan around that."

Randy, who is the new CEO, seems to have a clear idea of what Rocket Fuel needs to accomplish and we are right on track with these goals.  He made some key new hires who are intelligent, determined, and experienced.  Besides the  strong leadership, Rocket Fuel has a great organizational culture.  There are a ton of perks. My favorite is the free catered lunch and the  most extensive snack options I've seen at any NY tech company.  RF also does a great   job of celebrating success, whenever employees are doing a great job and are going beyond the typical duties.  RF also does a great job on being innovative.  Not only does the product and engineering teams make great products for our customers, but they are constantly making great products to make internal teams life easier.  I've worked for other companies that only focus on customers and don't think about helping make internal workflows more efficient. Overall, I would reccomend working at Rocket Fuel to anyone.  If you want to work for an innovative, growing, fun, and supportive Ad tech company in the, Rocket Fuel is the place for you.","The current office space is too big, for the number of employees, but this issue will be resolved when we move into our brand new office space this summer.

Our tech/product is actually very great for a company that has had issues with its stock price, and you will work with tons of intelligent yet cool people.

Many employees are super spoiled with the free lunches, free coffees, happy hours, game room, gym, high quality snacks, so they don't know what a great thing they have.

They say they do and send out surveys asking about how satisfied employees are but there's no action that shows it. They constantly work employees beyond capacity with very little to no appreciation. An email here and there with people's names called out isnt that helpful. Employees are just expected to deal with having constant work overload and not enough additional headcount for relief. Unrealistic expectations are placed on employees and even when it's called out by the employees, there's an ""I don't care just figure it out because that's what I want"" type of attitude and response."

149,Rocket Fuel,Generally Positive Experience but Onboarding is a Mess,2015-09-29,4.0,Software Engineer,"Seems like a great company so far. I'm very new to the world of Programmatic Marketing, so it's hard for me to gauge, but the company appears to be trending in the right direction, competitively.

I haven't put them to much use yet but the benefits packages seem far and away better than any other company I've worked for.

Work environment is nice and fairly open. Flexible hours, unlimited PTO, dog-friendly, and all the other perks you get with a tech company are all there. Catered lunches are a very nice plus - never encountered that before. Everyone at my location is very friendly and helpful. I'm always happy to share a few drinks with everyone at happy hour. 

Very happy with my position with the company at this time. Front-end developer being asked to do front-end development tasks, so no surprises there. 

I'm told there is room to grow here and that compensation is evaluated on a regular basis.","Sorry to say, but onboarding was a bit of a mess. Started with being given an offer for salary over the phone. I thought it was fair and accepted the offer. Only to be called back a couple hours later and told that, actually, the offer they gave me was too much, and would I like to accept a lower offer instead. Not a great way to start. 

Prior to accepting the offer, I had also asked about what work equipment would be provided as this was part of my evaluation. Everything sounded good. Subsequently I received a form where I got to check off my requests exactly as had been discussed on the phone. When I arrived my first day I received none of this, however. Completely different laptop and setup than had been agreed upon. 

This shouldn't outweigh any of the Pros listed above, but two bait and switches to get me in the door seems a bit excessive. Brought up the equipment issue with corporate when they asked for feedback. Apparently the new policy -- ""you get what you get and you don't get upset"" -- didn't get communicated down the pipeline at the time of my hiring. No intention of making good on that at this time. Just kind of strange for a company who is aggressively hiring."
150,Rocket Fuel,Avoid,2015-09-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The company culture and perks from when the company was smaller have carried over and are a huge pro of working here.,The company is extremely disorganized and has very weak upper management in all departments.

154,Rocket Fuel,"Tales from a new-hire: Great company, culture, products, leadership and people!",2015-09-10,5.0,Director,"I was drawn to Rocket Fuel after my main contact at my top account from my previous job asked me to gather competitive intelligence on Rocket Fuel (our competition). The more I researched Rocket Fuel, the more I realized that they had a VASTLY superior DSP product and technology stack. 

Soon afterwards I started reaching out to Rocket Fuel for an interview. I was blown away by the entire interview process. All of the (many) folks I met at the company came across as smart and genuinely energized - there was a palpable sense that the company had turned a corner (after all the Wall st drama and company restructuring).

The interview process was thorough (5 interviews) - I was expecting it to be grueling, it wasn't at all. The interviewers asked challenging but fair (and relevant) probing questions that also served to inform me on Rocket Fuels priorities. Worth noting, they all placed a high value on protecting the healthy Rocket Fuel culture and making sure I would be a good fit. 

After my first few days on the job, I started to experienced the Rocket Fuel culture first hand: smart, fast-paced, friendly, high-energy, demanding and a LOT of fun!

On my first day, I was also pleasantly surprised when I saw the fringe benefits: fully stocked kitchen with every imaginable snack or drink (healthy or unhealthy) you could want, AND amazing free lunch Mon-Thurs. My boss warned me about putting on the ""freshman 15"" - you need a lot of self-discipline to stay away from all the tempting goodies.

More importantly, in the days and weeks that followed I learned more about the underlying technology that powers Rocket Fuels Artificial Intelligence engine - I learned that the Rocket Fuel tech was the real deal and it was light years ahead of other DSPs (including my previous job). 

The company has definitely built a better programmatic  mousetrap that just plain works better than the competition. What sealed the deal for me though was getting a glimpse of company's innovation roadmap for the next 9-18 months - I was relieved to see that Rocket Fuel wasn't resting on its laurels, but rather aggressively building new capabilities and products to drive even higher performance for marketers...and selfishly, more career opportunities for me.

Lastly - I've been here only a month, yet I have already sat in on 2 global company (virtual) meetings. It gave me the chance to see the style/tenor of senior leadership (CEO/CRO). I was super impressed with their efforts to over-communicate company priorities and challenges. They also laid out a clear PLAN on how they were going to beat those challenges and delver against our (aggressive) goals. Their candor, transparency and business strategies inspired a tremendous amount of confidence in me (especially as a new employee). 

Net: although its only been a month, I tell everyone that asks me that this is an awesome place to work with a very bright future ahead...I'm extremely happy with my decision to join the team, and I'm looking forward to a long successful ride here at Rocket Fuel! 

I would HIGHLY recommend checking it out for yourself..","The first 30 days here (as expected) can be overwhelming - LOTS of data, systems, process etc... to ingest. 
Like proverbially drinking water from the fire-hose when your thirsty. This certainly isn't the right fit for everyone - you need a lot of stamina to manage the information onslaught during on-boarding.
You also need to be self-starter - lots of internal resources to navigate...however, no spoon feeding here, you must be both scrappy and self reliant in self-managing your own experience."

159,Rocket Fuel,Great place to work!,2015-09-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"No company is perfect and I’ve been through my share of places that’s seen good and bad times.  Rocket Fuel has been through some difficult times post-IPO with a lot of changes in the first half of 2015.  With that said however, the new leadership team and interim CEO have breathed new life into Rocket Fuel and has been creating a culture of innovation and transparency.

If you’re the kind of person who dislikes change – this is probably not the environment for you.  There are lots of changes (all for the better) happening all around the company which requires people be flexible, adaptable, and have a positive spirit.  Some people might have a hard time adjusting to all of the changes but for many of us, we see it as a great opportunity to learn and grow in our careers and a chance to help make a positive impact.

We’ve made great progress in the last 6 months and I have no doubt things will continue to get better.

Positives: Great food selection (hot foods buffet, fully stocked salad and sandwich bars, pizza and soup station) and tons of healthy snack options on a monthly rotation in the break rooms, awesome gym, beautiful park-like grounds, unlimited PTO, flexible work arrangements, great technology, smart and fun people.",Still some negative energy in parts of the company - hope everyone eventually finds something that will make them happy.

The work environment is a relaxed atmosphere, it's not at all politically correct, so you don't need to worry about offending people too much.

There is some career development, if you have a good manager.","There is no accountability, no chain of command, no one to make a decision, the good news is there's no one to take the blame when things go wrong.  And things are constantly going wrong.  However, since no one can be blamed, no one is, and no lesson is learned and when a similar event happens in a few weeks the cycle repeats itself.

The few decisions that are made are quickly forgotten about when it turns out they were the wrong decision.  Advice is given, but rarely if ever followed.  If you're not telling senior management what they want to hear, you're not going to make any friends."

A subset of managers at Rocket Fuel have been given leadership roles without real leadership acumen or any resources given to them to learn/improve.

And when brought to HR's attention, HR unfortunately takes the side of management. 

Senior management has made terrible decisions, organizationally and product-wise, causing stock prices to fall and morale to drop. From the ""Spend it like it's yours"" expense account program to the layoffs that seem to have been more of a personal revenge list (we let some incredibly talented people go to competitors only to now be scrambling to find new, good people). Why would a company lay off so many only to then offer a huge employee referral bonus just three months later?
The 5-star reviews on Glassdoor must be written directly by HR, falsifying comments to attract new candidates. Or these may be employees incentivized to write reviews here since so many just appeared recently, coincidentally, as our company is crumbling."

Decent health benefits","Rocket Fuel was a ton of fun as a lean/innovative start up, but it is very clear that senior management was not equipped to lead the company through an IPO and into the public market. Since the IPO, nearly every C-level exec has been replaced. 

2+ years ago, Rocket Fuel was the leader in programmatic, always the top performer and the sales team essentially just processed IO after IO without really having to hard sell. The company definitely rested on it's laurels and didn't invest in improving the technology at the rate that the market was moving. With a new push towards transparency and self-serve tools, Rocket Fuel's managed service (black box) scared advertisers away, and they haven't been able to gain traction with their lack luster self-service tools. The company is now focused on getting their basic tech stack up to par with competitors, and putting any innovative technology that would bring them ahead of the curve on the back burner. 

The acquisition of x+1 has been a huge distraction, with the respective companies essentially continuing to function as two separate entities until very recently. This has only fed into unnecessary politics and essentially created two separate camps (Rocket Fuelers and Former x+1ers). Unfortunately, this has also negatively impacted new business opportunities. 

There have been a number of factors impacting morale, including mass layoffs, hiring/bonus freezes and the fact that post-IPO senior leaders were allowed to sell ~10% of their vested shares before the typical blackout periods ended (the stock tanked shortly after this) and the average employee's stock is now worthless."

Lack of direction and clarity of roles

Narcissistic senior management

Work is extremely tedious

Product is oversold and only marginally better (if that) than competitors

Product lines are numerous and complex with no training nor documentation.  Only the engineers who developed the products understand how they work and they're too ""valuable"" to spend their time documenting the product and training the rest of us.  However, we're the ones held accountable when campaigns don't perform due to product failures/misunderstandings.

No employee development whatsoever.

Promotion/Bonus/Salary Increases based upon how well promote yourself and suck up to the (narcissistic) senior management.

Senior and even some mid-level managers are clueless as to who's doing what.  As long as noone's complaining, they're happy.  As soon as someone complains, they immediately start pointing fingers and blame some subordinate.

Brought in ""interim"" CEO to fire loads of good people.  These were low-level employees who took the blame for the (narcissistic) senior management's bad decisions and ineptitude.

Morale is extremely low.  Noone believes nor trusts the senior management when they try to rally the troops.   Everyone just seems to be sitting around waiting for a miracle to happen.  There's no leadership coming from anyone.

Engineers are treated like gods.  Most of them are very smart and nice, but it's strange that they are put a pedestool above everyone else.  It shows in their attitude towards the rest of us when we need their help to understand the details of a particular issue.  They know that they're not going to be measured by how well they communicated or helped their business partners."

Weekly happy hours in the kitchen. Work/life balance is decent - there will be some late nights but it won't take over your life. Everyone working here is really smart and motivated.","- Truly explosive growth means that there are very few processes in place. Management does not invest in internal infrastructure or gives it lip service, bandaid solutions. What you basically have is a bunch of 1 year or less tenured employees all dashing haphazardly towards a goal. Very common to find 4-5 people unknowingly working on the same project, trying to achieve the same thing. Maddening to find that management didn't communicate to each other that they had these large scale projects going and therefore missing an opportunity to combine efforts. Everyone trying to earn credit for their ideas without sharing the limelight, from lower levels up to management. 

- Career growth is basically nil. No investment in learning about other teams, developing skills, emerging products, or our industry at large. I actually believe that management is proud of siloing teams out to prevent cross-learning. Engineering is placed on a very tall, very untouchable pedestal. Frequently you need to ask the same question 3-4 times to make sure that you are getting an accurate answer. 

- HQ-centric view. There are a number of ""satellite"" offices around the globe, but everyone is pointed towards HQ - teams don't interact cross-functionally, and the outer offices are treated second-class. No effort has been made to foster an on-the-ground culture. After acquiring [x+1], very little work has been done to integrate these teams socially to make them feel included. 

- Terrible downwards communication. While top level announcements are made at townhall meetings monthly, changes in best practice, process, outages or product are never communicated."
218,Rocket Fuel,High hopes and advanced tech derailed by poor management,2014-12-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Over the course of its growth spurt, the company has attracted a number of talented and smart employees, particularly in engineering & analytical roles, who are nice to work with. With that said, the most talented ones are leaving in droves for better opportunities.

When you start out, expect a steep learning curve, but within your first 6 months, you should pick up valuable knowledge and in-demand skills that are applicable within the adtech or big data space.","When you start, you’ll probably feel right at home. Between the impressive facilities, break rooms fully stocked with snacks, catered meals, and elaborate company events, what’s there not to like? But like the boiling frog story, gradually, you realize just how toxic the environment is. The company grew too fast without the right processes and leadership in place, and what’s left now is an unhealthy culture built around sales calling the shots.

The management team, particularly at the VP-level and up, is pretty appalling. Many have huge egos and are responsible for rampant favoritism, sexual harassment, and discrimination, but are strangely not held accountable. Most of the management team seem out of touch with reality, because they care most about driving topline revenue and appeasing sales, when they should be more focused on building a sustainable, scalable business. Non-sales management are always traveling to client meetings, so they are essentially never in the office and they are only quick to award their direct line employees who are most ingratiated with sales. In addition, they blatantly overlook the need to measure organizational success, host departmental all-hands, or meet with frontline employees. Instead, they approach decision-making with a lack of strategy, transparency, and communication. The real scary thing is that they appear to think that the status quo is working fine and that everyone should be happy with the sales-driven growth of the business. But in reality, there’s no clear guidance of a vision or strategy for fixing a broken operating model, scaling the business, or developing talent, and employee morale and happiness is quite low.

Lastly, even though there's a lot you can learn, there’s virtually no emphasis or investment made in encouraging employee career growth. As has been well-documented, HR is pretty useless, but the real sad thing is that management’s idea of career growth is to give you a random rotation of accounts/assignments and reward those who are most proficient at sucking up to VPs and sales. Most people work pretty hard to start, but then end up either bored with repetition or frustrated that their efforts go unnoticed. Unless you’re a maestro at tooting your horn, expect a slow boil until you reach your breaking point."

But not so many people can suddenly get job, it takes time, so make me think what going on until then also? The people who left were many years and of different groups, so maybe problem in the upper management of ... department? Also what questions to ask in interview to find out work situation?”
All I can say is, good questions! Agree that any large company would have some dissatisfaction, however, does not mean that it is the experience of the people who should be ignored, and the big question for you is how to find out where the big problem is long-term. There are many differences in the management culture and capabilities in the company, a lot of people have got the reward and gone up without skills or interest in development of the management skills, thereby negatively effecting large numbers of people a long time without solution. With criticism on Glassdoor, leaders asked the employees to give the positive feedback instead of addressing core issues, which raises doubts about the positive reviews here.
Also, when the anonymous feedback is solicited, the first reaction of the head of the department is to try find out who said it from language and details in the comments. Employee feedback is not acted on, so many people don't bother responding."

4. PMs. Fire the product management team. Honestly, they are only playing catch-up with the competition. I am yet to see them ideate something good.

Each year after that, we get a tiny grant. That is not how other companies do it--with them, you get the same major grant each year.

It's a bummer to hear that your CEO just cashed out many millions in options (with presumably many millions left over), and my own options will probably never be worth anywhere near even $1M.

Honestly, people going on about the free food is stupid. The food is cheap and has to be the worse quality stuff I have ever had. I ended up buying my own lunch or bringing it.

This is the kind of place where you'd email HR and they'd forward it directly to your manager. 

It's a popularity contest and those who are favored can get away with just about anything (A $15K/month expense budget? Sure!). Or if you're just a regular sales guy doing what sales people do and you go a bit over budget for a client dinner, good luck getting it paid for.

-Management has no regard for actual culture - they just care about revenue.

264,Rocket Fuel,Left this toxic company with toxic people and culture for good!,2013-08-29,1.0,,There are no pros for working at this company.,"No complaint policy for discrimination, harassment and hostile work environment. They keep hiring through referrals. The most political and dysfunctional employees are at the management level who keep hiring political people like them. These same employees in turn hire people like themselves again and again and again and the cycle continues. Basically, the entire company is filled with dysfunctional employees thereby creating a highly dysfunctional culture. Don't understand how in the world the founders sit on it and not even notice how this cycle is impacting the company for worse than providing equal opportunity for employment! This is the worst career move of my life and I left the company as am one of those employees who regards integrity above anything else. 

There is rampant discrimination, F word is used after every other sentence and coworkers and managers are like drama queens throwing temper tantrums. During the interview they give you a bag filled with gifts and what not, paint a brilliant picture of the company and culture. The moment you are hired everything changes. You are beaten to death in the game of politics. There is no time to work as your entire time goes in validating everyone's drama around. The whole time I worked here all we had to do was to keep saying sorry to every other manager throwing temper tantrums. Finally, I would go home end of the day, work 4-5 extra hours which made it a 16-18 hour work day! Don't know about other departments but if you are interviewing for Analytics or Ad Ops or Sales group be very careful! I made a bad career decision by joining this toxic place and was smart enough to get out of here asap.

The founders are only focused on making money and keeping the cash flowing in. The dirty internal politics goes unnoticed and most times people get fired for not giving in and trying to stand up for what's right. Working hard and being optimistic is something you are highly discouraged from doing here. Lacks integrity to the core you have to pretend like you are the dumbest person ever and your peers and managers will love you. If you are smart, hard working and do not participate in dirty politics by putting someone down and someone else up high then you are let go of. Luckily I did not give this company a chance to do that with me as I have seen them doing so with rest of the hard working ex-coworkers who were let go of because some dysfunctional-political peer/manager's drama was not validated by them.

I ended up finding a wonderful opportunity at a wonderful company and moved on before letting them make my life more miserable. I would never ever recommend this company even to a criminal as jail would still be a better place for them than this toxic place!  It's high time this company gets audited or sued for some of its practices that I have seen."
