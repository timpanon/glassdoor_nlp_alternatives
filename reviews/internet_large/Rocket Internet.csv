6,Rocket Internet,Great learning experience,2021-11-12,2.0,EIR (Entrepreneur In Residence),In just a few months you can learn a lot about startups and e-commerce.,"Weak leadership in the middle management : in the past they used to attract great people, (i.e. ex-McKisey, Bain, BCG) but now the company relies on fresh graduates from MBA with almost no previous experience in managerial roles, maybe it is due to the low/absent salary.

High turnover and it so it is hard to build trust with the team.

127,Rocket Internet,Head of Key Accounts,2017-01-08,1.0,,None to speak of... You have to try hard to think of positives. Informal work environment and fun people but that is dependent on location,"Not an honest or straightforward company, many things are promised verbally and in contract negotiations but not delivered. They see people as disposable workhorses.   No training or role induction, unwilling to invest in employee's development. Scope for promotion is limited, especially for junior staff. I would not recommend this company to anyone starting a career as there is little structure, no programs to help your development and a top down unwillingness to invest in staff and develop skills.

For middle and senior managers, regular shifting of goalposts/targets to the unattainable to preclude you from making the bonus. Zero job security and unclear contracts that allow the company to dispose of you with minimal stress and cost to them. 

Staff are regularly expected to work unpaid overtime daily and any person who wants a work-life balance is seen as lazy. Not a recommended choice of workplace for mothers, people with disabilities or those with caring responsibilities."

I worked at the branch in Mexico City and this happened all the time in all of Rocket's different branches (Linio, Hello Food, Dafiti, Lamudi).

They expect you to work 12 hours a day and the salary is really low. They promise you will grow within the company, which is true. One of my co-workers was promoted from a sales executive to a manager, which required more work and pressure, but his salary remained the same.

If you work here, expect to be fired really fast. 30 people I knew that worked with me were fired after 3 to 6 months of working there.

You'll learn how to develop and keep the businesses running, how to survive the peaks of black fridays and tv ads, how to design and maintain a high performance and availability systems architecture and so on. And depending on your team, you'll have a great culture and flexible hours. Also, if you are doing your job right, your career will also sky-rocket, because management values good and smart professionals (no political bootlickers)!","Depending on the team you're in, engineers are only the ""it guys"" department, so, you won't have those fancy perks or be a programmer superstar here (like you would on other tech-centric companies), but don't get me wrong, it's still far better than most companies. You'll stumble upon some endless discussions with engineers that only wants to prove they're right, even when the whole team agrees they're not. You'll also need a lot of patience to deal with some people who thinks a great grad/college will be -everything- they'll need for all of they lives - until they finally perceive they're on the real world."

313,Rocket Internet,Fast&Furious...,2014-02-15,4.0,Country Chief Executive Officer and Founder,"As Country-CEO for a Rocket Internet local portfolio company, I have had the best entrepreneurial training and experience of my life. The pace is super-fast, with incredibly long hours and a big load of pressure (a good pressure): I had to hire 20+ people in <1 month, build operations from scratch, and take on incredible responsibilities in very little time. The amount of trust Rocket Internet gives you is really empowering. It's probably one of the best ""safe"" arenas where you can have a true entrepreneurial training with limited risk (you have a competitive salary).
Colleagues and management are smart and driven. Culture is a ""no bollocks"" one, which I appreciated, but may be intimidating to others.","The company can be brutal. If metrics don't live up to expectations, or fund raising (done centrally) does not go as expected, they are as quick at closing down operations as they are at spearheading them. Obviously, that's exactly what the start up risk is, but, given that your equity stake is nowhere near what you would have if you were a real founder, you end up sharing a lot of the downsides, but your upside is limited. Make sure you know what you sign up for, but overall I would do it again, if not for the incredible training received."
