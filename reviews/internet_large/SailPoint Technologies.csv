Reasons: Most benevolent and authentic CEO I've ever met. People are treated like adults. No jerk policy when hiring. Ability to improve processes and make an impact outside of my primary responsibilities. Superb office yet freedom to work at home. Awesome co-workers who enjoy collaborating. Great industry space to be in. Lots of learning available. Lots of apps to choose from to do your job. Challenging work. Culture of appreciation.

Mark's philosophy: don't hire jerks who are SMEs. You end up with expert jerks no one wants to work with. Hire kind people who are good at what they do, interested in learning, and who work well on a team. The result? Market-leading identity security technology, and happy, motivated employees. Ask any SailPoint employee.","The company is growing rapidly, and scaling to meet the market needs is challenging at times. Some departments have grown really quickly, while others are still catching up. However, this is typical for a relatively small, incredibly successful Cloud company that is projected to dominate the identity security market in the coming years."
9,SailPoint Technologies,SailPoint puts people first!,2022-03-01,5.0,Engagement Manager,"SailPoint puts people first! 
I know many companies claim that, but SailPoint lives that value every day.

The four company values of innovation, impact, integrity, and individuals are lived out every day. I do meaningful work, I am rewarded for it, and I am not micro-managed.

It's the first time that I can say I actually miss going into the office. The level of support is unmatched and the pay is rewarding.,"We stay busy. But in this economy I take that as a plus.

Hopefully if global growth continues more facilities will be built out.
26,SailPoint Technologies,Great CEO - weak middle management,2022-01-26,3.0,Manager,"Amazing CEO, Mark really cares about people and is a genuine person.","Very little room for innovation. The product is good but the surrounding processes and tools are archaic and suffer from rigid thinking. This is mostly caused by individuals in middle management having worked for the company for a long time and don't want to ""rock the boat"" while being more concerned about their status and how they are viewed politically within the organization than innovative thinking. It is very ""clique-ish"""
27,SailPoint Technologies,"Great place to work for early career or management, not for strong individual contributors",2022-01-24,3.0,Senior Support Engineer,"A CEO who believes in the ""right way"" of doing business. Good trajectory. Big customers. Technology is fun to work with. Customers like the product.","Highly political. Good-ol'-boys control most everything.

Management filters unsavory news from reaching senior leadership, especially in the support and professional services orgs. Example: A former colleague informed me that my exit interview that was supposed to be confidential was shared directly with the person I referenced as a reason for leaving, and that person blocked it from reaching senior leadership."
28,SailPoint Technologies,I love this place!,2022-01-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I love working here. I stay for the people, the career growth, the constant learning, and being a part of a fast-growth company impacting a hot market. I was one of the earlier employees who joined before the IPO, and I appreciate we have maintained our values while also scaling. Mark McClain has been able to bring in a leadership team for our next phase that shares our values while bringing vision, passion, and ability to execute at scale. Scale is challenging and involves constant change, so it's not for everyone. If scale were easy, every company would succeed in doing it. I'm looking forward to what opportunities become available as we continue to grow and lead the Identity Security space. This is a fun ride.","Executing at scale is demanding and challenging. That breeds the kind of problems that are fun to solve, but if you aren't up for the challenge, this isn't the place for you."

31,SailPoint Technologies,Rat Race,2022-01-03,1.0,General,Pretty Good people over all. Minus the Self Aggrandizing mid level people movers...I mean managers.,"Self interested management that will throw you under the bus at a moments notice. Lack of advancement for producers. Plenty of promotions and safetys in place to protect skaters, slackers, and esteemed members of the Good ol boys club. Not to mention, the laughable approach on diversity and perfomative allyship."
32,SailPoint Technologies,"Best place to work, ever! Seriously.",2021-12-21,5.0,,"The culture, the people and benefits.",Long hours and sometimes very high demand.
33,SailPoint Technologies,Best comany ever!,2021-12-20,5.0,Solution Architect,"I love the flexibility we have to work on our own schedule. I've learned how to balance work and personal life, which is usually very difficult. They have always been very supportive, but I was impressed during Covid times, we were always encouraged to take a break, a couple of hours or a couple of days, whatever was needed to don't loose my mind. Being a full-time mom and full-time employee is much easier, managable and even fun at SailPoint.",It's been almost 5 years since I joined SailPoint and I still don't have much to complain about the company.
34,SailPoint Technologies,Sincerity and Integrity,2021-12-17,5.0,Solutions Architect,"The company doesn't just value its ""employees"" , it values its ""people"". This attitude is set at the top level with our CEO, Mark McClain. 

Integrity is a part of the decision making process everytime there is sincerity to making sure work doesn't suck, our CEO even wrote the book on it. 

Seriously, go search for this book: ""Joy and Success At Work: Building Organizations That Don’t Suck The Life Out Of People""

Beyond that, there is tremendous opportunity here and movement from one part of the company to another happens frequently when folks are looking for another challenge. That's a good sign that most don't want to leave the company when it's time for the next step.",The remote culture makes it difficult to know people outside of your immediate team.
35,SailPoint Technologies,"Great people, great culture!",2021-12-17,5.0,Director Professional Services,"The people are phenomenal. Some of the brightest and most driven folks I've worked with in my career. No one is here just to punch a clock; across the organiztion, folks are invested in the work that they do and the people they do it with. Management truly cares about individuals and tailors jobs, responsibility, and career paths accordingly.","The lack of a defined vacation policy can be frustrating, especially if you've been here a long time."
36,SailPoint Technologies,Best company I worked for,2021-10-21,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"SailPoint is a great company to work for. There is an excellent leadership with a great vision. We have the latest and greatest sales tools that gives us a great inside in the local business. Culture is awesome, it's a team where everybody want to be help each other to be successful.","No experience until now, just happy to make to choice to work for salePoint."
37,SailPoint Technologies,Incredible Company To Work For!,2021-10-19,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"For someone that's been in the professional workspace for 20+ years, it's basically impossible to find somewhere SailPoint doesn't check the ""I'd want to work there' box. Top pay, top benefits, autonomy, work/life balance, friendly and inclusive environment, work remote friendly, and the list goes on. I'm very happy I learned about this company and decided to join.","Not really a con per se as it's just the nature of the business, but products are very technical and complicated to implement. However, SailPoint is continuously working to improve the process."

41,SailPoint Technologies,Challenges of Growth,2021-09-16,4.0,Marketing Director,"Values, coworkers, great products and high customer satisfaction",Growth is causing us to get in our own way.
42,SailPoint Technologies,Egos + Nepotism = Disengagement,2021-09-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Mark is an exceptional leader who created a caring but high-performance culture. But the caring and recognition of individuality ends with him.,C-level leaders below Mark have lost the thread. Too many egos and runaway empire building. Nepotism is rife and you're either in the clique or out.
43,SailPoint Technologies,The best job I have ever had,2021-09-02,5.0,Cloud Support Engineer,"I have been with SailPoint for about 3 months now and can easily say it is the best job I've ever had out of 4 technical roles. They don't hire jerks around here, and you can tell with how warm and supportive the climate and culture are. Your whole team will help you to be successful. Working in technical support is often a very stressful job and I seriously feel like this is support technician heaven! Any on call schedules happen for you a week at a time a few times a year, scheduled months in advance, and only go up until around 9pm - vastly different from places where I was expected to be available 24/7! your personal time is very respected - they give unlimited PTO and you actually get to use it. Management is very focused on a smooth onboarding process and constant process improvement. One concern I had was that being permanently remote it would be hard for me to engage in company culture. It has not been challenging to get involved! There are lots of social channels in our chat app for different hobbies and interests, like video games, or pet photos. We do virtual fun activities once or twice a month and I got to travel to Austin and meet a lot of the team in person when COVID restrictions were lower. Speaking of COVID, SailPoint has had a very pro-active approach. Everyone is fully remote right now with the option to reserve a desk at the office for any number of days if they want to, and there has been no pressure to return to the office full time. I could go on for a long time about how much I love working here, but I'll leave it at that. You're crazy if you don't want to be here!","I wish I had constructive feedback but I really don't have any cons. The only thing I might say is that the health insurance is so-so. I have some steep copays on a few of my prescriptions. All of the other benefits have been great (401k matching, unlimited PTO, holidays, etc)"
44,SailPoint Technologies,Love this place!,2021-08-31,5.0,Strategic Account Manager,"I joined the SailPoint Crew in January and have been nothing but impressed with the Overall Culture, Support from Senior Leadership and the Solutions we deliver to help our customers solve complex business problems.","Due to COVID-19 restrictions, I have been unable to meet most of my co-workers and customers in person, but hopefully this will improve in the months ahead."
45,SailPoint Technologies,"Great Company, Great People, Great Technology",2021-08-30,4.0,Account Executive,"Great Company, Great People, Great Technology",Not the right fit for me.
46,SailPoint Technologies,People make SailPoint an amazing place to work,2021-08-26,5.0,Associate Manager of People,"At SailPoint, culture isn't just a checkbox. The SailPoint crew is like a family and we celebrate both personal and professional successes together. We also support each other in not so great times. We have great vision and we execute well because we enjoy working with everyone. I haven't been told once that we can't change something because ""that's how we have always done it"". New ideas are met with a healthy dose of enthusiasm tempered with making sure we have thought it through.","SailPoint is growing. It is in a transition period and that always causes some storming. However, we all know it is happening and work through any issues that arise because we are all in the boat together."
47,SailPoint Technologies,"Strong culture, transparent and people focused",2021-08-23,5.0,ISR- Inside Sales Representative,"As a sales person I look at a few things when choosing an org to pursue. 
1) What is their reputation in the market?
SailPoint is a clear leader in the IGA space, and after having been here for just over 3 months it is clear why. They are innovative, pouring countless investment dollars into innovation, they do their research and work with the right influencers to better understand market trends, where it is heading, and how to apply that information. They go as far as partnering with industry leaders in the auditing space to build out our tools to make sure our customers are actually benefitting from our tech. 

2) Does their product actually work and is it recognized in the industry?
SailPoint is hands down recognized as an industry leader in the IGA space. We are constantly recognized by industry reviewers like Gartner as being the leader. We have nearly 2000 clients spanning all markets with some amazing logos attached. 

3) Do they take care of their employees and customers?
I cant go on enough about how well they care for their employees. As a professional I have traversed 3 very different industries now and have a wealth of experience in terms of seeing how leadership interacts with their employees and these leaders care. I am sure this can very from manager to manager, but in my experience with Matt Perry and Mariah Finleon I am very happy. They will take any question I can throw at them, they give me space to grow, show me the resources I need to grow and help me get there. Over the past 3 weeks or so I have had lunches with varying levels of leadership with the sole focus on getting to know each other. This may sound small, but for those that have been in orgs who only know leaderships names, they should understand the benefit. I am confident that if I were to ask to schedule a one on one with any of them that they would allow me that opportunity and it would be welcomed. It wouldn't be a chore to them. 
The treatment of employees starts from even before day 1. Prior to coming on board I received a care package and a welcome letter. On day 1 we were onboarded by Kimbi Macy of HR who helped arrange a variety of guest speakers throughout the organization including, CEO Mark McClain. Let's be real, how many CEO's make it a point to be on every onboarding session?...not many.","I am not really sure how to answer this question as I have had a very positive experience. Although, I will say that in order for someone to be successful here they need to have the willingness to put themselves out there to ask questions to learn, to seek guidance etc or it may be difficult. I do not really think this is a con as everyone is clearly empowered and encouraged to act this way. They have a plethora of resources on hand and everyone one of my teammates has been willing to help, even at times when I haven't asked, but they knew this would be a great teaching opportunity. 
Again, I don't really think this is a con, but I would encourage anyone coming here to be prepared to advocate for themselves and do so openly as people will help. In saying all of this, I believe these statements are true anywhere anyone may choose to go and will put the old adage out there of, ""you get what you put into it"". So, go it!"
48,SailPoint Technologies,Great place to work pre-covid.,2021-08-20,2.0,Desktop Support Technician,"Great environment, team, food options, free drinks, amazing building and location.",Executives seemed to have a horrible view on covid.

Great colleagues - everyone is busy, but it's a welcoming, inclusive culture and people are encouraged to ask questions, learn and grow.

Good work/life balance
Decent benefits - I'd expect a better 401k program from such a successful company
Mark, the CEO, is truly fantastic
Great company culture foundation","New sr. leadership in ISR org lacks visibility, transparency, or overall leadership/guidance - there have been many changes made with little reasoning or value realized - causing high turnover and friction between Inside and Field orgs
We went from weekly engagements with senior leadership with fun activities and prizes given out based on performance metrics, to only hearing from SLT once a quarter for all hands.
Most feedback seems to fall on deaf ears
Direct manager is not capable of providing value, but there is no chain of communication to allow team members to voice this without fear of career impediment
Similar leadership challenges seem to be popping up in different departments as well, leading me to worry of the direction the company is moving in

Overall: I still believe this is a great company, and I'd like to continue a tenured career here. However, new ISR leadership has not met expectations set of such a reputable company, leaving myself and many others feeling undervalued, unsatisfied, and desiring to look elsewhere."

62,SailPoint Technologies,"Boring, unremarkable",2021-06-21,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"It's hard to explain, but I found this place one of the most depressing places I've ever worked. I wanted to believe the hype but I was disappointed.

It is a monoculture of engineering dorks. The people I worked with have no real sense of humor or intellectual depth. The lifers who have been with the company for nearly 20 years are the worst.

The product is mature and management is very risk averse. This is not a cutting-edge stack, for obvious and understandable reasons. 

The company is recruiting on reputation developed over the years as a once great place to work. Free lunches, nice office, foosball tables, etc. All the typical trappings designed to keep you in the office longer.

Since the pandemic, I'm not sure if any of those things are relevant any more. I left shortly before lockdowns, so I wonder how things have evolved.

For software engineers, I found not much potential for growth or advancement here.","Boring, old stack, monoculture, lack of growth"

Product is better than the competition.,"With the new executive leadership they have completely stopped promoting current employees in favor of outside talent. As a result there is a huge cultural and capability gap as well as bad morale as people in sales engineering have nowhere to grow. In the past 1 1/2 years every sales engineering leader has left the company and no current employee is even considered for the openings. Instead the void is filled by professional services & product management leaders who want to measure and metric every breath that you take. Pre sales organization is run by people that haven't sold a single day in their lives, but feel that they can create ""process and measurements"" to lead their teams. Soul crushing."

They campaign internally and externally to ensure you are aware of the recognition they’ve received. The Kool-Aid here is strong and the overall experience underwhelming. SailPoint has the highest Glassdoor rating of all the companies I've worked for but was easily the least impressive. The experience taught me that product-market fit can take a company really far because under the hood is a general mess of bad practices enforced by mediocre management that have institutionalized themselves believing they're the reason the company is crushing it, and not a great product. They've made it really hard to help the company scale. Even incoming executives have trouble getting things done. It's really easy for your ideas to be dismissed, which takes its toll. As an experienced professional, I felt like an intern."

Another pro is that we work with the best customers around the globe who help push us to deliver new and innovative features that produce measurable results and value for our customers.,I honestly can't think of any.

A+",There is no 401K contribution or matching.
117,SailPoint Technologies,It is all about caring,2019-05-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company embodies four core values, which are known as the four I’s.  Integrity, Innovation, Impact, and Individual.  Think of it as the four P’s of marketing, its essential, it provides a good learning framework, and it is quite catchy.  If you had to distill those four I’s down to a common denominator, into a singular ordinal, it would be the word ‘Caring’.   The company just CARES, it cares about its people, it cares about its customers, it cares about the market, and it cares about how-to improve the way it serves all of the aforementioned.","The company is driven to grow intelligently, while staying focused on its core and its values.   This requires capital allocation decisions that may run contrary to the institutional imperative which can become disruptive in the interim but inevitably it sets up the business for long-term value creation.  To the outsider, this may be interpreted as a con because it is countervailing to conventional wisdom but when reviewed diligently, it becomes apparent that strategic decisions are rooted with the mindset of sustaining enterprise value-generating and healthy long-term growth."
118,SailPoint Technologies,Good to their Employees but...,2019-05-16,4.0,Anonymous Employee,SailPoint treats their employees well. The benefits are good and they offer many family events. Pay is fair. Not the top or bottom of the industry.  Unlimited PTO but you may be too busy to ever take much of it because the company is doing so well. Working from home is sometimes an option. Breakfast tacos once a week and a good supply of snacks and beverages in the kitchen.  The employee stock purchase program was a great idea and allows employees to get a small discount for stock purchases.  Fabulous Holiday party.,"The company does not have many women in C class positions (minus the standard HR and Marketing) and that won't change. They have several very qualified women on staff that for some reason are not COO or other C level even though they should be. This is why my rating of career opportunities is so low. 
SailPoint is a bit too Christian for my taste. All company meetings take place at a Christian church and before you say 'that's the closest large meeting place' let me add that the one time it was booked, instead of choosing another available location close by, the meeting was shifted to another Christian church several miles away. The Chaplain that the company employs will not accept your 'I'm an atheist' message and will continue to come by your desk periodically.  
The location is a bit out of town and that is a bummer but if the right job, definitely worth it."
119,SailPoint Technologies,Typical corporation,2019-05-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The direct deposit is usually a day or so earlier than actual payday.

Mark M is the best CEO. Although the company has grown rapidly, he still does his best to take a personal interest in people.","As others noted, there is a glut of managers and a dearth of leadership. Post IPO, corporate types came in and began nepotism hiring. SP has managers with no management experience and none in the field they manage. The expected micromanagement is now the rule.

Transparency has been abolished. While this is understandable at higher levels given SEC rules, Management under C level is unnecessarily covert.

The reason for 1 star overall rating is the micromanagement, preferential treatment, disregard of and disrespect to employees, and the corporate infection that killed the previously collaborative environment where employees were treated like adults. 

Career advancement path has been abolished and seemingly random promotions prevail, despite lack of qualifications. Generally, you must be in a clique."
120,SailPoint Technologies,Dream Job,2019-04-25,5.0,Manager,"With growth comes opportunities and I've seen a lot of internal promotion. Coming to work isn't something i've dreaded the past two years, which is a genuine first for me.","The company is maturing as it continues to grow and I can see this has impacted a few of the long timers who enjoy working in that startup environment. For me this isn't a con, but it's something to look at to make sure we don't lose the soul of who we are as a company."

It's great to be treated like an adult and not micromanaged to death. I've had nothing but positive experiences with all my coworkers and the executive team. People here are smart and want to make this company succeed (which is clearly happening). 
The culture here is unlike anywhere I've worked before and is really fantastic! There are so many opportunities to socialize and get to know your coworkers at company events held in and out of the office. Getting to know your coworkers through these social functions is great, and helps foster collaboration across departments and to just meet people that you may not otherwise due to your work duties. There are many family friendly company events, as well as volunteer opportunities to give back to the Austin community. 
I truly am always saying positive things about where I work to friends and family - which is a change from past jobs.","This is not unique to SailPoint - and it is just that at times work can be stressful and busy. However, there are so many resources and helpful coworkers to keep things fairly manageable.

1. Leadership - thought leaders, leadership having very clear idea on leading the organization
2. Culture - virtues, values and ethics
3. People - the workforce that’s always self-motivated and keen on learning new things, innovation. Always ready to accept new challenges.

SailPoint is strong in all these 3 segments. I am part of this company since last years now and don’t have enough of words to express all the Pros in this company.

The only definition of SailPoint that comes to my mind is - it’s and FAMILY of people all over the world that believes in core values & ethics of SailPoint.","None really, except the minor ones that come along with the unexpected high growth of any organization.

The 3rd year everything began to change. My product was constantly hit with severity 1 grade issues at all times of the day. Technical leadership began having to  work on the weekends. Very little effort was made to stabilize and scale the system, yet more and more customers were being signed.","Little career movement:
- There simply just aren't opportunities to grow your career at this company. The senior developers have all been there since the beginning of the company or are best friends of the people who are at the top. You can make many lateral movements, but vertical movements were just non-existent. 
Technical Decisions:
- Technical decisions on my product were made by a sole entity. As we all know, this is just not how things should work. Architects should have final say but the decisions should come from a group of developers to make the ""best"" decision for the product with the budget, time, and resources available. The technical decisions led us down paths that were questionable and full of technical debt. 
Final Straw:
- Manager became a snake in the grass. She would say or do one thing and then slate us with tons of work. She never worked to help her employees and only work towards pleasing upper management. Honestly, I watched this manager throw people under the metaphorical bus so many times it became the norm. You always had to watch your back."

Here are some of the pros:

+Good, cohesive culture within Sailpoint. Classic dev vs sales vs services vs support battles still exist, though it's not beyond understandable that each team has different interests. 
+Select very strong individual contributor performers across all divisions, however, there is no sense of superiority or arrogance by those individuals, overall. It's quite pleasant to see, actually. 
+The product continues to evolve, and evolve for the better.","-Cross-org transfer is not something that is in practice supported. In theory, ""yes."" In practice, rare. Instead, once you're in your seat, you're pretty much stuck in that seat for a while. Upward career mobility is merit-based, though slow, however if you come in as a developer, and wish to move to Services, or vice-versa, the challenges of doing so are higher than average compared to other companies. Most people just give up and quit. Be absolutely sure you want to be a ""developer,"" or a professional services engineer, or a sales person for 5+ years -> forever. This may ease up at some point, though was not the case when I left.
-Demands of the company can grown very fast, with some waning at times.  Hiring is sometime matches the demand, other times painfully behind, other times a bit ahead. There are other factors too such as budget, and investor pressures. Crunch mode can come really fast, and then a lull, and then fast again.
-Salary increases have been woefully small in the last couple of years. 
-Office musical chairs seem to be happening every six months. Don't bring in expensive art work or nice furniture."

And they don't make you feel guilty doing any of those things either.
- No micromanagers. Management just cares about you getting your job done. The rest really does not matter that much. Of course your hours according to position have certain expectations of availability and in-office attendance, but they are all very reasonable and super flexible with you.
- Hands-off approach to leading employees creates a company culture of self-motivated people who want to do excellent work for the company because they feel loved and cared for.
- TONS of smart people. I feel like the sky is the limit for my growth potential in a technical role. I am super happy with the different career paths readily available to take.

- Flat hierarchy, accessible leadership, open-office policy, makes you feel like you can approach anyone in a higher position at any time.
- I've had multiple conversations with our CEO already and I've only been here for a few months! Super nice guy, very genuine, approachable, full of life and personality. 
- GREAT compensation & pay. I feel well-paid for what I'm worth with my skill
- fast moving pace with great company culture.

- Free lunch on Wednesdays and breakfast tacos every Friday!","- Free snacks in break room aren't very good. Can we change it up and not have just animal crackers and pretzels in there all the time? (First-world problems)
- Health benefits aren't the greatest. Co-pays are significantly higher for the types of medical specialists I need to see. I noticed a significant price increase in co-pays as compared to my last job with United Healthcare benefits."

209,SailPoint Technologies,"Amazing culture, Amazing People.... The company as a whole is just AMAZING.",2016-07-15,5.0,,"Culture, many companies in Austin preach culture yet most of them don't actually practice it. Mark and Kevin are by far two of the best people to work for. I could go on and on and on about the perks of working here but I would probably have to write a novel (at least a short story essay).","If there is a con here I have yet to find it, so as of now I could say nothing."
210,SailPoint Technologies,"BEST company to work for, hands-down",2016-06-17,5.0,Director of Corporate Communications,"This company constantly blows me away -- the people are so smart, so kind, so hard-working, so FUN, but are equally results-driven. And this comes right from the top - Mark (CEO) and Kevin (President) lead by example in a big way. They genuinely care about their employees and want them to enjoy coming to work everyday. I appreciate that more than ever. As an indicator, two days into my time at SailPoint,and I told my husband: I've found my 'work family' -- my team simply ROCKS. I love everything about the job, the company, the people, the culture.",Honestly? I can't think of a single con.
211,SailPoint Technologies,"Good to work for, until you don't",2016-06-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Management is attentive.  Good salary compensates for weak benefits.  If you know what to expect when working for a fast-growing tech company, you won't be disappointed.  And if you also know what to expect when that company is owned by a Private Equity firm, even better.","Benefits are really very terrible.  If they offer you equity (via grants or options) please read your Restricted Stock Agreement carefully and pay attention to the Repurchase clause when you join this company.  A repurchase option greatly reduces the ""value"" of any equity offering, be warned and account for that in your offer negotiations.  They can and will repurchase your equity upon your departure, guaranteed.

Also, there was a big internal push for positive Glassdoor reviews and CEO recommendations while I was working there.  Interpret that however you like."
212,SailPoint Technologies,College New Hire - Services IE Review,2016-06-02,5.0,Implementation Engineer,"The people are great to work with. Management recognizes if you've been working hard. If overworked, they practically make you take a day off. As a first job, it's a good environment to learn how the real world works. There are plenty of learning opportunities, and, if you are vocal about learning, there are opportunities for ""shadowing"" other jobs just to see other aspects of the business.

The company culture is pretty relaxed. Working from home is available though working in the office is sometimes just better. PTO is lax (no set number) and is up to manager discretion. They will be tracking it, but as long as you aren't taking advantage, the manager won't say no to a request.","As a billable resource, there is not much room for internal projects. This makes it difficult to learn more than just by observing during the ""shadowing"". Also, sometimes you get stuck in a particular niche and become an expert on one topic. It's hard (but not impossible) to get into different topics since you are just used as a rock star for that topic."
213,SailPoint Technologies,Happy to be here!,2016-03-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"SailPoint is a great company. The leaders a genuinely kind people who live the corporate values every day. The space is great, with free perks like breakfast tacos, beverages, fun events, etc. Great vacation policy (flexible) and shared offices instead of cubicles.

214,SailPoint Technologies,Mature Software Development Environment,2016-03-07,5.0,,"SailPoint isn't a place for brogrammer's and the environment here is a stark contrast to so many Austin startups.  It's filled with many talented folks who have figured out how to check their ego's at the door.  Everyone here understands what we're driving towards, and that we're all in it together.  The teamwork here is outstanding.  Maintaining a proper work/life balance here is very realistic.","The office location is somewhat far away from the larger collections of technology companies in town, however that in turn makes for a more enjoyable commute (which can be hard to find in Austin).  There's also no 401k match."
215,SailPoint Technologies,Great company to be onboard with,2016-02-29,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great company culture, friendly staff, flexible work schedules and opportunities to grow and develop in rapidly expanding organization.",Due to the high growth procedures are often a work in progress.  Sometimes it is not always clear but this can be a good thing which allows for innovation and updates to be made as required.
216,SailPoint Technologies,A fantastic place to work if your values aligns well with SailPoint values,2016-02-29,5.0,Product Line Manager,"- An executive team that has been together for over 8 years and has had multiple exits.
- Very little politics at the top level, meaning people below them don't have to pick mommy or daddy or uncle's team unlike most large enterprise software companies. SailPoint values people focusing on the problem and does not waste time or talent on internal fiefdom issues.
- An established product that is a leader in the market and two new products in the pipeline. 
- Rapidly growing company but with a healthy starting point
- Mature leadership - a strong collection of veterans focused on the enterprise market
- Strong emphasis on growing leadership - they actually invest time + material not just figure of speech (like ""people are our best asset"" blah blah). The best i have seen (yet) in Austin.","- SailPoint has sort of isolated itself for a long time. It is slightly out of touch with the rest of the leading software creators in terms of technology. I see this as an opportunity for the right candidate, YMMV.
- The other cost of isolation: unlike most software companies in Austin, we do not have a culture of humble-brag. There are a lot of software companies in Austin getting lot more credit for lot less. This is our own challenge, we are starting to figure out how to market out strengths without coming across as arrogant.
- The company has more senior talent that younger engineers. This will correct over time but coming in, one should be aware of it."
217,SailPoint Technologies,Best Place I've ever worked,2016-02-29,5.0,Senior Manager,This company has figured out how to excel at both innovation and customer satisfaction simultaneously.

SailPoint is a great place to work. I think the number one reason why SailPoint is a great place to work is the leadership. All the way from the CEOs down to the managers. They do a traffic job and really understand the identity market and how to run a technology company. 

- SailPoint is a fun collaborative place to work.
- Lots of perks and a friendly environment
- Lots interesting problems to solve","- No 401K Match

I like being surrounded by so many smart and driven people. What really makes this job one of the best I think I'll ever have is how great the people are. This company attracts great talent, but also just genuinely good people who I enjoy working with day in and day out.

Free lunches on Wednesdays, breakfast taco Fridays, fully stocked beer fridges, snacks and drinks in the break rooms, and company events are perks we get here.

The company has grown substantially in the time I've been there, and is still growing at a double digit rate after 10 years. I've gained 20 years of experience in the 5+ years I've been there. I would have had a 401k match if I stayed at IBM, but I wouldn't have the breadth and depth of experience I've gained at SailPoint.","With high growth comes a few pain points. At times work can be demanding, but I think the CEO & President do a good job acknowledging and rewarding exceptional effort and encouraging extra time away from work in less busy periods. Like most fast growing companies, office space is an on and off problem. The Austin office is a bit crowded now and some days it is hard to find an available conference room."

The people here, individually speaking, are of a very high caliber; you simply do not find underachievers at SailPoint.","There is a lot of work to be done, so the hours can be long at times.  Still, it's better to be busy than bored.  If you're bored and you work for a tech company, you likely won't be working there very long."

The senior leadership has a proven track record or growing a couple of companies and is continuing their strong track record here. The biggest things that keeps me here is the quality of my team members. Other than the occasional mishire, most everybody here is talented, easy to get along with, and wants to do a good job.","Hard to keep the bar so high and keep up with the expected growth.

Mark and Kevin are great. They know everyone's name and their contribution, they value input and even after 10 years they are always smiling and excited for the next success story.","Growing quickly- too much work in some areas, but I trust that Leadership has a plan.

I know many have read and heard about the ""cult like culture"" strong companies have.  SailPoint is one of those companies..we strongly have each others back and are one awesome work family.  We still really take hiring seriously... because if you don't fit into our fun, hard working, kooky culture then, well, you just won't!","We are growing so fast, we are struggling with the growing pains of going from a small company to a larger company.  Mark and Kevin are really dedicated on doing what we can to maintain our culture.  Something I know will continue to keep SailPoint strong.

Upper management makes it a point to get to know each employee and ask for feedback.

The competitive pay and benefits package are rare in such a struggling economy.  The expert talent acquisition and retention are exceptional.  Furthermore, all the people you work with are themselves interesting and engaging.  There's a common thread we all share throughout SailPoint, and that is taking pride in our work because everyone on our team is making a difference.  We produce superior products and strive to improve our products, customer's experience and day-to-day work-life.  The integrity of our leaders is reflected in the quarterly results, and apparent after hours and at the 'water cooler'.  We enjoy what we do, and we're the best we can be.  SailPoint is a positive influence in a world of uncertainty, or traversing waters of uncertainty.","The unknown and exciting short term future of our Company.  The company size and maturity to expand our mission across all geographies is delicate and vital to realizing our success.  As the company grows to welcome the demands of our customers, precious steps must be taken so as to adapt and scale gracefully.  Naturally, changes are surfacing that challenge our leaders while they reflect on the past and focus on our future together.  Even though I may never know of the options, choices or reasoning behind their decisions from my station; I am confident in our leadership and where they are steering the company.  I gather this 'Con' is not having a crystal clear view from the bridge.  I've learned to deal with that in the past, such as worrying about quarterly lay-offs, year after year after year.  Wisely, SailPoint leadership communicates more than enough to all staff and keeps all our channels of communication open!"
