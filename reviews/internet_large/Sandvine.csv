The company has been constantly evolving both its technology as well as people and process wise. I have been part of transformation from waterfall to agile with scrum, going from 1.0 Architecture to 2.0, evolving from DPI to Network Intelligence and now Service Innovation. 
Lately Sandvine has been making good progress towards support of 5G deployments, as well as Cloud - both VNF and CNF, and I believe it has good momentum.
As a new Software Engineer joining us you will have the opportunity to work on various platforms and learn new skills. You will be challenged and encouraged to grow. If you are in the beginning of your career you will find others more experienced ready and happy to help, and first level managers which are good coaches. Management has an open door policy, so talking to someone at my level about your experience and ideas to make things better is possible any given day, and appreciated - we only succeed together!
If something like Cloud Native or Kubernetes has been on your list, now you can work on it. If your interest is more towards Analytics and Machine Learning, we have open positions for that as well. If you think Security is interesting, we are evolving that.
We know you have many choices for your career, and part of us being here is to make sure you can contribute and share in Sandvine's success and future as well!",Remote work only at present time but that will change once pandemic is over.
51,Sandvine,"This is a sinking ship, stay away.",2021-05-06,2.0,Software Engineer,"It may be suitable for anyone interested in a mediocre job that provides no career growth and pays little. Bonus tip: Your job can be outsourced to India, so stash some cash already :-)","In short this is a sinking ship, stay away. If you can not find any job ""WAIT"", do not join this crap company.

Engineers: It's not a place where people engineer products. It's where engineers just sit and waste time. If you join this company and then later try and look for a new job, one question is common: What is the biggest challenge that you solved? You won't have any answer for this one. You will learn almost nothing in this company. So don't even consider this as step for something better in future.

Middle management: These people are equivalent to ""shepherds"", their job is to get something done out of demotivated engineers. Anyone who can herd sheep is promoted to manager. Even worse, people who only know how to herd sheep and have no engineering talent whats so ever are managers at this company. And these ""shepherds"" constantly undermine good engineers who can make a difference. So that makes more demotivated engineers and people leave. 99% of good engineers have left. Now there is just sheep left, waiting to become shephards.

Upper management: Now this is the cream of sandvine. No outsiders allowed. You don't get promoted to VP etc. You got to be a school friend, best buddy with other VP's (outside sandvine). Nepotism is not a strong enough word for this group. Upper management is a group of toothless people and their job is to keep their job safe. So they do ideas / products that they know will fail, but continue just so that they can buy a few more years for themselves (not company).

Execs: Have no idea how to run a company. One disaster after other. Burning VC capital, lol that must be fun."
52,Sandvine,Fantastic Product - poor leadership,2021-05-06,2.0,Business Development,The platform should sell itself,The company is 100% top down and all decisions are made with no involvement from staff (regardless of how senior they may be)
53,Sandvine,Problematic at best,2021-04-18,2.0,Anonymous,Flexible hours and some good people still left,It often seems their only goal is cost-cutting. This is reflected in all the R&D jobs being moved to Bangalore. They have also been laying off their highest earners and distributing the workload amongst existing employees. High turnover rate is a direct result of overworked employees who are paid less than they deserve because the company withholds promotions. Morale is low.
54,Sandvine,Terrible and destructive culture,2021-04-14,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,Nothing I can think of.,"The company was way better before the merger.

The culture is terrible from top down. 

There is a very apparent lack of leadership in management. There is no clear direction and strategy on the products the teams are building. An executive member was hired to increase revenue generation, but all the initiatives implemented so far seems to indicate that cost reduction is primarily focus. And it is very noticeable that the engineering power is slowly moving from North America to Bangalore.

There is a lack of transparency. There is not enough context provided on why certain decisions are made (e.g. restructuring and moving teams around). Many of these decisions have been causing way too many inefficiencies.

This has led to projects being run in a very dis	organized way, and introducing too many dependencies from other teams. Unfortunately, each team is more focused on their own success instead of the company’s success, so it requires a lot of politics and time to get collaboration from other teams. And every decision requires endless meetings with everyone.

On top of that, there is a concerning lack of technical skills in many directors and managers. Most of them speak as if they were experts, and undermine any engineer who try to challenge their approach. Major technical decisions are not been made by technical experts (architects, senior software engineers), but instead these are decided by a few people in power. This lack of transparency has created a culture where new ideas are not encouraged, and individual contributors do not have ownership of the project. 

With regards to career development, there is no clarity on how your performance is evaluated. It suppose to align with the goals that you set with your manager. But apparently it is based on your “ranking” compare to other people in your level. But no one knows who and how are people being ranked.

To sum it up, it is a very toxic work environment."
55,Sandvine,There is nothing good here.,2021-04-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some of the people are great, but without offices or travel, it's not enough to stay.","Upper management and the senior leadership team refuses to be held accountable and aren't interested in making a difference or fixing issues. There is a clear exit strategy: put everything they can into profit, regardless of ethics, in order to make the company look appealing enough to sell. Clearly, it hasn't been working in their favor as it's now 3+ years into their new ""strategy"" and they are still struggling.

It's an Old Boys Club where nepotism will get you further than competence. Many good leaders have left because of this and it's clear based on the amount of turnover over the last 2 years that others feel the same. If you aren't a ""yes man"" to the senior leadership team, your days will be numbered or you will get demoted. 

Ethics don't exist here. Look at what happened in Belarus and that tells you everything you need to know. 

HR is incompetent and sides with management in all cases. Don't brother bringing up anything that needs to be addressed because it will get shut down if one of the ""boys"" gets wind of it. There is no culture here and it is a shell of what it once was. HR clearly pushes people to write positive reviews, so take that how you may.

Salary and benefits leave a lot to be desired. 

There is no work-life balance. You are expected to work weekends if your manager contacts you, even if it's a non emergency and can wait until Monday."

All that remains is the new management team who will also be gone the moment it financially pays off for them (and them alone).  No real innovation is coming from here anymore.  The order of business is maintain appearances, cut costs and shine it up for the sale."

Lots of favoritism, Director here points out their favorite ones and using his powers gives all the perks like better ratings and hikes irrespective of work they do. 
If you are not in his list of favorite one then be ready for very low hike irrespective of your performance.
Moreover there are high chance of getting laid off too. Moral of the story is keep licking or never raise voice against anything. 
If you are working in global team (team which operated or works for all Sandvine products) then be aware and be ready for escalations. People love to escalate things and they will portray you are always culprit for delay in release.
HR team operates like an government work; always sleeping. 
Only thing they do here is writing good reviews on Glassdoor.
Management doesn't appreciate or recognize people here. They don't give any awards or no service award either. 
Once you complete 5 years you will get extra leaves but ironically it will get lapsed as you won't be able to use it due to work.
Very pathetic HR policies.
There is no communication between management and employees. Recently they conducted a survey and got shock about what employees think about Sandvine. Management played cleverly by asking employees to give solution so that if it doesn't work they are ready to blame each one of you as your suggestion didn't work.

It is an abysmal working environment.  You will be treated as a grunt and expected to follow their Sandvine way which is complete nonsense as they apply it.

Actually you will be working almost 16 hours daily for the company, and you will compromise your vacations, weekends, and granted public holidays. 
The company claims zero politics but there is a huge well established political group which never allows talented people to rise professionally within the company. This group provides daily updates and micromanage people. The time you come in, go out, and breaks are counted.

A normal employee is stressed out with manipulative practices from managers (both India and Waterloo offices) like asking to do unreasonable loads of work, credit stealing, disrespectful comments and behaviour, and abuse.

1) All the products are propriety & company don't follow any of the standards in making the products
2) Hectic work & need to spend long hours in completing the work

I have joined Sandvine irrespective of the above reviews & these are my experiences

Obviously its a great company to work for & coming to the Standards not followed on the products, Initially for one of the product there are no standards followed, but now this is getting standardized. Also all the other products are developed/developing based on the standards.

Then coming to the Hectic work, I guess this will be there in many start ups. But I had a talk with many of the employees who were here since long time and got to know that the work will hectic only during the release & depends on the product as well. Obviously if the customer has to be satisfied, there should be some extra effort required.","At this point I don't see any cons as such, will definitely post if I come across"
252,Sandvine,A Great Place To Work,2015-04-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been at Sandvine for the past 6 years of my 14 year professional career, and I have no intention of leaving.  At Sandvine I get to work with an extremely talented group of people, on a variety of interesting projects.  People are friendly, helpful, and appreciative of your efforts here. 

I have worked at a variety of different companies from startups to one that dwarfs Sandvine, and after a while you can get a sense or feel for how a company is performing, both in terms of the market, and towards their employees.  In the six years I have been here at Sandvine, things have been getting better and better.  These days, this place feels like all cylinders are firing and we've got great momentum.  There is a palpable energy here that is only present at a company that is on a winning streak, and it feels good.  

I decided to write this review because yesterday I was walking down the hall at Sandvine, and I spontaneously found myself thinking, ""Man, I love my job.""  I'm feel lucky to be here during this exciting time.","We work hard at Sandvine, and sometimes you have to suck it up and put in the hours to get the job done.  This may mean sacrificing personal/family time on occasion.  If this is something you are uncomfortable with, this probably isn't the place for you.  

I personally don't consider this a significant con though. You're going to have to work hard at some point during your tenure at any company.  It's no different at Sandvine - what is different from many places, however, is that we celebrate our successes, effort is recognized, and employees are rewarded.  If you are driven, Sandvine is a great place to show off your effort."

So much so that they stifle creativity and progress.

There is also lots of preferential treatment. You either kiss a** and have it easy no matter how poor of an employee you are or you don't and are mistreated, abused, and eventually let go or quit.

On Day1, you would be meeting individually with the entire staff of Sandvine, which i feel is a great practise because everyone recognises you from the day one, and it avoids the awkward feeling of being a stranger among the crowd when you share the table with them at some point of time. 
The coworkers are also smart enough that you get the feeling that this is the right place you are meant to be.
The quality of work is good and combined with the pace that you are to do work, it definitely boosts your career.
And ofcourse, who wouldn't be pleased with getting free food and drinks.","It seems the timeline that is given to finish a feature is too short that you would have to work extra hours almost everyday that leaving home early would become history to you.

264,Sandvine,Make a well informed choice,2014-09-30,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Finally I decided to take some time off and write a review. Not to rant but to help others make an informed decision for their career. Sandvine is a company having a good product and lot of talented engineers. The top management is experienced and capable to steering company to success. Good work culture, flexible working hours, opportunity to work on latest technologies, industry standard pay and free food are of avail. When Sandvine started it's center in India it was a great place to work. These were the reasons I joined Sandvine during the time when Sandvine started it's development center in India. I enjoyed working for the organization for most of the time I was with Sandvine. While Sandvine Canada continues to be a great place to work, unfortunately India center couldn't keep up the goodness it started with.","As I wrote in the ""Pros"" section, Sandvine India started great but it couldn't maintain the initial spirit to stay a great place to work. Within two years ""club of well connected"" have took over the control of Sandvine India to most extent. Though zero politics is one of the Sandvine ways but in it's not the chosen way in Sandvine India's day to day activities.
Sandvine hired many talented professionals, managers and engineers, but most of the talented engineers and managers either moved out or forced to make a move. Many times engineers will be asked to do odds jobs. Not because of business need but to sideline the engineer so that the favorites can be given good pie and their accomplishments can be highlighted.

Most of the reviews invariably mention longer work hours and slogging during weekends. Management will give an excuse that Sandvine works a startup company but it is all due to wrong effort estimation and poor planning by the management. If successive projects slip the schedule by weeks or months even when more resources were pooled in, it is only due to gross mismanagement. India management has no clue about code complexity and only looks into number of lines of code when it comes to effort estimation. And the result is that whole team slogging over 10 to 12 hours on daily basis. At the end management pushes the blame to engineers.

Managers are more into micro management rather than understanding the complexities of the technology and product that can help them plan projects better. But they are all interested in giving very tight (most of the times, impossible targets to please the masters in Canada).

When Sandvine started in India, all the good activities like lunch and learn sessions, idea generation and innovation generation were promoted and practiced regularly, but all these activities eventually stopped and all you are expected to do is fixing bugs.

The top management is experienced and open. Even few senior people in India office are very good but most of the control is highjacked by a set of ""well connected people"" who aren't open to an honest feedback. So forget about difference of opinion!

Sandvine India was planned as a development center but has reduced to a service center."

2. Poor management experience: Management is mostly made up of people that have been there 10+ years directly out of school and are set in their ways. Best management practices are only stumbled upon and not developed.

3. Lack of planning: Many times the engineering dept has been left trying to fast track new product development becasue there was not sufficient planning on EOL parts on existing products. This resulted in EOL parts being bought on e-bay and products pushed out long before they are truely ready for a tier 1 network. Engineers are expected to suck up the overtime and dont complain. 

4. Lack of support: There is no career development. Its sink or swim. Your training is on the job and dont expect anyone to train you about the product. 

5. Lack of architecture: Dont ask for an architecture diagram or document. They dont exist and the architects like it that way. Causes mass confusion for all developers and makes it very difficult to understand the whole system. 

6. Low quality tests: They have 1000s of tests, But the infrastrucutre is so unreliable they only have to have a single PASS of each test after dozens of executions. It takes over a week to find regressions. Near a release,  many testers repeat tests executions multiple times until all of them PASS once. 

7. Departmental fifedoms: there is a constant struggle between all departments and very little collaboration to work together. Causees stress and conflict and drags productivity down.

8. Lack of Product reliability: Sandvines equipment is often placed in tier one networks, but their system is not robust to failures. Fault tolerance is not designed into the product and as a result, a small army of engineers comb through the hot issues on customers networks daily.  Its not profitable to add reliabilty so they throw people at it and bill it as support contracts.   

9. Customers force Sandvine around. Sandvine sells to some very large corporations. As a result Sandvine has had to spend a lot of extra efffort back porting features onto older releases which they were not designed for. A lot of wasted effort for a single sale (although  a large one). 

10. Product space is heavily regulated: Sandvine is a DPI company. Prorotcols change and break regularly. But the main thrust of their products is on Usage Based Billing. The public is largely against UBB and govenermetns heavily regulate network operators. This environment causes very slow changes in network management which Sandvine advocates. However buisness is great in less regulated sections of the world. You can find skype calls blocked thanks to Sandvine."

+ Free lunch/evening snacks/beverages.","Guess the positive reviews down were propaganda posts from someone closer to either HR or the newly promoted AVP.  I see lot of false praises in those posts which can't possibly come from neutral employees.  
 
- Zero trust on employees. Highlight is that recently they went to an extent of getting 'writing confirmation'  from every team member working in a project that ""assigned work will be completed on time"". They have problem in trusting their own employees.  
 
-Management do not take any responsibility/ownership should a project slip time lines. Entire blame would befell on the poor developer for none of his/her fault of wrong estimates or incomplete requirements passed down. 

-Things follow hierarchical order from top down. No opinions/suggestions are considered from bottom to top. AVPs and Managers in Bangalore are too scared of their Canadian counterparts may be the fear of their jobs.  
  
-Lack of product vision. They have started and scrapped lot of projects.  

-Job insecurity. You may be fired any time for none of your fault but even due to project budgeting reasons or to show up quarterly earnings.  And in the subsequent quarter, they will start hiring again  and even encouraging employees for referrals.  Doubt any saner organisation would do.  About four Directors have left the organisation in the last one year and some of these have left or fired within months they joined. 

-No parity in pay scale and it is not even based on performance. Average hike of 6 or 7 % max."

I've seen a lot of change over the years, some good and some bad, most necessary to adapt to no longer being a startup.

If you are an ambitious person, and want to work in a certain area - you are empowered to do so. The less you need management because you know how to find work and excel, the more the company will like you and the more opportunities will open for you. Do the right thing, work hard and you will thrive. If you expect work to be doled out to you, someone else to help gauge your priorities, then you're less likely to succeed there. I love this.
If you are a leader and believe in zero politics - then there is ample room for growth at Sandvine","There is higher attrition in engineering amidst senior roles. I expect this to come from a couple of problems:
- Management: People managers are somewhat iconic. I suspect that they don't have time alloted to people managing (people managers are also project managers who have a ton of work), so managing an employee's mental health, how much you're working, are you over working, are other managers over working you, etc.... doesn't really happen. The end result is people who show themselves flexible and who don't say 'no' get serious amounts of work and responsibility. Leads get leaned on heavily.
- They really expect you to pay your dues before getting promotions/salary raises.
- Worth noting of course that I haven't reported to everyone, so take it for what it is....the above is at least what I experienced."
