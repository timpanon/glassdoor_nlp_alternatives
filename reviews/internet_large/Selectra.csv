22,Selectra,Poor management,2021-06-06,1.0,Sales Executive,Nice colleagues . . .,Many pitfalls in losing commission which are almost impossible to miss
23,Selectra,The good reviews are written by the company not employees,2021-06-01,1.0,Sales,"Anyone can work here. No experience, education or references are required.

Quick hiring process due to jaw droppingly high staff turnover rate. 

Permanent contract offered however most people quit within a few weeks

Work from home allowed to save on energy costs for the company","All call leads are generated by false advertising, no one means to call the company. You will spend 8 hours a day explaining this to misled callers. Your main task is to force the callers to sign up to a contract and collect as much personal information from them as possible for the company. You will be told to pretend to listen to their problems even though you have no understanding or power to help them and try to  ""help them"" by signing them up to another supplier which does not solve their problem. The whole system confuses you so you don’t know your working in a scam. 

Employees have no technical knowledge of telecoms/energy. The company promotes the cheapest and least effective suppliers. Clients almost 100% of the time have issues changing or setting up the new contract and there is nothing you can do to assist them when they call back and the customer service numbers for the suppliers do not answer. 

The commissions are paid by how many contracts you make per hour and the tariffs are impossible to obtain. You will have to sell additional products such as insurances or newsletters which are often sold to clients without their consent. 

The call centres are all based in Spain due to cheap labour. Their strategy is to employ French people who moved to Spain to work for them as they are not established so will need money for rent/living and can be easily exploited. The pay checks do not add up and the company will steal from your salary/commissions by changing the tariffs or compliances. 

The Moroccan call centre makes the most sales due to pressuring the clients and lying to them. These people are paid even lower than the centres in Spain. It’s common for these individuals to be racially abused by misled callers. The other calls you will receive are from these clients calling back to complain about being scammed.

The managers have a very low level of education and are usually sales agents that got promoted to business developers due to internal office politics. They are the individuals who have had to keep the job due to personal issues and money problems due to immigration and thus have to make the sales targets and got promoted. These types of people are often at the lower end of society. The training they give you contradicts itself, they are highly unprofessional and blackmail you with the promise of money/comissions. Bullying, harassment and inappropriate behaviour is rife among managers. They behave like highscoolers in a popular clique but in reality are just insecure young adults. 

The working culture is shockingly childish. Emojis, Gifs and memes are used to communicate with staff. The general working atmosphere makes you feel like a 12 year old in school and having your work graded and criticised unfairly. It’s extremely difficult to take the job and it’s management seriously. 

The salary for this job is very low and not worth the effort.  The job itself is highly unethical and very draining. To be good at this type of work you would have to have been a scammer in your previous job/life before joining here."

50,Selectra,Stimulating and enriching experience,2020-10-20,5.0,Country Coordinator,"Selectra gathers the advantages of a startup (friendly & young environment, flexibility, no long/annoying processes nor strong vertical hierarchy) and those of a SME with clear ambitions, strategies, processes and a long-term vision.
 The top managers are accessible and easy to talk to, and the company offers real possibility to evolve. A great experience overall if you're young and willing to learn.","It's not for people expecting to always be taught what to do and how to do it, you need to be autonomous, self-starter, and flexible."

If you have no problem with shadiness and taking advantage of people's confusion, disadvantages or ignorance then you are what Selectra is looking for.","Borderline fraudulent, illegal behavior. I have no idea how the calls get diverted to this company (not one call was looking for Selectra specifically, it was always confused British people who thought they were calling their provider or an ACTUAL energy service provider - I mean how many times have you ever dialed the wrong number?) but whatever query the customer has you can't do much other than give them the number they actually needed in the first place, and in the meantime, you must convince them to switch tariff. The company won't tell you to lie, rather be misleading or elusive from the truth. Where that stands on your moral compass is up to you."

58,Selectra,Working for some months,2020-01-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Selectra is located in Madrid and will be the perfect place to develop your professional skills in a young and dynamic ambiance. It is a relatively new company. They are growing very fast and there are internal promotions for new positions. Working well you can have a very good salary. Good relationship with your colleagues.,"There may be times when you have to work under pressure, but as in any job."
59,Selectra,Super unprofessional workplace,2020-01-06,1.0,Teleoperador,None that I can think of.,"High staff rotation, low, very low pay, commission structure changes every time the company needs it to, communication is non existent, Team Leaders think that they are in some sort of mine and that the call agents are they're workers, the way people is treated there is not even humane. Having to ask for permission to go to get water, to go to the bathroom, to stand up in order to stretch the legs. Being on the phones all day long stressful after stressful call, Employees are seen only as machines and we are good until stop producing. There's no training, no real training, everything is learned on the go. Compliance is everyday harder, seems that everything is designed and set for the call agents to fail. Facilities are extremely poor, from the cafeteria to the bathrooms, there's two cleaning ladies for a massive building, desks get clean once every 3/4 weeks. It's genuinely shameful to be running a company in those conditions. Little AC in summer, little heating in winter, everyone sits there with their jackets on. No flexible hours, no flexible permits of any kind. Whenever you have a complaint and you go to your supervisor or even to HR, your complaint is heard and then dismissed."
60,Selectra,Inbound sales executive,2019-12-03,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Every employee has the chance to make good commission,"Little room for error during your onboarding like most startups.

Completely unrealistic expectations in reaching the higher commission bands. The company is a complete scam. “Price comparison” is a lie, they only work with select few companies. Absolutely ridiculous company to work for. You are just another number to them. They don’t care about your pay check, they just care about lining their own pockets."
62,Selectra,Worst company to work for,2019-11-05,1.0,Sales Associate,Really liked the people that I worked with,"Poor working conditions, aggressive and forced ways of selling.
A scam company with a dishonest and unethical environment.

65,Selectra,Terrible work conditions and atmosphere,2019-06-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Easy training and good location,"KPI performances are unrealistic, staff can't be trusted. Poor working conditions. Since Spain has terrible work regulations, an 8 hour and 30 minute workday with a 30 minute break included seems reasonable to them for what you get paid"
66,Selectra,happy and fulfilling experiencie,2019-04-29,4.0,Human Resources Generalist,"Autonomy, responsibility, innovation, co-workers, team spirit, compensation & benefits",lack of interaction with other depts
67,Selectra,Great people with great opportunity,2019-03-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There is a long list of pros I could go into, The wages, the opportunity to make a lot in commission is also outstanding, more than I ever saw or heard of in the UK for the type of positions selectra offers. Progression is one of the most appealing aspects of selectra for me. There is no end of chances to grow, develop and progress. I came to Spain to find bar work or to teach, but ended up in a job that could turn into a career! The people i work with is also a huge positive. Colleagues that are now good friends.",Not much interaction with the other departments.
68,Selectra,You make what you want to make,2019-02-28,5.0,Energy Consultant,"I'm grateful to be in such a lively work environment where I can make money and have fun at the same time, I've only been working here less than 2 months and my last paycheck was over 3k. If you put the effort and mind to it you can make as much as you want, is up to you how much you like to succeed within the company.","The amount of taxes they deduct from your salary. I know it's not the company's fault but the Spanish government, but thats another topic I should not get into."
69,Selectra,Selectra UK - horrific working environment with problematic management,2019-02-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Easy to get work here if you are a native English speaker from the UK,"My time at Selectra UK has been by far the worst of my working experience. The company offers empty promises of opportunity and completely lied about salary during the application and interview stages.

The management is the biggest issue in the team, facilitating an environment that is dominated by boys and allows unfair treatment towards women. Threats of cutting pay were often made as well as putting in place unrealistic KPIs as a way of docking your pay. There was no training of any kind of quality given when first starting the job, however management is quick to pass blame to sales individuals when certain targets weren't being met.

A lot of these problems come from the management's inexperience in their role as well as their attitude towards workers, especially women. Strong performers aren't rewarded with any sort of progression in their role and will instead be reprimanded for having a bad week (essentially being treated like machines). The role itself is mentally draining as you spend the entire time on the phone, selling gas and electricity tariffs to people who have often called by accident and are vulnerable. Scamming tactics were often encouraged, where we were advised to withhold important information or straight-up lie to callers in order to get a sale. There was never any opportunities given to do other things as part of your role that will allow you to grow within the company, even to those that are performing the strongest.

This was by far the most depressing, hostile and unorganised environment I have ever worked in and I would not recommend it to anyone.

To clarify, this review is for the Selectra UK team and its boss. I can not comment on whether this is experienced in other parts of the company"
