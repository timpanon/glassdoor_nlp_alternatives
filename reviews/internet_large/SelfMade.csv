- Coworkers are smart and incredibly friendly
- Lots of opportunities for growth 
- Everyone pitches in and helps each other
- Plenty of autonomy
- A lot of different projects to take on, leading to learning new facets of a startup
- The leadership team pays a lot of attention to its employees and any problems or concerns they might have. No matter where you are within the company or your career, you'll have a voice. This is especially marked by an open door policy.
- REMOTE FRIENDLY!","An obvious con is that it is a startup so it is a fast-paced environment that is not for everyone.

The company had planned to lay off the entire Austin office for potentially weeks but thought it was appropriate to show up and fire everyone with a day's notice and an insulting severance package. It was cruel and tacky. These positive reviews are frequently solicited from current employees to bump up scores. The kids in the NY office spend more time playing beer pong and meditating than working. It's no secret, it's all over their Instagram stories. They also give out crystals as rewards. Yep, crystals. Somehow an amethyst is supposed to fix the fact that I was barely able to live off of that income. 

Creativity is stifled in favor of crunching out work and hitting difficult numbers. Problems are ignored and shot down even in ""open forums"" and employees who voice concerns are encouraged to shift their attitudes. You really only get anywhere in this company by trying to become a favorite and agreeing with everything or from piggybacking off of other people's ideas and work. It's the worst place I've ever worked and has almost soured my perception of startups as a whole.  The only reason I'm writing this is to keep others from wasting their time and talents in this place. It really takes advantage of people and this company will most likely sell in a cash grab when funding runs out."

285,SelfMade,Awesome company and incredible co-workers,2019-12-10,5.0,Delivery,"I’ve worked at SelfMade for about a year and a half now. Overall, it’s honestly been the best job I've had. I’ve worked at startups in the past so the “no job is too big or too small” work mentality wasn’t foreign to me (though it’s evident that it’s an adjustment for some). The difference of this office from others I’ve experienced in NYC is the culture. Startups are tough and the culture can quickly become toxic or uncomfortable - SelfMade has done an amazing job of taking the hardships and coming together in a way that everyone really feels like they’re playing a part in the solve. 

When we closed the Austin office the shift was uncomfy at first but after the dust settled it was pretty obvious to most that it was the right move. The team feels","stronger because of it. 

There are areas to improve (i.e. delivery could be more seamless, etc.) but in general I like coming to work everyday and feel like I'm learning a lot."

- Stocked kitchen
- Cool co-workers
- Interesting concept","Where to begin........
- First, I was part of the mass lay off when they shut down the Austin office
- Major decisions are made in a split second
- CEO is so underqualified to run a company that it is laughable (he was a high school teacher of ETHICS [no ethics in this company] and a meditation coach [issues within the company are solved with meditation and sound baths instead of business consultants and fair wages])
- Severe favoritism and sexism
- You will not grow in your career here, as it is not a marketing company but rather a revenue machine that is not making revenue 
- Dishonesty is rampant: employees are kept in the dark and then told to lie to customers
- Underpaid and unfair raises (see above point about favoritism)"
287,SelfMade,Belittling Place to Work,2019-10-09,1.0,Content Strategist,"- ClassPass
- Cool coworkers
- Interesting clientele","- Low pay
- Poor middle management
- CEO's leadership was uninspiring and misguided. He rewarded people with crystals instead of paying them what they're worth

291,SelfMade,This Is A Real Review Not A Fake One That They Paid Someone $10 To Write,2019-09-16,2.0,Sales Development Representative,"AMAZING coworkers, I have never loved people so much and they have truly become my out of work friends. 

I have learned so much from working here. 

The office is conveniently located and good benefits.

If you're fresh out of college, great first job to have.","-Customers are treated so poorly and the sales team is told to ignore someone after signing them up (they're going to tell you this has changed but it hasn't)

-To fix reviews (on Google too - go check them out) they said they were going to pay people on the streets of Little Italy $10 to write them but instead I believe they just made up fake accounts and wrote a bunch

-Any problems that there are they blame on the fact that it's a startup. Now I have worked at startups before and there's a difference between change/growing pains and the people in upper management having no idea what they're doing 

-CEO has a threaten & intimidation mentality. I can't tell you the amount of times I've heard him say ""accept this or leave now"" 

-When you bring this review up in your interview they will brush it aside and say that there are growing pains cus it's a startup and it's not for everyone but that things are changing and people are so happy here and always hit their goals etc. (they lie, a lot, even though they always say they're transparent)

-They fired the entire Austin office to ""cut costs"" on what seems like a whim"
292,SelfMade,Challenge and Support,2019-08-13,5.0,Sales Associate,"SelfMade is an energetic space with a constant, intentional focus on improvement, both personally and organization wide. There is a lot of room for challenge, especially at a start-up that is as dynamic as SelfMade, but there is enough support to make you comfortable with trying new approaches to old problems. The level of creativity and ingenuity in the office is unmatched by anywhere I have worked previously.","There is a certain level of stress that comes with a job this fast-paced that will always be there. It takes a bit of time to adjust to the expectations associated with the role and while they are attainable, it takes a lot of work to get there."
293,SelfMade,SelfMade Rocks,2019-08-06,5.0,Operations,It’s a dynamic place that is constantly growing. The people are super supportive of each other and everyone is in it to create something incredible for our customers.,It’s hard work creating something new.
294,SelfMade,Overall fun place to work,2019-07-12,3.0,Senior Sales Associate,"Very  laid back atmosphere, nice people, benefits, dog friendly office,","The typical ""Stick to the script"" cold calling sales gig.  The value of services offered"
295,SelfMade,The best job I've ever had but a lot of people don't feel that way and I understand why.,2019-07-10,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Honestly can say I look forward to coming to work everyday. The people I work with are smart, supportive, funny, and motivated. I've made some very good friends here that will last a lifetime. I'm talking the level of friends that will help you move, or notice when you're having a bad day. I try not to take it for granted, there are a lot of people that don't have that privilege on a day to day basis. 

- Great environment for learning. A lot of people in this company started with entry level jobs and have been promoted due to their performance and growth. This could be looked at as a negative, but to me it promotes a meritocracy of sorts. This is exactly why people join startups and why startups exist. Good work should be promoted, not the bullet points on a resume.

- Values driven mission. Ultimately SelfMade is trying help small businesses grow. This is a GOOD thing. If we are successful this is good for the world. Huge wealth consolidation leaves small businesses at an inherent disadvantage for growth. The playing field isn't even and ultimately SelfMade's goals is trying to help even out the playing field a bit.

- Generally it's a place where you can be yourself. In a lot of work environments your aptitude and performance can often be judged based on secondary personality characteristics instead of how effective you actually are at your job. I feel here at SelfMade people's uniqueness has been celebrated and generally employees feel like they can be themselves.","- Transition in company's offerings have affected different teams more negatively than others. SelfMades goal since the beginning of 2018 is to help small businesses grow. Our main offering was generating content for instagram (images and captions) and posting it for people. As we realized that this alone could not guarantee demonstrable growth we made the decision to widen our offering to include all sorts of marketing solutions (emails, ads, website audit etc). For some the transition has been exciting. A chance to learn more, offer a more effective solution, build a wider array of tools and services. But the majority of the work and pain of the transition has fallen to the brand managers, a large contingent of which are in our Austin office. To a lot of the brand managers the transition seemed like ""more work, same pay."" I think this is totally fair. A lot of promises were made that over time they would have less customers and it would be more about managing a ""book of business."" But in the meantime people saw their workloads increase by like 75% without the perception of support from engineering and leadership. The end goal I ultimately think is a better, more fulfilling job that actually really helps our customers but the transition has not been handled well and I can't fault the employees who it affected the worst for feeling that way.

- Efforts can sometimes seem scattershot. There are a lot of balls in the air at once. When you have too many things to focus on this leads directly to feelings of stress because you don't feel like you are in control of your day to day. Like I said before I think this has affected brand managers more than anyone else.

- Austin office and NYC office are a little too detached from each other and I think this has had a negative impact on culture. A big part of working with people is trust and sometimes it feels like the Austin office has little trust in management and leadership in the NYC office. This makes sense when you're only communication or exposure to leadership is a once a week all hands meeting. I hope we do a better job in the future of cross pollination between NYC and Austin."
296,SelfMade,"Dynamic start up with great people, great perks, and a great vision",2019-07-10,5.0,Manager,"- Supportive, young, enthusiastic team. Coworkers are friends outside of work without it feeling cliquey. We all genuinely like and care about each other.
- Amazing perks: 20 days of PTO every year (effective on your first day), fully stocked kitchen, covered medical, unlimited sick time (a lot of companies make you use PTO if you get sick)
- Monthly team nights to have fun together outside of work
- Opportunities to be involved in shaping the direction of the company as we grow
- Interesting field - we work with e-commerce entrepreneurs, representing a variety of unique brands and products
- Autonomy to manage your own time - no clocking in and out or micromanaging
- Excellent work is recognized and achievements are celebrated
- Management listens to concerns and works to implement positive change. Direct managers are accessible and helpful, and the CEO sets aside weekly office hours so you can speak to him directly if you want to.
- Upward growth of the company overall as new offerings, procedures, and team leaders are added. As a young company, turnover is expected, but new team members and the ones who have stayed are contributing to positive growth.","- As a startup, the company is still figuring out what we're doing and how, so things can be messy. There aren't clear paths and procedures in a lot of areas.
- There can be more work to do than people to do it, so everyone is very busy and some team members feel overworked or burned out. This is not a job where you can just show up and sip coffee and wait for 5:00 to roll around. Every single team member makes a valuable contribution - which is a pro! - but if you're looking for an easy paycheck with minimal effort, this isn't the place for you.
- There can be a disconnect between Austin and NY offices, but efforts are being made to remedy this."
297,SelfMade,Truly A Mess.,2019-07-02,1.0,Brand Manager,"Pros: 

- Perks. You get ClassPass which is awesome. You also get a kitchen full of food, snacks, booze, etc... There are also monthly team nights and lunches. 

- The Culture. The culture in the Austin office was incredible. Such a great group of people to work with.","*Disclaimer: Over 5 brand managers have left this company since changes have been implemented. I sincerely wish that I had read the REAL Glassdoor reviews of this company before accepting my offer. Most of these 5 star reviews are FAKE, written to hide the real reviews. I really want to caution anyone who is considering being a Brand Manager at SelfMade. It is a very unethical company that is being driven to the ground by people who have no idea what they are doing. 

Cons: 

- Upper Management. Upper management is by far the most incompetent group of people I've ever met. This company only has ONE C-executive position, and that's the CEO. The other management positions are filled by people that have ZERO experience and have no idea how to run a company, be professional, and be on a team. I have had instances where my manager would ignore clients because they did not want to deal with the issues. SelfMade has terrible management and this has unfortunately trickled down to everyone else.

- Work Flow. I was a brand manager and it was the most frustrating job. When I joined, they said our book of clients would be around 45 people. Since then, the cap is taken off and we are managing books of 60+ clients. In addition to the job description, SelfMade added a completely other responsibility (ads creation/management) to the already overwhelming job with NO pay compensation. There is no work-life balance, get ready to be constantly stressed 24/7. 

- Company Outlook. SelfMade claims that it manages social media, specifically Instagram but this is very misleading. The only thing that they do is create Instagram posts and that is all, no Instagram stories, no replying to comments, no liking other images, etc... This is NOT social media management, but a very SMALL part of it. SelfMade has not effectively mastered their ""post-a-day"" offering and instead of focusing on the issue, has tried to extend into other areas of marketing such as Facebook/Instagram ads and email marketing. By not working out the issues on its original offering, the quality of work has gone drastically down and the employees are getting extremely overworked."

The company is the brightest and most encouraging place I've ever worked. People really care about each other. We care about building something that our customers love and we care about building a big business. At SelfMade, there are different teams -- sales, product, operations and delivery -- and each area has their own mini-culture. They have all changed a lot over time. But it's all SelfMade. 

I've been here since the beginning (January 2016) and we're at the best place we've ever been. We have a new focus now (April 2019) and we're moving really fast to build something that changes the world.",The biggest areas for improvement at SelfMade is about keeping everyone informed about all the changes and keeping everyone connected.
301,SelfMade,Can it be a hot mess sometimes? Yes. But will you love it? Yes.,2019-04-24,5.0,Product Designer,"Listen, I could write a whole book on working at SelfMade. I've held a few different job titles and been through quite a few iterations. I've seen pretty amazing high moments and some pretty crappy low moments. But now, more than any other point before, I truly believe SelfMade is cracking the code on helping small ecommerce businesses while creating an incredible culture. 

Our team has changed a lot recently, but ultimately for the better. Everyone who currently works at SelfMade (to the extent of my knowledge) is excited and passionate about helping our customers, building powerful products, and supporting one another. It definitely has not always felt this way, but recently I love coming to work more and more each day.

There are all the cool benefits (we just got Class Pass!!!), a chill office space, work-from-home ability, and a pretty clear path to success, but the people are what makes working here so awesome. They're funny, they're smart, and they're generally good people. If you're down to have ""work friends,"" you're bound to make many here.

SelfMade can definitely be seen as ""another startup in NYC"" but right now our team, Brian's vision for the future, and a new re-commitment to our customer is setting us apart. I'm stoked to be here.","With all those pros being said, it's not all roses! It still is a startup. It can be stressful. You may feel overworked or overwhelmed, so you have to be good at managing your time. There's a lot of changes that come at you really fast so you have to adapt faster than may be comfortable. Because of this, the big vision, as well as transparency into changes, haven't always been great either. But they've all ended up being necessary. 

I say all this, yet even a year ago things were much more unsure and seemingly unstable. The overall position of our team and company now feel much stronger."

-Team nights monthly.","-Things get shaken up. A lot. Change is frequent but usually in a positive direction, just tends to be jarring. 
-Communication between NYC headquarters and ATX office can be shaky at times. 
-Job is less about being highly creative, more about offering efficient service. This can lead to burnout if you don't manage your time correctly. 
-Pay is below industry standard. This is par the course for a startup, and the tradeoff is perks and stock options, but as for money now this is certainly a detriment. 

The company is largely still figuring itself out, so if you don't have faith in it you will find yourself conflicted often. Worth noting that when there are major issues that are voiced, they tend to be resolved  (although not always quickly)."

There is a reason that they are constantly in a state of losing employees.

Not one coworker that I interacted with expressed any interest or pride in SelfMade's product. The overwhelming majority aspired to be elsewhere. Many of the Brand Managers -- who are at the heart of the service that SelfMade offers -- regularly commented on how laughable it was that they were running Instagram accounts for small businesses. As a startup, SelfMade should attract and hire young innovators who are interested in business and the tech sector, and who are invested in working hard and selling the product. Instead, SelfMade seemingly randomly and haphazardly hires anyone that can talk about how much they love posting nice pics on Instagram. It creates a culture where nobody seems to want to be there, and everyone seems to be using it as an opportunity to go somewhere else. 

The company is quite small, and somehow the leadership is cold and inaccessible. There is an intense culture of random favoritism, whereby certain employees are publicly commended and others are publicly scolded. One of my superiors was constantly gossiping and spreading rumors about coworkers. Others superiors shamed me for my eating choices, my clothing, and how I chose to organize my PERSONAL gmail account. I felt constantly bullied and monitored.

I made truly lifelong friends here and loved the fully stocked kitchen and friendly, hip office environment. 

NB: if you are interviewing for the content strategist role, it will be sold into you as a copywriting and strategy-based position. This is not true: It is writing Instagram captions. No more. No less. You are given a quota of captions you must write per day (~100 captions), ranging from 3 words and an emoji for a fashion influencer to a 3 paragraph treatise on the benefits of colon cleansing for a doctor. If earning a $40k salary to write IG captions all day doesn’t bother you, it’s a great role. This is the type of gig that would work for someone who has something solid going on on the side and therefore doesn’t actually value their day job/career development very highly. 

Overall: great 6 months here. Made great friends. Ate lots of snacks. Learned a lot about Instagram and the influencer world. Would I have stayed beyond 6 months? Absolutely not.","Working hours are quite literally ridiculous. People generally get into work at 10am and then there’s a morning meeting meaning the day doesn’t really get started until 11 — as a result, you are at work every day until 7:30 AT LEAST. I stayed until 8:30-9 at least once a week, and team members in other roles often stayed even later. 

You are very underpaid. 

Management plays favorites massively and if you are not one of them, your ideas will not be listened to. Barring the tech team, I don’t know anyone in the other teams (sales, account management etc.) who likes their boss and feels that their career development is being prioritized."
