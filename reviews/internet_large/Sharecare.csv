As a company, we all seem to try to deliver the best products, service levels and be responsive to our customers.","It can be difficult as you grow to have everyone ""in the know"" when processes are being created and changed. Over the last year, we've had executive shuffling in our division; each time someone new is brought in, the teams have to train the new person and almost reset entire projects/initiatives. When new people are brought into lead new people, the knowledge gaps widen even further, especially when teams are silo'd. With that said, many of our mid-leaders have been in their positions for a long time & do not move up; not only does this cause some of the knowledge gaps we see but this is also limiting growth opportunities for our entry-level colleagues."

Sharecare creates a diverse, positive, passionate culture and community even with all of us remote coaches. They truly care about our well-being... they don’t just preach about work/life balance. 

Flexibility with hours is a great plus. You have room to start when you want to (within reason) and can take a break in the day to run an errand, go workout, etc. Our caseloads make us busy, yes - but I'll be honest.. it's really not that bad and the stress is quite low despite our caseloads.

Zero micromanaging, fun events, great leadership, and a friendly work environment.

I read a negative review on this forum about our CTO. I strongly disagree with that review, and in fact would like to state that without the current CTO, Sharecare would not be where it is as a company today. He has been pivotal in building unique, quality products that truly differentiate Sharecare from its competitors.

-Pay - I've had a bonus and a pay raise without ever having to push for it. Unlike my last company they'll pay you as much as you earn/deserve, they won't try to underpay you just because they can.
-Culture - everyone works hard but also believes in playing hard and they respect your time off; if they ask you to do something when you're off or on a weekend, it's rare and will be followed with a lot of thank you's and ultimately adequate compensation or additional day's off
-People - everyone is very nice and they only hire people who are nice people. I was told they believe you can find good talent but what's most important is good people. This is my first company that I've actually enjoyed going to happy hours",It's still a growing company so sometimes you come up with some people who are busier than they should be and getting them to respond and help with things can be difficult.

97,Sharecare,My experience at Sharecare,2021-05-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"PAY & BENEFITS
Good. Higher than average, even when just starting out. Affordable medical care + dental and vision, so full package.

WORK ENVIRONMENT
Overwhelmingly positive. Very upbeat even though things move at lightning speed around here. Also, very collaborative with a strong emphasis on teamwork.

CULTURE/COWORKERS
Some of the most optimistic, solutions-oriented, intelligent, creative people I’ve ever had the honor to work alongside. We’re like the Avengers of healthcare.

MANAGEMENT
Surprisingly friendly and welcoming. Their doors are always open. They value feedback and take criticism well.

WORK/LIFE BALANCE
Difficult to find at first, but it’s not as bad as you would expect from a start-up. Dedication is key and an understanding of your own boundaries and needs.

OVERALL
A great company to work for with lots of opportunities to grow and learn.","Few to none. Not every day is perfect, but the cons are so insignificant it’s hard to remember any I’ve experienced."
98,Sharecare,Fantastic Learning Experience,2021-05-24,5.0,Marketing,"I can’t speak to anyone else’s experience, but mine was nothing short of wonderful. I grew exponentially in my career, learned more about my craft, and honed my marketing and sales skills. My direct supervisor was a huge support for me and I’m grateful for all of his guidance and advice.","I loved the start-up environment at first, but it just wasn’t for me in the long-run."
99,Sharecare,My ideal work environment,2021-05-23,5.0,Software Engineer,"I’m not going to sugar coat it, it’s a challenging, fast-paced environment and it’s not for everybody. That being said, if you’re the type of person who eat, sleeps, and breathes digital health and loves what you do, then this is the place for you. Everyone here is dedicated to the company’s mission and excited about the work we do. If that doesn’t sound like you then do us all a favor and don’t apply. We only need more exceptional and passionate people.",None. I absolutely love it here. It’s the perfect work environment for me.
100,Sharecare,They take care of their people,2021-05-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I’ve been with Sharecare for some time now and it truly stands out as a fun, exciting and safe place to work. Everyone gets along with each other, management cares about each and every employee.

The culture at Sharecare is fantastic. The company is always looking for ways to be a leader and is constantly seeking to evolve and innovate. 

It also takes great care of its employees. Whenever someone has a family issue or emergency, the team pulls together to help out and keep things going smoothly. 

I am personally aware of two separate occasions when a Sharecare employee had a family crisis with a financial component and everyone in the company banded together to help out. 

Finally, there are excellent opportunities for career development and growth within the organization. I have seen many people rise from entry level positions to positions of much greater responsibility in just a year or two.","They do their best. They don’t always make the best decisions and I’ve disagreed with them from time to time over the past 5 years, but they always try to do right by us and be open and honest and I appreciate that."
101,Sharecare,Plenty of help and support,2021-05-19,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"Everyone in the office knows their stuff. If you’re ever stuck or unsure, they’re more than willing to help out. It’s a very positive, uplifting work environment that makes it very easy to focus entirely on providing clients with the best possible service. Unlike other platforms, Sharecare is extremely reliable and very high quality, so it’s easier and less draining working in customer service.",Which shift you get can be a total grab bag at the beginning. It’s all the luck of the draw.
102,Sharecare,One of the best! Inspiring!,2021-05-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"One of the best companies you could ever work for; The extensive amount of training they put you through prepares you for any challenges you may face. They essentially have paved a golden path to meeting my career goals and overall success. I can absolutely guarantee they will provide more resources than any other company you will find. I fully believe applying for Sharecare was the greatest decision I have ever made. I never thought I would be where I am today, and I owe it all to Sharecare. Expect to be Inspired!","I got exactly what I needed from my experience at Sharecare and so much more but I realized after a year that there was really only so far it would take me. I know for a fact that that wasn’t the case for several of my colleagues, but I can only speak to my own experience."
103,Sharecare,Great career prospects,2021-05-18,5.0,Health Coach,Sharecare is a company where you can fully establish your career. Managers are great about checking in with everyone on their career goals and making sure you’re on track to meet your targets and eventually move up into the position you want.,Very fast-paced environment and high expectations on a daily basis.
104,Sharecare,Great Comapny,2021-05-18,4.0,Care Manager,Flexible hours and great earnings potential,Many policy changes. Must be very adaptable to change.
105,Sharecare,Work place full of discrimination,2021-05-18,1.0,Human Resources Consultant,Work from home and flexibility,"I read the reviews before I started especially from the former HR Generalist. I should have listened as I was the third HR representative in this position since Feb 2020. Sharecare has absolutely no diversity and inclusion. Their culture is discriminatory. I witnessed discrimination based on race, religion, gender identity, gender, marital status, and education. When I brought these issues to my supervisor I was told ""that's just the people we employ here.""  I was ""severanced"" after it was known that I filed an EEOC complaint because it was disclosed to me that someone within the HR department made discriminatory and defaming comments about me. When brought this to my supervisor, no investigation was done. Let me repeat, no investigation was done!!  When I followed up with my supervisor the response was ""I did not say that.""  It was never told to me who made the comments; however, it appears the guilty always try and defend themselves and clear their name first. As the previous HR Generalist noted, you can not have any morals if you choose to work here. Not only can I not recommend Sharecare as a place to work from an HR standpoint, but I also cannot recommend it as a place to do business with."
106,Sharecare,A company where you can start at the bottom and work your way up,2021-05-17,5.0,Data Analyst,Sharecare has been a great company to work for. I started in an entry level position over 7 years ago. I have been able to grow my career over the years with many opportunities for advancement. My hard work and determination was noticed and appreciated by upper management. The company stresses the need for a good work/life balance and it has allowed me to spend time with both of my young children at home. My team at Sharecare has been just like family to me over the years. I couldn’t have accomplished even half of what I’ve achieved without them.,I can’t think of a single thing at this moment that I haven’t loved about working here.
107,Sharecare,Making a difference,2021-05-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I can’t say enough good things about Sharecare. From the moment I was hired on I’ve had nothing but the best experience with everyone at the company. My colleagues are some of the most intelligent and creative people I’ve ever met. Management has gone above and beyond to earn my respect every single day, and there’s no better feeling than being part of an organization that’s make a significant difference in the medical industry during a global pandemic.","There isn’t as much upward mobility as I would like, at least not in my department. It’s frustrating, but also not a deal-breaker because my salary has increased every year."
108,Sharecare,Positive & Friendly,2021-05-16,5.0,Sales Specialist,Positive environment. Lots of fun. Great culture. Very fun staff. One of the best companies I've ever worked for.,It was time to move on.
109,Sharecare,Disingenuous and Duplicitous Management,2021-05-13,1.0,Senior Web Developer,"Great team members to work with, until they started getting laid off.","Disingenuous, duplicitous management at most levels, but especially at upper levels. Endless rounds of layoffs despite management assurance after each round that it ""was the last one"". On the rare occasions that raises were given they were insulting while at the same time Sharecare was getting millions in bonuses from clients for performance. I know this to be true because I sat in more than one all-hands meeting where they announced these huge performance bonuses from clients and then handed out insulting raises and began massive layoffs. Definitely a ""the bottom line is the bottom line"" company you want to steer clear of."

112,Sharecare,Took a chance on me and won my loyalty,2021-05-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I understand why most love working here while others struggle. Sharecare is one of those companies where you have to pull yourself up on the strength of your own merits. You’ll get plenty of help along the way, of course, but unless you’re willing to work your butt off and I mean REALLY work your butt off, you’re going to hit a wall. I enjoy working at Sharecare because I see it as more than just a job. It’s my career. If you have anything less than that type of mindset, I suspect your experience won’t be as positive as mine.","Like I said, if you have a different mindset, you’re probably going to have a completely different experience than I have."

115,Sharecare,Ex-employee with nothing but good memories,2021-05-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Even though I left the company recently I don’t have any complaints. I’m not sure if it’s the norm for ex-employees to write 5 star reviews, especially since people will probably think “if you liked it so much why did you leave?” but I only left because I wanted to go back to school and pursue a different career path, and that choice had nothing to do with working at Sharecare specifically and whether or not I liked working there, which I did.","There were a lot of thing I liked about working here actually: the people, the pace, the mission, and the paycheck wasn’t too bad either. Leaving was a gamble, and even though I don’t regret it, I also don’t have any complaints about my time here or anything negative to say about the company in general. Honestly, all things considered, it’s a great place to work."
116,Sharecare,Managers DON’T hover,2021-05-05,5.0,ROI Specialist,"Once you know what to do, they trust you to just do it. You’re not watched over like kids at a daycare center. Don’t even get me started on how frustrated I got at my old job for this exact reason – it’s literally the reason I left. Thankfully, it’s the exact opposite here. Managers trust you and leave you alone to get your work done. No hovering. No micromanaging.","It’s not perfect. I like it WAAYYY more than my old job, but I don’t get along with every single one of my coworkers. Some of them are just lazy."

118,Sharecare,Great company for recent college grads,2021-05-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Like any college graduate my job prospects were low after I got my diploma. Sharecare hired me on even with my limited work history. If it weren’t for the time I spent here I wouldn’t have been able to beef up my resume and move on to bigger and better things. Sharecare was never my end goal. But as far as stepping stones go, it was more than I could have ever expected. It was an incredible learning experience and I wouldn’t be where I am now if it wasn’t for the time I spent here.","The pay wasn’t spectacular, but it was more than I probably deserved with almost no work experience under my belt."

121,Sharecare,My review,2021-04-29,5.0,Marketing Specialist,"Sharecare has a quintessential start-up vibe. It’s very exciting and fast-paced, but the environment is friendly and welcoming. There’s plenty of perks like free healthy in-office snacks, fun company events, flexible hours, good benefits etc. If you’re looking to help create a company from the ground up and revolutionize the industry, there’s nowhere better.","It’s still very much a start-up, so you’ve got to be prepared to work hard… and I mean HARD. We put in the hours and the energy every week."
122,Sharecare,Great first job,2021-04-28,3.0,Health Coach,Great people and the management is very supportive,heavy workload and constantly on the phone
123,Sharecare,Bait and switch,2021-04-28,1.0,Former Employee,Please look elsewhere this is not a place to work for.,This company showed me that corporate HR’s are out for the company not the employee. In my over 20 years in corporate I’ve never seen a company support a culture of self preservation by any means more than Sharecare.
124,Sharecare,More pros than cons,2021-04-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Thorough and effective training 
Constant mentorship and guidance 
Plenty of opportunities to push outside your comfort zone and grow professionally

Amazing coworkers",Expectations are high and hours can get long when it’s crunch time.
125,Sharecare,Metrics-oriented health company,2021-04-26,3.0,Health Coach,Getting to work from home and speaking with clients throughout the country,Employees and health coaches aren't valued by the company and there is rarely an opportunity for internal growth and professional development.
126,Sharecare,Good medical records company with a high market share,2021-04-22,3.0,ROI Specialist,"Currently remote work. Good support of setting up remote office. One-on-one training, from scratch. Apparently good base pay with good commission structure.","Job is deeply complex, and yet training program is haphazard. Software tools are proprietary and buggy, requiring workarounds and continually training on the tools. Sink or swim in the first three months."
127,Sharecare,Fun and exciting start-up atmosphere,2021-04-18,5.0,Account Executive,The office environment is practically electric. Things move at lightning speed around here and there’s always a new idea or projected that’s being pitched. It’s the perfect environment for creative types.,The workload is intense at the moment because management still needs to fill a handful of key positions.
128,Sharecare,Busy call center short staffed,2021-04-18,3.0,Medical Records Call Center Agent,"Great team in the call center, good benefits, possible work from home which is in the testing phase",Pay rate is low for the work we do. Manager is more concerned about how long your on a call if its longer than 3 minutes than providing great customer service. If you dont want to use your PTO and would rather not get paid if you have an unexpected absence they won't let you. No sick days. Used to have an incentive if we met monthly goal but you dont get the 100 if you call out. They changed it and decided to deduct $25 if you were out a day which only lasted for a month and they took that away because of too many unscheduled absences. You can't be out at all for that month to get the full bonus. We work so hard and get criticized more than recognized
129,Sharecare,I miss my colleagues,2021-04-17,5.0,Customer Service Representative,It’s a chill job staffed by the coolest people you’ll ever meet. You know that adage that talks about “giving you the shirt off their back” when describing someone who’s really nice? That’s how it was here. If I was cold and shirtless I’d have a couple dozen shirts…all joking aside I really loved working here.,New employees tended to get the long end of the stick when it came to shift preferences.

132,Sharecare,Pretty flexible,2021-04-11,5.0,Customer Service,As many reviews have pointed out the schedule is pretty flexible. That said it’s not the most exciting job in the world. Processing medical records can get boring after a while. That aside it’s a healthy organization to gain experience and begin stacking the building blocks for a career.,It sucks when you work with colleagues who don’t really take their jobs seriously. It makes me question why they’re even here.
133,Sharecare,Great company,2021-04-08,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,Large company with well defined roles,"Has grown very fast and no longer has the ""family"" feel among employees and managers ... still a great company"

135,Sharecare,I can’t imagine ever wanting to leave Sharecare!,2021-04-07,5.0,Sales Manager,"Here are 10 reasons I love working at Sharecare:
Everyone in the office feels like one giant family.
We’re all passionate about and motivated by the company’s mission of making healthcare more accessible.
Management is always hosting fun company events and team-building exercises.
We get plenty of hospital perks and discounts.
No one is paid less than what they deserve and there’s no favoritism or discrimination.
You have the opportunity to work from home.
The work never gets boring because no two days are ever the same.
Your work hours are flexible and managers are understanding of family emergencies and doctor appointments.
The dress code is casual and so is the way we interact with one another.
You’re given full autonomy in your role, which makes it feel like you’re your own boss.","It’s hard to think of things I don’t like about Sharecare, but if I had to come up with at least one I’d say that the company could make it easier to use your accrued PTO."
136,Sharecare,Proud to work for such an outstanding company,2021-04-06,5.0,Sales Manager,The starting pay is really good for anyone jumping into the workforce right out of college. I may eventually leave for a higher paying position in a few years but for now I’m content. The job has its ups and downs but every moment I’ve spent here thus far has made it all worth it. If I had a stamp of approval I’d give it to ‘em.,Communication isn’t the greatest but it’s something they’ve taken a stab at correcting.
137,Sharecare,No,2021-04-03,1.0,Behavioral Health Coach,"Work from home, pay was ok","Everything else. Company atmosphere, stressful job talking to people that don't want to talk with you, cold calling people all day long, no management, no room for growth, etc."
138,Sharecare,They care,2021-03-29,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"When your time, effort and expertise is acknowledged on a daily basis like they do at Sharecare not only will you feel like you are heard but you’ll also experience a big boost in self-esteem. I feel that I’m more than a worker bee. I feel that they actually care about me as an individual. It feels great to work for company that actually cares.",Not many cons. I have nothing but praises for Sharecare.
139,Sharecare,Great for a short period of time,2021-03-27,2.0,Customer Service Representative,"Work at home, no weekends","Unorganized , problematic, low pay."
140,Sharecare,Great concept to improve health but poorly ran,2021-03-26,2.0,Health Coach Operations Manager,"Work with great people
Ability to train and develop your team
Remote position","Low Pay
Little to no professional development
No opportunity for advancement
Even as a manager I did not feel heard. I felt I had no say in how to improve operations."
141,Sharecare,The capstone on an interesting year,2021-03-26,5.0,Customer Service Representative,I’d say the only good thing about 2020 was the fact that I spent most of it working for this great company. I learned so much and now have a solid idea of what career I want to pursue. I’ll forever be grateful to the many supportive people who pushed me to be where I am today. Looking forward to another (and hopefully less eventful) year.,Local Care Coordinators have a high turnover rate. I respect the people who do it because it’s not an easy job.
142,Sharecare,Strong leadership,2021-03-24,5.0,Customer Service Representative,Jeff knows what he’s doing. He’s a true visionary and it was an honor to work under him.,"They have very high standards for their employees. Not everyone can hack it, especially people who are just looking for a paycheck and aren’t invested in the company’s mission."
143,Sharecare,Community of Care,2021-03-22,5.0,Member Service Representative,Your manager will speak into you and really help you as you work.,"As a Member Service Representative, its hard to move up in the company, unless you are striving to be an incredible asset with networking, or if you have a degree in a related field."
144,Sharecare,A stable job,2021-03-18,5.0,Sales Representative,It gave me a real sense of security when everything else in my life at the time was crumbling down around me. I won’t go into details but things were going downhill for me really fast. Sharecare gave me 40-hour work weeks and guaranteed benefits. At the time it was the only stable thing keeping me going.,Nothing too major. Far more positives than there were negatives.
145,Sharecare,"So far, it’s living up to the hype",2021-03-17,5.0,ROI Specialist,"Pay & Perks
My starting offer was much higher than I was expecting and my manager let me know that I could expect an additional raise after my first annual review if my performance exceeded expectations, so there’s that!

Work Environment
The work environment is pleasant enough. Everyone in the office is friendly and I haven’t noticed any glaring issues with gossip or office politics.

Management
I haven’t had much interaction with senior management, but my direct supervisor is an incredible human being inside and out and I enjoy working under her.

Work-Life Balance
So far, so good. My personal time is my own, and work hours are standard and consistent.

Overall
I enjoy working for Sharecare and look forward to continuing with the company for the foreseeable future.",I haven’t noticed any as of yet. I’ll be sure to amend this review later if things change.
146,Sharecare,Doing what needs to be done,2021-03-14,5.0,Sales Manager,We did what needed to be done to make the healthcare industry more streamlined for patients. Sometimes it felt like we were fighting an uphill battle but it was rewarding all the same. Working with such dedicated and compassionate peers was the highlight of my experience.,You can only rise so high before you hit a wall.
147,Sharecare,SMH,2021-03-14,1.0,ROI Specialist,"Can be flexible if you need time off. If you don’t mind to be micromanaged, could be the perfect job for you.","Micromanaged, Unrealistic goals to achieve. Unorganized."
148,Sharecare,Worthwhile mission,2021-03-11,5.0,Project Manager,"Sharecare is doing everything humanly possible to make it easier for people to be in sync with their health. If 2020 has taught the human race anything, it’s that there is nothing more important than your health and I feel incredibly proud to be part of a company that has been doing its part in the healthcare sector long before COVID-19 hit. We’ve progressed the healthcare industry leaps and bounds and created solutions that became not just a luxury, but a necessity, during quarantine. 

Digital solutions to physical problems are the norm in every other area of our lives, and over 10 years ago, our founder Jeff thought “why not health?” That one thought put us on a path that has revolutionized healthcare. I love the work we do here and the impact is has had on hundreds of thousands of real people’s lives. The work isn’t always easy and every day isn’t always fun, but everything we do here is always 100% worth it.","How can I possible write any cons to working at such an amazing company? If you’re looking for perfection, you won’t find it here. But also, you won’t find it anywhere. There’s no such thing as the perfect company. You just need to look for the company that’s the right fit for you. My advice is to find a mission you support and a company whose values line up with your own. Nothing else matters if you’re fulfilling your purpose."
149,Sharecare,Launching pad for the beginning of a career,2021-03-09,5.0,ROI Specialist,Served as the ideal launching pad for me as an undergrad who had zero experience coming out of college. College doesn’t really prepare you for this job. You learn through training and by actually working every day. The salary and benefits are competitive. There are many networking opportunities.,Dealt with a micromanaging manager when I first started on. As I gained his trust he backed off.

We have lacked in the past few years we have grown exponentially and with that, we have all the expected difficulties of explosive growth.  All of the leadership has been candid in their feedback and we are taking that feedback and have a multitude of actions to improve in the areas identified. That kind of response is what keeps me here. A willingness to accept our shortcomings and work collaboratively to solve coupled with a true caring spirit for our employees.","We are in a difficult industry where government changes can suddenly impact our overall success.  Since we are labor intensive in this industry as a whole, tight purse strings can feel constraining to employees when they are asked to produce at a high level.

Nice offices.,"The leadership team is not engaged with the rest of the company and does not share enough information for others to be able to make decisions. Many business unit leaders are hostile and create a toxic environment. There is no company culture, no strategy, and seemingly little vision. This all makes everything, at every level, disorganized. Many redundancies exist because of things being so disorganized.  People are leaving because of these well-known issues that are not being addressed."

The company's mission is to help people improve their health and, in turn, their lives -- and it's inspiring to see that in action every day. Have put a big focus on improving the culture, led by a group of employee volunteers called the Care Crew - they organize happy hours, volunteer projects, catered breakfast on a semi-regular basis, raffle off awesome tickets to concerts and sporting events -- they really do help make ""work"" more ""fun."" On a personal level, I enjoy the camaraderie and friendship with many of my fellow employees. Appreciate the strong female leadership and CEO's commitment to raising them up. The pay and benefits are, especially in this day and age, better than a lot of what's out there.","The cons... from where I sit mostly involve a small handful of vocal people who are just plain negative/unhappy in life, no matter what. As mentioned above, benefits and comp *could* be better but what is offered is pretty strong compared to the market.

- Highly underpaid for the type of work and the amount of work that health coaches do; and especially for how much the company makes per year
- Very micro-managed
- If you run out of PTO then they do a poor job working with you to make dr appointments or other urgent appointments - they will dock you

You can tell the CEO has a positive vision for the company and genuinely wants to make a difference. Generous pay and vacation days. There's a lot of great people here, but a few office bullies (male and female) can make unnecessary Mean Girls-esque drama.","They have Thirsty Thursdays and holiday parties that kind of serve as a bandaid for the fact that there's not a lot of job security. Management has no problem letting go employees with no notice or explanation. One employee told me ""I've never been to so many going away parties until I started working here."" It kind of feels like your own the Apprentice or Survivor or something. During the quarterly meetings, they talk about how great the company is doing, then a month later they laid off 30 people in their corporate office of 200! It's hard to have a happy office culture when everyone is worried about getting fired."

Benefits were a complete joke
Upper management made it a goal or objective to make sure they never left their offices or the floors they worked on to come and see the rest of the company.
Transparency was nonexistent.
Raises? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Bonuses? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
270,Sharecare,Talented employees are jumping ship for good reasons,2019-04-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Working at Sharecare is a great crash course in how not to run a company.,"There is very little transparency with the higher ups. The direction of the company seems to shift constantly to the point that employees don't even know how to describe ""what Sharecare does"" to friends, let alone clients. 

Decisions are made without consideration of how they will impact front line employees, who are left to scramble and adapt to unexpected and unannounced product and program changes. Huge components of the platform are broken or buggy, creating massive headaches not only for the engineering team, but anyone who has to sell or defend Sharecare products to clients. 

Because turnover has been rapidly increasing over the last few years, the remaining employees are spread thin and not compensated for what often amounts to a doubled workload. New hires aren't even introduced around anymore because no one knows how long they or anyone else will stay. 

Communication across teams is poor at best and increasingly hostile as teams are competing for resources and their goals are often at odds with one another. Most teams have no idea what the others do or if they're even located in the same office. 

The company's advertised mission is to help people live their healthiest lives, yet Sharecare makes zero investments in the physical, emotional or financial wellbeing of its employees. The lack of healthy snacks/drinks or incentives or subsidies to participate in any kind of fitness activity have been mentioned in countless reviews, but no efforts have been made to improve. In fact, they quietly cancelled a short-lived ""Wellness Wednesdays"" program after they fired the two women who organized it (without warning or explanation, according to the women). The only social activities are awkward and forced, and usually revolve around alcohol. After hours emails are a regular occurrence. The office is located in the most congested and expensive neighborhood in Atlanta, so most employees have to drive at least an hour to work. Raises are promised and take months to materialize, if they ever do. Bonuses do not exist. The executives love to brag about ""Sharecare wins"", but none of that success has trickled down to colleagues. A remote employee once described the Atlanta office as ""morgue-like"" and a client once asked if ""everyone always looks this sad"". 

The company is way behind in terms of supporting women. Maternity leave options, though slightly improved this year, have a long way to go to provide any real value to women and their families. Sleazy behavior from men at the top of the company is ignored when reported to managers."

In addition, the CEO generously offers up his football, baseball, basketball, soccer and concert tickets throughout the year.  They do expect you to give 100% all the time, which might mean occasional longer hours during a launch, but they reward you for your extra efforts.","Would be nice if they offer healthy snacks (fruit bowls, nuts, etc) in the kitchen."

I have worked for a company that didn't care if the paydays fell on a Sunday-make them wait, or didn't care that the person put their entire heart into their work but didn't have the skill they needed-fire them and things like that. With Sharecare, they look to make sure paydays are going to hit before the weekend if possible, they look for a place for you in the org if the current one you have isn't working out. Not to mention, looking for every which way to train you they can figure out. They are constantly looking for ways to give back to the community and encourage us all to get involved. they even have health challenges to us all to walk or run or meditate to get some balance.","A lot of change. The world of medical is a crazy place, with all kinds of things going against it and constant waves of change. Since Sharecare works in the medical space, they are always having to change things to accommodate all that. It is hard for people to get a stride when that happens. Also some of the older technology is still being used, need to get rid of that stuff and the bigger organization (I work for sharecare health data services) needs to allow for more money or resources or something for their IT-the new stuff isn't getting here fast enough)"

People Give Back events (fundraisers, walks for causes, etc)","BACTES, now Sharecare HDS has always had high turnover and that says a lot about the company if they cannot keep their people. For a company that talks a lot about their missions and values, it sure does not reflect on how it is actually run. There are definitely many areas of improvement, but the top three would be favoritism, nepotism, and politics:

Favoritism: There are employees that need some disciplinary action that is long overdue, but nothing is ever done by their direct manager or HR. They do not hold these people who are considered ""favorites"" accountable for their actions.  When issues and complaints arise regarding these employees, nothing is ever done because they try and avoid conflict due to their seniority with the  company. There is also no standardization for pay ranges, which leads upper management to give promotions and raises however they please, while others, especially hourly's, are given close to nothing.

Nepotism: Family is one of their values, which is great, but not when you have family reporting to one another. It creates the culture of favoritism.  You have upper management's children reporting directly under the same line, siblings reporting to each other and even previously spouses reporting to one another.  What truly boggles my mind are that candidates who have absolutely zero experience in the department they are interviewing for are hired as part of the leadership team, simply because they are related to upper management. 

Politics: Because of the said two areas of improvement mentioned above, it causes employees to worry about things that are outside of their job description. People just want to come in, do their job, go home and not have to worry about being liked or wonder if their status of their job or raise are due to factors that is not based on performance or attendance. You feel like you have to always put on a mask."

In fact, I had no idea what this company did for a while. It was always a ""healthcare"" company. But what kind? What do they do? We had a couple apps here, a website there, and some product. But overall, we weren't sure what our focus was. 

They have pivoted a lot. It feels like the upper-management has no idea what they're doing. It seems like they're throwing things on the wall and see what sticks. If they do know what they're doing, they haven't communicated that effectively to us. 

It's also a startup with a very corporate culture. They are trying to act like a big, traditional company, but the workload and the pace feels like a startup. It's probably because the company doesn't know what their focus is. 

Since they don't offer bonuses, the salaries are supposed to be higher to compensate for that. However, the pay doesn't seem that much different compared to the rest of the industry. 

The benefits package seems lacking. PTO days are average. They only offer 15 days with one floating holiday. They do allow working from home, but that's up to the discretion of the manager. Some people don't get to take advantage of that depending on the manager. 

Overall, I see a lot of overworked and overly stressed out people in the company.  The groups don't seem to get along and work together effectively. The pace is frantic."

Very cool space with amazing views of the city.","HR/Benefits: I've heard a lot of employees complain about the benefits - but it's not that they aren't good; they're just really complicated. Unfortunately, there isn't a real HR department so getting information about that kind of stuff can be tough - and all the other cons that go along with not having an HR department.
Exec Leadership: While the exec leaders have done a great job hiring some very impressive people, it doesn't seem like they actually trust those people to do their jobs and/or recognize when talent ""below"" them have more expertise than they do in a particular area. They neither seek nor accept advice (at least sincerely), which frustrates those managers - and it trickles down to the rest of the company. There also seems to be no rhyme or reason with titles, promotions or organizational structure; and in an effort to get more accomplished, they pit employees against one another. It can be toxic, especially when they allow some senior managers bully their employees. And because there's no HR department, there's no where to air grievances or provide constructive criticism."

The occasional fun after-work, or lunch-time party. Mostly low key. A Chili cook-off or desert bake-off, etc. Great time to visit with those you don't work with on a regular basis.

3. Departments work closely together, but their attitude is very flexible around project deliverables which can cause fires to spread in every direction.
4. Working overtime, on weekends and holidays is expected for all full time employees.
5. Management takes full advantage of their 'status' for flex work schedules, employees are under their boot in regards to flex schedules so it depends who you work for.
6. More often than desired projects can move way too quickly.
7. Project priorities are all over the place, the agile pace of development can affect other projects and stall them, which in turn affects the outcome of a quarterly performance. Most if not all fault will lie in a bottom line employee rather than management.
8. Random firing occurs, hiring is slow and this is rarely reported to employees. This is a big issue because the large scale effects of this spread throughout the company. The results take the shape of: loss of money, overworked employees, lack of performance in other departments and it can end up affecting you without notice.
