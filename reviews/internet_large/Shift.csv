0,Shift,Blindsided Layoff,2022-04-07,1.0,Sales,Sales jobs are fully remote,"The Sales organization is in complete shambles. Both the buyer and seller side are being led by incompetent VPs who have never taken the initiative to realize and understand how terrible the CRMs that sales reps are expected to use, are. 

Separately, the sales teams are paid out commissions based on deals they have their names attached to, except, it boils down to the concierge handling the appt on in the field, if the deal closes. I've heard of concierges purposely not trying to sell high end sports cars at appts so that they can drive them back to the hub while enjoying them -- I kid you not. You tell me how this is the fault of the sales reps. 

The COO Sean Foy seems to think he knows what he's doing, and if you interrupt him or disagree with him, well let's just say, you've tainted your career at Shift."
1,Shift,V ery good job!,2022-04-06,5.0,Car Salesman,You were able to work by yourself and with customers a good mixture of both.,The hours could be late at night.

Nothing is ever told to the employees you basically need to figure it out yourself
They fire people constantly"
3,Shift,Hectic and constantly changing,2022-04-04,3.0,Assistant Manager,"The job is engaging, challenging, and constantly changing. You learn something new every day and have to come up with new and creative ways to solve problems and approach new situations. Lots of opportunity for internal promotion/growth.","Very little communication between upper and lower management, and between different departments. Little to no training or warning regarding policy/procedure changes. Little to no consistency with directives and expectations from managers and senior staff members."

Being full time remote is major plus for people who are not tied to a hub.",No 401k match. Less growth opportunity unless you're a white male or you pull magic out of the air. High demands from leadership team. The company feels disorganized at best of times.
8,Shift,50/50 rating,2022-03-10,3.0,Lead Service Advisor,Super chill environment to work in. Easy going. Good people to work with. Benefits are fantastic like health insurance vacation accusing and sick time.,"Lots of promises but no action. Lots of bandages on problems but no actual fix to the issue. This is a tech company selling cars, meaning Human Resources is all online. Very tough to get things handled efficiently. Repairing the cars is done in a ghetto way. Rape and tape paint jobs / partial paint jobs / Lots of bondo / drilling holes for pdr work / spray painting wheels 😳 like really. 😑. Mech work is good. But management basically only cares about numbers. Bot about their employees. No bonuses. They like their employees to work multiple jobs but not compensate them market value. Management like to have u work on your days off (recon side)... Many more issues."

18,Shift,Not bad Not good,2022-01-13,3.0,Lead Distribution,"The company is technically a start up, and has constant turnover. Some pros in this position was the ability to work remotely, and you get a MacBook to work off of. Overtime was nice as well.",The management is unorganized and typically have no management experience. They are all young and were usually drivers before getting promoted. Zoom calls every morning. High quotas for sales your job will basically be to call prospects and get them to book a test drive at one of the locations. If you are not constantly booking 45-60 test drives you will be fired. The demographic is typically young people so you will be working with a lot of people that aren’t very experienced. In my few months there at least 10 people quit or were fired. Training is a joke.

Other employees are garbage. 
They are garbage to customers.
They work you until you are literally screaming from insanity. 
Very switch and bait of a company. They said a lot of good things to get me in and did a full 180 once they got me in. I really hope this business doesn’t continue. Go to carvana if you really want to do online car sales. I can’t wait to get out of here. So many other companies offering way more and better benefits than here."
25,Shift,so much waste potential.,2021-12-20,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,Not many. they give you food. Drive different cars which is fun and bad at the same time.,Upper management does not know how this business works.

The managers are all very invested in you and your success and set very attainable goals.,"The company can be very greedy with your time. Be prepared to work every weekend, including Sunday, and every holiday excluding Christmas, New Years, and thanksgiving. If you take paid vacation they do not adjust your quota, so be prepared to get paid way less for using your earned time off. On average less than 1/10th of LDR’s make quota before the last week or even days of the month."

Management listens to the boots on the ground and makes changes to support employee growth. 
Flexible work arrangements for non-hub positions (corporate/platform). 
Great opportunities for advancement to management in field operations. 
Great entry-level pay for field operations positions.","Time off isn’t as generous as other tech companies (excluding platform). 
The work can be busy/hectic/chaotic, especially in the field operations teams.
Professionalism can vary depending on your team/environment"

HR complaints are mostly glossed over especially when it comes to high conversion employees. They will put your safety on the line in order to buy a car. I have never been so disgusted with a company in my life. Almost 0 communication between hubs, managers, or employees. People are rarely if ever fired because of their behavior and it leads to a very toxic environment. I will NEVER work for this company again."
47,Shift,Not a good time to join this company,2021-09-02,2.0,Vehicle Acquisition Team,"+ health benefits 
+ remote work environment","- Company has been going through many changes at multiple levels and it's been causing many issues across multiple teams.

- Someone without much understanding of how Salesforce works decided to move from to Hubspot and this has caused many employees to lose over $1000 a month in commissions month after month.Managers are just giving excuses every week and projecting blame on engineers.

- Management is hired from outside instead of from within so someone who knows very little about your job will be telling you how to do it

- High turnover and Low pay

- Stock is going down.

- Limited career growth opportunities."

50,Shift,Shift’s used cars are one of a kind,2021-08-29,5.0,Car Concierge,"It’s a great place to work in my opinion! Very relaxed but also a fast paced place to make the days seem super short. Opportunity to make extra money each month and most of the people here are great! Snacks at your disposal, discounts on inventory, and of course being around and driving cool cars! Not to mention being able to travel around and meet new people everyday :)","Sometimes it does get a bit slow, as well as customers not always knowing how our business model works, our customer service game needs a step up and I feel like lots of departments that are work from home need extra training for sure. I’m always having to back step and explain things that I don’t know too well my self. It gets rough sometimes being the face of the company and having to deal with the lash from customers when I’m just the guy who brings you the car and does my best to make sure everything goes smoothly. That being said I think the pros still way out weigh the cons for sure!"
51,Shift,Used Car Dealer that want to be a Tech Company,2021-08-26,2.0,Lead Development Representative,Great Benefits....the ability to work from Home....Decent Money if you can hit your goals.,"You will be micro-managed by people who are not fit or trained to be leaders.

You never know your goals until about the 10th of every month so you can never take a day off. Because the goal is based on 100% obtainment. One month to get $1000 commission you need 30 cars sold the next month 60 cars sold for that same commission.

You as a sales rep get charge backs if the customer returns the vehicle."
52,Shift,Fantastic Start,2021-08-25,5.0,Staff Lead Security Engineer,"I will update as I've been at Shift for a longer time period.

From the get go, Shift has impressed me across the board with their approach to being a fantastic place to work at.
The recruitment process was the best I've ever been through. My recruiter was extremely informative, kept me up-to-date with any progress (or stagnation), and went above and beyond in helping me understand new concepts that I haven't dealt with before. 
The on-boarding process was straight forward and what you would expect from an organization at this stage. I'm fully remote and several states away from HQ but I still felt involved and informed throughout it.
The culture is very welcoming and easy to land into. I did not feel as if I had to push open doors to get involved as I have in previous positions. There is still a very start-up feel to a lot of how Shift approaches things, which is nice when coming from organizations that are steeped in (sometimes not so good) history.
Workload is not something I believe my position can accurately be reflected of Shift as a whole right now. Conversations with others leads me to believe that while it's definitely steady, it's not overly so in most areas. 
Compensation is more than aligned with and what should be expected for an organization this size and for IT professionals.
Benefits cannot be matched, in my opinion.","The start-up mentality. I understand that the market space Shift currently fits moves rapidly and the start-up mentality makes sense to continue to move the organization where it needs to, it will eventually become less of an asset. While this isn't a major con primarily because the transition is already in process away from the start-up mentality, it does cause some uncomfortable conversations and projects."
53,Shift,EXCELLENT company to work for!!,2021-08-24,5.0,Recruiting,"* Great company culture-very “people-centric”
* Lots of collaboration and our leaders truly care about our ideas and opinions 
* Everyone works really hard but work/life balance is highly encouraged and respected
* Amazing benefits!",I haven’t found one yet!
54,Shift,Great company,2021-08-17,5.0,Concierge,Lost of Overtime / employees are very nice and friendly,Really enjoyed my time here no many cons for me
55,Shift,Overstaturated,2021-08-10,2.0,Lead Development Representative (LDR),Working remote. Paid twice a month. First months commission paid to you while in training.,Work every single holiday. Hard to get time off. Overstaffed in this role. No lead ownership which reminds me of like a rat race. The phones initially rang a lot when I started but then they stopped ringing. My hours were changed from agreed upon when I applied for job. Very entry level sales job. Good for people who like making $15.12 and hour plus a few dollars but not even close to target sales goals communicated. HR isn't very responsive once you leave and transition out of the company.
56,Shift,Mismanaged,2021-08-05,2.0,SERVICE ADVISOR,"Snacks in the kitchen, some cool staff, “working at a tech company”","Poor management across the board, sales team can’t ever return calls to customers or keep their documents updated"
57,Shift,1 year anniversay review,2021-08-05,5.0,Senior CRM Manager,"I've just hit my one-year anniversary and thought it would be a good time to reflect on the past 365 days. I work in the Marketing Team but engage cross-functionally between product and engineering. I've primarily enjoyed my time at Shift - to me, the number one thing that makes or breaks a company is the people.

I've found folks to be largely positive and engaged. I trust my coworkers and find them hardworking, caring, and immersed in a team spirit. I believe the founders genuinely do the right thing balancing growth and mitigating the pitfalls of running a fast-paced emerging business.

Shift is an excellent place for folks looking for a dynamic and fast-paced company and thrives on the expectation of making a significant personal impact on the company. The flip side is since things operate so quickly, you have to embrace the one constant: Change. I think it also helps if you have a personal affinity toward cars and the business of selling them.

Whether working with my comrade in arms, product planners, the creative team, or engineering - I've enjoyed most of the experiences. Of course, there will be hiccups here and there - but that's in every company.

If you're ready to lift your sleeves and be part of the new paradigm in future car buying and selling - one should consider Shift.","If you're a person looking for an established 'old' Company environment with established norms, Shift, won't be the best place for you. One must be comfortable wearing many hats and dynamism - the company moves FAST, and priorities change quickly - so if you're looking for a place where there is no ambiguity, you'll have a hard time thriving here."

60,Shift,Best Company Ever,2021-08-04,5.0,IT Manager,Shift is one of the most innovated companies I have worked for. They hire the best of the best. The entire organization all works together in a collaborative and transparent way to achieve company goals. It truly is the best company I've worked for. The benefits package is superior to any package I've had.,I cannot find a single negative statement about this company. The entire staff from entry level to senior leadership are the most professional group of people.

Our CEO Toby really take the time to talk with employees and shows he cares. Both CEOs join weekly meetings to chat with corporate employees which is pretty cool.,The company is growing really quickly which means a lot of big growing pains. Things change very fast and there's a lot of work to do. Many people work well over 40 hour weeks. Corporate and operations seem really divided.

I guess a side effect of rapid growth is also rapid depletion of culture. The company is becoming more and more corporate which is not necessarily a bad thing, but now it's all about making the board of directors happy and neglecting their employees. Especially those who are in operations (sales, CS, concierge, drivers, recon). 

There's a clear division between the engineering / corporate teams and operations. It seems that most of the people in engineering are happy, which is good for them I guess.

The company is not actively campaigning for diversity and inclusion. Management and executives are 90% caucasian males."

Very unprofessional management always swearing, speaking negatively about others in the company, bro sales mentality. 

The “uncapped commission” in the offer letter really is a joke. Less than 10% of people are hitting quota (to get even the base commission) and the rest are falling short and making pennies for their work. Even hitting quota and more is not that well paying. It also doesn’t help that they raise the quota by 70% within one month and don’t tell anybody until 1 week into the month. Also, increased quota does not come with increase commission pay structure. Just more work for the same or less pay. 

Shift really needs to bring in some outside organizational behavior planners because their KPI’s, commission structure, and culture is having some really adverse consequences that management probably isn’t aware of or doesn’t care about. High turnover should speak for itself. 

There may also be a cabal keeping women out of management too. I saw a new hire become the number one rep for months in a row consistently, crush any record ever set at shift by a long shot (doubling and tripling quota), and I never saw that girl  get promoted. It’s possible the male management would feel uncomfortable trash talking so much if there was a hard working woman in their ranks."

They did a lot of shady things to not only their employees but customers as well. You would only get promoted if you were already friends with the managers.  Anyone that asked too many questions or didn’t agree with the higher ups would be fired. It at times felt like I was in high school. They even had assigned seats as if we were kids. One of the managers there is always losing his temper and has caused about three employees to quit.

- After six years, the leadership team has no idea how to differentiate itself from other tech-enabled marketplace companies in a way that will ensure the company being gross margin profitable
- While the company tries OKRs and quarterly goals, it rarely is able to keep the goal consistent for a quarter. Direction changes on a weekly basis based on whatever the executives focus on for that week. It makes it challenging for the team executing to know what the focus should be 
- COO is one of the most abrasive people to interact with. He consistently sends group emails or has Zoom video calls where he verbally bashes people. He has brought numerous people to tears or to the verge of leaving the company

I was also part time working full time hours"
132,Shift,Loving it here so far in the DC office,2020-01-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"Context: Graduated in 2018, worked a year at Capital One, and started at Shift in the DC office in November, so still pretty new here and can only really speak for the DC office.

DC people are amazing. The people - engineers, product, design, and recruiting - are all fun, welcoming, and smart, where some have been with Shift for 3+ years while most started in early 2019. Chose to accept the offer with Shift specifically after seeing the office and meeting them in person. There are about 20 of us in DC. We are currently in Clarendon and will be in Rosslyn in February.

Culture is fantastic. We have after work socials such as board game nights and watching Ford v. Ferrari together (the GT40 is core to our values). We have weekly hangouts with catered food and drinks where we can demo and show off our projects. We had a two day hackathon recently and soon holiday parties.

Good mentorship. Skillsets range from new grad to senior engineer so there's a lot of good collaboration and guidance. I feel comfortable to ask questions to anyone even just out of curiosity and bumping ideas off each other.

Good work/life/balance. Schedule is flexible when you want to come in and leave. I don't feel any pressure of having to stay late in a time crunch to meet a deadline, but I have continued working longer days when I was excited about a project independently.

Projects are fun. Full-stack development in React/Redux and Go. I have been contributing to production from the get-go and working on stuff I enjoy and want to learn. I'm given a lot of autonomy and trust in my responsibilities and projects.","Seems that there was a spike in attrition in the months before I started where several senior folks left or are leaving.

We had an additional benefit of provided lunch money, but no longer by the time I joined. Still have additional benefits including commuter benefits.

DC is a small office compared to the HQ in SF. However, since I joined, DC hasn't felt so much like a satellite office and does seem like an important hub for Shift, especially for engineers. I was concerned with how the DC office was treated when I was making a decision with the offer, but ultimately chose to accept for the people. Now that I have been here for a little bit, I believe DC has the best of both worlds - it's an important and growing office with the best culture and brilliant minds."

If you are not one of the Favorites, friends, or family group members then if you make a mistake you will be ""laid-off,"" reprimanded, or your job becomes just that much harder.

-Demand the world out of your hardest working employees with no benefits or incentives to make them want to stay working for you.
- No opportunities for the hard working employees that includes growth for them.
- Only the F, F,&F group members are taken care of financially while everyone else does the work for everyone and be paid the least and treated the worst.

Performance will not guarantee you a promotion or job security. I have no idea how this company can survive. There are constant changes that actually stray far away from the ""Not like A Dealership"" theme they pushed on us when we were first hired. Fees are always going up, quality of cars is always going down. There is no continuity and they will layoff all the best people just to keep friends on payroll. If you want longevity do not work for Shift. Work part-time or use them to gain experience, because they will use you. They will make you feel like this is a great place to work with outings and award ceremonies but treat you like you stole something when they are going to lay you off. Shift even asked us to fill out our own employee reviews, but instead of a meeting to talk about advancement; our entire team receives and email at 5pm one evening that mentions a mandatory meeting the next day starting at 9am. The mandatory meeting was actually a firing fair, with all documents and final checks ready to be handed out. What sort of employer fires their top performers, and keeps mediocre guys?  If you weren't educated at the finest schools, do not give any advice or comments it wont matter. Your performance only matters to their bottom line, it will not help with your advancement or job security. The top sales people were laid off, so friends could keep their jobs. They will ask you to be flexible, and patient with them because they are just a wee little tech-startup who makes mistakes (lots of mistakes).

They were so disorganized and there was a huge communication problem internally. Senior management works from their Ivory Tower on Market St in San Francisco while all Sales & Operations works out of a dilapidated industrial park in South San Francisco. Even though we were full time employees, we never felt like we knew what the Market St office was doing or thinking and had little idea of the direction of the company. There was never a clear line of communication and things constantly changed without warning. We'd be on the phone pitching a customer and we'd happen to chance upon a major procedural or pricing change by accident. Needless to say it made life in Sales very difficult. Even after great months of production from our team, we were never recognized for our hard work, and we never felt valued even though we performed a critical function for the company.  I had a total of one 1:1 with my manager over the course of a year and when I asked the tough questions about the company and my future, all I got were vague blanket responses. I became pretty vocal about my dissatisfaction towards the end of my stint at Shift and I think that's what ultimately led to me being let go. I don't know what kind of people they want to work there but I for one, am not a robot. There was a huge round of layoffs a month after I was hired, and people left the company pretty much every other week thereafter. It was a bleak and sad atmosphere to say the least."

From my understanding, wasn't supposed to be a dealership. The past month felt like Shift is just your typical shady dealership. Been told to try to sell a car to a customer even though the steering felt off, and the check engine light kept popping back up. 
Anyone in the South San Francisco office seems to be looked down on by the ones from the main office in San Francisco.
You get NO commission on a sale (the people on the phone do for whatever reason)
The scheduling team doesn't seem to know how to look at map and thinks you can go to Oakland to SF to Palo Alto all within 1 hour. Traffic doesn't seem to be accounted for when scheduling appointments.Hertz car dealership makes Shift not feel as genuine as it should be. Feels like I'm in a frat house most of the time. If I could rewind time i would've dodged this bullet, as I spent a lot of time at home working 9-10 hour work days, (1-2 hours spent working at home AFTER I'm off)
Huge disconnect between all departments, customers would constantly complain about being contacted by 4-5 people from different departments. 
I was optimistic about Shift at first and thought it was amazing and going to be revolutionary, now it's just going down. Only reason for a 3 star were the friends I made at this job. Management seems desperate to pull more people in to work here, probably because after a year of working here people realize it's a bust. Stay away. Glad I was asked to leave."

227,Shift,Avoid at all costs,2016-12-18,1.0,Sales,-The only thing positive that I can say about working for this company is people and corporate culture.,"-Management has no empathy for workers at the lower levels
-No training or career progression
-Unsustainable long hours 
-Large layoffs 
-They will make promises they will not keep to keep you at the company"
228,Shift,"Great People, Long hours",2016-12-14,4.0,Car Enthusiast,"- Great People 
- Okay benefits",- Long hours that sometimes don't feel rewarding.
229,Shift,Terrible Company for Career Growth,2016-11-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The best and only good thing about working for Shift is the laid back environment and people.,"The company has incredibly high turn over due to management making their employees work countless overtime hours with little to no growth. Couple that with no form training, I would not recommend this to anyone."
230,Shift,"A fun job, but not a career",2016-10-04,2.0,,"Lots of freedom to experiment with building new processes and develop new ideas on the sales side, lots of camaraderie amongst your teammates, a fun and lively office dynamic, an entertaining place to start off.","Get what you can while you can, and look to really grow your career by leveling up elsewhere. Don't expect any employee development consideration or long-term investment since sales is a commoditized department with little if any opportunity for advancement without an Ivy pedigree, in which case you would have been hired into Shift Tech rather than Shift Ops. That's a whole other story."
231,Shift,"Great idea, but not financially stable",2016-06-22,2.0,Car Concierge,"The job was interesting, provided a new look on the used car market. Lots of potential to provide a better way for buying/selling cars. Company offers great benefits packages.","Though not totally unexpected with a startup, upper management runs it like a tech startup when in reality this is a service industry business. There isn't a big tech company budget backing all their expenses. They tried to do too much and then had to do massive layoffs to appease their board. I was hired only 3 weeks before being laid off -- not a fun experience."
232,Shift,Amazing team with exciting future ahead,2016-06-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Independence and autonomy in role (no micromanaging) but guidance from leadership is available and extremely helpful if you're willing to be proactive about asking for their time. Really incredible people who are both ridiculously smart, and kind, a sort of rare and important combination. Plus we are building a great product. Employees are trusted to work hard and figure out creative and interesting ways to collaborate. Plus, fridge is stocked with beer, plenty of snacks and coffee, and the area has ample street parking, so you can't beat that in SF.","Conference room space is a battle in current office. 
Some disconnect between offices. 
Often necessary though unofficially expected to work weekends + long hours, but balanced with lulls...overall seems to be ok balance 
Not a lot of training for new hires. Very sink or swim.
Lots of people happen to be more introverted which can come off kind of intimidating"
233,Shift,Good Intentions,2016-05-18,2.0,,"The company has a lot of potential to disrupt a market long overdue for change and has a product that is useful to a lot of car buyers and sellers. Field and office environments were very casual and managers/team leads did not micromanage. Overall, day-to-day work felt like it was contributing to a greater overall goal. Seniors and executives were relatively accessible and benefits okay.","The company laid off a significant portion of its staff without prior notice within two years of getting off the ground. This happens with startups, but overall is a reflection of the disjointed communication throughout the entire organization. Many managers and team leads, although impressive on paper, seem to lack real-world understanding of the U.S. car market. Suggestions and initiatives move through several offices (some outside of the country) and levels of hierarchy and may be implemented through three or four ""training"" meetings."
234,Shift,"Smart people, interesting product, average culture",2016-04-21,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Shift has hired people from very solid backgrounds - everyone in eng, design, biz ops etc all come from top companies so you are working with smart people. It is a big challenge trying to make money on flipping cars and solve the logistical side of operations via technology.","There is no focus on building or developing the culture of the organization. Minimal organic interaction between the different functions (evidenced most by engineering sitting upstairs and biz ops and others downstairs). 

Company has just gone through a rationalization. Seemed very rushed and not delivered in a totally transparent way. Benefits also slowly being reduced."
235,Shift,So far so good,2016-04-18,5.0,Analyst,"Competitive compensation for a start up. 
Very strong team with impressive backgrounds.
Fantastic culture of hard work + fun.
Great to see the result of my hard work.","Office location can create a tough commute depending on where you live.
Hard to explain that you work at a ""car company"" that is actually a technology company."
236,Shift,"Awesome opportunity, not for faint of heart",2016-04-18,5.0,Business Operations,"Awesome opportunity to solve one of the most challenging problems for consumers today - used cars.  Massive market requiring massive change.  

See real impact each and every day.  Lots of opportunity for autonomy and individual ownership of important projects.

Incredibly talented team at all levels from eng/design to business operations, top to bottom.  Fun and engaging people to work with.",Not easy - don't expect a 9 to 5 and don't expect to ride a start up to IPO without breaking a sweat.
237,Shift,Shift Sales Team,2016-04-18,3.0,Senior Inside Sales Representative,"hot market, potential to be a game changer.. Shift tech benefits are much better than Shift Operations roles.","layoffs within 2 years of starting company.  Benefits were not great, biz model is too operation cost heavy to be success or sustainable."
238,Shift,Eh,2016-04-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Laid back atmosphere, autonomous work, no one is micromanaging you",The company doesn't seem to know how to make money and does not pay attention to the importance of processes and training
239,Shift,Innovative model.  Passionate team.  Lots of opportunity.,2016-03-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Clear business case for a company like Shift: an innovative, customer-centric, tech-enabled platform to help people buy and sell used cars, which is a process that is universally hated by consumers today.  

The team is incredibly passionate about the mission and about building the business together.  Lots of very, very smart people working to solve problems and build something to be proud of.   

True start-up culture:  roll up your sleeves and start brainstorming / building / getting $#!& done.  Creates lots of opportunity to have meaningful impact on the business.","Not a 9:00 - 5:00 job.  Definitely an expectation that you work extremely hard, including being available if things come up evenings or weekends.   

Still some cultural issues to be worked out.  Not always clear that there's a defined company culture, so people seem to default to their own practices and preferences. 

Org structure involves a lot of cross-dept. matrices (engineering, product, operations, finance, etc.).  Not always clear who within the matrix is responsible, accountable, etc."
240,Shift,"Amazing people, amazing opportunities!",2016-03-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I wake up every day excited to see my coworkers and do my job. I truly feel as though my coworkers have become my friends. People are intelligent and driven, its true, and most are humble and treat each other as equals. Its an incredible opportunity to work for a company with people that want to be here, know how to collaborate, and have a good time building a great company.","I can't think of any cons. However, I'll say that if working hard isn't your style, I don't think this would be a good fit. Its a startup and people put their time in, but we definitely have fun while doing it."
241,Shift,Pass,2016-03-25,2.0,,The company has a lot of room for growth. People are warm and it is a nice environment to work. Lunch is catered daily.,"They do not promote from within. Unless you are an engineer or work in operations, compensation is very poor. Be ready to work weekends."
242,Shift,Great Place to work!,2016-03-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people are by far the best thing about Shift. I love all of my colleagues and feel like I am constantly learning things. I also really appreciate the company culture. At the headquarters most people leave by 6, which works well for me. I think the senior leadership team, specifically George and Minnie, are great.",The office is getting a little cramped and it can be difficult to get a private room for meetings. We definitely need a bigger office.
243,Shift,Great place to work,2016-03-09,5.0,Operations,"Super bright people, fast paced, exciting work environment.

quickly gain responsibility, add value to the company- see real change happen!

get to work with people from different backgrounds, work experience","Super fast pace, so would be good to occasionally take a step back, slow down, look at big picture."
244,Shift,Car Enthusiast,2016-02-24,5.0,Car Enthusiast,"Great people, great culture. The concept of SHIFT is an amazing idea for car lovers looking to take all the stress and headache away from the selling/buying a car experience.",None at all! It's a startup so you're actually waiting and seeing how everything is coming together at the moment but the rapid growth is tremendous.
245,Shift,awesome company,2016-02-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There is lots of room for growth here because it is just starting out, there is alot of potential and new markets opening up which is great. There are many great perks that I didn't get while working at a multimillion dollar company that I left for Shift for.","Can have some long hours, and the training is not the greatest but thats start up life! Once you get the hang of things its easy to problem solve  any situation"
246,Shift,"Great product/service, but really shady.",2016-02-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Once you're hired you dive right in and you get to be a part of big decisions and forming the future of the company. There are some really driven people involved and it's a great learning experience.,"Unless you are a engineer/designer/manager - you will be a 1099 contractor, although they will have you working 40+ hours - this is super sketchy and only benefits them as a company on their taxes. You will have to pay your own taxes since they won't take taxes out for you. This is NOT the norm when it comes to full-time employment status and it's a very shady way for them to get benefits while you do not. You'll be worked much harder than a regular salary employee but without the pay."
247,Shift,Car Enthusiast,2016-01-14,5.0,,"Great working atmosphere, friendly people, happy to come to work daily.","There are some long hours sometimes, a Lot to do. Must keep moving forward."
248,Shift,Best place I've worked,2016-01-02,5.0,Operations Management,"Incredibly smart, dedicated and nice people.  No egos and very little politics which given the recent growth of the company I think is impressive.  Leadership is very competent, transparent and perhaps most importantly genuinely care about the employee's experience and development.   There is a real focus on finding a healthy work/life balance which I like. The speed at which decisions are made (with the right level of thought/analysis) is also super impressive.",not really any I can think of.
249,Shift,Never been happier at work!,2015-11-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Smart, hard working, kind, comfortable, respectful, trusting, and fun environment.",We work hard- a lot of hours.
