38,Shopee,A place to learn how to point fingers to others and strengthen your political skills,2022-04-03,1.0,Senior UI-UX Designer,I don't see any pros till this point now. There used be a few but that was already history.,"Corporate benefits wise:

I don't see any benefits sustaining for long as the company grows. Used to have TWG teabags at pantries, now there's only cheap cheap ones. 

Diminished corporate insurance benefits to minimal level so that they can.

Claiming is getting super difficult now comparing to 3 years ago. 

Don't believe what they boost about the infrastructure-gym in office, sleeping pods, massage rooms-these are just for photo-taking when visitors come. What we have in reality is: bosses will spy on you and complain that you used gym too often; sleeping pods are kept shut doing the pandemic; massage room is only subjected to online booking with very limited quota per employee, and by the end of 2021 the earliest slot you can get on the booking system is only in 2023. These benefits are what they used to lure you in, once you are in, it's a different story. 

Workplace culture wise:

Very toxic culture where you won't stay long if you don't speak and understand mandarin. It's a shame that they claim to be a ""Singapore registered, NYSE listed international company"" that has more than 80% of employee are native Chinese speakers. Almost all internal meetings are conducted in Mandarin Chinese unless there's a non-Chinese speaker presented, and that's where they all start to struggle to expression their opinions and ideas. The problem is they are not proactively willing to adapt to English speaking culture. 

When there's an achievement, bosses and leads will take all the credits; when something nasty during the project execution happens, they start to point fingers level-by-level downwards. 

Workplace skills wise:

People come to work to create product that make business revenue possible, and taking away their wage and skills learned at work as the other side of the equation. In Shopee, the skills you learned at work would be minimal, as there's not enough room or resources to gain skills. Your boss may only ask you to get things done, without you even understanding how it was done, or why it was done in that way. What you were told to do is only to copy what others have been doing from the past. If you question out of curiosity, you will be told to not waste time on such questioning and focus on repetitive work. As designers the nature of the job should be constantly questioning ""what"", ""how"" and ""why""-a product will only improve if we constantly asking such questions and trying to find out the answers. Without these, you are merely doing what you were told to do, and not having the opportunity to learn design critique skills."

On the first day I was shown an out of date presentation without any structural, who to talk to so I can do my job, what's my scope,.. etc 

- Cultural is all for banner and stickers, they dont' actually implement it. 

- Internal process is a mess, too many long meetings, everything is stored in chat and excel ( chinese style) no jira, confluence, what soever. 

- No matter how much the CEO try to patch it, this is a chinese company, doesn't matter if headquater is at or branded as Singapore. It's a chinese company.

Compare to mid level or experienced people that joined the firm, the same title or rank will be for one who at least have double of these old guards.

The incompetent seniors or managers love gaslighting especially on those from outside who are more competent than them.

Long working hours, lunch hour is 1.5 hours and starts late, so offocial hour finish work is 7pm and if you expected to work even later, imagine what time you get to go home.

Top managers do nothing about these deadweights and leave them in charge of large, core teams for years.

This translates into:
- No mentorship/coaching
- Close to zero learning opportunities from manager
- Empty promises regarding progression
- Poor guidance for decision making

I do not recommend this company for experienced hires:
- You will likely not be picking up any new skills, knowledge, or competencies
- Progression stagnates after a while, especially since middle management is already saturated with figureheads (most of them will likely stay for years to come in order to vest their attractive stock packages)
- Authority doesn't like to get challenged. Even if they are blatantly wrong and can be proven so.

For fresh grads, know what you are getting yourself into:
- You will still have a decent learning S-curve
- Ultimately, this is an entrance into Tech, and there are only that many Tech companies in Singapore
- Unfortunately, you will be mostly an instruction-taker. Only after an extended period of time at the company will you be given more responsibility.
- Avoid the Ads team, if you can."

- Fast past and dynamic environment

- Understand the eCommerce scene better with in-depth knowledge on the operations","- Prone to burnouts if you do not manage your well-being

- Lackluster work-life balance

- Constant changes that are beyond your control but would directly affect your KPIs

- Extremely high turnover rate means that the existing workload will be carried by you temporarily till a new hire joins the company. By then, you would have already been burnout due to the constant campaigns.

- The high turnover rate is evidently shown based on the positions and vacancies that they are hiring although the company is expanding aggresively."

- alot of self-learning is involved
- task by task basis with timelines. First 3 months will struggle, after finding that balance, it will turn out fine.
- you will need to learn how to not put too much pressure on yourself; if you have already given your best but still can't complete task, have the courage to ask for time extension or reason it out instead of trying to maintain frontal facade of 'I am independent' and OTing. Depends on individual."

596,Shopee,Good for those who can't find something else,2022-01-02,2.0,Senior Associate,"1. Get to work on interesting projects. The projects I was given had quite high visibility so I have access to senior stakeholders. You might have a better chance at promotion if people in power know you. There are colleagues in other teams that really connect to the purpose of serving the underserved.

2. Strong feedback culture . This is unheard of in other teams but my team was asked to do deep reflections and then to give each other feedback in a group setting. I find it useful even though it's time-consuming and I imagine this can be quite daunting since it's quite confrontational. However, this can help to uncover your own blind spots and weaknesses faster, and people in your team hold you accountable. It's up to you to decide if this is good or bad.","1. Unclear direction from management . While my manager was reasonably competent, the level above her is simply not. She provided no sense of where the team should be headed and all she wants to do is to follow what other companies are doing. Be original! The team once spent a few meetings discussing an insignificant agenda with no outcome, actually she herself also doesn't know what she wants. In one of the town halls, the management even said that employees should be prepared to sacrifice in the short term i.e. work longer hours, no personal time, for long term growth.

Do note that a lot of the managers are junior because this is their first job and are rewarded for their loyalty. Promotion is based on tenure. You can have about 10 years of experience and be reporting to someone with half of that. This means they have no experience leading teams or what to do. What they can add to you is probably to tell you what the CEO or this particular senior management thinks.

2. Don't expect to be coddled. Especially for mid-career hires, you will be squeezed dry and quickly burn out because:

-The priorities are always changing so you might need to redo everything from scratch. Specifically for my team, the HOD only believes what other people say even though she hired me to do the job. 

-No one will be free to talk to you. Everything here is about execution and fire fighting. If you are new, either swim or drown. 

-Figure out who the stakeholders you need to talk to yourself. There is NO organization chart . The reason given was that the teams are always re-organizing but we know that it's actually because of the high attrition. Employees are asked when posting on LinkedIn to censor the names and prevent tagging other employees as it gives a sense of the structure. Other tech companies are poaching actively. Even big companies have organization charts so I'm not really sure why the secrecy.

3. Overall lack of transparency. Similar to the org chart point, when the recent saga online, employees only received an email addressing this about 1 week after. Until the point I left, there was no news on what the outcomes of the investigation were. Disappointing!"

Max 20% Increase for non promotions with ""good performance"" (no metrics for this). Y-O-Y.","There are a lot.

1. Compensation is based on previous work and not proportional to responsibilities given. Example, for 2 people in the same position and rank, one can get paid more than twice the other person for the same responsibilities and scope just because they came from a bigger company with better previous pay. Understandable to a certain point, but the disparity will never be closed regardless of how the lower paid employee performs.

2. Management is disconnected to those in the Assistant manager and lower roles. They push the lower ranks to perform with promises that it will be good for their career growth and advise them that taking on more work is truly the way to advance their careers but truth be told, it will still be a matter of politics usually controlled by middle management. 

3. Career progression is very vague. There are no timelines for career progression and there are no clear career paths. Even for lateral transfers to more crucial roles, there are no increases.

4. Onboarding for certain roles is rushed. Setting up employees for failure.

5. HR is not transparent with their documents.

6. There are no clear metrics on how employees are graded for their KPIs and their bonuses for yearly increases and yearly bonuses. HR does not share this.

7. Employees Bonuses are based on Previous Years performance but are only eligible for employees that are currently with the company, if you resign before they are paid out, no bonuses at all.

8. Local Hires can only grow to a certain point. Management are all expats.

That's the only benefit I see from Shopee.
Colleagues are nice (most of them, cause they're still young kids)","I don't know where to start the cons. I probably can write for 100,000 words, or even more. I regretted picking this offer and stayed there for more than one year. I already left the job several months ago --- but my body is not healthy anymore (caused by OT)... insomnia and depression are still following me.

You can come if you have an MBA degree or you've worked for those ""big names"" that the company likes. 
This company tends to value MBA, so they hired a lot of MBAs, and these MBAs have a high chance to be your manager. So, good luck :) 
There're a lot of first-time managers in the company; the opportunity to get a good manager is 1/10. If you're a fresh grad, please, take those better companies and then jump after several years. It's too hard for fresh kids to know how to escape from abusive bosses.

Fun facts:
。EVERYONE NEEDS TO OT, ESPECIALLY SEAMONEY. DON""T BELIEVE HR's WLB WORDS. 
。You need to OT to show you're ""valuable"" to them. They will tell you they reward ""hard-working"" colleagues. DON""T OT AT HOME, cause your boss won't care :) If you want to show them you're hard-working, DO IT IN THE OFFICE. Otherwise, no one will value you. ----- THIS IS HOW TOXIC THE CULTURE IS.
。When you escalate your boss's issue to your boss's boss, most of the time, you'll get ignored. Cause they want you to ""TRY HARDER"". And they'll also tell you you're just whining --- no one cares how you feel.
。Don't think work more you'll get more rewards. It's not for PM. It's for devs. There's no clear KPI or OKR for PMs at Shopee. So if you don't know how to bluff, just don't OT, go home at 7, cause no matter how you work, you'll get the same amount --- there's nothing for them to estimate your performance, everything is by impression or boss's GUT FEELING.
。They solve issue by removing those people who creates the issue.
。NO STRUCTURE AND DIRECTION. Everything comes from the big boss. PMs are just executing machines.
。If you can't speak Chinese, avoid this place. I'm serious.
。No one will give you positive feedback. They'll only give this to you when you are about to leave the company.
。No career opportunity or progression. Everything is unclear. Same, they'll only give you hope for career progression when you're about to leave.
。Worked with Shopee's China team and they laughed at my Chinese accent, kept saying they don't understand. While at the same time THEY CAN""T SPEAK ENGLISH.
。Compensations and benefits are the worst among all tech companies. 

There're more. Probably time to write an article about my unhappy career at Shopee. Anyway, if you want more money, go to ByteDance, if you want culture, just leave Singapore, if you want to be healthy, go to European companies. Shopee has nothing but A LOT OF PROJECTS to do."

HR team is abusing its power in recruitment. The expansion of talent base in Mainland China like O2O business in Shanghai and Short Video business in Beijing gives the opportunities for HR team's abusement in power, eg. get rebates from headhunter companies is not a secret. 

Apart from that, the high referral fee(up to 5k+ SGD) motivates the employee to refer friends to join Shopee is also used by HR recruitment team, some of the recruiters find a partner in the company and pass the candidate they should hire by themselves to the partner for them to refer, and share the referral fee.

This is not a single case, but the corner of the iceberg. If a company is bragging itself for good benefit(gym, snack, wlb etc), but messing up in management to cause the discrimination happening everywhere in the company, shall we still call it a good employer? or it's only a money machine faking itself as financial market darling?"

Their so-called HR department are filled with people with little to zero HR experience. People that come from non-related work background can come into Shopee and become a HRBP or do some policy related rubbish. Go have a look at the profile of employees they have in their HR roles, you'll get what I mean. 

Experienced hires are made to report to junior staff (by this I mean all the fresh grads they hire). Work processes are a joke and if you raise a concern, pray hard your manager isn't the type to gaslight people. 

All the comments about this being a Chinese company, it's true. Sometimes I wondered if I was working in China. 

They talk about creativity, diversity, inclusion - all the pop words in employment. But its merely lip service. There's no celebration of individuality here. Everything is according to ""what Chris likes"". 

This place is a literal sweatshop. Unless you want to sign your life away to Shopee, avoid at all costs. Shopee expects you to go above and beyond for them but when something happens, they shun you. 

And you know why everything seems rosy on the inside? That is because they don't bother finding out why their turnover rate is so high. Neither do they take employees feedback seriously - they stuff you silly with campaign merchandises instead of addressing issues.

Payroll is also a joke. A leaver has to send over 6 follow up emails before they get 1 reply."

Young, inexperienced, (sometimes arrogant) managers that were just lucky to be hired in the early days of Shopee and are now entrenched there. Many recent hires are from great companies with a lot of experience to bring to the table but are forced to follow how things are done instead of bringing improvements.

2. No concept of boundaries. You are expected to prioritise the company above everything. Senior management openly calls for 'work-life integration' instead of work-life balance. People who cannot keep up are viewed as not a good fit for the company. It's not even a big deal when people resign anymore.

3. Wasted effort with multiple departments doing duplicate work because CEO will say something and multiple teams will jump on it without clarifying. Every one rushing to make decks for the CEO instead of doing real work. 

4. People are paid according to their education not the amount of work they do. Someone from private uni can be doing the same or more work than a local grad and be paid much less. Senior management can also be openly condescending to those from private uni background. It gets better after a while, but starting point is very uneven. 

5. Lack of coaching. Management actively hires a lot of fresh grads but gets frustrated when they need time to ramp up or cannot cope with some of the work thrown at them. Feedback is given in a very rude and public way. 

Also, some of these positive reviews are obviously fake. There are many 5 star reviews with not much elaboration."

Pragmatism rules - if you have a suggestion that is good for the business, it can be driven forward quite easily

Can be quite a lot of objectivity as at the lower levels, decisions made are very data driven","Onboarding is horrible - As a new joiner manager told me to talk to a list of people to find out what my portfolio is going to be about. Processes are not documented at all and there's a very steep learning curve that organization doesn't help you with, then your performance is not reviewed positively. 

Chaotic collaboration - often have to collaborate with other teams, no clear SOP, no clear sense of prioritizing of incoming requests or to hold other teams accountable to timelines. A lot of internal frictions where there is a lot of miscommunication internally that adds on to already insane workload.

Lack of Empathy - we have a pandemic which is driving Shopee's growth, and employees are stuck with WFH arrangements where amount of workload is not visible to managers at all. When pushed back up, manager just smiles and tells us to ""manage your time better"", while the C suite cascades down to launch more markets without additional headcount in the team nor removing existing projects. Just like it was called out in WakeupSingapore IG page, 996 culture is the norm (unless you are lucky with your manager)

No work life balance at all - In the new Joiner orientation, we are presented the 5 shopee values, of which one is ""We Run"". You are assessed against this and it literally states that to meet expectations for this value, you have to ""go above and beyond"" for the company.

- If you are a graduate be careful, because they look down on graduates. There was an incident when someone made a mistake and said individual was a fresh graduate.

Very elitist. The recruiter was nice and upfront to tell me that cos im not from local uni, they will never give me associate rank & pay. they say private uni all start around 3k, which to me is ridiculous. who are you to judge that my uni is worth lesser than the local uni? no commons about hiring managers, feels like they dont care about me much since i was from private uni.

Salary
pay differs if you're not from NTU, NUS, SMU . if you're private uni, you start as a team assistant (analyst rank?) and get paid $1k less. i'm from private uni and they told me no matter what my grades or past references say, i can only get $3.3K. whereas my friend from NTU who got in gets a starting of $4k++.

Training
nobody gave me proper training or onboarding when i joined. they just told me this is your team, here's what you do, just learn on the job. like at least park the first month as a training-only month? 

Scope
always increasing, and expected to do more even when im just a ""team assistant"". make me do associate work but pay me way lesser than their associates. tell me doing what im paid for isnt enough and i must ""constantly stretch myself"". but your pay isnt matching up? the associate that works with me do lesser but paid 30% more than me, and you also wont promote me. was told that i can only get a certain grade coz of my uni, and even if i get promoted im only at the starting line of other local uni grads. thats super messed up. imagine doing more than people who just got in, just to prove that youre equivalent to them. what the fk?

Leadership
heard from somewhere that its the old guards that wants the salary difference to be there for private vs local uni. not sure what theyre thinking but it really sends a message when i heard it. whats the point of working hard here if they wont give people like me a chance"

- Great compensation when producing good value for company
- Company is deferring to shared values to unify sense of identity, rather than lengthy bureaucracy and titles
- Company can be seen to purposely try to maintain welfare of employees by rolling out more benefits and support, because honestly work is tough and they know it
- Company have healthy quarterly ""pulse-check"" survey that surveys each employee's opinion of their sustainability and impact, while also gathering feedback. This is anonymous and handled by HR so team-related feedbacks are not pressured out.
- People that work here are generally friendly and willing to help. There are some nasty ones but so far seems to be more exception than norm
- I speak against my boss openly when there are things I disagree about. I never got heat on my pay/performance level from that. So I would say at least in my team, we operate well on professional level.
- I've read that some ppl reviewed saying Shopee is racist, I just want to share that I would disagree. Indeed my colleagues are predominantly Chinese. However i don't think it's because we racially pick Chinese. Factually China is a huge nation with a huge talent pool. It's not surprising that Shopee attracted this tech talent pool. Regarding speaking chinese in meetings, my personal experience as a non-chinese speaker has been, if my colleagues are talking to me they will speak to me in English. Sometimes there are terms and ideas that they are not able to describe well in English as they are new English speaker, that they discuss better in Chinese with their peers, which to me is fine. In cases that they do switch to Chinese, and they require my input again, they will summarise their discussion and continue with me in English. I would encourage people to withhold judgement of racism, when the intent was to deepen the discussion in ways they can manage.","- Work is hard and demanding
- We are expanding very fast. It is difficult to keep up. At times we really are stretched very thin.
- Sometimes the speed of expansion is at the cost of making patchy and unsustainable designs. Hence tech side need to do extra work to amend rushed things later.
- Very big tech stack that suffers legacy problems, but resources are still very much prioritised to churning out new features. One day it will be a super big pain, maybe soon..."

We often work very collaboratively towards a common goal and that really helps make things move a lot quicker. 

Micro-management doesn't really occur much, at least for my experience, we are given a lot of credibility and empowerment to work in a way we deem fit.

Beware.,2021-11-11,2.0,Analyst,Working here will make your resume look good cause it's a big company and the people team try their best to make the employees feel cared for (with gifts and programs.) Their medical benefits are also good. Mental and physical health is cared for - both are reimbursed. Vaccination for COVID was free.,"SO MANY. First of all, hierarchy is so bad here. There are bosses and supervisors but some abuse power and have biases. Some even use their connections to make things favor towards them. They will do this in a passive-aggressive way. 

The management sucks. It will take you a year to get a raise and the raise is not even that big despite the work being so heavy. Even if you get promoted in the middle of the year, the raise comes at the end. Tenure doesn't matter in Shopee. I asked for a promotion because I was doing the same workload as people at higher ranks than me but all they could tell me was they'll consider even though I've been there longer and have done more. Instead of promoting you, they will hire new people above you then load them with the same work and volume. 

Their employees of a higher rank can be very fake too. I've encountered an employee who made it look like I was the one at fault and even set up ""proof"" that did not show the whole truth just to make themselves look good. I could not defend myself because I needed something from them in order to fully process my resignation and end all ties with Shopee. I could not risk slowing down that process and based on what happened, they were capable of doing that on purpose. 

The final payment is also not paid as early as they tell you. They overwork you endlessly but when it's time to compensate they don't do their best to show their appreciation. Shopee is shiny and inviting on the outside but really, it's just as rotten inside."

- HR recruiters just shoved and sugar coat you with the role during interview, job turns out different that promised. Recruiter actually don't even understand the job scope

- team mates are just toxic and glorifying hustle culture

If you wanna work here go ahead as it's good for your resume. But dont expect to expand your career here. Get the job experience and pack your bags after a year or two.

952,Shopee,Think twice,2021-09-22,2.0,Marketing,"- Established branding and strong presence in SEA. Aggressive ventures and expansion in other markets.

- Steep learning curve, suitable for those looking to equip themselves with skills and e-commerce knowledge in a short period of time.","Overall, toxic culture as a result of poor managers and lack of transparency in communication.

- Horrible managers who are mostly inexperienced and political. They mostly suck up to senior management and what is appalling is most managers are so out of touch with the working teams that they have little to no knowledge on the product and actual implementation. And what does this mean is that if you join, expect to NOT get any knowledge or guidance from the managers as they cannot really educate you. They can only share with you “the concept on a high-level” and disguise it as “go figure the rest out yourself” most of the time.

- Managers generally lack of empathy. Throwing people under the bus and blaming culture is a common behaviour observed among managers and leads. There are also some leads in Marketing who practice double standards - if you do not carry a ‘lead’ or ‘manager’ title, they do not really respond to you or bother responding to your questions, may it be in person, SeaTalk (Shopee’s version of WhatsApp) or email. 

- High volume of workload as a result of never-ending campaigns and projects. There’s no such thing as low/high priority here (especially in Marketing). Everything is of high priority and requires attention - doesn’t matter if project is less impactful or has less potential simply because these managers and leads want to appease the bosses above.  Also, expect to work till midnight, weekends, and even on public holidays (Raya, CNY, Christmas).

- Funny how Shopee prides themselves as a tech company but truth is, a LOT of manual work happens behind the scenes. Simple things such as uploading banners, voucher creation, whitelisting etc requires a large amount of effort but feature updates and improvements nowhere to be heard or often deprioritized. 

- Whatever you read on Glassdoor about Shopee’s attrition rate is true. Turnover rate is sky high and yet nobody is addressing the elephant in the room."

Many teams hire a large proportion of chinese expatriates who are young as well. Be prepared to have cultural clashes, as well as language barriers with them, even if your team speaks predominantly english
Don't expect pay progression to happen. You are easily replaced by the next batch of wide-eyed hopeful and hungry fresh grad.
The chinese culture also brings an unofficial 996 to the company even if you're not based in SZ. if some teams are 996 in China, don't expect your work chat to be silent on weekends

Overall you probably going to get burnt out. If you joined early and have fat stocks... then maybe worth the grind? But probably better idea to move to another MNC with better progression after you learned enough"

But not good if you want to be a real product manager. Or if you are a senior product manager, please avoid at all costs.","1. After a good run till early 2021, upper management seems to think it's a good time to start an internal overhaul. Many teams are restructured for the ""good of the company"". but are actually politically motivated. Many people have left the company over the last couple of months and teams are overtaken by new joiners. In fact, many teams have moved to China because maybe now management is so complacent that they believe product & engineering teams are non-essential.

2. Product management department leaders are inexperienced and don't understand what being a product manager really means. They don't have experience at other big tech companies as product managers and just got to where they are by being the most senior person. Majority of them don't measure metrics, don't properly roadmap, and just end up rushing whatever business requests. They aren't real product managers, they are more like implementation project managers receiving work from business and also somehow doing the work of engineers & designers e.g. ux design or technical design. Due to their inexperience and premature promotion into managers, they are also terrible at leading and don't practice servant leadership. Most of them are just focused on self-promotion, with the exception of some experienced managers.

If it was only their incompetence & lack of leadership, maybe it's not that bad. But many of them, specifically those leaders heading the Order team and now almost taken control of the entire Marketplace, engage in empire building. It's an open secret in the department that they somehow got the trust of the upper management and took control of many product teams in an almost villainous manner, unfairly weeding out previous team leads who have spent years building their own teams, and transferring their own team members to take over them. Even other product heads were weeded out or had their scopes reduced in favour of those power-hungry Order team leads. The way in which they operated led to departures of many senior product managers, leading to a very depressing morale in the product department. Many product managers around me are in interview process. 

Due to the highly political nature of the current product department, I strongly advise talented senior product managers to avoid this place, as you will not get true recognition here. If you are in the wrong team, you can expect to have a lot of difficulty getting recognition or getting thrown around with the restructuring. Even if you are in the ""right"" team which is in power now, you can forget about your personal growth as your manager will only be concerned with getting more power for themselves and using you as a pawn.

3. Compensation here is terrible. HR will definitely low ball you. I'm already in the process of accepting an offer double the salary here."

1091,Shopee,Only if I knew this beforehand,2021-08-10,2.0,Analyst,"1. People are generally nice, minimal/no office politics

2. Everyone is willing to share and offer help when necessary","1. Brief hierarchy of the company: Team Assistant (TA); Associate; Senior Associate; So on and so forth. If you just graduate from NUS/NTU/SMU, the entry level position offered to you will be Associate. If you're from any other local/private unis in SG, the entry level position the company deem suited for you is TA. So you may graduate the same year as your friend but they may be your superior because of your school:) These are applicable for fresh grads and majority of the teams only. 

TLDR, as a TA, you're basically everybody's assistant. You take instructions from anyone above your ""rank""

2. Your day end at 7PM, so naturally you will miss your usual dinner time with your family and friends taking into consideration the travel time. (Timing can never match with your friends unless they starve and wait for you)

3. OT is norm and not paid (you feel elated when you're able to get out of office on time and still see bright sky lol. dont try to plan anything outside of work cause tasks are unpredictable and you may be given a task at 630PM and they expect you to complete asap)

4. Managers check in with you time to time and after sharing your concerns, work are still given to you (mgrs check for the sake of checking, they also need to report mah)

5. People are still working on leave/after office hours. Receiving messages and emails at 12AM? norm

6. If you speak chinese
a) awesome cause you can 'blend"" in easier and mgrs are generally glad to hear that you speak their mother tongue language
b)boo cause you need to help your non-chinese speaking teammates (not their fault btw) with their work AKA translation. ppl from other teams will prefer to seek help from you than your teammate since they can communicate better with you in their language

7. No clear career progression, job scope not defined (always doing work with no background given)

8. Turnover rate high. around half of my teammates has left after staying for less than 6 months or before their 3 months probation. The burnout is real:)

9. Work is extremely manual. Time spent on Crtl C + Crtl V takes up your whole day, thats why the company needs TA

10. The only time you get to interact with your teammates is lunch time/ team bonding session (usually held after work but will still attend cause FOMO)"

2. Inexperienced leadership to motivate the team. There is a distinct difference between management and leadership.

3. Most of the features are copied directly from competitors. Essentially, it's a duplicating culture. Most colleagues were complacent, whereby, they laugh off at competitor's products. Personally, I felt other e-commerce platforms are really better than shopee (even till today). Most mistakes or amendments could have been prevented if better planning were executed.

4. Chinese culture - emails and documentations were in mandarin. Meetings as well.

5. The title product management is widely misused. Some friends from top tech companies have shunned shopee's offer. Scope of works might not exactly be a good indication of ""product management""."

1142,Shopee,Growth opportunity but..,2021-07-26,3.0,Senior Product Manager,"Endless (company and personal) growth and projects for you to work on, everyday every period is a peak period. The company values growth above everything so there is a lot of room for new initiatives. The manpower is stretched so juniors and seniors have chance to drive major / key projects.","1. Leadership team is young hence does not possess the relevant experience and leadership skills like communication, nurturing, stewardship nor charisma to drive the team. Leaders mainly focus on executing when they should primarily be focused on grooming people. So from top to down, there is no emphasis/ importance on people culture, just get work done which results in high turnover. Personally changed more than 3 managers during my stint. 

2. Growth in career is a major trade-off with your personal life. Non-existent work-life balance and this is a basic expectation as you take on the role/ projects. No work life balance is the norm and you would feel 'judged' if you have work life balance. Someone once said ""wow how lucky you're leaving on time"" to me. To me, this is toxic but it is really a personal preference on how much one is willing to trade off. 

3. Flawed reward and recognition system; many promotions are typically given to people who have been in the company since the 'beginning' and may not be as experienced. Compensation is slightly below average compared to industry (similar size firms) in this role but not necessarily true for other roles.

4. Importance of speaking Chinese; It is not a preferred skill but rather a survival skill in this role."

2. Decent salary and benefits

3. Brand-name reputation in the region, and is only getting bigger","1. 0 separation between work and personal life:
- The nature of campaigns being run is that they go live at 12AM. This technically means you'll have a lot of days spent working till 12AM and beyond just to make sure everything runs smoothly. If you're someone who wants to plan a life outside of work, FORGET ABOUT IT.
- Like many other reviews have mentioned, the working hours are dismal, OT is the norm/expected and goes largely uncompensated. You might think that it only gets intense during big sale periods, but that is not true. You work at a back-breaking pace all year long, and management likes to assuage you that it gets better after 9.9/10.10/11.11, but that is simply not the case. The pace at which campaigns switch up and change every month leaves no respite, and most colleagues who have been here for more than 1.5 years are absolutely burnt out.
- Frequent meetings scheduled at 7PM (end of work)/our TOWNHALLS are held after working hours. Need I say more?
- On townhalls: during one of the presentations on Shopee's ""core values"", one of the slides presented was the core value ""I Commit"", where the slide states that exemplifying this value means employees must ""Make personal sacrifices for the organization"". On the other hand, an example given for someone who doesn't fulfill the core value is someone who ""Puts personal interests ahead of the organization"". I have no better example than this anecdote to illustrate the toxicity of working at Shopee.

2. The Backend is a mess.
- Product teams are expected to rush out new features to aggressively pursue growth, at the expense of quality-of-life features for employees. Therefore, what you get is a backend system that is extremely tedious and cumbersome, to the extent that some operations require you to be up at 12AM to simply push a button or edit a field, day in, day out. Completely unsustainable. When you request an update/improvement, they can only tell you that ""quality-of-life updates are in the pipeline, but are lowest priority"". 
- This is another example of how the C-level couldn't care less about their employees. Product teams push out features that are a complete mess on the backend and expect employees to work inefficiently to fill up the gaps. All in the name of rushing out some half-baked feature because ""our competitor is doing it too"".

3. Alarming lack of diversity
- Yes, the reviews are spot-on. The diversity in this company is abysmal. Working in Singapore, you will encounter entire tech teams that can only converse in Mandarin. If you don't speak their language, sitting in a meeting with them is a total nightmare. This is an issue that has been raised many times, and management has failed to address it."

1187,Shopee,Overall management needs to improve,2021-07-13,2.0,Marketing Analyst,"-Flat organizational structure.
-Young demographic, average age would be around 25.
-Benefits are okay, WFH setup with support (i.e. wifi reimbursement) during the pandemic.
-Trainings are provided.
-Growing industry.","-Very very high attrition rate. People only last 1 year if they don't leave earlier than that. Management/HR doesn't seem to be proactively doing anything about this since they'll just hire replacements.
-Upper management roles usually filled by expats instead of local talents. This causes a gap in understanding the local market and also affects overall leadership at times. They have little to no knowledge on on-the-ground execution and expect their team members to do things on the snap of a finger. 
-There's a lack in company-wide standardized processes especially with the virtual set up. One team's processes may differ from another. Overall internal communication is a mess, everything is cascaded and announced via Seatalk which is difficult to document and look back on. Too much chat groups with so many stakeholders which could have been easily solved by creating email lists. HR needs to look into this and improve because sometimes the leads themselves are disorganized. 
-No one enters the e-commerce industry not knowing that it's notorious for crazy hours. But management needs to stop glorifying overwork. Please prioritize your employees well-being so they don't eventually burn out. And no, this doesn't mean provide them with more mental health webinars. Revisit the workload distribution. Maybe evaluate if team leads are actually equipped with leadership skills. If a team member is doing 60 hours of OT per month, that doesn't mean he/she is an exemplary employee. That means you need speed up and hire 3 more people ASAP.  
-Pay gaps. HR will low-ball you if you were paid lower at your previous job even if you have the same experiece as another employee.
-HR will promise you performance bonuses but it is very very low despite good performance. 
-Management does a lot of questionable things in terms of strategy. The tendency to pivot a lot is given because of stiff competition, but Shopee needs to re-evaluate its intiatives in marketing and not just be reactive to LZD all the time."

1200,Shopee,Growing but not the best place for early career,2021-07-10,1.0,Campaign Analyst,it's growing and shopee has a large SEA presence.,"I think the most shocking thing in my time here is the professionalism of management and workers, in addition to the notorious hours and repetitive work that is already known with campaigns.

 Yes all managers are busy, but what kind of manager allows himself or herself to lie in order to support his or her beliefs/narrative of the story? This has happened to me twice with my manager. Once, I rode it off as a misunderstanding when I was being interrogated by weird questions about a scenario I barely knew about but encountering condescending tones from my manager as if I were to blame. 

The second time, I noticed the same thing again as he or she begins to spew out assumptions and weird questions based on something he or she heard? An example would be, ""this guy said this and this about this scenario, you were potentially doing XXX"". I go ask the colleague and weirdly the response would be I haven't talked ot the manager. Again, so many red flags about the integrity of managers/workers if this happens. 

Also, saw one person wrote that because hierarchy is so flat everyone is trying to be everyone's boss one way or another. This is so true.

Career growth opportunities are low. Not a lot of opportunities to learn a varied skillset, and it's weird that people here actually scold you for trying to learn more. So, I wouldn't recommend for people early in their careers."

- Friendly workmates and casual environment
- WFH, laptop, phone, quarterly team building
- So-so benefits.
- 3 weeks intensive training and another set of trainings under your category and tier level.
- Incentive when you acquire a seller to join selected campaigns (if you belong to a certain team)
- Campaigns can be done in a month","- Insane amount of google sheets trackers.
- Insane amount of meetings
- First time to witness attendance through gsheets instead of a system.
- Needs better systems / processes because they heavily rely on google sheets and google forms/stackforms. Then again, they don't seem to invest in it.
- Good branding but deceptive on the inside. 
- Upper management only cares about the results or numbers. Doesn't care about the people. Mostly Chinese with little firsthand knowledge about the country and culture. Rarely seen Filipinos in upper management roles. 
- Initiatives feels like I'm scamming accounts.
- You work to make the boss look good for his/her boss.
- Stressful workload. Strict when it comes to overtime unless it's an official task. But you need to catch up with the workload so you end up doing an OT without pay.
- If you're placed in ST, you get PIC roles and growth. Packages to pitch are much expensive. MT, little growth. Equally stressful because of adhoc work and seller concerns.
- Basically, the role is growing your shops, pitch to sellers, plot for deals and campaigns, assist seller concerns. Feels like a sales agent role.
- One campaign hasn't even started, you will be introduced to the next month's campaign. 
- Disorganized, sabog and communication heavily relies on chat app which makes tracking hard. People aren't as responsive in email as to chat app. So you tend to miss announcements and reports. Also, the amount of chat groups is insane.
- Short term plans. Long term is not visible because it is constantly changing.
- Chaotic processes leads to unnecessary stress for client facing roles.
- Pushes A LOT of marketing initiatives.
- High turnover like <5 people leave in a month per category. Management doesn't really address this since they'll just replace people. People usually last 1 year then leave.
- A lot in the team, roughly around 80-100. So it's kinda hard to climb up.
- As an external hire, I'm disappointed because it isn't as efficient as it brands itself, but if you like fast, wear multiple hats, multitask, maybe it's for you.
- Management says they understand but don't do much about it. It's all words."

They stay for the stock/pay - which is a great, and 
maybe only, “pro”

Hands-on experience since it’s still a start up company and has a much leaner process vs bigger companies.Your work probably has bigger revenue/growth impact vs biggercompanies. This pro could also be a con depending on your preference e.g. If you don’t want to do trivial work.","Horrifying culture that trickles down from the leadership. Horrifying. Period. Especially if you’re not used to hard-core a Chinese company culture. Just imagine the worst and that’s what it is. Employees are told to prioritize what’s best for Shopee over what’s best for yourself, unless it’s a “life or death” matter. Actual quote from the Csuite. Sound insane? True story.

Not much to learn. Is there a strategy other than (1) Exponentially expanding to other markets burning cash, or (2) Endlessly hiring juniors to do the operational, manual, boring work vs actual tech innovation? Maybe. But if there is, it’s clearly not communicated down to the juniors.

Sky high turnover rate. Most sensible people come in, get a shock, leave (many people leave even before 3 months probation out of pure shock), or constantly try to leave. Have you come across Shopee employees who are not actively trying to leave? Probably waiting for their stock to vest."

1384,Shopee,ZERO work life balance & psychotic top management who treat employees like slaves,2021-05-14,1.0,Marketing Associate,Abundance of snacks in the office. But you’re better off buying your own snacks than working in this hell of a company.,"- ZERO work life balance as you’re expected to work way past working hours (most weekdays till 1am), public holidays & weekends. You’re expected to be contactable 24/7 (literally).

-  Top-down management approach, meaning whatever management or your boss tells you to do, you have to do it even if you have to stay up for 48 hours to finish something assigned to you at the last minute without a wink of sleep.

- Your voice is not heard AT ALL. You can try speaking to your boss or HR about issues that you’re facing at work but it’ll only get brushed off.

- Terrible & incompetent teammates. As the company is very flat, many (if not all) your more senior teammates will try to be your mini boss.

- Horrible working culture as there is so much hostility among different teams.

- No training or proper guidance whatsoever and you’re only assigned a buddy at the start to “teach” you. If you’re as unlucky as most, your buddy won’t teach you anything. If you’re a fresh grad, you should run and look elsewhere.

- Crazy bosses who work round the clock, have no life and expect you to be as miserable as them.

- Work for 20 hours & sleep for 4 hours during peak days of big campaigns (i.e. 11.11, 12.12). The best part is that your bosses would act like it’s no big deal that you’re sacrificing your sleep & weekend every month.

- Crazy attrition rate, meaning at least 1 of your team member would leave the company every month. Even though the company is hiring aggressively, it’s a waste of time having to train & retrain your colleagues since most people will leave rather quickly.

- Company’s only long-term mission is to beat Lazada out of the market. 

- Manual workflows that require intensive human labour. As one of my ex-colleagues once put it, Shopee is a human sweatshop.

My advice - unless you’ve gone crazy, no amount of salary would make it worth working here."

- HRs are very irresponsive and unhelpful especially after you leave company

Here is my story that I haven't got paid till now:
I've left Shopee in 24 Feb of 2021, yet haven't received my remaining salary so far. It's a norm that company will withhold last month salary until tax clearance comes out. But the date to receive remaining salary shouldn't be later than 30 days after the termination of employment, i.e. company should pay you no later than one month after last employment day even though the tax assessment hasn't been submitted or done. (what MOM told me) 

After I left company, I've sent some emails to seek advise from HRs regarding when to expect my remaining salary and when to file my tax assessment. I got ZERO reply. I didn't realize Shopee violates the law until I called out and checked details with IRAS and MOM many times, so I reported an employment act violation to MOM and forwarded the mail to HRs to ask for the status of my remaining salary. And finally they answered me and told me to wait till tax clearance came out sometime maybe in mid May (they filed my tax assessment on 8 Apr which was more than 1.5 mths after I left Shopee) That's really unacceptable! Now, I've been in touch with MOM again and hopefully they'll push Shopee to pay me ASAP. 

Sharing my irritating experience about dealing with Shopee regarding my last mth salary is to give you a heads up when you resign. Good luck!"

1544,Shopee,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,2021-04-06,1.0,Analyst,Nice office which lures you into thinking the company cares about you,"THE WORST place I have ever worked at. Nothing gets worse then this. The marketing department is filled with racist, bullying colleagues who will do ANYTHING to step on you to get what they want. 

→ There is NO such thing as work life balance here. I would work from 8 AM until 1 AM at night every single day for MONTHS. Management don't care if you burnout because they have someone else ready to replace you once you're done. Campaign period was the worst where we were staffed on weekends, and would work past midnight most days. 

→ No job security: I would get threatened by my manager that they would fire me if I didn't do more overtime or deliver. This is a very common technique they used with other employees to scare them into working harder. 

→ People are INCREDIBLY rude. I have never met such passive aggressive managers and colleagues. People would intentionally highlight your mistakes to the manager to step on you, and get promoted ahead of you. 

→ Turnover is incredibly high (half our team turned over within half a year, with several others thinking to quit). 

→ People were racist, and I would not advise working here unless if you're Singaporean Chinese/from mainland China. People were racist to me several times, and I felt limited in the opportunities that I had because of my race. 

→ No sense of accomplishment: Everything is about MORE at Shopee. Once 9.9 campaign is over, it's time to focus on 10.10, 11.11 and 12.12. I never was once thanked or appreciated for any of my efforts, and was always forced to look ahead. 

STAY away from this place if you care about your wellbeing and overall job prospects. I've seen many people who absolutely hate their job at Shopee but cannot leave because they are scared of leaving, and so they instead just try to climb upwards. The worst half year of my life, and now I'm making a higher salary and working half as many hours at a better company that cares about my wellbeing."

I feel like I'm somewhat in a college organization again, but it makes the environment less boring.","Difficult to perform tasks because of constant changes mandated from other departments. The Relationship Manager role can be difficult because of this, our position does not decide on the changes, we only implement the changes.

- Company pays you for 10am-7pm and expects you to work till 10pm. It is so shameful and sad that company arranges town-hall meeting after 7pm. Meetings after 7pm is quite normal.

- Company benefits are horrible. $1000 limit for insurance. Does the company know how much specialist cost in Singapore?

1704,Shopee,Unsupportive HR and staffs are treated unfairly,2021-02-23,2.0,Team Lead,Great and friendly colleagues who are pretty supportive,"1. HR squeezes out the staff as they are mainly focusing on making money for the company, and refused to hear out the options, feedback provided from the staff. 

2. Can you imagine that promotion has NO promotion increment, but just a title? Yes, that happened in SHOPEE MALAYSIA. So think twice before you join. 

3. As a freshie, if you start your pay at a lower range, don't ever think that Shopee would give you a higher pay when you're here for long. 

4. Pay between an Associate who served the company for a year long is ~RM500 differences between a Senior Associate. Yes, this happened. 

5. A junior pay (less than 6months) is higher than a senior (2 years within the company). Yes, that happened too. 

6. Intern is having a higher pay than a full time. Oh yes, if you wish to have a higher pay as an intern, join Shopee. 

7. Regardless of how hard you work, how well you do your job; at the end of the day, the middle management would only rate you based on your 'relationship' with them. 

- A staff who worked tirelessly with the manager until 3-4am yet the increment and bonus in 2020 was less than 9%. (Oh well, the staff tendered without securing a job as the staff was tired of how Shopee manage their staff/ policies etc). 
- A managerial staff who is LESS COMPETENT, great at phrasing beautiful words, definitely a great talker, yet can't do the job well (as in managing a team, handling a project) is STILL act as a manager. Currently, 90% of the team members left the team, except the favourite member who scored an A in last year's assessment.

8. Thinking of career progression in Shopee, please look for other places. They only intend to push someone from the outside world to take care of their portfolio."

Thumbs up to myself for being able escape from here and find a pleasant company.","1. HR can surely be more helpful and less ignorant. Once you left the company, they no longer answer your question regarding pending matters. No one is ever going to respond to you.
And interestingly, look at the short and repetitive good reviews showing up here. Like some reviews mentioned, HR FAKED MANY POSITIVE REVIEWS. THAT'S CHEATING!
2. HR low ball you all the time. Try very hard to negotiate the salary when they offer. Ask for a 20% higher number than your expectation because the HR will low ball you by cutting a 20% even though you give a very reasonable number.
3. Incompetent team managers who are extremely young think they are the best. They got to that place only because they kissed up to higher ups. They literally know nothing about team management and morale management. My team manager bluntly told my teammate I don't care about the moral... in my entire career, I have never met such an ignorant team manager.
4. Depends on your team, the projects you work on or even the entire product line can be cancelled or treated like a joke if your manager only cares about politics and showing face in front of senior management. Some team leaders treated their own projects like a joke and only cares about how to window-dress the project results. 
5. A lot of Chinese people and team managers who can't speak proper English. Good luck to you if your Chinese is not good enough to get the unspoken message. Be prepared for high-contextual Chinese your managers will use and the weird English they speak in.
6. People do not understand the meaning of OFF-WORK and PRIVACY. Ping you every now and then after work."

- No one believes in proper briefing. Information often comes in bits and pieces with little to no background context. 
- Very chinese-centric. Some decks and product documents are written in Chinese, expecting everyone in team to understand despite Chinese fluency not being a part of the job description.

If you are a family man/women don't expect to go home see your kids make dinner all. If you are a student your manager will tell you see how if you can go attend your class or not even if they know you're a working student. What kind of response is that? 
Also offered me job say job is only mine if I can start in 2 weeks even if they know my notice is 1 month in resume. 
Working hours states 930am to 7pm. But some people come 1030 already still go home 7pm manager say nothing. People take 2.5hrs lunch also manager say nothing. But when ask if can leave to go to school answer is see how. 
Can't stay here if you want worklife balance. Very draining sure burn out. Also if you are non Chinese you're going to be discriminated.

- PRC dominated. PRCs who had zero people skills became team lead instead of more competent people. This made the culture in the team even worse than it was before. This is a common occurrence 
- Overly focused on *looking* hardworking for the boss. Colleagues always trying to put up a show on how “long” they work. Emails prepared in advance to send in weekends and in the wee hours of the morning.
- When the bosses asked why some team mates had to work long hours, instead of crediting them for their work and dedication, the incompetent team leads often use the “he/she starts late and takes long lunches” reason
- department head praises workers who stay late and loudly mentions the name of those who leave at 8pm “so free ah? go back already?”
- suffocating environment that only expects you to do as you are told

- Fast-paced. Some may like the hustle. But the word fast-paced is often misused. The real reason why the work life of Shopee as fast-paced is because there are so many inefficiencies plaguing the company. Lack of systems, high staff count (they say its expansion, but hey, it's because you lack any foundations and hiring more is just a stop-gap measure)","- As I've mentioned, lack of proper internal tools and systems to streamline workload. A lot of manual work.

- Top down approach. A lot of yes men and women in this company, particularly middle management. Employees who are bottom of the command chain suffers.

- Inexperienced managers and leadership. Chaotic. Political. Especially with the mass hiring practices. 
good employee may not make a good manager. I've seen many who are promoted to people managers in a short span of time, but their leadership skills can be lacking."

Relatively good exposure to various subject matters.","Extremely biased against employees who don’t speak Chinese as their main language. You’ll be ostracised and don’t feel like you’re part of the team. This is Singapore, not China.

The seniors and managers love bootlickers. You don’t need to be competent in your job; as long as you make the people “up there” happy, you’re guaranteed a smooth sailing career. True hard workers, however, are subject to criticism all the time. 

Expects everyone to devote their time to the company 24/7, but do not acknowledge one’s efforts. Extremely results-focused. You can devote 24 hours in a day but as long as they deem your work as unsatisfactory, don’t even dream of getting recognised for the hard work you put in. Isn’t the point of an entry level job for you to learn and grow? If you pay an entry level salary and expect the employee to magically make zero mistakes, you’re very wrong.

They pride themselves for being a growing “top” e-commerce company in the region, acting like a Google wannabe but their working culture is very much like any SME out there. 

Bad planning in management as well. Managers are only managers because of the years they put in for the company; not whether they can truly lead a team.  As a result, you see many seniors who can do their work properly, but are clearly not of managerial material."

Great learning experience for those looking to break into the ecommerce sector. Learn quite a bit about technical project management, coming as someone with no relevant background","Terrible working culture. More than half of my department were from the mainland, and with it comes a certain different work culture as well. Very inflexible to change, reluctance to adopt new ideas and suggestions in improving work processes. Chinese management comes with the expectation of OT, where leaving ON TIME or even 30 minutes past working hours will get you questioned on why you're leaving. Expect to work until 11pm on multiple days a week just to meet departmental expectations.
HR statistics on OT were also skewed, I witnessed first hand, how some colleagues had to deliberately submit heavily edited reports on working hours, cutting the actual OT hours worked in the past month by more than 80% just to provide a visually appealing result back to the HR department.
Many colleagues share negative sentiments on the work life balance upon joining, and are simply looking to get the experience and move on to the next, better workplace as soon as possible"

2) An opportunity to be a leader due to its current aggressive hiring policy (There is a lack of System QA talents in Singapore due to the job scope is not actively learnt in the university, unlike example, Java / Python developer or DBA)
3) Lots of benefits, including Union membership, Gym within company compound and 18 days of annual leave (Longer than standard 14 days elsewhere)
4) Annual Bonus can be up to 3 months, subjected to meeting / exceeding KPI","1) This role requires a developer thinking mindset, and also a Project Manager thinking mindset.

A System QA Engineer is like a goal keeper, the last line of defence against buggy implementation / or implementation that dont meet either functional or non-functional requirement.

Therefore, the skillsets required for this role can be quite demanding.

2) The working hours is 10am to 7pm, some people find it a concern due to the office is located in a relatively inaccessible area (Lack of food choices within the area after evening)

3) This is a role under ""Engineering"" department, which requires 2 months of notice period if the employee ever wished to resign. It is considered longer than usual 1 month notice period.

4) For those who wanted to gain ""International exposure"" (Working abroad beyond Singapore) as career goals, this role is probably not suitable. 

Despite Shopee has QA teams abroad (Mainly in Shenzhen and Taipei), there is no known policy of transferring Singapore based employees to its local office abroad (Except its Management Leadership Programme). However as a Singapore based company, it offers work visa and PR sponsorship for people who wished to settle in Singapore.

Currently, there is a possibility for current employees based in Singapore to request for a job role changes subjected to certain performance requirements."

- Overwork employees for small value-adding work
- HR will not look out for you once you are hired; do not expect them to deal with you on any work-related issues unless you are part of the problem
- Harassment and use of inappropriate language is the norm (you have been warned)
- Unhealthy blame culture instead of fixing root cause of the company's many problems

Extremely 2-faced and hypocritical as well.

When other team needs help, we are actually obligated to help, and they would also shamelessly make us do their job without an ounce of gratitude or appreciation. 

Reporting officer title for show, no say or authority in anything. No decision-making power as well, literally like a pet to its owner with a golden food bowl as a reward for being a ""good boy"" all these years. 

If you want an internal transfer, be prepared to stay in your current dreadful position for 3 years first before you want to consider any transfer, and it's not even guaranteed. Basically, just put on a facade and try to get into the good books of your manager first, same goes for career progression. Wait for at least 3 years maybe. 

If you are not from a local uni, be prepared to be low-balled, don't say I didn't warn you. This company is full of foreigners, China people mostly. Have to give it to China people for being extremely smart and hardworking, but a handful of them are damn entitled. Personally, feel this sense of entitlement is manifested in this company for worshipping them.

We have at least 50 new hires every WEEK, because turnover rate is ridiculously high but of course it's justifiable."

2013,Shopee,Be Proactive to Succeed,2020-10-29,4.0,Relationship Manager,"1. Dynamic and high potential industry, so adapting to changes is something the company is good at
2. Adapted well to the pandemic
3. Excellent L&OD trainings (local and regional) for personal and professional growth
4. Internal databases and resources are extremely useful and highly efficient
5. Great place to grow in character since the stress really tests your resilience - but you have to be proactive if you want to progress your career. Ask for opportunities, be observant of openings/PIC roles, and make yourself recognized. Don't shadow around and expect career growth to be handed to you on a silver plate. 
6. Fun, start-up culture
7. Especially with the WFH set-up, inter-regional/inter-cultural dialogue happens a lot
8. Highly data-driven","1. A lot of the tasks are manual and tedious
2. Overtime is a culture. The ""We Run"" value of Shopee can tend to glorify overworking oneself, even though that may not be organization's intention.
3. Initiatives tend to be overly competitor-centric, especially in the PH context wherein e-commerce is a duopoly. I feel that this isn't necessarily bad since looking out for competitors is important in any industry, but upper management must be very transparent in communicating the purpose and initiatives well to the rest of the employees. The purpose gets lost in translation often given the intense amount of tasks we need to do.
4. [Could be a pro or a con, depending on how you see it] All functions expect proactiveness, diligence, and NEED you to be meticulous on details. People won't run after you to get things done -- you have to create a system for yourself wherein you are able to meet deadlines and do your job efficiently and of quality.
5. Career progression isn't very clear, but this can be solved by proactively communicating with your direct reporting manager often and understanding the other functions within and outside your department.
6. Comms/coordination/announcements across departments and within teams are cascaded over company group chats, so it's pretty disorganized and easy to overlook. Depends on the team and department how they organize it since each dept/team operates differently.
7. High attrition rate for Business Development Department, which says a lot about the nature of the work and the leaders."

Have the facade of an established MNC due to all the funding they get but they are really just a start up.

Micromanaging like crazy, enforce that you must turn on camera for video calls, even for those calls with crazy amount of attendees (50>). Their excuse is to give more ""office-like"" feel but really, it's just to make sure you are in front of your pc during the entire course of meeting (1-2 hours). On the topic of meeting, you will be required to attend irrelevant meeting that takes up your work time then expect you to do unpaid OT to finish up your task.

Good name on resume but bad experience on work life. They may offer a higher salary, especially for fresh grads but that is just to trap you in because other companies won't pay as high. Once you're trap, they can overwork you however they want and you can't do anything about it because you can't find another job that pays as well due to your lack of experience. You can't leave unless you take a pay cut, but if you are experienced hire then it's not as bad. Think carefully before joining."

- No prioritization. Everything's urgent, and most of the time you don't know why.
- No appreciation. At least leaders can learn to say simple 'thank you' or 'please.' I think it's quite different between treating someone as a team member, or as a servant.
- Initiatives or creative thinking? Forget it. The most important thing is to do what your boss wants. Very top-down culture. Directions can change anytime, without consideration of how much effort and energy that has been put/will be needed to change at the last minute. What's the objective or business impact?

- Lots of interesting events hosted by people team
- Decent salary and option to get equity for those that meet the seniority requirements","Senior managers (team leads) are by far the single worse thing about working in Shopee, all other cons pale in comparison. These managers have the autonomy to set their own culture within their team. 

In most companies, there are bad managers but they are usually kept in check by HR from becoming too extreme. However at Shopee, HR has no oversight or visibility on what goes on within the teams, they are simply too busy with recruiting. Also, you cannot complain to HR about your manager because there is so much political BS going on, there's a chance your complaint will be traced back to you in which case your manager will show you the door. 



1. Work life balance
- E-commerce is a 24/7, 365 days business, if you’re in product/ tech etc. you may be called at any time, even while you’re on holiday 
- Not responding in group chats within ~30mins is frowned upon, they will escalate to your manager and you will get scolded. Thus you end up checking your phone every 10mins or so (over weekend, outings with friends etc) to make sure the on-going group chats do not involve you 
- Some managers are known to ""test"" new employees by sending them tasks on weekends to determine how long it takes for them to respond. Managers will use these stupid tests to form an opinion of how “hard working” they are 


2. Micromanagement 
- Shopee managers are notorious for being micromanagers. I believe this culture is largely driven top down from the C-suite leaders who tend to see micromanagement positively as ""having paying attention to detail"" 


3. Chinese culture/ language
- If you can’t speak Chinese, don’t bother joining. 
- CEO has publicly said to focus hiring on PRCs and not Singaporeans as Singaporeans tend to be ‘lazier’ i.e. complain more about work-life balance etc, which I guess is kind of true since no such thing exists in China 
- Taking long leave i.e. >5days is frowned upon. The attitude is ‘you should feel grateful you have a job here’. My managers complained about me to my peers behind my back while i was on leave for 8 days (I was getting married in another country) 
- If you’re in tech, most meetings are conducted in Chinese, PRDs are in Chinese, most dev's english ability range from poor to none at all



4. Unprofessional team leads/ managers 
- Some managers even publicly scolded their team members for: leaving office on time (regardless of whether work is completed) 
- Feedback is never direct, it's always done behind people’s back or you get scolded on the office floor in front of everyone to “send a message” to others 


Team leads have little experience leading people 
Team leads are mostly appointed by being in “the right place at the right time” ~3 years ago when Shopee was a small start up, they survive by expertly managing the office politics 
Team leads do not have sufficient experience to understand the complexity of your task, frankly they don’t care until something is delayed or there is an issue. Then they will interrogate you until they can find something to scold you for
Team leads do not have sufficient experience to provide meaningful mentorship to their direct reports. Some leads have 10+ direct reports, they simply don't have the time either"

Narrow career path: Brainwash is popular there and people are working extremely hard to fight for promotions while senior managers prefer hiring externals rather than promoting people internally. 

If you want to explore other departments, don’t think about it, many dirty actions are waiting for you.

Bad management: Top down culture especially being told it is top down directly in the dept. Inconsistent decision making, incapable managers with terrible micromanagement and bad scope management. Result driven and squeeze people with tight deadline while do not care about how late people are staying in the office. Senior leads care about own interests which are against company’s interests. No integrity at all.

HR is not supportive: The company does not have any independent team to hear your voice and HR likes to execute management decisions without careful investigation when unfair things happened.

Because of this reason, I notice that new employees who came from different companies do not stay long.

Long working hours and knock-off time is 7 pm but don't expect to leave on time. Low insurance and medical benefits. High expectations from new hires on day one.

- With political mindset, there is always an opportunity to get close to the manger and the role that you play.
- Manager begins brainwashing team members in cult of his as early as the first day you join. This team is more like an communist in army camp. 
- Search and RCMD are rational fields but with this irrational lead....things can go very complicated. 

Can ask any PM in Shopee, they must have heard of something aggressive about this manager. Most of us left feeling disgruntled at the way we'd been treated."

- Social events and team outings are not uncommon in Shopee

2. Fast-paced eCommerce industry promotes a good amount of individual growth and understanding of what's in store for the future of retail

3. Good place to grow one's network as one gets to connect with people from different walks of life","1. Little to no career progression prospects
- This is true especially for local employees in the PH as Shopee likes to hire expats to fill roles instead of promoting dedicated existing workers
- Shopee hires a lot because of the very high turnover rate (possibly due to the first reason)

2. Distasteful Office Politics from Upper Management
- can be attributed to reason 1 as well
- Expats hired in upper management end up hiring more expats instead of promoting dedicated existing employees

3. The company is merely a disruptor to it's competitor, Lazada
- every single action taken by Shopee is geared towards beating Lazada, despite it being at the expense of their employees and sellers
- the company is merely a disruptor in this sense. Which is why instead of focusing on developing its people and constituents, Shopee merely focuses on implementing quick band-aid solutions instead of having long term plans in developing the company and it's people further. All because they really have to beat Lazada.

4. Uneven ratio of Workload and Pay
- You may be given a significant amount of workload and roles compared to another employee, however he/she can be paid the same or sometimes even more
- better to come in the company as someone with experience rather than a fresh grad if you are looking for high pay
- Having even a sliver of extra work experience can mean having double the salary compared to a fresh grad, despite having the exact same role as them"

Vibe and work stations are well design.
Working with one of the best team managers in Shopee.
Toilets and environment are always clean.
Company is growing as a whole, will have new departments and all for you to learn more.","Management does not know the target they would like to achieve. Hence cannot provide KPI for most of the staffs. No clear career progression, very hard to go for higher rank despite achievement and years of experience working in Shopee.
HR is not doing their part to improve our working condition, they keep hiring people but the desk did not increase desk space as fast, I can forsee we will be cramping everywhere after Covid ends. 
HR is does not allow feedbacks and cannot handle criticism. They closed the company group chat because too many people complaint in it. But they did not address to those complaint or even respond to the complaint within the group chat, of course people will be complaining. Now they closed it, all the complaints that can be settled internally will be open to public in Glassdoor / jobstreet etc. 
They are also very slow in hiring process even for urgent positions. Whenever we refer our friends in they did not even responded to our request and rejected. Even friends who previously worked as sellers in Shopee also failed their first screening for urgent position. 
Pay is definitely on the low end. For current employee you can try to search for the same task and being offered better pay somewhere else.
There is no increment of annual leave even after working here for years.
Biggest favouritism is where Ian only focus on BD and Marketing. BD team at times can make mistakes costing the company up to 100K++ losses but was not penalized or taken action upon. Promoting a culture of ""no big deal"" making such mistakes from their end.
They have L&D department but its useless as we are deeply understaffed and managers will not approve you to go for any training."

- processes change frequently; as the team in the company is generally young, the current processes can change overnight. Worst part is when you are tasked to do something and is already in the midst of it, another set of instructions can arrive all of a sudden resulting in you changing the entire way you are doing the current task, which is really frustrating and time wasting
- some departments have great culture difference; there are some depts which comprises of mostly China internationals and as much as I have to agree they are good and responsible in their work, you will still feel left out if you join such department due to the culture difference, and worst, language barrier. Some documentations are written in chinese and meetings held in chinese too

She can't well manage her own team and can't even protect her own team, she set her own expectation to her team member but herself broke all. Come late everyday, simply throw new task without guiding you. Disappear when we need her, but when she need you no matter midnight or weekend still will texted you. Ask us to done her report and she just use our hard work to show her head and MD. She wont accept any advise, just a ego person who just care her own performance. She can't assign right thing to right person. 

Diff jobscope when interview and after you join, they just lie you to hope you join the company 

Workload is crazy, everyday work more than 12hr, but when ask HR help, HR will just tell you there is no policy on this and advise you talk to your team lead. But the team lead know, she just dont care about your workload and keep throw you new task.

Means HR dont help at all when facing this problem and just push you back to settle yourself.

Now i dont understand why we need so many HR in HR department and dont understand why will have a person who obviously not suitable as Lead become a team lead.

Everyone suffer."

- Good people get overworked with little compensation, wont be surprised if people leave coz of this
- People get hired coz of their grades in uni, and these people are bringing their selfish, ""elitist"" attitude to Shopee by thinking about others or the big picture

Competitive salary
Good engineering culture and diversity in my team
Great CTO","Very bad diversity in other teams (mostly PRCs).
Incompetent colleague from other teams (especially promotion team)
No clear vision from CEO. Micromanage."
2229,Shopee,Wasted Potential,2020-03-09,1.0,Associate,"- Pretty decent compensation & benefits
- pantry stocked most of the time","- The fact that most of the reviews about the pros of working in Shopee is mainly compensation based speaks volumes about the culture of the people here. It feels like the only reason most people work here/retain here are because they are paid adequately enough to forgo the ugly parts of the company. As it stands, it feels like I'm only here to do my job adequately enough just to collect salary, I wouldnt 'champion' working here to others.
- The mass hiring rate means that most of the time, new hires were made just to meet numbers rather than showing the right profile culture & competency wise.
- There is a top down feeling of toxicity as well where people generally see the worst in each other and often display either two faced treatment/favourtism
- They like to advertise how 'fun' or 'innovative' it is in here to portray the image of a company that is willing to try new things, but that is far from the case internally. Most new suggestions are often turned down by people in more senior positions because 'its now how we usually do things here' or 'we always did it this way instead'
- Shopee's standard response to negative feedback is alway 'we are still a startup', which quite frankly cant be further from the group. Although Shopee is less than a decade old, according the Malaysia SME Corp guidelines, startups are supposed to be less than 6 months of operation.. We are also strongly financially backed and have a strong presence in multiple countries across south east asia and brazil as well. How can we still go forward with this 'start up mentality' if we are already such a global brand?
- HR displays a sense of toxicity as well in that they always assume the worst in the rest of the people. When people ask genuine questions, its always retorted sarcastically or in disgust. There is also a lot of talking behind other employees back as well. As a function that is supposed to champion the needs of employees without forgoing business needs, it feels like the HR here always assumes and expects the worst of the company while putting themselves on a high stool.
- Company wants to retain talent, yet are not necessarily taking action in initiatives that will address this. It feels like the only way Shopee can think to retain people is to throw things at them during special occasions/celebrations, but even then, budget cuts means the quality of things get worst each time.
- I dont think i even need to go into work-life balance as the working hours here are so rigid we even have to tap in and out each time to have our attendance recorded. Feels like high school all over again, even college/uni didnt require us to do something like this.

I've been here less than a year and I already feel all these things, and my review is not the only one that mentions these things."

- Not sure if it is due to the company or the management but there is lot of forcing  and one way communication.
- Unnecessary after work meeting which can be done within working hours. 
- The longer you stay there,  you will realized how the job is sucking your soul.

But immensely full of politics.","Lately, HR has come to learn of its bad reviews on glassdoor and has made every employee write 5 start ratings back on glassdoor. Is very evident with the sudden increase of positive review in the past 2 weeks.

Also dislike the patronising replies by HR to some of the negative feedback left by employees. Seriously, were they truly ""shocked"" and ""surprised"" by the negative sentiments? Either the HR staff are totally not in-sync with the company culture or just being hypocritical on keyboards, either way, is telling of the company culture when HR behaves in such an unprofessional way.

Absolutely distasteful and disgusting."

With Shopee its like falling in love. 1st month, you'll be all over Shopee. 6th month you start to see flaws. After a year - you'll be completely out of love. And before you'll be able to complete be out of love with Shopee - its too late, they already have someone to replace you. At least, I can guarantee you'll be able to stay in Shopee for a year :) Its a fun and energetic team eventhough its toxic.  

- Used to have tea time, now no more :(","- With above point, they hire new people most of the time - they don't groom their internal. So can forget about career progression if you join here.  Like I said, stagnant. 

- When they say they hire multiracial, ask them the percentage of at the 3 main races in Malaysia. You'll be able to tell how 'multiracial' they are. 

- HR internally is corrupted and integrity is not their thing. i.e Decision been made cater to their own opinion, biggest issue - change of policy, change of contract clause. 

- There's OT allowance, but not applicable to those earn > RM3000. But expected to work extra hours. Great! #LifeAtShopee

- Young, fresh hire. Sounds fun? Indeed. However there's a fine line between young and matured hires. Nothing is wrong to hire fresh grad and give them position that requires prior experience. But, it is wrong to give authority and power to the inexperience employee. No advantage if you have experience cos they don't know how to appreciate. Maybe upper management have insecurity issue."

I am sitting near the internal staircase and quite near to the exit. Every day, I saw a lot of employees leave the company at 6:00 or 6:15. And I am pretty sure they are not coming to work before 10:00. 

Our suggested working hours are from 9:30-12:30, 12:30-2:00 lunch break, 2:00-7:00. 

After being with the company for more than 1.5 years, I really saw the improvement of it.

1) HR is most definitely biased, racially inclined and do not actually take actions against employees that break rules.
2) Team leads who do not know their job are hired and promoted despite them not contributing to the team
3) Company does not respect maintaining employee privacy
4) Appraisal is based on how Manager feels about you and has no reflection to actual performance

Horrible work-life balance,  never ending ad hocs, unplanned added campaigns with high achievement expectations.

Once you take that away, Shopee is nothing but a company that micro-manages its staff, over-working them, stingy when it comes to compensation and extremely elitist when it comes to hiring. The first thing they consider is if you have upper tier honors/from local uni or not.

They are not like this initially. I think they need to re-evaluate their position and stop sticking their heads up in the clouds. 

I have friends that were rejected from Shopee, simply because they do not go to a local university. They would much rather hire a fresh grad from a local uni.

Secondly, career progression is vague. There is no clear charted path for you from your manage despite discussions. Performance review is based on arbitrary ratings and KPI's were not clearly defined.

Thirdly, there is no work life balance. Half days on major holidays (CNY etc) is subjected to Manager's approval. And half days are from 3pm onward. If you were to take leave, its equivalent to an entire day off. 0 flexibility.

The style of working as well, is very very very micro. Weekly lengthy reports done on Powerpoint slides (smh) and having meetings with CEO every single week. You would expect a company that is supposedly made up of young millennials to function a little better, but its working like a giant local  SME lol"

I think this is a major concern as Chinese is the main language of communication and if Shopee still hires non-Chinese speaking people to fill roles that require close working relationships with these PRCs, how can it be expected that they can perform well if they cannot even communicate well? This is extremely demoralising for non-Chinese speakers. Some PRCs do not even have sufficient English speaking skills to be able to carry out a conversation. I think it should be made clear during interviews that proficiency in Chinese is mandatory (at least be upfront about it!) and Shopee should not offer someone a job if they know that they cannot speak Chinese well. Requesting the PRCs to speak English during meetings just blatantly widens the cultural gap and as mentioned, some cannot even conduct meetings in English. This has been raised in previous reviews but I don't think anything has been done to improve the situation. However, it definitely needs to be looked into and I hope that Shopee HR and management take this seriously."

- Lower level jobs are easily done properly with MS Office skills and great time management, to be quite frank, so it could be a pro or a con for you

- I didn't think I was really learning at all since I felt like I was doing the same thing over and over again. Plus, everyone I wanted to learn from was also constantly too busy so I just felt like a robot in an environment of peers who made it seem like I was back in high school"
2294,Shopee,Micromanaging CEO is a pain to work with,2019-10-09,1.0,Full Time,Fast paced and very young colleagues. A lot of non-monetary perks like free gym and well stocked pantry.,"- If you have to get direct approvals from CEO, be warned because he is a huge pain to work with. You might think that only the top management has to deal with his nonsense, that's where you're wrong. He likes to micromanage the smallest things, so chances are you will have to go through him even if you are in a junior position. One usually wonders if he ever considers making better use of his time than replying emails about the smallest approval requests with ""ok"".

- this company mostly appreciates engineers. They had a fancy engineer appreciation day at a hotel, projects are usually done in favour of engineers timeline and effort even if it means the results will be undesirable for the product. If you are not an engineer, expect to be treated like a second class employee.

- HR likes to say that they are trying their best to diversify the workplace and hire from different cultures. But truth is, the work culture in Shopee is very Cheena, so usually they end up hiring Chinese people and preferably PRCs because those tend to fit in better. The hard truth is that Shopee's culture is not made to embrace diversity because if you can't do it the Cheena way (not questioning your leaders even if they're wrong which sometimes means enabling a toxic environment, doing things by copying instead of thinking, staying back late and pretending to do work so that it appears as if you are hardworking), you don't deserve to work here."
