Nice perks and expense heating and other bills to a certain extent 
lovely people and great support for any questions 
not stingy with tech equipment and replacements","- Rotating shift - really up and down hours 
- Some perks have limitation based on quality of work and can be very hard to reach quality standards. 
- Some forms of micromanagement 
- Light suggestions made very serious afterwards and can get stressful
- chats are 3 chats and can be all very different issues- like tax, bugs and etc.. 
- Support positions sounding very sales based and getting quality scored on that. 
- If pitching is not done- can become very stressful 
- feels like 2 departments combined to 1"

13,Shopify,TOXIC CULTURE. AVOID this place!,2022-04-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,New laptops. Fully remote. LSA is nice. Sends you random gifts from merchants.,"TOXIC work culture. Very low pay for the industry. If you have free space on your calendar, your manager wants to know about it. Manager doesn’t care about growth. They will cut you out and replace you in an instant."
14,Shopify,Burn out central,2022-04-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You get to work from home and you get a lifestyle spending account and sometimes they send gifts (however the lower in the employee pecking order you are, the substantially less you get)","I worked as a support advisor at Shopify for 2.5 years. This role is widely known within the organisation to be the most difficult and the least rewarding. You get treated like a lesser being by escalated teams and everyone is desperately trying to get a promotion and one-up you because it's such a stressful job. If you are lucky you will get a good team leader but they usually change a lot, because the turnover is high and a team of 10 might all of a sudden turn into a team of 4. 
The pay feels bad for the amount of work you put in. It's also really hard to get a promotion unless you brown-nose with the right people. I know some popular advisors were offered multiple promotional roles despite not having experience or skills in some of those fields. 
I was also told by a team leader that you will almost always be rejected the first time you apply for a promotion because they want to make sure you really want the job before they accept you, even if you seem like a good fit. So you have to apply for the same role and get rejected multiple times before they will accept you. People in this role usually have very broken spirits and are very burnt out. I don't know anyone who enjoys this role."

- Expense accounts and good health insurance coverage.
- Easy to use Slack channels and Google vs. using Zoom.
- Some really great coworkers and free stuff.
- If you work in other non-support departments you get more flexible PT and vacation.","If you're in a support role then this job is increasingly stressful and there is no proper compensation for it. Those in support, especially advisors, are told we are the frontline support and a necessity, that we are applauded for our work. Juggling 3 chats and back to back calls where you endure a lot of abuse and complex technical/code questions from customers you are not trained on adequately and your breaks are observed like a hawk by your lead supervisor and others. We are even told not to take PT on our work days if we can help it and your work-life balance is non-existent. Advisors get burnt out with the amount of work we are expected to do, no raises, no fair compensation, we don't even get paid time off during the holidays like everyone else in the company. Internal movement is near impossible because they prefer external hiring unless you know someone, which is why a lot of advisors quit or jump into whatever role is open despite having no experience and the higher ups are well aware. The mental health and culture of support is crumbling and the higher ups are not willing to take a look at this and do something about it. Very white culture and a lot of your bosses/higher ups will be white. There is no room for growth for those in the support department and we are separated from the rest of the company."

Career advancement will heavily depend on whether one lands on a team that is working on a shiny new feature and whether the manager cares about one's career advancement.

- Remote work, I can stay home all day with my fur babies but also have the option to travel and work from anywhere I please! 
- Wellness, Shopify really cares about our work life balance and our mental health, we have so much support from the company it is unreal. I never have to work overtime and if I do then it is 100% my choice and I am compensated for my time. In saying that they only allow up to 8 hours extra per week to make sure we have enough time to rest!
- Meeting new people : I am based in NZ, however I have worked alongside people from all different walks of life and even in completely different timezones to myself. I have also had a few friends join me on the journey after seeing just how amazing my job is! 
- Opportunity to grow : I have been here 2.5 years now and the opportunities have been endless, there is always people you can reach out to and new opportunities to look into with the company growing so rapidly. I NEVER thought I would consider myself technical and 2.5 years later I am digging into issues that I thought I would never know how to troubleshoot! 
- The environment : Shopify is like a family, its unlike ANY other business I have ever worked for before, they genuinely care about you and I have built so many connections with different people. Each day is different and I never stop growing and learning and I have connected with some amazing people who have taught me many valuable life experiences along the way, they are always putting on amazing events for us as well and connecting us with some awesome Merchant stories.","- Weekend work : Support roles generally work on a rotating roster to make sure we have coverage 24/7 however in saying this its pretty easy to book leave in advance and you get used to working the odd weekend, its not every week and usually we work 4 weeks on Mon-Fri and then 2 weeks with either a full weekend or one weekend day. 

I really don't have any other cons apart from the fact I miss seeing people in person, we usually have time to catchup face to face but obviously with a pandemic this hasn't been possible."

57,Shopify,"A great place to work, really!",2022-03-21,5.0,Software Developer,"It's a place full of very smart, motivated people who are imbued with a sense of mission and achievement of great things. People who collaborate and teach you every day in very subtle ways, but with great respect and understanding for the human beings on the other side of the screen.

Shopify seems to understand technology and what it needs to nurture it, make it thrive. There's no ignoring of the future, there's actually a focus on making things better and, as a developer, I'm very happy to be in a place which values good architecture, keeping tech debt at bay and solutions that scale in the longer run.

The culture they established is just great. They value diversity, inclusion, and respect the employee, trying to help you succeed and achieve your best version. They share context so you know how the work you're doing directly impacts the bottom line, while also making sure it's a meaningful thing to do.

They also have established a very effective remote working framework, which allows for flexible schedules and a nicer work-life balance.

In summary, it's the best time I've ever had in any company, I couldn't be happier about both the work I'm doing and my peers.","Being a large company, it's very easy to get lost in the sea of available information. They share a lot of context about everything that's going on there and you have to be very proactive about filtering out what's relevant and what's not.

Also, you're not going to be on top of everything, sometimes even inside your own department. If your vibe is an environment where you have more control over everything that's going on, this might not be the place for you.

And lastly, the pay is not as good as in some other big tech companies."

You make goals with your lead and they're very supportive of whatever you'd like to do. You can use your time in Support like a launch pad if you're driven.","In support your schedule is laid out and you're expected to follow it closely so if you prefer to make your own schedule this may not be the role for you. Depending on how you view dealing with tough interactions, that could be a con, but empathy goes a long way and tough interactions can turn out to be meaningful and valuable depending on how you view and approach them.

2. There's great space for progression in a variety of areas, and managers are very open about how to progress.
3. Pay is absolutely above the average for this field of work, and the benefits are great, but it would be nice to see a small increase on the base pay due to cost of living increases in Ireland","There's been a shift lately to spend longer periods purely on chats, compared to the past where there was a decent mix between calls and chats during the week.

Shopify does a great job at hiring the right people, building and expanding our culture, and making remote life more exciting than any office could ever do (had 10+ years of office experience prior).","Nothing that I can think of. The downside of remote working is the physical meet-ups. This was a nonissue prior to the pandemic, and I know after the pandemic will not be an issue either as Shopify exceeds with prioritizing these situations,"
125,Shopify,Great place to work. Job can be tough but they really support you.,2022-02-25,4.0,Support Advisor,"Great perks - expense account, health insurance, regular extra perks.
Time set aside every week for your career development and you are really encouraged to work towards moving up in the company - and it happens a lot. 
Very encouraging atmosphere, even from your team leads. Very much an emphasis on working with you to identify where you can grow and improve and developing a strategy on how to do this - rather than beating you over the head with any mistakes or failings you may have made.
Supportive teammates who help each other out.
Every day is different as you will get many queries each day that are about a topic you have never heard of.","Can be a very full on, stressful role. You can be on 3 interactions at once. 
Shopify is such a big platform that you can't learn it all and you will often not know what the customer is talking about when they contact you - good resources and support though. 
Customers can be annoyed when you cant solve their queries instantly.
Very steep learning curve when you start. Training is very intense. Lots of support for new advisors though.
As role is remote you can feel a bit isolated (lots of supports for this to be fair).
Platform is always changing and this can be difficult to keep up with."

- Interesting problems to work on and solve
- I strongly believe that Shopify is a net-positive for the planet and that my work has a positive impact on the environment and our planets future
- There is some incredible talent at Shopify which you can get exposure to if you are on the right team","- Pay. Shopify employees are paid well below average and leadership/HR make up bs reasons as to why you are actually paid fairly. Shopify has become very corporate/cultureless and should pay accordingly. Stop acting like getting to work here is compensation in itself.
- They have a work from anywhere policy which is a bold face lie. They market externally to potential hires and even internally to employees that you can work from anywhere for 90 days a year. In reality you can work from only where you have a passport lol. 
- Shopify used to have amazing unique benefits and culture that you could not get anywhere else. Amazing food for breakfast/lunch everyday, amazing social events and beautiful offices. Now you just get a one time payout for office equipment (like most other companies at this point) and thats all. 
- Shopify went all in on remote almost two years ago now, and has not figured out how to build a culture remotely. I do not have faith or confidence that Shopify is the company that will figure out how to make the best remote experience."

144,Shopify,Provides the environment for growth - if you fancy it,2022-02-23,5.0,Data Scientist,"There's a strong emphasis on taking ownership of your impact as well as your career path at Shopify, and so this can provide ample opportunity for personal and professional growth. Alongside this, the professional development budget, internal initiatives aimed at skilling folks up, and the general approachability of colleagues means that one can build up a pretty awesome skillset if they fancy it. In my own experience, I was able to contribute to areas such as people leadership, project management, and research before finding my passion in data. 

Meanwhile, as the company has pivoted to being fully remote, we're seeing a lot more consideration for folks outside the core EST time zones. Still some work to be done here, no doubt, but the improvement has been drastic.

There's a whole bunch of other points I can put here, but these two are what really make the difference for me.","That expectation to own your career journey can be a hinderance to some folk, especially if they're lacking in confidence or not sure where they want to be in the future.

Some teams are more comfortable in a remote environment than others, with some being able to build strong relationships across teammates while others may feel like strangers to each other. Shopify provides resources and training for leads in this area, but perhaps there's room to hold leads more accountable in engaging with those resources.

Our Support folks get a very different experience compared to other areas of the company, to the extent that moving out of Support is seen as a landmark achievement. More can be done to provide a more equitable experience."
145,Shopify,Cannot Fault Shopify,2022-02-23,5.0,Support Advisor,"Where do I start? The work/life balance that Shopify offers is next to none. The freedom to work wherever you want is amazing. The autonomy can take a bit of getting used to but once you do, you'll never look back. The trust that Shopify puts in it's employees gives a massive sense of belonging and appreciation. I say this literally - EVERY employee that I have met/spoken to, has been nothing but supportive and extremely friendly. The job itself has a bit of a learning curve but your team has your back 100%. Perks and benefits are beyond what I ever expected. Shopify treat their staff like gold. Unlike any company I have ever worked for, higher management are not faceless leaders in some office. They're real people who appreciate everything that you do.",The learning curve for entry level roles are steep but you are fully supported throughout.

The culture encourages open communication. Good perks.,"The expectations for this role are unreasonable. The pace is too fast as you need to be able to juggle 3 chats at a time with a quick response time. The scope is much too vast and you need to be able to solve any problem a merchant comes to you with, no matter how niche or complicated. I actually did very well in the role in terms of my performance but I was exhausted at the end of every day and was physically sick almost every day because I was so stressed. I dreaded coming into work and only lasted 3 months. My friends who stayed tell me they haven’t found the job has gotten any easier and they’re burnt out. I found this job to be dehumanizing.

- The role can be very tough, especially 3 chats simultaneously while checking resources or reaching out to teams on Slack.

- Pensions are paid for by us, using our expense account. I would rather have the company contribute to my pension than have a food allowance for homesites.

Our hours are totally flexible as long as work is completed to the high standards we set. My team has absolutely no politics or internal strife, everyone works well together, mentors each other and encourages learning. 

I have so many opportunities to learn new languages, new frameworks and am encouraged to complete self-development at every opportunity. Since the entire company went remote in 2020, it has opened up opportunities across the whole company and many different areas of development and I know I can change direction and explore another aspect of our engineering infrastructure if that's what I want to do. 

And Shopify cares (and I mean really cares) about our well being and work / life balance. There has never been any issue if I need some sick time, or personal time for whatever reason. They support everything I need to do family-wise, the flexible working hours make managing a career and family very easy and their health cover is great. 

I also know I can advance my career with this company, I can clearly see how to achieve this and what I need to do to get to where I want to go. Shopify provides a framework for everything need to accomplish and reach the different roles in the company and it's a meritocracy, promotion doesn't just depend on how long you have been here, but the impact you make in your role.","I honestly don't have any cons to add here. I'm in my 40s and so have had numerous jobs, have travelled, have spent time in academia and ran my own business for a decade. I can honestly say that I never worked anywhere remotely as good as we have it here in Shopify. I think perhaps I could attain a higher salary as a developer in some other software companies in Ireland, however I don't believe for a second that I would have the same quality of life as Shopify has provided me with. That reason alone means I will be with them for the very, very long term."

172,Shopify,Mobility done right,2022-02-11,5.0,Theme Support,"To say I am satisfied with working here is an understatement, and there would be many reasons to list, but I'll just mentions 2.

Mobility - Working from Home: I have moved 3 times in the past 3 years, and I will almost certainly be moving again this year. Every time, the only question I have had to ask myself with regards to my job was ""Did I get the Internet set up at the new place?""
But I suppose any company offering a WFH set up does that, right? To some extent, sure, however I would say that because everyone works remotely, the amount of effort that goes into planning for employees to be at their best (from hardware set up to virtual experiences) is incredible.

Mobility - Job progression: In 3 years at Shopify so far, I have had 3 different jobs, each with its load of new experiences and challenges. The variety of roles available and the possibilities for professional growth is truly amazing; too much choice really is my only issue.","The main con I could see to this set up is that there are limited in person interactions, so if you prefer or need to be able to leave home and physically meet with the people you work with, it might be tough or require an adjustment period.
In the past we did have punctual get together and hopefully these will come back soon, but they will never be a 2-days-a-week in the office kind of thing."

182,Shopify,Shopify only values some employees,2022-02-09,2.0,Technical Support Specialist,"Depending on your job position, Shopify can be a great place to work. If you're a developer, marketer, or work with anything except for support, then you will be treated well here. Of course that's not guaranteed since you can always get a toxic manager.","If you work in support then Shopify is not a company that will invest in you. It's not uncommon for companies to treat their support teams as second-class-workers, and Shopify is no different.

To give an example Shopify decided to give ""all"" workers a few of weeks off over the holidays. Very nice of them! Management sent out a company wide email informing everyone of this... Then we find out that support is not included in this. This is of course is understandable because customers still needs help over the holidays. However at most other companies the support team would be allowed to take those days in a more spread out fashion. 

If you're not white there is unfortunately a risk you will face discrimination at Shopify. Depending on your team you might be in for a rough time anyways. Several people have had their self confidence destroyed and are in therapy because of how they have been treated at this company."

189,Shopify,"Amazing company and culture, only con is the salary",2022-02-09,4.0,Product Support Network Specialist,"I joined Shopify over 2.5 years ago, and I can honestly say this is the most amazing company I have worked for to date. Before Shopify, I could never have seen myself committing long term to one company, and yet here I am seeing myself here for the long run. The mission, the culture, the people are all things that I am proud to be a part of, and I have not yet met a single toxic person. You will be surrounded by smart and ambitious yet extremely laid back and friendly folks. Working remote full time, 4 day work weeks during the summers, the option to work for 90 days in any country of your choice, the lifestyle spending account which offers a great amount of coverage for personal expenses, excellent swag, flexible vacation time are all amazing perks you get out of the box, too. The leadership inspires confidence, and you can really feel the passion. The priority here is not to make money or increase revenue - it's to provide the best product to merchants and in particular small businesses, to empower them to take control of their lives and be successful entrepreneurs. Revenue comes second as a result of our focus to provide a world class product, and I love that this is the mindset. I would highly recommend Shopify if you are looking for fulfilment, an amazing mission that is already changing the world, and amazing colleagues that are also going to become great friends.","The salary, and this is the main reason I didn't give a 5* review. In my experience and for Ireland specifically, the pay falls quite short of what competitors offer, so if you are living in an expensive capital such as Dublin, this may be somewhat offputting. Alternatively, if you are motivated financially then Shopify may not meet your needs despite the benefits I mentioned in the pros section. The same can be said in terms of stock options - there is no stock increase offered after a change in role or as your tenure increases, at least from what I have seen thus far.

Another potential con would be the challenges in terms of career opportunities. It can be tricky to move roles internally unless you network and connect with folks beforehand, and even then, there is often a lot of competition. It feels like there could be more focus on career growth or job opportunities."

2. Growth Opportunities - You can go in any career direction and the company would love to give you more opportunities.

3. Benefits and healthcare 

4. Company's Mission - They don't only just say 'make eCommerce better for everyone', they actually make a difference and you would see the impact.","Lack of support in terms of Visa Sponsorship, so if you are looking to get a work permit, I would say look for another company. 

The reason for this is because people who are in similar roles in another company can apply and get a work permit but not much help from the company on this.

This may change in the future so please discuss it with HR even if you are applying."
193,Shopify,"Tough work, but rewarding work!",2022-02-09,4.0,Workforce Planning Specialist,"TLDR; I have worked for other companies in the tech sector. Shopify beats them all hands down and has become my fave company in my career so far. That being said - it's not perfect.

*The biggest Pro I can think of is that the career prospects are there for anyone willing to put their head down as an advisor.
* The Support Advisor role is tough - and no one will say anything different. Any TL's or escalated support teams that spent time as an advisor have empathy for the role you are doing - there can be a community vibe,
* There are a lot of aspects to Shopify - from technical aspects of the product to regulatory aspects. This means there are spaces to really thrive and become a champion (and use your Professional Development time (2 hours per week) to grow and develop those skills to allow you to move out of Frontline support.
* If Frontline Support is your jam anyway - the Salary, remote working, stock options and Expense balance (€3500) to use to reimbursed purchases from furniture to tech make this role competitive in the market
* Fortnightly Pay","*You'll see this con appear a lot - but managing 3 chats at one time is rough - once you find your rhythm it's less rough, but still a challenge.
* Some TL's should not have got into the role - or were grand when they started but have become complacent
* Towards the end of last year a reshuffling of senior management has caused a divide between Ireland and Shopify at large"

- Shopify is a wealthy brand name company, and it shows. There are all sorts of perks, even with wfh
- If you like working remotely, you will be a fit","I worked at Shopify for over two years, beginning before the lockdown and for well over a year into it. The difference between before the company closed its offices and afterward was night and day. 

The working experience at Shopify underwent a fundamental change for the worse, all at the hands of one decision: to work remotely forever. The collaborative, upbeat, and social atmosphere that formed the core of Shopify's work experience was completely obliterated. Other reviews have mentioned Shopify's low compensation and higher stress relative to other companies. Those discrepancies were acceptable with world class offices/perks, excellent social events, and a wonderfully cooperative atmosphere where you got to sit next to other intelligent, ambitious people everyday. 

With digital by default, all of those positive aspects were taken away, while the problems remained and became much more visible. The experience became no different from any other high flying tech company, only for (significantly) less pay, literally zero physical interaction with your coworkers, and a stifling, passive aggressive culture where key issues are quickly shut down on internal channels.

I haven't seen any other company handle COVID the way Shopify did. Shopify employees have to work remotely forever, from a decision that was made without ever consulting them, and to which they never consented to. That speaks volumes. 

If you're a current Shopify employee who has been there for a year, reflect on why you're still there. Research salaries at other tech companies. You'll be shocked at how many of them will not only pay you more, but have an office to boot."

You're only given 30 mins for lunch which is ridiculous for a high stress job. 
They say they're all for change but that's not applicable to the employees. It was initially advertised as a remote working company and while that's true you cannot pick and choose where you want to go to. So if you're working from Ireland you can only work with them from Ireland. You can't move abroad. 

Their approach to a lot of things could be so much better. 
They're more of a one size fits all kinda company which isn't realistic. More consideration and nurturing of the current employees needs can help towards the success of the company and wellbeing of everyone."

Strong focus on wellbeing - There is support both internally and externally for wellbeing. It's not just lip service and I'm yet to encounter anyone in management who doesn't encourage healthy working practises.

Innovative industry - It doesn't get boring. New features and functionality is rolled out constantly and people are given the space to learn new skills that might not relate exactly to their position, but future positions too.","No transparency on salary.

Support is treated very differently to the rest of the company despite making up a sizeable portion of Shopify's workforce.

As a result, the training period is really too short to absorb the volume of information crammed into the four weeks. Shopify prides itself on work-life balance, but it certainly does not give that impression during the training. You are essentially told to get all the modules done, so you rush through them and retain very little. You start the job itself totally unprepared for it and feeling overwhelmed by the diversity of issues raised by the businesses that contact you and how hard it can be at times to find the answers for it. Adding to that, you are essentially tied to your desk most of the day and you have to let your lead know if you are taking a short break (and by short, I mean 5-10 minutes max a couple of times a day, apart from the short 30 minute lunch). The work was stressful, there was a lot of pressure and at times very little help from the lead, especially during the training where we were told on a regular basis to figure it out on our own and show initiative."

The platform is the industry leader for eCommerce and growing exponentially. Having Shopify on your resume will open doors and provide you instant ecom cred. Lots of opportunity to learn and level up your knowledge base. Depending on your team, region and manager, you could have a lot of autonomy.","This is an intense role with a lot of ambiguity and a huge scope. Expect to work more than 40 hours a week and constant change, you’re never finished, there’s always more to do. Management spews a lot of rhetoric around wellness and work/life balance but at the end of the day it’s just talk. If you’re not performing , expect to be scrutinized. Most measurements of success in this role are subjective, and as a company Shopify is very much one where who you know matters. Pay is below standard for a company of this size and a role this intense. There are huge discrepancies in pay between employees preforming the same role at the same level, depending on if they were hired externally or internally, when and where. All external communications are recorded and reviewed, so be careful what you say. Recently the role has shifted to be much more “salesy” with product adoption and upselling becoming the top objectives internally. With the recent explosion of growth Shopify is acting more and more like it’s competitors who it tries to differentiate from than as the disrupter and highly ethical company it was a few years ago."

289,Shopify,Really exceptional place to work,2021-11-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I moved to Canada to join Shopify roughly 5 years ago and I'm very glad I did.

So far, I've managed about a dozen talented people and I've reported to two very thoughtful and supportive managers. I've also found the opportunities to grow, both in terms of personally and my career, are abundant and easy to come by *if* you're proactive. Compensation is very competitive, too.

The work itself will obviously depend on your role—I work in marketing and find it challenging and interesting. Shopify benefits from the fact that its primary customer base, up-and-coming entrepreneurs, are a great audience to work with; they're easy to appreciate and the fact that our work helps them have a better chance at independence means something to me. This might not be so important for other people, but it is to me.

I suppose at a 10k+ person company part of your experience is determined by the smaller teams you end up on. So, take the praise as a general assessment of Shopify but specifically to the Growth Org because that's the only department I've worked in. Best growth team on the planet!

My two managers have been great, too. I work hard but I have never been asked to show face or work on something outside of normal working hours—ever.

Department leadership is good, too. There's a very transparent culture and our leads do a great job of communicating what the strategy is and what our priorities are.","""Cons"" should probably be specific to the company, but all I can think of are things I'd expect to see at any company that is experiencing rapid growth.

E.g., there are lots of small re-orgs (annoying, but necessary), things change frequently, tentpole moments like Black Friday can result in busy weeks, too many meetings. And lots of planning and internal communication is required to be successful here (less so at a small company).

Back in 2020, I think some of the senior leaders were starting to realize that the company growth had outpaced them a bit. E.g., there were some"
290,Shopify,"Good benefits, mediocre culture, poor compensation",2021-11-28,3.0,Retail Technical Merchant Support,"Shopify is a great company to get your feet wet in the tech industry, and to build some practical knowledge to use in your career. The benefits package is unmatched, from stock options to spending accounts. You're given a lot of room to grow as a person, and ample opportunity to develop your own skills. The culture between teams is also good, for the most part.","Advancement in Shopify is abysmal, as is the compensation. Shopify operates internally as if it is two different companies, one side being Support, and then the rest of the company on another. Support is often excluded from the rest of the company, and the benefits package is significantly less enticing. Shopify advertises a fair wage, but you will find that this isn't the case. Colleagues in support make far from industry standard with no real room for compensation adjustments, and other teams make varied wages, with external hires making significantly more than internal hires.

There's very little opportunity to grow, and significant favouritism with internal hiring. Managers often have little to no leadership experience, and move quickly, requiring you to play the ""who you know"" game to move around internally. As the company grows, the internal culture and equality among employees is diminishing quickly."

Onboarding was hard. My lead told me that it’d be overwhelming and yeah it was. Everyone was patient and supportive but it was still tough. But now feeling like that’s behind me and I’m feeling very comfortable now (takes 4-6 months or so I think)"

Work from home

Good salary & excellent scheme where you could get % money off any health & wellness (like fitness classes/yoga mats/sports equipment/art books, etc)","Working on 3 chats meant your eyes did not leave the computer screen for at least 2.5 hours (sometimes more) - how on earth is this good for health & safety?
I ended up developing a painful neck & shoulder injury from the stress of holding my body in a rigid position during the chats - had to go to a physio for a full 12 months to sort it out. 
Was the most stressful job I’ve ever had.
I tried to get into another department whilst working there but it seems you have to be there years before that’s possible.
If I could have progressed from the Guru role, I probably would have stayed longer as salary & benefits were so good.

After 6 months there, you are expected to deal with the Plus customers (customers who have a yearly turnover of $1 million) - talk about pressure!"

383,Shopify,Amazing company to work for,2021-09-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Really supportive culture and truly a great team to work for, in my opinion",None that I can think of so far
384,Shopify,Grow your tech skills but don't stay long,2021-09-22,3.0,Software Developer Manager,"- There are so many technical problems to solve that you will always be able to tackle something interesting
- Shopify is mostly full of really great supportive people. You will very easily find people that will be your friends for life and while it is hard to find a good job, it is harder to find a good team. I think in Shopify, this is more common.
- Shopify does have lots of room to learn and grow as a developer (unless you’re a FED)","To work at Shopify, you have to be okay with the fact that part of your paycheck will come from gun paraphernalia and far-right propaganda merchandise shops who use that money to fuel their ambitions, all while at the same time having leadership give 1-hour conference talks about how commerce and Shopify are morally good and that Shopify is good for society. Which I am sure for a lot of people is fine, and may start off fine as well, but it can also get very tiring over time as you see one thing and then leadership tells you another. Here are some of my main feelings about this company.

- It is always very obvious when leadership decides to not address something that they don’t like, which they often do, and often about very important things like compensation or attrition. Usually, they will not be able to answer questions and dodge them, and then suddenly every single person in leadership suddenly has the exact same answer about how this new change that you think is negative, is actually positive. Compensation is actually the best in the industry (when it proveably is not)
- Backward promotion. I suppose these are common but still a criticism. To get promotions or raise, you will have had to do the job for a year or more already. This is a good way to underpay high-performing people. 
- Work-life balance is not real. especially if you are a manager. Directors and senior staff will message at any time of day. They will say that balance is important and they spent all of “Mental Health Month” talking about this but then go on to push harder deadlines for Unite, an annual conference hosted by Shopify. They say the R&R days (4 day work week) should not make your work more but the deadlines stay the same.
- Constantly shifting organization structure and constant release of new useless terminology. Often getting the sense that leadership uses this as an excuse to explain what work that they are doing. Sometimes their announcements of reorgs or new words to describe the work we already do, have a feeling of being made up on the spot and always end on a note of work in progress. This adds to the feeling of instability because they want us to use what they have come up with on a day-to-day basis but it could change at any moment. It also always make you feel as much f you are a pawn or resource to be moved around without regard to building community and relationships. (Which causes managers to use this as a reason to not promote or give raises)
- Pretending to be open when in fact at AMAs, the hardest questions are skipped over to the extent that they have made a team build tools to filter out questions that are too hard and report employees to HR if they asked questions that leadership doesn’t like or seems too critical. The same team built tools into slack, to direct report any employee to HR which almost immediately killed all slack discussions that were in any way critical of the company, even good-faith criticism. 
- Leadership lacks accountability and refuses to listen to feedback. Usually, when asked for accountability, they will say something along the lines that the conversation has become unproductive and wasting company time. This will often just result in slack channels being changed to read-only, forcing the conversation into other channels.
- When I joined the company, they marked themselves as a hacker culture. Everything was hackable, including the company itself. So often we had discussions about what the company could do better and how it could be better. Currently, Shopify has a culture of constantly telling its employees that if you don’t like what the company does, then you should leave. This position was used for remote working as well. They are hostile and gaslighting to employees who have dissenting opinions or criticism. 
- Most of the good culture that Shopify still retains is from the people they have hired in the past and good lower-level managers having great connections with their small teams. The company as a whole is seemingly doing nothing to support everyone other than half-assed mental health statements and talking about a future where they will fly the whole company to central points once a year. This is odd because in the same breath they will mention how environmentally conscious they are.
- Criticisms of the company are cast as direct attacks on C-levels, who are surrounded by cult-like people who think they can do no wrong. Echo chamber at the top to the extent that it seems obvious that there is a house clearing of any dissenting directors or C-levels.
- C-level execs are highly involved but are not highly informed. They will often say incorrect things, very confidently.
- Leadership has a poor opinion of UX and front-end, as displayed in the past by CEO comments on Twitter and the fact that the UX role was eliminated from Shopify. It has taken years of advocacy to get front-end developers paid nearly the same amount as backends. Leadership will often go on tirades about how no one should write javascript at all, even though javascript powers a lot of what the company does now.
- Work is not appreciated across teams, highly competitive and if the team did not create it, they will just create their own and try to destroy the other.
- Very strong not-built-here mentality where Shopify tends to rebuild things that already have solutions.
- I would feel bad for Tobi if he was not often rudely opinionated and surrounded by people who will protect him at any time. I get that he has a hard position where he is expected to run a company but still looks like (or still wants to be) highly connected to the technical aspects of dev however it is clear that he cannot. And that is completely fine. However, when he reads an article or tries something out in his spare time, he tries to push people to use things in order to feel relevant but it is clear that he has not used the technology in a sustained way. If he only brought items up as a suggestion of something he is interested in rather than something he is telling technical team that they should already be using, these would be taken a lot better, however, because of the way he approaches items like this, he wastes massive amounts of time as teams are constantly consumed with building up a case to tell him in a fully data-driven way an answer they could have just told him at the start. I mean, there has been enough coverage of Tobi tornadoes, I don’t need to re-hash.
- Managers have very little feedback loop. There is no way in Shopify to evaluate a bad manager who is causing their employees to have a bad experience. It is common for ICs to talk about who is a good lead and who is not because the only hope is to avoid the bad ones. Managers are mostly evaluated by the work their team produces and their ability to explain those things in meetings. So when managers are deliberately not promoting or doing terrible things like punitive PIPs, there is no hope for those ICs except to change teams.
- Hiring has no feedback loop. There are many people who participate in interviews that are very pretentious and biased but there is no way to tell how well interviewers are performing. We hire with committees so everyone needs to come to an agreement to combat bias but if the whole committee is full of bad interviewers then it is doing nothing for bias. I was trained years ago, which was reading a few documents and shadowing two interviews, and then nothing ever since.
- Shopify hires with a pretty strong requirement of using TDD however in practice, I would say a small minority of the people at Shopify actually practice true TDD, which just seems hypocritical.
- New hires often get paid more that tenured staff, with very reserved raises. Which is fine if you were just hired, that will only sting a few years in.
- Promotions are really a popularity contest. The loudest, most visible people get promoted the most, the quiet but highly productive people rarely get recognition."

392,Shopify,Fantastic company,2021-09-19,5.0,Software Developer,"WLF is great,
Impactful projects,
100% remote, so more free time every day
Amazing perks",Not everyone loves working from home
393,Shopify,Company has changed since going fully remote,2021-09-19,3.0,Senior Software Developer,"- Lot of talented people
- Huge infrastructure
- Expectations and workload are reasonable","- Pays less than most big US companies for the same type of work
- Culture has largely vanished with the turn to remote-only forever
- Lots of big talent and C level execs have left after the switch to remote-only
- Management comms are frustrating and un-transparent
- Decent amount of beurocracy to get things done"
394,Shopify,The good and the ugly,2021-09-18,3.0,Data Scientist,"- WLB is pretty decent.
- Culture is still positive, not as good as before.
- Blue ocean, not many competitors out there.
- Problem space has lots of potential.
- Quite bottom-up, but data can be a bit irrelevant sometimes.
- Lots of very pleasant colleagues to work with.
- WFH flexibility.
- Decent perks such as coach, WFH supports, etc.
- Reasonably easy to hop teams and learn a wide range of topics.","- Below industry compensation. Still trying to sell a culture that is going to be no longer there.
- Culture is changing with the adoption of remote work, 6-weeks cycles and the increasing hires from the silicon valley. 
- Reluctance to give existing employees raise or promotion. Limited career growth. 
- Inconsistent and vague performance assessment and expectations.
- Some unqualified managers. They could use much better training. Some of them lack empathy, skill and responsibility.
- Lots of gas-lighting.
- Not a data-driven company, for most of the product teams data sits at the back seat.
- Data tech stack is both immature and outdated at the same time.
- Diversity on top is still lacking."

396,Shopify,Wonderful company,2021-09-18,5.0,Support Advisor,"-Pay is great for a job right out of school! 42,500/year
-Benefits are great! 
-Lifestyle spending account
-They send you all the equipment you need! (laptop, mouse, monitor, keyboard, etc)
-4-5 weeks of paid training. 
-They truly care about their employees and their customers/merchants","-talking with merchants on the phone can be very stressful. Especially when they ask you for business advice and they expect an answer right away, but their question involves you to do some research. It is easier to offer business advice in an email because then I have time to research and form a proper answer for the merchant."
397,Shopify,Stressful,2021-09-18,2.0,Support Advisor,Salary is fair. Benefits are amazing. Work from Home role.,"I'm here about 4 months in the Support Advisor role. I am one of the most senior on my team and get called upon to mentor the newbies. The company is growing rapidly in Ireland and most advisors are moving up to specialised teams quickly. That is a positive for those who move on but for those of us starting out there is very little help in this crazy job. You have to provide support on shipping, billing, taxes, apps, Facebook, Instagram, the Shop app, retail POS hardware, tech issues, SEO, theme issues, design and deliver 'merchant growth' i.e upselling in all those interactions. It's an insane workload and the training is subpar. We had a very large training group lead by a lovely trainer who had the right manner but was totally let down by the curriculum. We spent most of our time reading course after course on feature after feature. One short course on domains and we were supposed to go on live channels and troubleshoot domain issues, same for international sales taxes, Shopify Capital offerings, Facebook integration....Impossible. On weeks 4 and 5 we were introduced to mentors but it was different guys every session, some excellent, some terrible. We were thrown on 3 chats without enough practice and with little support from the mentor, at the end of that session, one member of my group almost walked, and another collected 2 'frownies' from dissatisfied merchants. Talk about demotivating someone! I cannot even blame the merchants, imagine wanting to get help with analytics, domain transfers or customising your site and getting a newbie who is still in training! Even worse when we were put on phones. Only 2 members of my group got a call, another frownie was picked up there and the rest of us were put onto teams with no call training and scheduled for call shifts on week 1.

My own first solo session on live chats was scheduled for 8am when most of my team were not yet in, and with an average tenure on the team of about 4 months not sure they'd have been any use! Stress isn't the word and so it goes 4 months in. 

Every day I get queries I haven't a clue about. Queries that require specialised training to be able to answer the merchant. We are told to google, navigate help cards and fake it till you make it. We can ask the specialised support teams but each of them has iron clad rules about what we can ask and heaven help you if you ask and they think you should have just googled. Head. Bitten. Off. 

Team leads are nice people, but mine and many others were promoted to leadership after a few months with no management experience. They are pleasant and we get to have 2x monthly hour long team meetings where Shopify gives us some money to buy food, merch etc for the team. But there's just no support. If you say you are totally frazzled, feel undertrained and ill-prepared to give merchants the support they deserve you are sent a flowery article on imposter syndrome and told to....google better when you get a question.

So, 4 months in, and I love WFH, I'm happy with the salary and the benefits are amazing. This job could be a dream job, I'd love to stay here in rural Ireland working at home without the commute but I'm already at the end of my rope. Have lost 10 pounds, have pounding headaches by the end of the day, and am sick to my stomach when dealing with phone calls from merchants who want advice on analytics and coding and Italian couriers and Swedish taxes and credit card chargebacks and policy documents. Not to mention the ones who want me to guide them through setting up collections and importing from Oberlo and sorting their variants live on the call and get snappy when I'm slow as someone poorly trained and new to the job would be.

Like all call center jobs you also have rude, rude people who yell at you over things you have no control over like credit card transaction fees and delayed mail. Others come in with an attitude, won't do anything you say, and give you a 'frownie' 2 mins after you send them a long email with possible solutions which they clearly did not read or try to implement. 

I will probably be gone before Christmas, I'm hanging on to reach my goal of paying off my car loan. I'll miss my lovely coworkers, the benefits, no commute!, and the very cool swag boxes that Shopify sends out. But my body can't hold up under the constant stress much longer. 

Shopify really needs to consider having specialised teams instead of jack of all trades advisers FKA gurus. At the very least revamp the training. As I type a new bunch of advisors are landing in their teams, I have had them shadowing me this week and they are stunned, scared, stressed, and feel totally unprepared."

* Excellent level of transparency and autonomy for a company of this size
* Invested in using updated tools and technologies - for example, teams dedicated to improving developer tooling and teams on payroll to contribute to open source systems that are important to the company
* Company is trying really hard to address diversity, but systemic issues remain (though this is tech-wide)
* Unlimited vacation with a ""minimum"" of 3 weeks, which is well-enforced but can vary on a team by team basis
* Very hard to get bored as it is easy to move teams if you're looking for a new problem or even learning a different stack
* Technical leadership chain who are actually useful and helpful and can offer useful feedback in reviews","* No RRSP matching or stock purchase plan; stock refreshes are very small
* Most eng teams have on-call, expect some off-hours work
* Psychological safety can vary wildly across teams - but Shopify's defaults are very good (Shopify wide its a blameless culture, but pockets of teams can vary)
* Pay for impact company; which is great, but also means that experience is not valued. Middle management are constantly re-learning ""obvious"" things or things that would be expected of a lead (for example, managing individuals; since it is pay for impact company, and impact on individuals can be hard to measure, you often get promoted w/o actual leadership experience).
* Work-life balance will vary; hero culture is prevalent, especially for folks looking to move ""up"" the ladder quickly. (again, very low value on diversity of experience and too high of a value on impact) - the how doesn't matter, only the what does"
400,Shopify,Awesome culture,2021-09-17,5.0,Software Developer,"It's unbelievably easy to talk to and ask for help from another team in this remote working environment. I think that's because Shopify hires people with great communication skills and not-jerk personalities with the special interviews that are not just technical questions. 
Really appreciate the small and big teams' effort to make remote work collaboration easier and better.",I have to say the pay is not around the top level but it's a trade-off I guess.

* Your colleagues tend to care deeply about your customers. Most people are deeply engaged with the vision of what we're trying to solve.

* High emphasis on personal growth and bettering yourself every year.

* Amazing work life balance. Most of the time, the team clocks out at 5pm their time, and overtime is rare. A global workforce makes having on-call only inside your own timezone easier.","* Roadmaps shift rapidly. If your project isn't a huge hit, it's hard to get the engagement to run it for more than year. There's been quite a few times where good ideas have to be experimented on by different teams for a few years before they finally get it right. 

* The promotion process can be stressful. If your manager doesn't get highly involved with the promotion, it can be difficult to get it through. There's a interesting split"

420,Shopify,Shopify really invests in their employees,2021-09-15,5.0,Senior Development Manager,"There is a big culture of learning and self-development at Shopify. Everyone is encouraged to learn new skills and technologies and there is a whole area of the company dedicated to coaching - want to get better at leading people? There's a coach for that. 

When I started I didn't know Ruby, Rails, React, or really any of the primary technologies that Shopify uses. I was a little worried about this. But my first four weeks were dedicated to learning everything I needed to know - free courses, etc. Moreover, the assumption was that it would take me a while to get up to speed. Probably the best onboarding that I've experienced in my nearly 20 yr career.

As someone who would classify themselves as a life-long-learner, Shopify is an amazing employer.","Things change pretty quickly here. If you like predictable, Shopify may not be for you."

They would rather let long-term employees leave, and turn around and hire people with less experience and context for more money than keeping their tenured employees would cost.

Lots of gas lighting from senior leadership in regards to our benefits/compensation. They state ""culture"" as being a main factor making up for our below average pay with one VP even citing not being called during the delivery of his child as a reason why our culture is so good.

If you want to work hard, go to another company that will pay you accordingly. Shopify is a great place to coast with friendly people, but they will not pay you what you are worth ESPECIALLY once you are here."

The company itself is a stable, but the problems we're trying to solve can arise quickly - like the weather. ""Thriving on change"" is considered healthy here - but if you're looking for ""years of stability doing the same job over and over"", that may be a challenge for you.

- Work on problems with massive scale
- Great developer-centric culture around learning and experimentation
- Plenty of opportunities to explore other career paths
- Being full-time remote allows those who are parents the flexibility to manage life in a far more manageable way.

THE biggest perk is the STRONG emphasis on work/life balance. Those who wish to work longer can, but it's almost discouraged to keep people fresh.

Also there's an expectation that you're spending some time to learn the how/why of what you're doing, not just cranking out code for the sake of finishing tasks.","- No offices due to COVID

I’ve been on 4 different teams in 3 years which meant new leads as well. It’s always tough to start with a new lead since you have to re-build relationships that would them help with career growth. The team changes have always been valid and logical.. but it still happens. Shopify is not scared to shift priorities or change project focus if there’s clear signals to do so.

Internal support systems are pretty poor - google is the main tool you use to find “resources” because internal documentation is poorly managed
Career pathing has been poorly done which usually results in individuals being “stuck” in the support function which pays a fraction of the salary that is made in other departments.
Poor work life balance - frequently required to start early and stay late. Didn’t have a single holiday off during my time working there. On day one of training I was told that they expected us to work outside of scheduled hours by our trainer. 
Managers use lots of jargon and trendy business terms but aren’t great at coaching, developing employees or refining workflows.
If you have any issues, you’re told to suck it up or get out of the company as you can be easily replaced.
You’re definitely a number and can be very isolated despite all the look-aide they attempt to pump into you.

The work we do feels meaningful and the people there are great!",Changes occur all the time at Shopify. We have to thrive on change and if we need stability in every aspects of our lives then it won't be a good spot to work at.

464,Shopify,This truly is a mission driven company.,2021-08-14,5.0,Software Engineer,"I would say that the best part about working at Shopify is its unwavering commitment to its mission of making commerce better for everyone. It really is satisfying working somewhere that you know has a net positive impact as opposed to finding new ways to barrage users with an endless stream of advertisements or other brain rotting content.

From a technical standpoint there are endless opportunities to learn and advance. If you are interested in growing as a Web Developer it is certainly one of the best places in the world and currently retains the best Rails developers in the world.","Recently Shopify has committed to moving fully remote for all roles in the company. For the most part I am really enjoying it, but we used to have absolutely killer benefits when working from the office (catered lunch, amazing office space, high quality coffee, beer, in-office presentations) which are all gone. In addition to the obvious material loss I feel that the culture has taken a hit since these benefits encouraged getting to know your co-workers and socialise. I was hoping that they would replace these benefits with something else, but it has been over a year now and nothing material has been forthcoming so I am not holding out hope."

Shopify stocks","The managers are in general very young (below 30 yrs old) and inexperienced. They show clear favoritism based on if you like the same things. 

Reorg happens every few months and your team members disappear suddenly (fired) on a regular basis.

Very chaotic and things keep changing and they are so proud of this being part of the culture 'thriving on change'. It's okay that many companies are operating this way, but the rate of change at Shopify makes it very hard to keep up with the current state of things, the current way to do things, the metaphor of the month, etc. There's almost an expectation for you to spend time outside of working keeping up with this - listening to podcasts, watching talks, reading books. Culture is set by those who live and breathe Shopify, whose sense of work-life balance takes a back seat to their investment in the company.

External hires are paid way higher than current employees. The managers and HRs refused to admit. When turnover is obviously so high and we had to spend so much time interviewing new people and HRs keep saying it's normal."
469,Shopify,Phenonemal!,2021-08-09,5.0,Operations,Everything about this company is amazing.

- Thorough training program (3 weeks of training before before you start ""working"")
- They send you all the tech needed (very nice monitor) to do the job
- Opportunities to move to different areas within the 'Support' department if you're willing to wait long enough
- Helpful and supportive managers","They don't tell you when you sign your first contract that the Junior Support Advisor program has 3 different contracts - all of which are 3 months. After three contracts you may have the chance to become a full-time Support Advisor. There is no pay increase within the three contracts. The pay is very low for the amount of work you do.

If you're interested in working for a cool tech company, this is a great role to get your foot in the door. Keep in mind that it will most likely take months to move up, and get out of ""JSA land""."

Good pay 
Good benefits
Fridays off in the summer (Only a pro if you're in a non-merchant facing role however)","Leaving my successful career to join Shopify has become my biggest regret. I feel scammed and trapped. All the linkedin marketing about culture is a lie. I was grossly mislead. They don't tell you that every merchant-facing job is just glorified customer support, where you have to deal with 40+ merchants who have been lied too during the sales process. You are thrown into the thick of it with little to no training. I have been yelled at and abused my my merchants for things out of my control. 

You are expected to work 24/7, even if they don't explicitly say that. The work keeps piling up and there's no hope for relief. Shopify gave all of it's employees friday's off, but what they don't tell you is that you will end up working those days anyways due to the influx of merchant requests.

The job is way too ambiguous, and you end up just acting like customer support. Nobody I know signed up to be customer support but we were all lied too. We were never told that we'd have to answer complex theme questions or help troubleshoot API's. Most people joining this role think they're becoming a Customer Success Manager, not a support person. 

Every night i go to sleep afraid to wake up and to go to work. Working at Shopify has made me feel like a prisoner in my own home. It sounds overdramatic, but I sit in fear of the next email that will come into my inbox. Working here has been the most stressed that i've ever been in my life. I never get to eat my lunch because it's just work work work. There's no work/life balance. Your work IS your life now. I can't leave my house without bringing my work laptop with me, even during a trip to the cottage. My friends and family have been worried about me since i've been working so late every night. 

 There is definitely a popular clique(cult) at Shopify, and if you're not in it, there will be no career progression for you. Also there are very unfair differences and division of work between teams, ie some teams have never used their email before, never talk to merchants but somehow get to have game nights and pizza parties while getting paid more. 

Do not believe the hype that you see on linkedin, the culture sucks. most people are overworked. You will develop severe anxiety and depression. The pay is good but it is not worth being a punching bag for merchants."

- Unlimited PTO isn't just lip service. I'm going to end up taking ~5 weeks this year and that's not including Holiday's or summer Friday's (we've been given all summer Friday's off...it's great)

- Remote first. No plans to return to an office (this can definitely be a Con for some people)

- Business is booming. I don't worry about getting laid off. My role continues to grow as the company grows.","- We probably aren't paying top of market in the US. I can almost certainly get paid more working at a FAANG. I believe we're revising comp right now, but I don't have particularly high expectations. Pay certainly isn't terrible, but there's room for improvement.

- Senior leadership can sometimes come across as callous when addressing employee concerns. I get it to some degree (people complaining about work from home still when we've known about it for over a year, for example), but I think they could strike a softer tone sometimes. 

- There's a handful of people who have been promoted into positions that they simply aren't equipped for anymore. We've scaled quickly and hired a ton of great people in the process. As a result, you sometimes have really strong teams led by really weak Managers. This has definitely contributed to some (not all) of the attrition we're seeing"

502,Shopify,Losing talent and engagement over management decisions,2021-07-07,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Shopify really embodies the ""career jungle gym"" idea (probably less so for Support). If you're having good impact there are ample opportunities to switch teams, roles, or pick up an additional responsibility that will grow you.

It's a pressure cooker at times, but you'll get through it and feel great about what you accomplished. People are generally nice and supportive. Perks like being able to expense books are great.

Working here could be good for you. Just be informed when deciding that and don't believe all the hype.","Shopify can be chaotic at the best of times - many companies are, but the rate of change makes it very hard to keep up with the current state of things, the current way to do things, the metaphor of the month, etc. There's almost an expectation for you to spend time outside of working keeping up with this - listening to podcasts, watching talks, reading books. 

Culture is set by those who live and breathe Shopify, whose sense of work-life balance takes a back seat to their investment in the company. Execs are these people, and have a hard time relating when others aren't so invested, or don't share their sometimes alien world view. There is definitely an ""old guard"" (strongly-held views) vs. ""new guard"" (don't feel as strongly) dynamic to things.

You've got to solve for how much energy to put into meeting various expectations - and you likely won't meet them all without stretching yourself thin. As long as you're aligned with your manager on what counts you're good. It's very easy to find faults if they want to give you a negative review. Unrealistic standards can be used against you if you're not liked by your manager.

I'm not happy that Shopify betrayed Black employees."

Recruiters and hiring managers make lots of promises that you'll be able to grow quickly, but those are all lies. The reality is that it is practically impossible to get promoted to L8 (sr dev manager) or higher.

In an engineering team of thousands, only 3-4 people in the history of the company have ever managed to become Directors. Every single one of them was one of the ""OG"" (pre-IPO) people. If you joined later and not friends with the CEO or VPs, just forget about getting promoted."

The only real pro is you are given a $5k benefit budget where you can expense anything you want and the company will pay for it. This $5k does not come off your salary however it is taxable.,"If you are disabled in any sense (physical or mental) you will be terminated. They do not care about their employees at all. But that isn't the worst of it, the worst of it is they will lie to your face bolstering that they will provide all kinds of accommodations for any kind of disability. When in reality they won't even give you extended leave with a doctor's note. I have officially diagnosed ADHD and when I brought this up I was met with promises of understanding, that if I had a depressive episode I would be given the time I need to recover. When a depressive episode inevitably came and I was requesting more time off than normal with a signed letter from my psychiatrist, I was terminated within a month."

The issue is not the pay gap that exists, but the core issue is that HR and leadership continues to deny that this issue even exists. Every recruiter and internal hire knows this."

- Good to see the beginnings of a mass exodus of tenured employees finally getting the courage to move onto other (and inevitibly better paid) roles at other companies, because the compensation is not good compared to competitors now
- Total complacency from middle management, so great opportunity in those roles if you want to spend time avoiding doing any work and pretending to listen to overworked and struggling employees","- Enourmous pay disparities between tenured employees and new hires (ie substantially higher salary for an employee who started one year ago vs one whos been there for 5 years, even if the new employee is less qualified)
- Constant gaslighting from both middle management and execs, despite peddling a philosophy of honesty and openness
- Years of feedback and pleading for help (ie yearly failures at hiring enough staff to keep up with the rapid company growth) pretending to be listened to but never acted upon. 
- 7 months of begging leads to hire new team members for a drastically understaffed team as the company grew more rapidly than even before, resulting seeing many teammates burn out and struggle a lot
- Increasingly poor hiring decisions which fail to meet team needs
- 6 monthly reviews are decided by the head of the team (who does not have the context of what work you do) but made to seem that it is your direct lead who has the power to decide on raises etc.
- Rampant nepotism and politics across many teams
- Carrot on stick promises for tenured employees that a promotion is ""very close"" only to hire externally for senior positions (instead of promoting excellent and knowledgable existing team members)"

- echo chamber at the top. 
- we're told what a great place shopify is, and yet a lot of people across many areas (below director level) talk about leaving and what a horrible place shopify has become. 
- the culture has been completely ruined - can't tell if this is on purpose or not.
- even new people joining are surprised by how the company is run. Huge disconnect between what's being sold to the outside and what is actually happening on the inside.
- the UX org is a mess. It used to be the most amazing group with a clear vision and a lot of excitement. Can't tell if this is part of something intentional or not, but it's hard to get my head around why else we're heading towards destruction.
- the blatant gaslighting.
- the lack of transparency when it comes to pay. This company definitely doesn't pay people what they should. Huge gaps between people. Not paying people enough is justified as opportunities to learn as if we're doing some kind of work placement.
- micromanagement from the top is intense. What's the point of middle management if they can't do their job and be trusted."

There's no structure, and you are entirely at the whim and mercy of terrible management. After I had accomplished my mission as an Ops Specialist, I internally applied for a promising new role that would have me move countries and build something new. I was offered the job. After I accepted, weeks went by while I was sidelined and told things were being worked out. Then I was summarily told by the hiring manager that the role he had hired me for hadn't been approved by his manager and so wouldn't go ahead. Even though prior to applying I had specifically checked with him that the role was approved. That's the kind of mess this company is all about. I complained to HR and they told me that was that.

After this debacle, I had a positive impact review for my current role and got a raise. I then applied internally for another role in a different team, not having learned my lesson. I went through the interviews and was about to be hired. My current manager disliked this turn of events and without warning or justification I was laid off. Mind you I'd just had a raise and my performance was excellent. There wasn't warning or disciplinary action or explanation, I was just thrown out. Also worth remembering that Shopify is a company that proclaims to encourage and incentivize internal mobility.

Stay well away from this place, I wish I could get the years i gave them back."

Working here will surely help you evolve into a better software engineer.","I'm not saying that all teams/employees are like this, but here are some negatives I found from my experience.

Some employees/teams can be very judgemental, i.e. one wrong move on the wrong day and you're out. At the same time, some teams are more lenient and even take syntax errors lightly.

Work-life imbalance, especially after they went remote. 

Some employees/teams have strange expectations. Say, your task depends on a senior member from another team. You might be blamed for delays caused by that member.

Unequal treatment of employees in certain teams, e.g. a lead or a senior developer can break prod with their mistake and the team laughs it off, while a junior developer can be criticized for small things like code-style preferences. When I needed help understanding some vaguely described issues, nobody was available to reply to my messages. However, I was surprised to see that even the busiest team member would take time to help the other noob that joined. Not only by replying to their messages, but by even jumping on a pair-programming session.

Some teams are not open/ready to accept new members, e.g. if they don't like you, they won't reply to your messages or GitHub comments, they'll take weeks to review even the simplest PR you write, they won't hesitate to make a big issue out of any small mistake you might make.

Doesn't matter if you get your work done and work hard to meet the team's expectations (growth mindset), if you don't have a certain ""je ne sais quoi"", the team will not cooperate with you.

Some teams are not good at communicating, e.g. vague comments on PRs which might take 15-30 mins to decipher. E.g., someone might post a vague comment about something and if you try to address that comment by changing your code, they might post a follow-up comment saying, ""you don't have to change the code just because I suggested"". Additionally, delay in PR reviews can make you feel useless and makes it look as if you're taking more time to do your work.

Improper feedback might lead you down the wrong path, e.g. I was always told by my lead that I was ""on the right track"", until the last month when they suddenly sent me a warning to terminate my employment.

Finally, if they put you on probation, chances are that they've already decided to terminate you. I did my performance-evaluation task way before the deadline that was assigned to me, but I was terminated despite that. And... I wasn't even asked for my feedback when I was being terminated.

In summary, I've never had such a strange experience in the 10+ years of my career. Again, maybe it's all my fault. Please don't be discouraged by the points I shared above. I'm just saying that a series of unfortunate events is probable."

Overqualified people are put in lower job levels and expected to work their behinds off. I personally feel like no matter what I do, I wouldn't get a promotion, so there's really little incentive to be an overachiever (which I have been at every other company I've worked at)

The pay is terrible. This is the lowest salary I've had in 10 yrs (and I'm managing a large portfolio and working across multiple team). 

Overall I feel that I can't speak to my lead, as I feel like if I say anything remotely critical about the company, I would be pushed out the door. 

Very corporate, cold, but I hear that if you're a Dev, you have more opportunities for advancement and better salary."
726,Shopify,"No process, all politics.",2021-01-27,2.0,Human Resources,"The people. You work with some very smart folks and collaborate often. 
 
When the offices were still in play, the physical culture offerings like the cool space, the snacks, meals and free booze were great. 

Flexible work approach is a plus in that you can make your own hours as needed.","Where to start - at the risk of identifying myself I’ll keep it neat. This is my experience in Talent. And yes, I’m looking to leave. I’m at the end of my rope. 

1. This company does not care about you. Lots of lip service, but when someone is struggling and their performance slips or they aren’t themselves one day, the reaction is 100% judgmental and punitive.  Instead of really looking at the burnout, fear and fatigue, they send you expensive swag in the mail. Like an abusive relationship where they ply you with gifts when they smell unhappiness. People for whom this is their first job, or have never worked anywhere else are easily bought. Shopify is shiny, but when you look closely it’s brass, not gold. 

2. If you have a voice, don’t use it. They want you to think how they think- they hire the best bright minds and then extinguish them. They hire skilled HR Directors and then bring them in as a BP. They tell you to forget what you know, because Shopify is “different”. I would encourage anyone taking a job on the HR team to REMEMBER what you’ve learned, because that’s the only way to get your job done. The team is disconnected, burned out, and no one speaks up out of fear. Processes are broken or non existent. Every AMA with HR leadership has anonymous questions because no one wants to be identified and then targeted for having an opinion that is different. 

3. You will absolutely burn out. The demands are incredibly and unreasonably high - there is minimal recognition and they don’t pay anyone in HR enough to put up with the disregard for their wellness and mental health. For a billion dollar company, this is an area in which they MUST do better. 

4. If you’re reading reviews, you’ve read that management is terrible. There are some good folks that know how to lead, but they are needles in a haystack. They have a great leadership training program but not enough people to lead it."

They blindside you with this without even a proper and thorough performance review and chance for improvement. This is obviously the case when the terminations occur within a few weeks of joining the company. There is bad management here and lots of politics. Managers are not fit to be managers as they have little guidance and support, are typically inexperienced (less than 5 years on the job), and don't offer proper support. If you ask your Managers for advice, help, or feedback, they will shut you down as if you made a mistake. 

Once you are terminated without cause, they will offer you the opportunity to sign a shady termination agreement with or without severance and connect you with a career transition service. This career transition service then tells you that they are currently working with many ex-Shopify employees who have been fired. 

I am amazed this company has such shady employment practices as they otherwise do good work and portray themselves out to be the social justice warriors of the technology and e-commerce space. My experience at Shopify left me with a lot of sadness, bad will, and severe confidence and mental health loss. Then I found out that they have been doing this for many years now and shut people up by offering to help them find another job through a third-party service. Tobi needs to see this and respond to these concerns. These mass layoffs and terminations after only a few weeks, months, or even years that come out of nowhere are not OK. You should not treat people this way, especially when this is happening during COVID and people's lives are already a mess.

732,Shopify,"Genuine company that cares for its merchants (customers) as well as employees, alike!",2021-01-24,5.0,Junior Support Advisor,"1. Great positive teams and trainers

2. Monthly budget allocation for books and reading material you'd like to purchase for personal or professional development and growth

3. Free work laptop, hugh 27"" Dell monitor keyboard, mouse, USB C to HDMI adapter etc. Company lets you keep everything even after you stop working for the firm; only return laptop for security reasons

4. Fun place to work, fun people to work with

5. Great work life balace

6. They genuinely care about you, and in turn you learn to genuinely care about the customers (CX)

7. This is a company where anyone can do anything! Start off in CX support .. move into HR, IT, Finance, Data Analytics, Software Development, etc. If you excel in your current role and want to switch roles.. the company sponsors your education of bridging courses from local universities/colleges that prep you for your new role.
Shopify is like a university in itself; a gigantic learning hub for anyone that wants to!","Can't think of any. But keep your lines of communication open with your lead/traininer. They are there to help you, but in a work from home scenario its not difficult for a misunderstanding to prop up. Then it tests your ability to turn the situation in your favour. As long as you are honest about how you spend the time during working hours and stay on top of your work, you will keep moving forward.

Not a ""Con"" per say.. just something to keep in mind. This company is more rewarding that most others out there I have seen, and I have lived on 4 continents in the last 15years :-)"

734,Shopify,Mentally Draining,2021-01-21,1.0,Support Advisor,"Remote work, excellent benefits, paid sick & personal days.","This is the most mentally draining and exhausting job that I have ever worked. There is very high turnover among Support Advisors because people get burned out so quickly. Literally every second on the clock is timed. Training didn't prepare me properly for the job at all and I still feel like I'm winging it. You only get 30 minutes for lunch, and it could be within your first 2 hours of work. There is no overtime pay but you are expected to work overtime to catch up on emails. The culture is both a pro and a con, Shopify is no longer a start-up company but hides behind this as an excuse to throw curveballs and justify inefficient ways of doing things. This job is the definition of toxic positivity,"

There's a very real, shared connection to the company's mission among Shopifolk that is incredibly motivating. There's so much opportunity to make a real impact, and after coming from another very large tech company, it's so refreshing that there's real collaboration across teams and disciplines that I've never seen elsewhere. The Talent team also goes WAY above and beyond for employees. Throughout Covid we've been given so many incredible perks (like Fridays off all summer, a very generous expense allowance for creating a comfortable workspace at home, and much more). Working at Shopify has pushed me to grow in ways that no other job has and I'm really thankful for it. For those of us who lean into that growth, the rewards are pretty amazing.","Being surrounded by so many incredible people can definitely lend to imposter syndrome (this isn't necessarily a con but can be a real challenge), things move FAST and if you wait around for people to hold your hand and and spoon feed you information you'll get left behind quickly (resourcefulness and using available context is highly valued), the office closing for all of 2021 was a huge letdown but of course I understand given the circumstances"

You'll get to work with really the best professionals (and people!) in their field, friendly and open by default internally company culture. You'll get to work with various exciting and industry leading products on a mission which makes the world a better place. For all of this you will get a competitive salary, amazing benefits and perks, stock options. No question, one of the best companies to work for. The support advisor role is not your usual monotonous role - you'll be talking with entrepreneurs every day, helping them to build and run their businesses so every day you get to learn something new not only about Shopify itself but also about running an online store. A specific time in your Support Advisor work day will be dedicated to working on your own initiatives and projects. Shopify is fairly flexible and really does have a great work-life balance. However, no matter in which city or role you're working, it is expected that your performance will improve every year, there is no slacking off. In Shopify, people seriously come to work & get things done.","As of 2020 Shopify is all digital by default which means that everyone is working from home. For some it might be a con. Also, career opportunities are limited for those in support. However, with Shopify becoming a remote company when physical locations and timezones don't matter as much, this might be changing in the future."

Front line support staff are treated at times as disposable, senior management seems to be aware of issues with support staff working through a third party not being trained properly and seems unwilling to do anything about it.

- No pay transparency despite pretty glaring pay gaps that they refuse to acknowledge exist even though people talk and find out the hard way
- Silencing BIPOC but also asking them to fix all your glaring biases and culture problems free of charge, cute!
- At the end of the day it's just another cold corporation with a shiny coat of paint, if you come in, do your job, don't voice opinions and annoy everyone in your life with your worship of the company, you'll be just fine"

834,Shopify,"Democratic, meritocratic, but too big and ""too cool""",2020-08-26,3.0,Senior Product Designer,"It's a highly democratic system where everybody (at least in a Trifecta system - UX, product, engineering) has an equal say and is expected to have a say. It's also based on meritocracy where everyone advances based on their contribution and is absolutely attributed to it. 

Work-life balance and compensations are top-notch, though.","It's had a hiring surge for the last few years and it can feel like a small fish in the pond. Processes and bureaucracy can get in the way - although not as bad as corporations. The culture of building a strong case (and writing down docs) even for the smallest decision is good but sometimes becomes a nuisance. It's also become a ""cool kids"" club where everybody feels they are super good and super entitled ""to be here at Shopify"".

The company has scaled without deeply thinking about processes and structures to enable people to collaborate effectively together. Decisions tend to happen pretty haphazardly from the leadership team, and individual contributors are often left taking orders top down. 

Middle management is increasingly growing and there are a lot of individuals who shouldn’t be leading people. Shopify has a tendency to keep unqualified people around longer than they should, while letting go of people who are more opinionated and don’t fit into the passive culture. 

Shopify introduced a level system, but promotions still tend to be weighted by how others perceive you versus your output. Your ability to play the game and befriend people across the company is how you’ll rise in the org.

Shopify’s still a predominantly white organization and struggles like most companies in tech with diversity. The leadership team and the company still have a long way to go towards building an inclusive culture for people of color."

Working from home offers flexibility

You'll learn more than you ever thought possible","Working from home can be isolating
Being remote means you don't get paid as much as someone working in the office (and they don't keep up with cost of living - hope you like making the same salary for 5 years straight)
When perks are given company-wide, Support is usually excluded, or given a watered-down version
Perks don't pay the bills, but are included when they evaluate your compensation and tell you it's ""on par with industry standard""
Growth outside of Support is all but impossible. Success stories exist but are maybe 1% 
Chokehold on scheduling - good luck trying to take a vacation or even take a pee break when you need it
Decision makers are far removed from the front line. The Shopify they talk about publicly doesn't exist.
Major changes happen daily. Support lives in chaos. Huge decisions are made and then walked back within hours
You're expected to keep track of changes but given no time to do so
Management's perception of what the job is vs the reality of what it actually is differ appallingly
No metrics for success, no consistency in evaluation. Raises based on ""impact"", but ""impact"" is undefined and raises are so rare that most people think assume don't exist.
Leadership with minimal training, human resources issues abound and don't get handled appropriately
Gaslighting happens everywhere - you'll be told there's no issue and everything is fine, even as you're struggling to stay afloat

864,Shopify,This is the most forward thinking company on planet earth. And I'm thrilled to be part of the ride.,2020-06-10,5.0,Marketing,"I was hired into the company exactly one month after graduating college. Shopify was the only company I applied to after graduation, as I refused to try my hand anywhere else until I got my firm ""no"" from their recruiters. They were ranked as the best company in Canada of 2017, and I had really high hopes for myself.

For whatever reason, I made it through the Google-esque hiring process, which felt more like a chat with an old friend than an interview at an A1 tech company.

I started out as a support guru, and slowly worked my way up the support ranks over the next two years. The Guru role is very much of that of a fancy call center, with levels of business coaching peppered in. It's a tough job, but it's compensated extremely fairly for the work.

I'm one of those people who ""made it"" from support to an internal role of the company, and it was a hell of a journey. Support took a toll on me, and I was eager to show the company how much more I was capable of. It took a couple years, but I like to think they recognize hard workers when they see one. 

I now work internally, and can honestly say this job was worth the two-year wait. Our benefits are incredible, or pay is competitive, and the company's vision is something I can truly get behind. I'd do it all again in a heartbeat.","A few years ago, it would be common to work your way up from a support guru to anywhere within the organization. As the company has grown exponentially, increased competition has made internal movement exponentially more difficult- but absolutely not impossible. 

If you're willing to put in the work, the time, and the passion here, you will get recognized. You just have to work harder and smarter than everyone around you. If you identify a need internally that you are uniquely suited to fill, it's not unheard of to create your own job. In fact, I'd say it's encouraged."

888,Shopify,Best company ever,2020-03-23,5.0,Customer Success Guru,"After several bad experiences with corporates businesses, Shopify has showed me a light at the end of the tunnel. 

First of all, they treat you like a human being and as a person, and if you have any issues in your private life they will help you out as much as they can. 

And in Shopify you're supporting merchants as a Guru where they have an online store, and if they run into any issues or you're helping them out with any advice that you can give them. 

After one year of tenure with Shopify I still can't believe how they treat their employees. Everyone is so caring and everyone helps you out as much as they can. And trust me when I say that you're not a number here. I spoke with some CEO's and Directors and they're normal people like us, they'll listen to you and they will take your feedback very very seriously. 

Pros:
1. Working from home
- I never thought that working from home will be so fun and relaxing. After spending 5 hours a day on commute on previous job, working from home came as God given! More time with family and kids, drastic saving either on public transport or on car fuel and no more spending €10-15 on lunch in cantina. 

2. Amazing colleagues and Team Managers
- These people will give their hearts out to help you out, and no backstabbing!

3. Perks and benefits
- Every year you get a significant amount of € bonus (trust me when I say significant) to expense it as you want it. 
- Fully covered private health care and full paid by Shopify
- 20 days of holidays and 10 personal days (call it sick days but they aren't) so technically you have 30 working days of leave. 

4. Professional development
- If you want to learn more about your job or if you think that an online course or a book will help you out, Shopify will cover the expenses. 

5. Loads of training each week that you get allocated outside of live channels or Professional Development time too. 

6. Salary
- Salary is amazing when comparing same role with Apple. I'm not going to mention Amazon as they are paying peanuts compared to Shopify and they don't brainwash you like the others. 

Just to add, this isn't a manager review, I'm a Guru here in Ireland and my family means everything to me! I used to commute 5 hours a day before Shopify to bring bread in our house, my little kids didn't even see me, in morning when I would leave nor in evening when I would come back home. 

My relationship with my children has drastically improved because I'm working from home and you're always there for them if anything happens!

I know that some other reviewers will complain about Social life balance because we're working from home. If someone isn't capable of going out to a pub or to call their friend to meet up after they finish their shift then something is really wrong with these people. 

And I've been super productive while working from home, no dress code...nothing. No 50-100 other people around me laughing, talking, coughing, sneezing, creating distraction which would distract you. 

So yes, this is a place for me to stay!",Handling 3 chats at the same time can be daunting!

892,Shopify,One of the best places to work in Canada,2020-03-04,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"Great culture, great people, wonderful perks and beautiful office (Toronto). Absolutely love working here.","Recruiting is broken, wish it was more transparent, feels a bit embarrassing to be  fairly high up in the ladder (staff engineer) and not have your referrals matter. Meanwhile I interview candidates sourced by recruiting that are subpar, where my interview rejection rate is probably over 70%. It's not just me, it's an opinion that is shared by many in the company."
893,Shopify,High stress,2020-03-02,2.0,Customer Success Guru,The pay and benefits are truly out of this world. Not sure if they are worth sticking around for but definitely better than other companies and jobs of similar nature.,"Where do I even start? The training is very rushed and fast paced - you cover the absolute basics of this massive platform to then after six weeks go into “guru land” and support people on things you never even heard of. My own trainer described their first year working in Shopify as “everyday I started my shift I felt like I was driving off a cliff” and this is how I feel constant stress and pressure because each day I will be expected to support something I have no training in. 

THREE CHATS!! I shouldn’t need to elaborate but let me, No matter how long you’re here three chats is a daunting task and creates an extremely poor service especially as many merchants want their issue solved immediately. Imagine having to chat with three people, launch their stores, their admin etc, troubleshoot their issue or find info and then having to try business coach them towards the end of the chat it’s simply too stressful and borders near impossible for many. Some people might like it but two should be the Max and opt into three if you’re comfortable as opposed to pressuring people into three. Calls are somewhat nicer as at least then you’re only dealing with one person so you have breathing space. 

Throughout training and mentoring you’re given rather vague feedback and told you’re doing great to only then go into guruland and be ripped apart by your squad lead. Who will tell you it’s normal to know very little but then absolutely obliterate you for not knowing something and providing inadequate support. There’s simply no win! Escalated teams don’t work on live channels so everyone is rushing to get into those squads. This again creates a pretty harsh environment for gurus as you cannot simply escalate a problem and see it’s sorted quickly. 

The platform itself does seem well designed but has far too many flaws and allows dare I say too much customisation? This is fine for those who are actually able to code but 9 time out of 10 it is somebody following a help article that gets it wrong, contacts support, support don’t know how to code so are reading from the exact same help document and stressing themselves because they don’t know the answer. It’s toxic and really hard to deal with. 

There is zero pay for working extra hours, which is expected. Especially as you begin with the company a lot of your live interactions will be pushed to emails as you simply don’t know the answer. This in turn leads to a huge personal queue which you have 45 mins to get through, 15 mins in the morning and 30 in the evening.  I have often had to stay way past my shift finish time as this “get it done” culture is embraced despite the stress and work life imbalance it creates. 

There is so much more I could say here but writing this even makes me stressed and sad. I don’t see myself lasting much longer in the role, the stress and pressure is too much and unfortunately this is common right across the company. Turnover is high due to the ridiculous demands and expectations."

* Solid benefits package, including retirement and lifestyle spending 
* Most of your squad mates will be good, supportive folks.

If you take longer than 15 minutes with each of those people, your boss will chew you out for being too slow 
* Management cares more about how many upsell opportunities you found (regardless of relevance to the customer's needs) than genuine customer satisfaction.
* High turnover rates: Stressful conditions, unrealistic expectations and pressure from management leads to a lot of people burning out, taking stress leave, or just plain quitting. Termination with last-second notice is not unheard of. Management threatening termination if you ""can't take it"" is common. Some people don't even make it through training.
* Inconsistent Managment: Had a good time with a couple of managers who filled in while my boss was away (which was often). My boss himself was the definition of false sincerity. Very ""buddy-buddy"" in appearance, but with threatening tendencies when management style or behaviour was brought into question. Unsupportive and intimidating 
* Work from home can be isolating. Tough to leave the work behind when there's no real distance between your work space and your living space
* Work-Life Balance is a joke: You'll be buried in follow-up emails of one sort or another constantly, and you'll be given less than an hour each day specifically to work on them (all the while, accumulating more). If you stay late to try and make a dent in them, you won't be paid overtime.
* Training lasts a month and is still insufficient to ramp people up to the speed this company demands of their workers.
* Internal and external resources used to help with customer problems are frequently out of date and generally inefficient."

925,Shopify,A company that cares deeply about both its employees and customers - a rare find!,2019-12-18,5.0,Solutions Engineer,"1. Amazing Talent: The people that work at Shopify are world-class at what they do, which makes learning from their experience a massive perk.  The “Don’t be an asshole” mantra is something everyone lives by, eliminating a lot of the toxicity of other workplaces I’ve been a part of

2. Growth Mindset: Shopify preaches the growth mindset from Tobi down to the frontlines, but they definitely also put their money where their mouth is. You can “Own your own development” and attend whatever relevant conferences you want, make book/workshop/online course investments, take dedicated study time to level-up (perhaps during meeting-free Wednesday)

3. Lifestyle Perks: From the free restaurant-quality breakfast and lunches, to the beer and kombucha on tap, to the spending accounts for fitness, travel, etc. Shopify constantly makes you love being at work and a part of the Shopify team.

4. Exec Team: Shopify’s executives are just very smart, logical and pragmatic people. From the regular townhalls they hold to answer ANY question that comes up and is voted on by employees, to the “default to open” mentality of corporate information, you don’t feel as though you’re working in an opaque corporation as is too often the case with most tech companies nowadays.","1. Startup Quirks: Shopify is very much so still a start-up in many ways. Not all processes are well defined, and who owns certain components can be hard to track down. But this also means things aren’t super rigid and bureaucratic. Personally a lot of this I’d still consider a pro, but I didn’t have much else to write here.

2. Internal Movements: Shopify does love promoting people internally, but there are definitely some times when being internal hurts. Usually, if you’re a Guru, since the demand to get a non-support role is so large. There are also very significant compensation discrepancies for internal hires vs external ones, which can suck for people getting promoted."
926,Shopify,A Career and Lifestyle,2019-12-18,5.0,Customer Success Manager,Honestly Shopify is the absolute hands down best company to work for. You are free to be yourself and are treated with respect and as an equal. You can start or get involved in new projects or learn new skills and knowledge to improve yourself. There is an absolute wealth of knowledge between all the staff that are employed and they're all happy to help if they can with anything and everything. You can use your own initiative to ask someone in another role what is required a d the best way to start upskilling for that role and they will point you in the right direction.,"No cons, however it can be difficult for some people to get used to the idea of asking questions and taking initiative. For example if you want to talk to someone in the very top management, go ahead and either message them or send an invite for a 30 minute chat. The worst that can happen is they say no due to lack of time which you can then try reschedule. You won't ever find this of freedom again."
927,Shopify,Guru,2019-12-18,5.0,Guru,"Great company, flexible, proactive, provide everything,  great training, perks are amazing","Remote working from home, can mean you feel isolated. So they promote wellbeing and encourage you to actively be social"
928,Shopify,Not What You Think,2019-12-17,2.0,Customer Success Guru,"The benefits are pretty good, they are very customizable. You get 5000 every year in a Lifestyle spending account, dedicated to improving your health eg. shoes, canoe, etc. Th benefits are what are keeping me from leaving right now.","Initial Observations: 

I was actually very excited to work for Shopify, I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to elevate my skills and try a new field, but it didn't really go as planned. I realized very early that, Guru's are not paid nearly as much as they deserve - considering the amount of work that we do. Your bi-weekly pay will be around 1,250 (if you are working in Ontario). I know some may be like, “thats not bad, why the complaints,"" it’s really hard to explain exactly what the job entails, because of how much I do - I would be writing an essay, but I know for sure it is definitely not enough. 

Training Experience: 

I was part of a training pilot which was only 4 weeks long. Usually, training for Guru's is 6 weeks, but they shorted it to 4 for my team, as a “test.” I believe this really negatively impacted me as a Guru, not only in terms of preparedness when I hit live channels, but also what was expected of me in my role.  

During training, it was a constant race against time. My trainer was always rushing, always cutting things short or giving us unreasonable deadlines because there wasn't enough time to truly go through all the content. I found myself skimming through the Bridge Courses (course readings) because there was simply never enough time to fully read through them. At times, this resulted in me having to spend 2-4 hours completing tasks that were suppose to be done in training, on my own time after work. Which isn't really ideal nor is it fair. Furthermore, you only have a few days to learn how to navigate 3 chats at once. This may sound like ""oh a fews days, not bad"" but in reality it requires a lot more time/practice, it not as easy as it seems, it is actually very stressful. The questions in chats, can be extremely complex considering how dynamic the platform is. You are also required to take notes for every ticket, reach out to live channels, and do follow-up emails, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem. Most of the questions I have received in chats, I did not learning training, it required my own research during the live chat. 

Furthermore, another common rumour about Shopify is that is it easy to move up. During training, you have various people from different teams that chat to you about how they moved up to different teams. One thing they all have in common is that they “started as guru’s, just like you.” I can’t even begin to explain how many times I heard that phrase. Actually, it is not that easy to move up. I witnessed members of my team (who have been there 3-4 years) mentioning they would love to move to other teams - eg. Risk or Theme Support. They would ask about steps and how they can reach their goals. Squad Leads and trainers, literally say “Master the Guru role first.” Which to some degree I understand, how can you move on to another role is you haven’t mastered your current role. The thing is though, you can never really “master the Guru role,” you can never know everything about the Guru role because of how dynamic the role is. Instead, it’s really based on who you know and how likeable you are. It really depends on your Squad Lead, they stand between you and your goal. 

Management Attitudes/Guidance: 

As the weeks began to draw closer to my time to hit live channels solo, I became extremely anxious, I knew I wasn’t ready and I felt extremely unprepared. I was struggling in my mentored chats, and also just struggling with what my role was and how to answer merchant questions. It was not only me who felt this way. I remember a peer on my training team, literally saying in a video call, “I do not feel prepared, there are a lot of Guru horror stories about this feeling, how do I navigate this, how can you guys help me?” Our lead, completely dodged the question. The answer was, “all starting guru’s feel this way,” and he later sent her a video on how to manage stress. That is the problem with Shopify. They do not take Guru concerns seriously or at all. I was feeling burnout during my training and I am still feeling it now as a regular Guru, and no one actually addresses this issue head on. Instead, they glaze over it with comments like, “everyone feels this way,” “you’re not managing your stress properly,” “maybe this isn’t the job for you,” “you’re not being resourceful enough,” THIS IS NOT OKAY. By doing this, Shopify is taking accountability off of themselves, and placing on the Guru, this is extremely dismissive, toxic, and not an appropriate way to address/solve concerns. This type of dismissive behaviour, has really had a negative impact on my mental health. I know that the employer comment to this is going to be something like, “Surprised to hear this, we take our employee’s mental health seriously, we try to provide the best training and support, blah blah blah,” I know this is what you believe in and strive for, but it is not actually how it manifests. I am constantly feeling like I am not good enough at my job, that this job isn’t for me, that my feelings aren’t valid, that my stress is my own fault. It wasn’t until recently that I realized, these are all things I heard from Shopify Leads, as a way to shift accountability and not actually address issues within the structure of the Guru role. The feelings Guru’s are having, speak more to the training/support not being as effective as it should be, it is not solely the Guru."
929,Shopify,Mostly Amazing,2019-12-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The people who work at Shopify are almost always incredible and inspiring individuals,Work-life balance is something of an issue
930,Shopify,Great company!,2019-12-15,5.0,Marketing Manager,"People, culture, management. I love that everyone loves working there",I had a great time there. Literally nothing I can say here
931,Shopify,Choose your own adventure,2019-12-11,5.0,Content Strategist,"Despite being relatively large at this point, Shopify has retained its scrappy, 'choose your own adventure' culture. You are literally in control of your own destiny here, which is both daunting and empowering—if you don't push for a project, team, or promotion, it won't be handed to you. If you chase it, you will be rewarded, and the company is very focused on fostering people that can show this.

That may sound like a red flag, but the company has focused heavily on ensuring this isn't only promoting the loudest voices. Instead, it's methodical about ensuring everyone is considered, regardless of if they're introverted or extroverted. 

It's a great place to work, if you like big, meaty challenges that let you hone multiple skills at once- and they'll take care of you.

Most importantly, through all of this, you'll be able to leave by 5.30 every day, and you're encouraged not to work late—which demonstrates just how much the company is focused on people.","Context overload. Unlike every other company, Shopify is obsessed with documenting both the failures and successes, as well as how to repeat the latter. While this is complete overload at first, I've come to realize that this isn't negative once you push through it—at any company you'd be figuring out unspoken rules constantly, and having to ask for basic information."
932,Shopify,"Toxic place to work, do not believe the hype. Honeymoon period is a thing.",2019-12-11,1.0,Customer Success Guru,The other Gurus you work with are nice people.,"This company has an environment of high stress and high anxiety, with little to no pay increase reflecting the time and dedicated work of its employees. The leadership is very poor and inconsistent, especially at the squad and time lead levels. There is constant micro-managment. Performance reviews for Gurus are done by people who do not actually do the kind of work routinely that they critique, in  some cases they have not done it for years. The place has a huge cult atmosphere. There is a ridiculously high burn out rate for staff. The type of work is very lonely and extremley isolating. There are high expectations in every aspect of your work, you will be monitored and recorded to a totalitarian level that puts 1984 to shame. There is a constant rat race to get out of Guruland and into another role.  Guruland as a whole is a glorified call centre, nothing more, do not believe the hype. People are slowly drained of energy and most quit around the two or three year mark unless they move into a promoted role. Those who have moved on to bigger roles do not glance back. Promotions stink of nepotisim and cliques are rampant. Expect to work most if not all major holidays, weekends are also worked but you are not informed of this until after the hiring and training process. The place is in a desperate need of a union for employees. There is little to no long term planning, which is ridiculous for a company planning to be 100 years old. As a Guru, it is a soul crushing, empathy sucking, time demanding job and it will wear down anyone. There might be a reply to this review from management that will ""understand where these feelings are coming from"" and ""it is not for everyone"",  they ""empathise and understand"" and they ""make changes to address these kinds of issues"" but that is lip service. They are looking to cover themselves and protect the company image at the cost of Gurulands wellbeing. It is business as usual and unsurprisingly they hemorrhage talent. All in all, it is a pretty bleak place to work, they will kill any enthusiasm you have for the role and I would not recommend anyone to work here."

Everybody you meet talks about how they moved up from being a guru into whatever role they are in now. YA OK, when there were 100 employees that's bound to happen, not when there's 10000. This also results in incompetence all across."

Little constructive feedback to action for advancement. No clear guidelines for advancing in the company. Company line is always, “just be better at your current job”,  even if you are already top tier performer. Intense multitasking for hours on end. Management very focused on smiley ratings from customers, but no way to dispute ratings based on circumstances beyond your control, like service outages, or policy changes. Excessive performance metrics. Sales targets, which are never called sales targets. Typically your workday on the day you start the job and your workday 2-3 years later will be identical.

A lot of really nice people work at this company.,"The guru role is expanding all the time and it is almost impossible to keep up. Management is just not listening and I've been here for 2 years and can see they are not listening. Burn out is frequent and real, and with only 10 sick days a year allowed, you end up taking days off and not getting paid for them if you go over those 10 days. The work load of the role has increased 100% but the salary definitely has not kept pace with that. 30 minute lunches and being micro managed is really frustrating. Shopify says they trust us and we are adults, but they micro manage guru's and watch our every move - even bathroom breaks! Steer clear of this role if you are thinking of this company."

Shopify seems like a great place to work if you're not a guru.","- Burnout
- Lack of professional development
- Everyone wants out of the guru role so there are thousands of people applying for one role, so very few chances for advancement
- Misaligned goals across the company
- No consistency amongst squad leads and their expectations
- QA and SLs are not aligned 
- Did not feel supported across teams
- Gurus are siloed and completely removed from the company. They are never allowed to attend company meetings (have to watch them recorded on their own time), which leaves us feeling unheard and not even part of the company
- Leadership is very disconnected from the role and have no idea how hard it is now
- Lots of talk about fixing things but nothing is done
- 3 chats about 3 completely different problems and also business coaching = stressful
- when concerns are voiced, leadership turns it around on the gurus and makes them feel guilty for the state of support (ex. we were told the queues are high because so many people were taking sick time. Maybe we should address why half of the gurus are on short term disability because of the stress of the Guru job, rather than telling Gurus to just not be stressed?)
- not a fair compenstation for the work that gurus do and the stress they are under
- Business Coaching expectations on all interactions without ANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! marketing or sales training
- Gurus are expected to hit a monthly sales goal that actually works out to be the guru annual salary
- All the little perks that made the job bearable are slowly being removed (PD time, training time, team time, jump offs)
- Remote employees vs. internal staff are treated completely differently
- Internal staff have many more perks 
- While gurus are handling 2hour wait times on the phone, the internal staff are spending the day doing a pasta making course, which I don't really understand how that helps the company"

- Fantastic 6-week comprehensive training process. 
- Everybody I met was very kind and always willing to help.","Intensity of the Role - While I loved the training, the people, and felt I was truly set up for success, when it came time to actually performing the role, I immediately struggled to the point of not eating, not sleeping, constant nausea, and intense anxiety. I believe this was largely due to constantly having to be ""on"" - when you're on phones and/or chats, your every pee break is timed by the second. Every conversation is recorded and Shopify has very specific messaging that can be extremely difficult to keep up with (especially since new features are always being added/subtracted). There wasn't a day where I was able to actually leave when my shift ended - I would always spend at least an hour trying to keep up with phone calls, chats, and email. 

High Turnover - Although I was only in the role for about a month before the cons outweighed the pros for me,  I experienced a ton of inconsistent management and several people in my initial training group has resigned due to stress and anxiety-related concerns. Additionally, I heard way too many stories of people who were afraid they were going to get fired any second for taking too long of a break here, not keeping up with 3 simultaneous chats well enough, etc. In my short time there, I heard from tons of people about the high turnover rate and was really alarmed by how many people from my training group ended up leaving within the first month. 

False Promises - Throughout training, you're encouraged to think about the roles you want to move into after your time as a guru. You go to Zoom meeting after Zoom meeting where someone who got promoted from the guru role after 2 weeks is telling you all about their department. Then, once you get into the role, you quickly learn that rapid movement is something that's dying out - and it's now pretty much impossible to get out of the guru role even after 2+ years.

I worked in sales and customer service for many years, but Shopify exudes a kind of pressure and exhaustion I have never before experienced. In a few short weeks, I lost control of my mental health - even as someone who's very active, healthy, and makes a concerted effort to prioritize my mental wellbeing. 

My main point here - Shopify Gurus get amazing benefits, but at a steep cost. I would absolutely NOT recommend this role for anyone who deals with anxiety."

- Working from home","There is a lot of work that needs to be done with this company, and if you are considering working here, you should really do your research to know what you are getting into. This isn’t just any ordinary support role, you are required to support EVERYTHING. This doesn’t seem like an issue, but when you get bombarded with questions that you actually do not have the tools to support and you are still expected to provide excellent support no matter what. Your KPI’s are almost impossible to reach, no matter how hard you try. A day in the life of a Guru consists of back to back phone calls for either part of your shift (8hrs) or half of your shift, where you better not take more than 5mins to finish your notes and send out an email. This is then followed by back to back chats, which just by the way you are expected to do 3 at a time (they don’t mention that in the interview process, this little nugget of information becomes known well into your training). You have an incredibly high workload, with constant interaction where all you do is try your best under the circumstances, all to be told during your QA that you are either a low performer or if you’re lucky average. There will be constant and borderline over the top goal setting, which in all honestly don’t lead to anything. The cherry on top the cake is that you will often get abusive merchants, and be prepared to be told that there is always something you could have done differently, even if they come in being completely rude, it feels like it will always be your fault that they are upset. Oh and support teams are often equally as rude when you require assistance, so be prepared to be the walking mat of the merchants and the company. It is completely and utterly mentally draining, so be prepared."

989,Shopify,Great mission- guruland needs work,2019-07-23,4.0,Guru,"- Easy mission to get behind: make commerce better for everyone 
- Visionary CEO
- Working from home can be awesome
- Great peeks + benefits
- The guru role will give you a strong knowledge base not only of the Shopify platform, but also allows you to learn how to be an expert in commerce in general. If you are into  business/entrepreneurship, this is a great way to learn and get paid at the same time.
- People you work with are really genuinely nice. Your squad becomes your family.
- Very progressive company in many ways when it comes to inclusion, diversity, mental health, and self care","Shopify is a great company to work for. If you are able to embrace the role of guru until mastery and then move on to something better, I think it’s a great stepping stone into other areas of the company. The cons below reflect my views of guruland.

- Some gurus are straight up smarter + show more potential than their squad leads. From a high performer perspective, it’s tough to be coached by someone you know you can do the job better than. Unfortunately, if you want to advance and/or keep your position, you will need to get this person on your side and let them believe they are helping you so that they feel like they’re good at their job.
- Reward for high performance is minimal. Even if you exceed your KPIs by 2x or 3x the expectation, the alleged “maximum” increase after a performance review is not much. If someone is putting up metrics that are equivalent to the work of 2 or 3  people,  should they be getting paid only slightly more than the weakest link?
- 30 min lunch is too short in my opinion. The issue is that scaling an extra 15 or 30 mins across hundreds of employees equates to a serious loss of productivity. I still think it would be worth it for employee morale, but there’s no data to show that.
- Middle management and upper-middle management have some blind spots when it comes to the front line. Sometimes it feels like they are too removed. I’d love to see them hop back into the job 1 full day per quarter to regain perspective.
- I don’t think the comp increase to go to a squad lead matches the responsibility increase. 
- advancement into another role is a grind. You can go through multiple rounds of interviews to find out that they are no longer hiring for that role. 
- internal talent movement can be better leveraged. The talent available in guruland is very high, but I feel like many high performers are not being used to their full potential.
- the kool aid is good at first, but after a while it’s just kool aid, and you can spot it very easily
- sometimes you will interact with incompetent and or disrespectful people."

I can tell you, flat out, that is a lie.

If you don't know someone (have an 'in' with someone from that department) you will not be hired into a new role. 

Guruing is hard work. The platform changes everyday and you are expected to change with it. New features are expected to be learned (without adequate time to train and practice). Some features are removed with little notice and we are expected to explain why to upset merchants (with ~positive positioning~ and offering them a chance to pay more money for a different plan than what they currently have). 

Shopify seems to pride itself on being a cool, hip place to work. However, guruland is drowning. There's not enough being done to show care for gurus mental health. We're told that 'breaking' is completely normal and expected. Isn't it sad that a company is telling their employees, the front line faces of their company, that yes, you will have mental breakdowns while working here?

Gurus aren't afforded the same leave benefits as the rest of the company. Most of the weekends up to the end of the year are already booked. Vacation is very, very structured and if you don't book it right away you will not get it.

I know I'm complaining, but it's all I can do to help future gurus who apply for this position. Please know what you're getting into when you apply. It's a stressful, relentless, mentally exhausting job. You will experience burnout and it will harm your mental health."

1032,Shopify,Past its hayday,2019-05-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great product. Great CEO that is truly looking to increase global entrepreneurism through his company. Very nice people, some exceptionally bright and creative.

Great benefits.","Nepotism and politics are ripe, and unfortunately management is mostly blind to it. Lots of unqualified people in very senior roles, which trickles down to mid-level roles and then onwards to individual contributors. It's very hard to find a team of true A-players. A lot of the standout A-players have either left, mysteriously disappeared (or got fired?) or find themselves in high management roles that are not suited to them.

My biggest worry is that management is blind to the amount of politics cause they're getting what they want to hear from incompetent subordinates. The stock price is definitely a lagging indicator of the quality of the company, and is more a reflection of its haydays a couple of years ago.

Salary is slightly below market these days because they haven't revised their salary bands in some time - at least for product development roles."
1033,Shopify,Shopify Guru Ireland Review,2019-05-22,4.0,Customer Success Guru,"1) The pay is very good and is annually reviewed. 
2) Benefits are amazing and include health and dental insurance amongst many others (sports equipment, house cleaner, ongoing learning etc.). You also get these once you start and dont have to wait until after your 6 month probation.
3) Equipment they provide is top of the line and if you have any issues with any of it or you accidentally damage anything they replace it quickly and easily.
4) Stock provided which you can sell at any point. More is given the longer you work there of course.
5) Everyone who works there is really nice and they train you really well. 
6) You get a lot of training and professional development time in your schedule each week, generally 2-3 hours.
7) Its great experience and you learn loads of great skills in the world of e-commerce, digital marketing and web design.","1) The 8 week rotating schedule means you have to work weekends a lot of the time.
2) It can be really hard to get time off. 
3) Because service is 24/7 you have to work over holiday periods such as Christmas. 
4) Getting promoted or moving to a different team seems to be based on who you know and not based on experience and skill. You really have to get on board with the Shopify ethos and attitude which can feel a bit suck uppy and annoying.
5) Escalated support teams are generally not available on weekends and holidays so when there is an issue out of your control you cant do anything to help.
6) Some things you are never trained on and its often expected you to have knowledge and/or experience on. They do offer a lot of training and professional development time each week to practice things and learn new skills, but things like Google analytics, Facebook Pixels and Marketing are not something you can really just learn from reading.
7) As with any remote position it can get really boring and kinda frustrating - definitely not for everyone.
8) So much of the job is dealing with people who should not be using the platform and have watched some video on youtube that has sold it as a get rich quick scheme. I understand how this is not something they can control but its definitely a mega frustration."

1046,Shopify,Traumatic life changing disappointment,2019-04-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Shopify has a solid well-crafted interview process. It's challenging, intense, and allows you to paint a comprehensive picture of your skills and experiences. It's a great experience regardless of the outcome.

While working at Shopify, you will meet a lot of great people who are smart and full of energy. Shopify is a company bubbling with potential. They will most certainly go very far.","The following might be an isolated case, but these were my experiences, and if they happened to me, it’s possible it happened to others. I was very disappointed to discover how this company turned out be.

Despite the efforts Shopify makes in taking care of their employees and despite their thorough and comprehensive interview process, the sole opinion of your team lead is enough to get you fired. The positive relationships you've built both within and outside your team are overruled by the opinion of this one employee with reasons that are misguided, exaggerated, and misunderstood.

Your motivation and work ethic rarely gets noticed as their just-get-it-done attitude discourages the time and energy required for high-quality work. The efforts you make in going above and beyond comes with the risk of being downplayed and dismissed as you struggling to complete tasks.

When advised of the failures to meet their expectations, the opportunity you’re given for improvement is an illusion. It’s very hard to change their minds once they’ve targeted you for dismissal. You’ll do your best to demonstrate your skills and talents but it will never be enough; it doesn't matter how good or how successful, they'll always ask for more. Small mistakes are exaggerated and good work is overlooked. There is no clear feedback regarding your standing, and your direct and upfront requests for more feedback is dismissed with excuses about not having enough information to evaluate you.

You are given the choice to speak with HR, but it's downplayed and not given any real importance. Instead, you are advised to trust them because it’s difficult to be aware of your shortcomings; you are advised to trust them and let them help you become a better employee, to give in to their “constructive criticism” and look inward to see what can be done to improve yourself, to accept their comments and choice of words as “tough love” as opposed to being unfair and unreasonable.

The day you get fired will come as a surprise. After you’ve given everything they wanted and completed all that was asked, the meeting for the feedback you were waiting for turns out to be the meeting to process your termination. You will be fired without anyone hearing your side of events. It’s not important. Your fate and the entire narrative is driven by the opinion of one person."

Loved my whole team and most of the projects we worked on.,"It's starting to move slowly for a scale up.

1050,Shopify,This place is straight up the worst.,2019-04-19,1.0,Customer Success Guru,"Gurus are great people, you share and go through a lot of frustration and BS together so it really bonds you with your squad, especially if you have a bad unexperienced lead which is the norm.","Terrible. This place is terrible. Middle management and supervisors are absolutely clueless with how to properly run the support team that Shopify needs. Our concerns are dismissed always and we're made to feel like we don't know anything by people that have never done our job. The only people who stick up for gurus in the rest of support are people who were recently gurus since they know what it's like. Suggest something reasonable like adding a character/ message limit for merchants starting chats so we don't get pages of text before even connecting with the merchant during our HOUR long wait times? Nope, no way, god forbid we implement something that makes the guru job even a sliver easier when we are actively voicing where we are struggling. Stop trying to compare Shopify to other companies that are nothing like us. We support the ENTIRE internet. This isn't Rogers, or Telus where you actually have departments that know about a specific aspect of the company to help someone, so you have no business trying to tell us that we're following the norm. Pretty sure Rogers went down to 2 chats at a time also after their employees voiced concerns but noooo, not Shopify, it's basically a crime to make any kind of change that positively impacts employees and helps them with an increasingly stressful job. 

We're the place mat for merchants to walk all over us and if you voice that you're struggling, you're essentially told off since there's 100s of people wanting to work here (obviously oblivious to how it actually is working here). Please PLEASE read all the Glassdoor reviews before considering working here, especially for gurus. And anyone working here under a year is still probably under the impression that Shopify cares about them and they have a chance to advance. That notion will fade soon once you start seeing the patterns of how decisions are made and the lies you are fed to make you think you are working towards a larger goal. You are fed the idea that Shopify's success is your success. It is not. Shopify will use and abuse gurus to grow and once you are burnt out they are done with you. Upper management has completely lost touch with what it means to care about their employees. Last time I checked, it's normal for large companies that say they are 'progressive' to actually invest time, resources and money into their employees to try and keep them here. We've had dozens of great people quit for much better jobs in the past few months and still no one in management seems to think employee retention is necessary."

1054,Shopify,Will Never Leave,2019-04-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Shopify is awesome. I'm happier than I have ever been at work.

- You see the mission and values of Shopify played out in your everyday work. Management really is trying to democratize commerce. Our work has real impact on thousands of people around the world. 

- Real opportunity to make an impact. High value put into personal growth and development (conferences, books, training, courses) all covered by Shopify. You *aren't* encouraged to stay in your lane. If there's something new you want to try, you do it. There is never a cap of people at the level above you. You're paid for impact so if you're successful, you'll be rewarded. 

- The autonomy to get your work done in the way that works best for you (hours, location, really anything) is amazing. Allows for incredible work/life balance. 

 - Perks are very generous and up to you to tailor to what you need and want, super flexible. 

- The office (especially in Ottawa) is beautiful. A bright, beautifully designed space with a ton of different areas (your desk, small bookable rooms, nooks, common areas) to get your work done wherever is best for you. 

- The culinary team is INSANE. Don't worry about feeding yourself breakfast AND lunch because there is ample, varied, incredibly tasty healthy & unhealthy food to keep you going. They go above and beyond to make Shopify awesome.

- You are encouraged to take care of yourself both mentally and physically.","Anywhere you work there is going to something to complain about, and obviously that's the same here.  It's not the environment for everyone. 

There's a lot of autonomy. There's not a playbook for how you do your job. You need to be a self-started and self-motivated.  There's also not a lot of coasting. It's hard, we're solving meaty problems, and there's a lot of change."
1055,Shopify,Toxic,2019-04-16,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"Very few to mention, remote working has benefits.",A near toxic workload with ever increasing harsh feedback. Felt pushed out of the company due to bullying nature or team leads
1056,Shopify,Be careful of the hype,2019-04-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits and perks. An amazing CEO. A good name to have on your resume. Good potential for growth in the some roles/depts. Probably a great place to work if you're a developer without a lot of experience or right out of school. Also a good place to work if you find value in working hard and moving through big amounts of work and are not particularly focused on results or problem solving. I think pretty much all new employees get a grant of shares, those will probably be worth a lot one day.","The company is going through very fast growth and some depts have serious issues with very bad management due to having to fill roles quickly. The company also doesn't follow it's own policies so you need to be very careful if you do end up with a bad lead, there is a line in your employment contract that says you can be terminated at any point without cause, this is likely to be used to terminate you if you raise issues with the work of anyone above you in the org chart. I'm not sure how the HR dept allows this, but it unfortunately does happen often.

The level of politics has got out of control, I think due to people being put into roles that they cannot handle and feeling like they have to ensure they aren't found out as not being up to the task. I saw multiple people get let go after doing great work because they were trying to hold their managers accountable for bad work. 

Be particularly careful if you are hired in as a crafter or senior crafter to help build a newer dept, your management will likely not know what they are doing and due to the culture of constant positivity that must be adhered to, if you try to advocate for change you will be seen as a trouble maker or as having a negative attitude. Although you will be hired as someone who is an expert, people will not want to hear your contribution, you will be told that your idea is not how things are done at Shopify and you will have to watch management make mistakes over and over that you could easily avoid.

The issue of politics does get raised repeatedly to exec level in regular AMAs but gets brushed aside for some reason, the company is also very hierarchical, despite strongly stating that it isn't and shouldn't be, but if you do manage to run some good projects or come up with a useful idea it will get taken by people above you in the org and you will get shut out of further contribution toward it. 

Unfortunately it seems like the sort of people who are needed at Shopify, and do good work, are not sticking around because they quickly realize that their growth opportunities are very limited and working with poor management is frustrating, or they get into disagreements with management and are terminated."

Management of the organization can be very poor depends on the team since they are hiring lots of new people. Especially international team, one person lied off just after a few months having got hired."

Inconsistency amongst support leadership, talk to any squad lead about expectations and you’ll hear something different from each one. Gurus are not evaluated evenly across the organization, it just depends who your lead is 

Constant nitpicking on every interaction - even if your merchant leaves you a glowing review, your lead will find something wrong with your work. Strict QA scores and unrealistic expectations means even if you think you’re doing a good job, you probably aren’t in your lead’s eyes 

Regimented schedules with even your bathroom breaks being monitored, with queues as busy as they are you need enough time to take care of yourself throughout the day and this is almost impossible 

Also impossible to move up in the company unless you have an in with the right people - hard work and dedication aren’t enough

No cost of living raises - you can go a couple of years without seeing a raise. You’ll be told that compared to “industry standards” you’re still compensated well

No stat holidays off or shut down at Christmas like the rest of the company gets, expect to work almost all holidays regardless of your tenure. Rest of the company also gets flexible vacation but Support is very limited to what will be approved by the scheduling team and is capped at 3 weeks

Lot's of vague answers for rapid fire decisions that are disguised as one of their core values ""thrive on change"". This is really an attempt to change the entire anatomy of the position and pile on more reaponsibility with little to no compensation or recognition. There is also a general unrest amongst all of support as there has been no attempt to reconcile these changes. Guru's are being put on performance plans left and righ and the entire grading system to review our performance has become overly obsesssive and nit picky.

For some reason, we still can't keep up, and leadership is giving very generic non-answers when we ask what the game plan is to help with our insane level of incoming support requests. We're constantly slammed, there's no time to breathe; support is exhausted, and many are at their wits' end, because we don't have enough time allotted always for training, personal development time, team meetings for pulse checks, etc. 
- There are so many people I know who have quit, been put on ""Performance Improvement Plans"" without warning, or have gone on Leave or reduced hours. Teams are being dismantled left right and centre, and there's been no real acknowledgement of how seriously this is affecting our support team, and in turn, how that is affecting/going to be affecting our merchants. 
- Job/Role expectations changed about a year ago, which now includes ""business coaching"" as an expectation, which is a whole other ball game. Without having the time to research and genuinely know what you are talking about, it would require some more formal education, and there has been no compensation increase in response to that role expectation change."

Respectable company that is reasonably well known in eastern Canada.
High autonomy and high trust if your values align with the company.
Brilliant people that care a lot.

The company is much larger now than when I joined. Many things have changed. Your manager will really dictate your experience, which roles up to director/VP. There are many great teams working on challenging problems.","Company was always product focused, with development skill being the highest valued. This is shifting in favour of product management. Product teams report up through general managers, most of which were product managers. Many teams are still striking an okay balance, but power is definitely shifting towards product. Estimates are no longer WAGs.

Departments are inconsistent. Offices are inconsistent. You will be fine if you thrive on chaos and learning the differences. Is not for everyone though.

Many managers/directors are inexperienced. Growing company with good opportunities for people, but you may end up under someone who you need to handle things they are not ready for. Gives you the opportunity to try more senior responsibilities before they are yours, but if you are expecting a clear vision you will be disappointed."

- top management doesn't treat people very well - very harsh criticism, changing priorities, disrespectful, never any positive praise - as a result, that type of behaviour and leadership style is accepted and rewarded across the company

1108,Shopify,Poorly managed,2019-01-10,1.0,Guru,Great fellow gurus. League benefits... nothing much else that another company can’t provide,"Gurus are simply overworked. You get only 30min lunch breaks and then back on phones with the never ending calls (literally when you hang up, you get a new call in the same breath) or back to back to back to back chats x3 since you have to juggle a constant 3 at once. 

You are allowed to take some brb’s but make sure it’s not over 5min at a time (more than twice a day is frowned upon). That may work if your job isn’t battling pissed off merchants every 20min - okay, there are some happy ones, too. But the point is, the job is mentally exhausting and gurus should be entitled to either a longer lunch or more breaks - I’d be surprised if they are even following correct labor laws.

They say it’s “work/life balanced” but if the day is marked red in the calendar (which is really a flip of a coin these days due to them being understaffed for the high turnover of the guru role) don’t think you can get it off unless you want to use 1 of your 10 personal days towards it. You’re thinking: “wow 10 personal days? That’s great!” Not so fast. It’d be great if we were given STAT holidays but no, you’re forced to work them. So if you think about it, the guru role doesn’t give you any long weekend. Not one. Let me repeat: Guru role does not give you 3 days off. Ever. While everyyyyyyyone else in the company does. To get that, you need to use a personal or vacation day — or promoted but good luck, an internal job posting is like a french fry being thrown to a flock of 100+ seagulls at the beach, if you get it you’re the lucky one. Better luck next year.

Yet this company “values & respects” all gurus. Not."
1109,Shopify,Don't believe what you hear/ read (unless it's negative).,2019-01-09,1.0,Customer Service Guru,"Started so great when I was hired a couple years back, but things have changed and will never go back to being good so no use in mentioning the good ol' days. The intentions of management in this company have changed drastically, specifically towards gurus and support. Sure, cool benefits, but please spare yourself the stress this place will cause you that you will waste your benefits on.","Where to begin. It's not reasonable to write out all the small daily problems happening daily here, but overall lately it's a total lack of consideration and respect. To anyone who's thinking 'well that's the way the world works and how companies are these days and bottom line is everything' - I get it. The problem here is that Shopify preaches otherwise and tries to paint a very different picture of how this company actually values you and your work. Shopify had the opportunity to be better than accepting the status quo for call center environments - toxic morale, high stress and high turnover, responsibilities piling as our platform integrates with more and more on the internet - and that was silly wishful thinking on my part. In the end, saving pennies will be their intention despite the role getting 3x as complex since I started. Raises are non existent or equal to/below inflation. You are constantly being told corporate lines to make us think one way and deflect us from the decisions being made that are making this job unmanageable and gurus suffer daily. I used to be such a lover of Shopify and wanted it to be my forever company but everything is going downhill here. Morale, our stock price, our employee numbers. We get announcements boasting about how much money Shopify is making and processing in GMV, and somehow when we ask about our paywe are met with judgement of being entitled and comments of 'how can we NOT be happy here' - it's the wonderful place of Shopify so if we don't like it we can reevaluate if it's the right place for us. Trying to make any negative feelings heard is only an uphill battle. First you will be told you are just making these things up and no one else but you actually feels this way and to change your attitude. Then you will talk to your squadmates and realize you are all feeling exactly this way. You will then be told you are a toxic squad that is spreading these feelings to the rest of gurus, and the intention to keep making gurus feel like they are the problem continues. Any hardship Shopify puts on their employees is expected to be managed by the employee by just doing 'more self care' or 'changing your attitude'. Notions like this are being abused to make gurus feel like they are inadequate for the job."

Opportunities to help people and find meaning in your job
Grow your communication skills and build empathy
If you get a good lead, they can really help you grow as a person and do things you never knew you could. My lead, for example, was really able to pinpoint exactly what I needed to work on, and this helped me improve and gain mastery of myself even outside of work.

The public and the media currently has a very favourable view of this company , which is always a perk. If you wear company swag in public , people will often come talk to you about it. 

The company *tries* (or purports to try ) to help employees keep good mental health","The 10 personal days they give you seem like a lot at the beginning of the year, but when you realize you never get long weekends, stat holidays or Christmas holidays, it really seems like not enough. The exhausting nature of the job means you will get sick more often. If that happens even twice a year, you may have used up all your year's sick days, and that doesn't even count doctor's appointments, needing to go to the bank, family responsibilities or just needing a mental health day.

The training materials and guru-facing documentation make it seem like the company wants to treat us as humans, but the workforce planning people and the company ultimately see us as numbers. That discrepancy can lead to feelings of disillusionment, cynicism. 

The platform has changed so much that the amount of issues we are expected to support is completely unreasonable. Especially POS hardware. Try troubleshooting a barcode printer that you've never seen or touched in your life - sound like fun?

Whether or not you can ever move out of the guru role seems like a very nebulous topic. I've seen people get promoted, but it's not clear to me why, and almost seems like a crapshoot. If you do take on this job, be prepared for the fact that if you want to grow you may have to move to another company."

Think of a glossy magazine that looks great on the outside but has garbage trash content on the inside. Inexperienced people will not be able to see underneath the glittering surface and will leave glowing reviews here but this was the worst managed mess of a company I’ve ever worked at.  New people who actually know what they are doing are handcuffed with the equity deal and muzzled by politics from the OGs. 

They say they celebrate individuality, and authenticity but you’re ultimately expected to behave a certain way to be part of this cult, otherwise you won’t fit in.  

It’s sickeningly disappointing that how they are portrayed in the media is an exact opposite of how they actually operate.  Their external interfacing layer (HR, PR, Medium articles, and conference talks) does a good job of maintaining a facade on this clown show on the outside.  Kudos to them for the magic show."

It's no fairytale; Shopify is a real place, with real (great!) people, and somehow, has shaped its culture to reflect how supportive, collaborative, and amazing everyone is who joins.  The personal growth and development that is encouraged and supported by Shopify is unmatched by far. 

I can't speak more highly of Shopify, a business that keeps their start-up feel. They constantly prove their commitments, dedication, and consideration to each of their employees; and are truly aligned with innovation to continue to:

I met others who have been here for a while and are always on the support channels, even on their days off because they enjoy it? Work and life balance on the surface is encouraged, but the workflow itself isn't conducive to it.
- Felt like a high school popularity contest.
- Training isn't as sufficient regarding time management - things are left out on how the guru system ""actually"" works when you are finished.
- Felt that there was a lot of narcissistic personalities. Keep smiling, even if it breaks you. Having dealt with volatile merchants (and a racist or two) from around the world, we're told to paint it like flowers and suck it up.
- You don't get holidays (federal and provincial) off unless you dip into your vacation time.
- Staggered work hours, where it may benefit some, but working 6 days straight in a row, one day off, then another 4 straight is really not conducive to a healthy work-life balance.
- Not really a ""Guru"" role - While you are expected to learn everything - you are also expected to make sales - appearing as a favour to the merchant, but it's really Sales, as you are ""graded"" every two weeks as to what you brought in to the team. And no, Gurus, even though they are the ones making a sales pitch because they are good at what they do, do not receive any commission - even if the sale itself is monumental - the managers get those credits, not the guru - even against their bi-monthly reports."

1166,Shopify,"Front End Developer, Toronto",2018-07-08,5.0,Senior Front End Developer,"I've been here almost a year as a developer. I personally think it's the most exciting place to work in Canada and love working here. Here's why:

Meaningful work making an impact to users. The company has a clear goal and you're contributing significantly. You get to make improvements & provide value to the user's lives which is very rewarding.

I've been encouraged to grow in terms of skills. I've learned Ruby on Rails, which I didn't know at all before. I've given a talk in front of a large group & wrote a blog post, neither of which I've ever done before and never imagined I would. This place can really encourage growth & improvement. Even though I'm a front end developer, there have been no issues with me doing some back end work or helping on other projects. It's all on GitHub and open to pull requests (feels like open source within the company).

With thousands of smart & talented people in a culture where they can do amazing things & innovate, amazing products are created. The people here are very talented & helpful. Everyone supports & roots for each other. On Slack, we celebrate each other's accomplishments. Most of the people here could work anywhere. Many come from start ups in Toronto or moved from different parts of the world to work here.

There are many opportunities to get to know others & work with them, for example Fancy Friday lunches once a month where you go to out to lunch with others (paid for by Shopify). Or a system that randomly matches you with others for lunch. Hack Days is another great chance to work with people you don't normally work with.

Even though it's a big company, there is little bureaucracy. There is tons of internal communication where everyone shares what they're doing and everyone can ask any question and get an answer quickly. We're constantly doing things & telling people so that people are inspired & get feedback or help if needed.

Compensation is high with public stock, something many other Canadian tech companies can't offer.

Great offices, food is usually good, house-cleaning perk. Sometimes I come into work and there's someone cooking fresh eggs for you. Book bars where you can borrow some interesting books. Internal podcasts!

Personally, I've never had to work evenings or weekends. Work from home & hours flexibility (can avoid rush hour on subway).

Tooling is great: Github, Slack, with many integrations & reasonable processes. Because there are several cities, there are many cross-location meetings, but with google hangouts & livestream infrastructure it's painless.

Really amazing employee conferences/events like Summit, opportunity to travel to other offices.

Even though there's free beer/wine/drinks, it's not a very drink-heavy culture. There's no obligation to stay late for things like hack days, so I find it very inclusive for those in different life situations. People may have a beer or glass of wine during town-hall meetings, but I haven't seen it ever go too far.

The employee population is diverse by gender, race, age & life situation, although it may skew younger than many larger corporations. Many women in leadership roles.

As with other tech companies, love that we can wear anything to work (shorts, hoodies, t-shirts).

You're always encouraged to give your honest opinion (in a respectful way), even if it challenges others.

If you're a developer, how cool is it that the CEO wrote the original code for this big Rails app that tons of people run their businesses on?","Growth rate is extremely high. After a few months, many on your team are newer than you. This is both exciting & has challenges. Each team or group can be different or have different processes, so my perspective might not be representative of all experiences working here. I've been here about 1 year and many are newer than me.

There's a good on boarding process but I personally found Ruby on Rails to have a bit of a steep learning curve, coming from a JS background. Having said that, there is a lot of support and I've been able to learn it & contribute.

There are 3 separate buildings in Toronto. The buildings are all nice but one of them is a bit of a walk away from the others, so you may not see people from there as often.

With multiple cities (Ottawa, Toronto, Waterloo, Montreal, SF), groups can feel fractured, but travel, Slack & remote meetings can mitigate this.

Those coming from more traditional companies might experience some culture shock by how casual & laid back it is here, but I think it's pretty standard for a tech & Silicon Valley style company. I've always worked in tech (in Canada) so things like sandals at work or beer at work is not shocking for me personally.

There is a lot of autonomy & freedom which can be good for some, but an adjustment for others. Sometimes you have to find your own work and ways to contribute."

I was in love from the first week of training - it instantly felt like a family who really believed in a common goal. There are so many opportunities for growth but in a company of this size and with so many remote employees, YOU need to pursue those goals and own your own professional development. Don't expect to work hard and have someone notice you and pluck you from the crowd for a promotion. After about 3 months of Guru-ing, I applied for a position with a higher level internal team and got it. I've grown immensely since I started working here. I'm constantly amazed by how smart and creative the people I work with are. I would never have thought I'd be in the position I am now when I applied to work as a Guru a couple years ago but I am so grateful for the opportunities I've found here.","In a huge company like this, you need to pave a way for yourself if you want to advance or be noticed.

- Good food
- Opportunities for personal development (internal ted-style talks, after-work programs and classes)
- Quarterly hackathons","- Ideologically inbred

Shopify insists that its very different from a traditional company, but as far as I can tell, they have no concept of the workings of a traditional company. They don't seem to know what works well in a normal company, or why things that don't work, don't work. As a result, they don't know how to do normal things effectively (having meetings, organizing work, etc.).

- Management is not involved or aware.

Managers didn't really know what was going on with our projects and didn't ask, which is good if you're screwing around all day, but bad if you're trying to actually get something done and need their help. The vacuum left by management is filled by informal structures; cliques and popularity contests.

- Feels like high school

Having friends and being popular is extremely important. Your boss won't know if you're doing a good job, but they will know if somebody doesn't like you, or if you're not getting along. 

- Lacks diversity

As with most tech companies, most of the people working on the tech side of things are of the same race, gender and age group. While not as bad as other places I've worked, brogrammer culture is very strong. Women and minorities are at a disadvantage. 

- Opportunities for advancement are largely illusionary

The company will tout the rich field of opportunities that are available to you, but the management defers to the workers for indications of who should be promoted, which goes back to what I said about the popularity contest. Creativity and innovation are stifled by entrenched workers."

* Advancement is on the basis of enthusiasm and who can drink the most koolaid, rather than performance, or even competence.
* Because of the above point there's whole layers of middle and lower management that are inexperienced and untrained, and just manage by buzzword.
* You are not objectively metricised in any way, you are at the mercy of your direct managers, if you don't get on with them, you're screwed.
* While Shopify is talks a big game about promoting ""radical candour"" amongst its employee's, in reality voicing an opinion that differs from management will see you effectively blackballed from any promotions.
* Benefits are rapidly being eroded as the company grows into another faceless corporation, you used to be able to move freely within the EU, take working holidays, that sort of thing, that's been completely removed. 
* No HR organisation in Ireland.
* Used to be a great social life attached to the job, but this has largely died off, in part due to the simple nature of it being a rapidly growing company, but also due to active management decisions like disbanding the employee organised social team."

1189,Shopify,"Shopify is an incredible place to work - supportive, driven, rewarding & great work-life balance!",2018-05-11,5.0,Talent Growth,"Shopify is a workplace that not only encourages, but enables, its employees to achieve incredible feats of success. I started working at Shopify as a Customer Success Guru, and while it was challenging, it was an incredible growth experience that helped me learn important job and life skills like resourcefulness, empathy, teamwork, leadership, meaningful communication and how to find value in not only the product, but in the relationship with our merchants, our teams, and our own network. Shopify helps its employees be their very best selves through mentorship, offsite IRL activities, endless professional development opportunities and an incredible benefits package that supports both physical and mental wellbeing. 

In a new team, I find the pros to be very consistent. Shopify is a place that is growing and changing - sometimes at a very fast pace. This drive to stay current, relevant, and a leader is reflected in the culture. Shopify is a place that is never dull. There are countless opportunities for the driven to find their passion and pursue it with fervour. Shopify is diverse, open, and full of incredibly intelligent people who are impactful in their own ways.

Work-life balance is incredible. In both the Guru position as well as my current position, I’ve never felt such passion for my job while also being able to literally go dark on all work communications until start time the next shift.","As noted in the aforementioned pros, Shopify is a company that is growing and changing - sometime quite rapidly. Change doesn’t come without some challenges - whether that’s delving into a job function that might be a little outside of one’s comfort zone or hustling harder during the work day to meet team goals, work pace can sometimes become more demanding. While this isn’t a con necessarily, it can be challenging. That being said, at Shopify you can always expect to be rewarded. Hard work doesn’t go unappreciated."
1190,Shopify,"Great place to work where I've been challenged, supported and encouraged!",2018-05-11,5.0,Recruiter,"Throughout my time with Shopify so far, I've learned more than I thought I would, and developed professionally and personally more than any other job I've had. You get the opportunity to work with a diverse group of colleagues who all bring something to the table.

Additionally, the values and mission of the company are really easy to connect with. In a nutshell, we're lowering the barriers to entry of the ecommerce world, and helping our merchants succeed in their business goals. You're ultimately helping people live the lifestyle and the life they want to live by bringing something they're passionate about into the world.","You do need to put a lot of yourself out there at times, and while all the resources are there for you to succeed, you need to be proactive. Also the company has grown so significantly, it is taking on more of a corporate feel, but I think that's relatively normal as companies get bigger. They're ultimately still trying to keep the spark that they started with alive."
1191,Shopify,Low level Management,2018-05-08,3.0,Guru,"Great culture, love that it is considered one team ,  crusher of corporate egos. Rapid Growth, great group of like minded, fun people. Great benefits & perks.","Training was a little off as they did a huge hire, things were talked about before the courses were taken, mentors straight out of Guru land that had no idea what mentoring is. Mid management very green, seemed forced to push us to 3 chats which in this case is a end result of Merchants given the wrong advice as the time is not there to properly research the situations for inexperienced Guru’s. Just think over 100 new hires doing this. Short breaks only one 30 min break for a 8 hour shift for a company that considers itself a life balance kinda compan. Gurus need proper breaks at least 45 min to regroup & clear their heads as this is not an easy job. Very “merchant obsessed “ to the point where gurus have to put up with abusive merchants. I don’t think the Gurus get paid enough to put up with that."
1192,Shopify,Customer Success Guru,2018-05-06,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Work from home
- Benefits kick in immediately
- Everyone has been welcoming and kind 
- 3 weeks Vacation 
- Encourages growth and development 
- Room to move into other positions if you make it as a Guru","- Encourage you to work OT 
- Expect you to be able to manage 3 chats at the same time. This is very hard when merchants are asking complicated questions! It's incredibly stressful, even for guru's who have been doing this for over six months. I don't think we're providing the best possible customer service when doing this. 
- Wasn't told sales would be a big part of the role until two weeks into training... quotas are pretty unrealistic, and I find being constantly monitored exhausting as well. 
- Work/home life balance has been very tough. The allotted time for catching up on follow-up emails etc is not enough, so we end up working OT most days."
1193,Shopify,There isn't a better company you could work for,2018-05-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Autonomy, plenty of opportunities to grow, treated like adults, challenging, tons of people to learn from, tons of people who can learn from you, coaching and professional development. With the exception of the guru role (which has set hours)  you pretty much decide on your own schedule as long as you're getting the right things done and communicating with your team..  There is a senior leadership team who genuinely care for their people, D&I, and are supportive of their teams. Shopify is lucky to be led by our founder CEO Tobi who is engaged and friggen (tried to use another stronger word but profanities are discouraged) smart.  He's direct, pays attention, lifelong learner and just gets it.  Not a ton of process (still kind of figuring out what process is great and what is not), solid benefits, inclusive perks, equity even for people not in R&D (which is very rare). Shopify's mission to make commerce better for everyone is 100X better than selling ads or accidentally messing with democracy. Supporting /enabling/empowering entrepreneurship and democratizing commerce globally to allow for economic autonomy for many who otherwise couldn't achieve it is actually something you can get behind, be proud of and work towards longterm. If you want to get better at your craft,  be challenged, work hard, learn a ton, be treated like an adult, and probably get rich, you should  work here.","Leadership team is still developing leadership skills which can be frustrating at times, it's a fast paced high growth company so if you like a check list of things to do in a day you should be prepared to write that check list yourself. It's chaotic (con for some) and you have to be really good at knowing how to check out because the work is interesting and it's intense. Creating your healthy work life balance is important."

They really believe and respect you as a worker and you truly feel valued from day one. For many jobs in Ireland this work lifestyle is very hard to come by. Great hours, never forced overtime, flexibility (with notice), great communication and great room to grow and better yourself as a worker and as a person",Very little - Not all positions you might want are readily available that you can progress to and rarely communication can take sometime as you are dealing with people in different countries but these are minute in comparison to all the 'Pros' of the job.

- Lots of smart people work here, you can learn a lot about software development or design at Shopify. 
- Compassionate and supportive work environment that stimulates individual growth
- There are some people who work hard, but they are few in number.
- Top salary and benefits if you are fulltime. Catered lunches, snacks 24/7, yoga and meditation classes.","- Might be interesting checking the ""Rating Trends"" call to action at the top to see the low rating trend for the last few years.
- Mid-level leadership is pretty inexperienced. Unfortunately, lots of leads hide behind the ""empowering employees to take ownership"" idea to hide their lack of skills. Lots of people leads don't quite have the people skills to do that. 
It might be a symptom of fast growth. 
- Every team is different. If you end up on the wrong team, life can be really tough.
-  Sometimes is hard to do things because you don't know if your lead or your co-workers are WFH or they're on vacation. No one cares that much about the project they're working on."
1198,Shopify,Great remote workplace,2018-04-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's a huge company with plenty of opportunities, but despite the size, it still feels like a startup and has that same buzz. Management is great, and I'm able to self-manage with minimal micromanagement from my supervisor. The other people on my team are great to work with as well. The company also has a strong remote culture - unlike other companies where I've worked, I don't feel undervalued as a remote employee.

10/10, would recommend.","It's a huge company with a ton going on, so it's easy to feel like you're out of the loop or not making a big impact. Compensation also seems a bit low."

The people are amazing (not the managers or leadership) but the people hired to do specific roles. Very strong design and engineering organizations.,"The leadership at the director level and management is very inexperienced. I started with about ten people and half of them left Shopify or were let go within 10 months. There is no vision or structure for any specific areas and every week is different. Management makes you run in one direction one week and then completely changes the direction and people and makes you run in another direction. For a company that has such good reviews there is a lot of politics! Everyone but the key decision makers (who are not identified) are expected to keep quite and if you are not quite HR and management gets involved to tell you not to talk or share your ideas. Communication between management and people doing its work is at the worst. There are a lot of mental health issues and people visibly depleted, feeling undervalued and stressed. This is a good culture if you are someone that does just what you are told without questioning why things change every week and why you are constantly offboarding and onboarding people. Shopify used to be great but the high growth and restructuring is really killing the culture."

The benefits are great and the salary is not bad - although the guru role should definitely be paid more! While I realize it's an entry level job, it's very stressful dealing with merchants all day!","Shopify is obsessed with reaching targets and will push to the point of breaking with guru's. Burn out is quick. One 30 minute break in an 8 hour day is not enough. While they stress that personal life balance is important, it really isn't attainable, as most, if not all guru's are putting in extra time to finish their work. The end of day 30 minute personal queue where you are wrapping up your days' tickets is simply not long enough, and it's a stressful scramble to finish. Every day.  There is also an irritating juvenile environment - staff is young and it can feel like high school. Squad leads are young and pushy - there is a big competitive environment underlying all the teams. It's not healthy."

1209,Shopify,The opportunity of a lifetime,2018-03-23,5.0,Designer,"- Working on something that is actually being used by a lot of people. You really are making a difference. 
- The salary package (Benefits+Equity+Salary) is the best you can get in a Canadian company
- Tons of opportunities to learn. I find that whenever something isn't working well, I'm empowered to either change it or give the feedback to the right team. 
- What you hear from the leadership team is genuine. You know that they aren't trying to con employees. 
- Working at Shopify is basically a golden ticket for your career. 
- You're trusted by your lead and your team. 
- The CEO cares highly about the people, the product and the company. He has great opinions and is willing to retract when he learns he's wrong about something.","- The recent reorg has brought some challenges. While it makes sense for most people, some employees might find themselves a little bit forgotten. 
- The very fast growth of the company has caused some issues. Usually, these are fixed with time, but there's often an awkward moment where no one really knows what's happening. There should be a better change management process. It's not about being afraid of change, it's about making it easier for people to embrace it."
1210,Shopify,"Home-based ""Gurus"" (call centre rep): Horrible training, poor leadership, ageism, high stress, extreme workloads.",2018-03-22,1.0,Home-based Guru,"Benefits are good for what is essentially a home-based severely-micromanaged high-pressure call centre environment. Unfortunately, that is the only positive thing about this company. You'll likely need a free prescription to an antidepressant and the free EAP psychology sessions for working here. My advice: take the training money and cash in the perks early on... then run!","High stress. Fake-smiling supervisors and trainers who will turn on you at the drop of a hat.

- 4-letter words -- that Glassdoor will not allow me to list here, including the big one (!) -- run rampant in company materials and verbal trainings: this is amateurish and repugnant to any professional business person. The use of this word would be a huge HR issue -- up to and including firing -- in the vast majority of companies if it was uttered, let alone published internally or used by trainers and other veteran employees in recorded training sessions, especially in a customer-facing department. But this occurs everywhere and all the time at Shopify.  The Society for Human Resource Management reports that it it is disrespectful and  ""can lead to depression, stress, reduced morale, absenteeism, retention problems [and] reduced productivity [and can] damage the image of the organization.""

- Poor training with recently-out-of-high-school former ""Guru"" trainers with all-powerful bad attitudes (and potty mouths) who throw systems, materials and jargon at you without any review of tools and resources: just a bunch of URLs to copy into your browser while glossing over material and requiring trainees to find highly-technical answers on their own via numerous badly-organized and difficult-to-search systems (compared to 1 or 2 with excellent search capabilities at leading companies). The little documentation that is provided in on-line exercises is often impossible to understand due to misinformation, misdirection and jargon. You're essentially thrown into a deep swimming pool without instruction on being taught how to swim. Then they will put you in the dog house and rationalize their bad management if you even hint that something could be done better or say that something was not explained clearly.

- Non-divulgence of the actual expected work load during the interviewing process: 3 ongoing chats are needed (along with phone calls and emails), which is 50% higher than the norm in the industry (Amazon has a maximum of 2 chats, for example, which can be overwhelming at times... 3 is crazy and anti-productive, especially when you consider the highly technical subject matter usually involved). Pressure to upsell, even though sales was never part of the hiring conversation. At the mercy of many unhappy customers to award you (or likely not) an extremely high number of ""smilies"" or be punished for not achieving those metrics.

- There are many reports on complaint sites of merchants enduring extremely long hold times and their accounts getting cancelled and/or payments delayed without any reason given (which the company says it can do in their Terms of Service), so the entire operation is extremely understaffed and badly managed. (It says that it will bar some sellers that may reflect badly on Shopify's reputation, so why does it still indignantly host Breitbart News, which promotes US ultra-right nationalism and has links to white supremacists, even after Shopify lost staff over the issue and continues to get lots of negative press about it?)

- Your fellow trainees and workers will be mostly early 20-something former minimum-wage call centre and retail employees (which, I'm guessing, are the foundation for all the positive reviews here: they don't know any better compared to those of us over 35).

- You have just one week following training to get up to snuff (according to the company metrics) or potentially be thrown out. This includes handling 3 chats on Day One.

- It is essentially a company run by the Borg: you will enjoy being assimilated and won't ask any questions or you will be fired.

- Do yourself a favour and read the negative reviews which are, by and large, accurate."

1. age (heavy bias against those who are 30+)
2. race (visible minorities are few and far between
3. physical abilities (I have yet to see a single person with a physical disability)
4. thought (you’re forced to either drink the kool-aid or quit).  

What could be an exceptional work environment gets poisoned by the very worst of the stereotypes attributed to millennials (vast majority of the employees fall into this age group). Much of Shopify’s workforce are overly fragile, self absorbed,  lack basic interpersonal skills, and see opposing viewpoints as offensive. 

At Shopify, you will be given promotion opportunities that no other company would give you in a million years, which sounds great until you realize that that results in the majority of middle and senior management being unqualified in their roles, leaving those managers feeling highly insecure and grasping at straws for how to manage their teams. 

If you want sales people, hire sales people. Don’t hire customer service staff and tell them they won’t have to do sales, then make their entire performance rating based on their sales targets. You’re hiring the wrong skill sets and then blaming the employees for not succeeding.

Performance recognition is nearly non-existent."

1234,Shopify,Trained for 6 weeks and only been given a week to prove self after training,2017-11-01,3.0,Guru,"- The trainers, mentors and Guru builders are great/helpful. I had a very good experience with each one of them and training was fun.

- The benefits offered by this company is pretty amazing.

- Probably the most interesting town hall I've ever been to and I think the company's CEO is pretty awesome.

- Most people who works in this company are competitive but very supportive at the same time. 

- There are really pretty amazing people in this company who would take the time to help you, to explain to you, to educate you, and to support you no matter how busy they are.","- The training was quite intense as they try to cover so many things in a short period of time and at the same time you're getting bombarded with new features that you need to familiarize yourself with. 

- Managing 3 chats at a time can be overwhelming and stressful especially when you are expected to respond to the merchants every 2-3 minutes while digging/researching, chatting with your team and other support group asking for help - if this isn't met a week after being out of training, it is possible that you can get terminated.

- Working from home may sound like a great idea but with the expectations set (particularly for 3 chats), it can be challenging especially when you can't get a hold of internal support to be able to get back to the merchants immediately.

- Most Squad leads are very understanding, unfortunately mine was not. I was always reminded to up-sell (I've only been out of training for a week). I was only been given feedback for chat interactions, mostly criticizing at how slow I got back to the merchants (there's 3 support channels - email, chats, and phone). I was never given the motivation and support needed to improve - advice to Gurus, the moment you think there is something wrong with your Squad lead, reach out to  HR or someone higher to seek advice before it's too late. Advice to the management, please train your Squad lead thoroughly."

When I started years ago in the Guru role it was a lot more relaxed and I did love to work here (it wasn't a whole negative 2.5 years!) But Ieft due not even being able to log off a channel to use the bathroom without someone pinging me asking me where I am and why I'm not helping people if I'm gone longer then 2 mins. I dont need to be micromanaged to the bone. 

All of my friends who still work here have the same issues. Expectations that are sky high and the micromanagement runs wild. People in other positions love their jobs because this only happens to the Gurus. You're also not promoted with seniority if someone else happens to be ""a better fit for the culture"" when you have much more experience in the role. 

I've watched people who have had disagreements with how they're treated or what is being done being wrote up or fired. They tried to solve it by going to someone else to have them intervene and in retaliation the squad lead got them fired. 

I'm not here to be angry or bitter. I left months ago because of all this but I am here to be honest and let people know what they're getting into and what the role is like from someone who did it for years instead of being in another position saying sunshine and roses when they have no idea what's entailed.

Yes the perks are really good - totally - but if you cant stand being micromanaged or find yourself to be opinionated in any way don't take this job. It isn't for you."

All the members are supportive and so far squad leaders seem to have a good knowledge of the platform and are willing to give you a hand if you need it most of the time. 
Benefits are a big plus as you can expense many things to the company. 
I like the fact that all the people here have to go under the guru training and many high responsibility roles were gurus in the beginning.","The role is stressful and emotionally draining, specially when dealing with rude merchants or when you don't get the help you need during a live contact. Very fast path and a good bit of workload everyday, which frequently leads to staying overtime to finish your queue (a few extra hours per week, specially during the first months). This is accepted and reenforced (get s**t done, even if your shift is over). 
Only the lunch break (30 minutes) is scheduled. You can take small breaks after informing your squad and if the queues allow it. 
It seems that Ireland does not have many opportunities apart from being a guru. No multilingual roles despite being a company operating worldwide and having a multilingual customer base.

The managers and many people knew of this but did nothing to stop it. 

I feel like the company shouldn't be judged by a particular set of people and it's unfortunate that this is my out look on the company now as many people within shopify are amazing. The reason I feel like the company is to blame is due to the reason that managers were aware and did nothing to stop it.

Lots of intelligent and open individuals work here and they all seem to be genuinely committed to building the Shopify product and making it the best it can be.  Committed to inclusion in the workplace and making everyone feel comfortable at work so they are able to perform at their best.,Along with growth comes a sense of disconnectedness (I see it creeping-in) as opposed to a interconnected startup feel that they company started with.
1282,Shopify,Toxic work culture starts at the top.,2017-03-20,1.0,,"Benefits and the salary are probably one of the better things about working here. It's challenging no matter were you are and you won't get bored. As poorly as I think of this company, its culture, some of the many bad apples, and my experiences in its totality, it's a good product.","Support is treated as expendable and yet they make them jump through so many hoops in order to get the job (rightly so). They have a high turnover rate for a reason. There is no job security whatsoever.

If you have any disability (physical or mental), you are expendable. They really play up how they care about the mental health of employees but at the end of the day, it's a business - not a family. They will ask to part ways. It's an industry-wide issue. Unfortunately, Shopify is part of the problem.

If you have any life issues going on that are severely impacting your life circumstances (family death, illness etc.), you are expendable. 

Discrimination and racism is rampant and goes unaddressed. The ""diversity and inclusion"" in this company is like a hemorrhaging wound. They have some really hardworking and talented ""model minorities"" at the top but literally everything else there makes many minorities feel uncomfortable and shocked at what's openly shared and said.

There's a huge class divide between Support and everyone else in the company. It's apparent in the culture, in the summits, in how the company runs its everyday. 

Higher ups can't handle criticism and the CEO is a WHOLE. Other. Story.

But how this can be done without the necessary internal diversity, I have no clue. I hope I'm not being naive but I'm (grudgingly) optimistic that things will improve in the long term.

- Working here is mentally and emotionally draining. Your days drag on and there are more angry customers than nice ones. If you have to use the washroom (bear in mind, you're working from your own house), you have to let your entire squad know. 

- There is a Smiley rating system which they monitor like hawks. If you have a great interaction with a customer but the customer isn't happy with the platform, they can mark you with a frownie and that docks roughly 3 points from your percentage. If you're not averaging a 90% smiley rating at all time, then be prepared to pack up your desk. 

- They should really explain in the job description that you're also required to up-sell. You have a monthly goal to hit and it's definitely not something I was told at the beginning. 

- You're on a 6 month probationary period so no benefits kick in until then. 

- Your Squad Leads (aka Guru team managers) are less than qualified to manage. They promote the favourites, not those most qualified. They say that you're not allowed to be promoted until after your 6 month probationary period but many Gurus have been promoted within 4 months or less (recall the favourites comment?)

- The pay is definitely not enough for such a high-stress role."

- Benefits","- CEO often interjects into projects (and not just at an engineering level). So common it's called the ""Tobi Tornado"" because he'll kill projects and make decisions without context.
- He prefers to publicly ridicule people and teams on Slack. I've seen this happen several times in the past year alone.
- Total lack of trust and respect.
- Hard to find people that have stayed beyond 4 years due to stress and mismanagement.
- Not uncommon for people to go on sabbaticals for stress. It's so common they even have an internal support group for ""breaking"" people. The company thinks this is totally normal.
- Everything the company does has an ROI for the company, not the individuals.
- They think the culture is great because they have parties and free meals meanwhile there is a major diversity and empathy problem. Very ""sink or swim"" mentality. You need to ""figure it out"" if something is wrong. Don't expect help from anyone.
- If you prefer to work where you'll constantly be stressed out, and without support, in exchange for a cleaning person and free lunches, go for it."

Training and personal development is pretty thorough and there seems to be a lot of room for growth. If you enjoy working from home, this would be a great opportunity for you. You're given a pretty solid support network.

They also try to keep things fun and up beat. Keep in mind, it's a young crowd that works for this company.","Some things were a little misleading during training. The quotas are high and you're expected to reach them very quickly out of the gate. You basically hit the ground running (which can be good and bad). Managing 3 chats at a time can be quite stressful and overwhelming (even for seasoned gurus).

This job can be extremely isolating. Working from home works well for some but if you are a social person, you might find this quite difficult (the isolation and working the ""social life killing"" 12-8pm shift is what made me leave in the long run). So many people get burnt out by the 6 month mark that there's a name for it...It's called The Valley of Despair. Seriously, there's even a support group for it.

Overall great place to work with decent benefits. $19 an hour Canadian. Nice to work remotely too. It's a bit too glorified within the company as a ""super-role"" but in reality, it's just customer support. Definitely a good team behind Shopify, and I back the product 100%.

You can move up really easily if you stand out (which isn't hard to do). Not sure how it is now, but if you're pulling over 100 interactions a day, then you'll be up for a promotion in a few months. They reward hard work, I'll say that.","""Leads"" don't get paid much more than guru's get, and are expected to hustle hard for it.


Not going to say any names, but there's a few people who have been there since the beginning and are a bit too buddy-buddy with the higher ups. Long time people having not a lot of experience, but just been there since day 1, you get a lot of unprofessional behaviour. Expected in a fast growing company, but just a con in my eyes.

Unfortunately there are also many cliques.
Lots of problems aren't addressed in the right way, but for example through witch-hunts over Slack (the internal method of communication).

The longer I work here, the most I realize Shopify has a horrifying diversity issue. We live in one of the most culturally/ethnically rich and diverse countries in the world, yet for some reason - Shopify loves to hire predominantly white people. And it's extremely troubling. I feel more like a ""minority"" at Shopify then I do walking down the street. And before you can come up with a perfect PR answer, or flat out deny this, here is just one example:

I looked at the employees in one department and it was 301 white employees vs. 104 people of colour (only 3 of which are black, by the way). That's more than double. Going through all the departments, it appears that this is a recurring theme in almost every. single. department. How is this acceptable?

How do you expect and promote diversity, if your hiring team is so predominantly white? Whether subconscious, intentional or not - racial biases DO exist in the workforce, and a lot of people of colour miss out on opportunities as a result. 

How do you expect your employees to feel comfortable reaching out to HR for help, in the event they experience racial microaggressions, hear other employees saying racist things, when their are HARDLY any people of colour to turn to? I don't even feel confident in speaking up against the casual racism I hear, because I am literally surrounded by only white people who have no possible way of understanding the weight of what they say, and how harmful these things are. There are many instances where I don't feel comfortable going to HR or saying, ""this isn't right."""

I've been at the company for less than a year now but have had both friends and family notice a change in my own development. This place has taught me to act like an owner, take risks, and learn how to thrive outside of my comfort zone - while still being myself! I don't need to put on my work face, or a corporate persona when I walk in the doors. I also love that we have coaches internally as well - literally a team of people who are here to help you grow, and deal with stress, or even work through a problem.

* Shopify has a data-driven culture, and directions change quickly (and smoothly) based on data evidence","I can't really think of any downsides, except that as the company grows larger, there is bound to be a shift in culture.

I work from home but I still feel very involved with the active day-to-day culture and experience regardless of my location; and while the front-facing personailty of Shopify minght not intone so, a lot of seriously hard working people work here. Lots of different opportunities to diversify or focus my knowledge and progress either horizontally or vertically. Unique challenges every day.","I tried to think of a response to this, but I haven't really encountered any as of yet! I'm sure sometimes the stresses and challenges can feel more overwhelming, but you could face that in any job."
1384,Shopify,Customer Success Guru,2015-10-02,5.0,,"~ Company has very ""strange"" interview process - strange in a good way - the questions are not your standard ""What are 2 strengths & 2 weaknesses"" they are very different in their approach to hiring not just the right people for the job/position but the right people culture wise.

1385,Shopify,Work Somewhere Else.,2015-09-04,1.0,Guru (Remote),"The ability to work from home allows flexibility, and the pay scale is decent for a work from home position but the negatives far outweigh the positives. 

They provide you with the tools to do the job, computer etc.","1) Required to work off the clock. At the end of your shift you can be held on a chat or call with a customer for an undetermined amount of time, which means you cannot plan a life for after your shift is over without expecting the possibility to be late. You're told basically that it sucks to be you if you get a call late. Your options are to a) suck it up and do your job, or b) rush the client to try and get them off the phone faster. If you do that though you risk the negative feedback that will affect your scores and employment. The system is SUPPOSED to be set up to not allow you to work more than 40 hours in a week according to terms in the employment contract. However, that's obviously not the case, as if you go over each individual day you can still access the system and are required to conduct work as per your normal scheduled hours. So basically they are just not willing to ever pay you for more than 40 hours a week. Even though you may be working significantly more. But through loophole because they pay more than minimum wage they are legally allowed to require this working off the clock. Honestly, it's bs and shows a lack of care and respect for the employee. 

2) Squad Leads are... to put it simply, less than trained. There is a need to promote the right people within the company and that is not happening. My current SL disappears for large amounts of time during the shift and is non-responsive when I need assistance. He uses nothing but buzz words to try and motivate the team without actually giving sound advice or mentorship. 

3) There are perks to working for the company, but they mostly feel like they are there to distract you from the fact that other things are not there. They feel like they're meant to placate you from a bigger picture of what you're not getting. 

4) Advancement opportunities seem bleak. You really can only transfer from one team to another based basically on what you want to choose to specialize in. Or god forbid you become a Squad Lead. Many people want to be ""mentors"" and get the chance to do the listening in to your calls and what have you, but they are doing it in an effort to not have to work themselves. 

4) The mentality is very hipster. Which is trendy sure, but leaves a lot to be desired. They've grown too big too fast and are not properly managing the people they have. 

5) New features are rolled out awkwardly and do not allow for older merchants who have been with the company to access new features that new clients can. Which creates an unnecessary strain on you as an agent to answer why. 

6) Goals are given daily, weekly etc. That are hard to maintain. You can and will be penalized for not reaching and meeting these goals. The frustrating part is when you're being ""coached"" by an SL who really doesn't seem to be meeting the standards of what it takes to be an SL himself. 

There are more cons, but I feel like.. honestly that's enough. I'm currently seeking other employment and would rather take a pay cut than to continue working with this company. 

It should be noted. I'm good at the job. I just don't feel I am respected, treated fairly, or compensated fairly as an employee. So good or not, I won't continue and advise others against applying."
1386,Shopify,"Inclusive, Encouraging, and Rewarding",2015-09-01,5.0,Support,"Shopify is a phenomenal workplace. The standards that all employees place on themselves is high, with strong encouragement and resources in place to help you succeed in whatever you apply yourself to. They recognize high achievement quickly, promote from within, and listen to employee feedback and suggestions at all levels.

The culture at Shopify is like no other workplace I've ever experienced in 20 years working. The diversity, and openness of the entire company to its employees is a change that more companies can benefit from. From the outside, it might appear as immature at times (what other company has a go-kart track in its office) but I have never worked with more dedicated, industrious, caring and determined co-workers. 

I would highly recommend the job to anyone who has the drive to work hard in an environment that encourages growth both personally and professionally, and is willing to set new goals every single day.","Very few - at times, the remote employees might need to practice a bit of extra self-motivation to avoid distraction. But that's not really a reflection of the company in any way."
1387,Shopify,It's really hard to do better than this.,2015-08-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Surrounded by smart, talented, and motivated people.
- Autonomy to get your work done in the way that works for you (MOST of the time - see Cons).
- Great perks, benefits, catering.
- Transition from private to public company has been handled really well, with little to no impact on culture.","- Compensation isn't great (it pays the bills, but it isn't amazing)
- Aspects of management are becoming one-size-fits-all - from a team cohesion standpoint it makes sense, but I was promised flexibility if I was getting my work done, and it didn't quite play out like that in reality."
1388,Shopify,Best place I ever worked at!,2015-08-01,5.0,Design Intern,"The culture is amazing, all employees, even interns, feel really empowered to do great things. They really want us to develop to our full potential and there is a lot of focus on sharing and learning. They also trust everyone 100% and are absolutely transparent.","They empower and give us all the resources we need, but you still need a lot of self-confidence to take initiatives, ask for help and such. It might be a tad more difficult if you are an introvert at first, but people are so nice and helpful it goes away. The only problem might be when you approach Shopify for a job, you'll have to put yourself out there. An advice, don`t be scared to be yourself, as long as you are passionate and speak from the hearth. After all, Tobi our ceo says he is an introverted too!"
1389,Shopify,Not a job I would wish on my worst enemy.,2015-07-13,1.0,Customer Success Guru,The hourly rate they provide you is decent for the job and the coworkers are smart and fun people. That's about it.,"Guruland, as they call their call centre, is a disaster. The management team doesn't care for you as a person. They provide you with unrealistic metrics to attempt to achieve and will punish you if you don't. Having an opinion of anything that isn't obnoxiously positive is punishable. Want to give advice to the company to improve? Don't. They do NOT want to hear it. Promotions are given to favourites, and not to the most qualified candidates. The company does their best to prevent contract employees from qualifying for benefits, but dangle the option over you, taunting the unlikely. You will also work incredibly unflexible hours, and will work nearly every weekend and holiday. They also expect you to work overtime for free. This company isn't worth the stress on your life. Every year your work at Shopify is worth two off the end of your life. Just don't do it."

1394,Shopify,Great company with a fantastic culture,2015-02-17,5.0,Software Developer,"I was on the development team at Shopify -- and I looked forward to coming to work every day. I received fairly generous pay and benefits, and the work was interesting. But the thing I appreciated most was a manager that really cared about how I was doing, and gave me actionable feedback to help me improve. I felt like it was a great experience for developing my career. Among the other pluses are:

- Worked 8 hours a day for the most part; people didn't care when as long as I showed up to meetings and got my work done. I personally felt no pressure to work longer hours.
- Was never concerned with making money, only with delivering the best quality product
- Great emphasis on craftsmanship and quality of product, everyone was very dedicated to this goal
- An excellent CEO: technically skilled, visionary and inspiring. Tobi deserved to win CEO of the Year (Globe and Mail 2014)","It was sometimes difficult to communicate between teams, and sometimes the decision making process was a bit opaque (though upper management was remarkably transparent). Though developers are treated well, sales and support staff seemed get their jobs reduced to performance metrics (which are visible to everyone in the company) -- I don't know if I'd want to work in a job like that."
1395,Shopify,The closest thing to Silicon Valley in Canada (in a good way),2015-02-10,5.0,Software Developer,"Shopify is as close to a SV style company as you will find in Ottawa. There are a ton of perks. Healthy lunches are prepared daily by trained chefs in a professional kitchen. Cereals, snacks, soft drinks, coffee - there is no shortage of food. You even get bi-monthly cleaning service.

I work in the software development side of the business. There's ""no vacation policy"", but realistically, most people will take 3-4 weeks of vacation per year. Work hours are flexible; hours don't necessarily matter, what matters is getting your work done. That being said, I would estimate most people work around 40 hours a week.

Culture is first-class, with numerous company-wide events throughout the year. There are weekly town hall meetings (with beer!) on Fridays, and a monthly AMA (ask me anything) with the CEO. There is great emphasis placed on making employees as productive as possible. Developers are given the latest Apple hardware, and are encouraged to attend and speak at industry conferences.

The company is a rocket ship, and there are plenty of opportunities to grow your career.","You *can* get burnt out if you allow it to happen.

The company is very young (in age and spirit), and it may take some adjustment for those coming from traditional office environments."
1396,Shopify,Best place I've ever worked,2015-02-10,5.0,Software Developer,"Free food, free booze, flexible hours, friendly colleagues, interesting projects.","They're forcing me to write at least five words, but there's nothing bad about this place."
1397,Shopify,An unfortunately poisonous culture,2015-01-20,1.0,Software Developer,"Generous benefits, time off, travel ability.","There is definitely a culture of superiority, arrogance and we know something the rest of the world doesn't. What we do is not rocket science. But developers are overly valued as gods, and we forsake infrastructure, solid planning, resource management and responsible governance. It's easy to say we're successful because we have cash coming in the door, but what lies beneath the cash is actually a quite poorly managed and led company."

1409,Shopify,One of the best places to work as a software developer in Canada right now,2013-10-16,5.0,Software Developer,"I have been working in software for 10 years now. I know what's out there. Most of the places I have worked so far have been great. But every job up to this point has really been a stepping stone in a search for that job that ticks all the boxes. My search is over. If you are a software developer this is where you want to be.

- Full of top talent (in all departments, not just engineering) 
- Complete autonomy in your day to day work
- Top of the line hardware and tools to get your work done
- Freedom to take ownership of whatever you want
- Extremely flexible working hours
- Transparency beyond anything I have ever seen or heard of at any other company
- A shared desire to fix problems as they come up. Action is taken instead of procrastination and allowing the problem to grow and fester
- An engineering process that is so ""agile"" that we don't use stupid catch words to define it

As an engineer that really wants to be a part of something amazing, the points above make it pretty clear why Shopify is amazing. So what about everything else?

- Great salary
- Stock options
- Very different approach to bonuses (Meritocracy - some may like it, some might not)
- Pretty good health/dental package. I have seen better, but typically the bigger the company the better the benefits package.
- Breakfast bar and catered lunches
- Free drinks and snacks
- Beer tap and well stocked supply of bottled beer/cider 
- Bi-weekly maid service at home
- One paid conference trip per year (your choice), and additional conferences if you are a speaker
- Amazing office location and space
- Probably several other things I have forgotten because there are so many","The biggest con for me personally is Ottawa, where the company headquarters is located. Not the most interesting or lively city to live in.

I hate to not write anything bad, but I haven't had that many negative experiences to date. Every time I have found myself thinking there are things that could be done better, they are usually addressed quickly. Shopify is far from perfect. But the company is constantly making improvements across the board.

The bigger question will be how long the company can maintain this level of awesomeness as it grows. So far so good."
