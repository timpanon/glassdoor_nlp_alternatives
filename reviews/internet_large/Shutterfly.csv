0,Shutterfly,Lots of positive change,2022-04-08,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,New management is trying to right the ship.,There is a lot of legacy to overcome. Many senior engineers have left.
1,Shutterfly,A bureaucratic machine with bad company culture,2022-04-03,1.0,Software Developer,(Very) Slow software development processes leaves you lots and lots of free time to do stuff in your personal life unrelated to your job.,"Your brain will quickly deteriorate as you find yourself absorbed in a bureaucratic ""Borg"" where you are nothing but one (very) replaceable cogwheel in a very big inefficient machine.

Double digit of developers spend weeks and months on features that can be implemented by two experienced developers in a single sprint."

3,Shutterfly,keeps you guessing,2022-03-29,4.0,Seasonal Photographer,work life was easy and would recomend,system kept going down and lack of upper mangement support
4,Shutterfly,Great starter for career.,2022-03-24,3.0,Program Coordinator,I stuck around for many years and was able to grow but eventually like most of my colleagues figured management impediment in career advancements. They tend to bring a lot of outside talent for advanced careers instead of internally. Its a great company to get the name on your resume some experience and look for better paying job in a 2-3 yr plan.,long term isn't much of an option if you want career growth and a competitive salary.
5,Shutterfly,Great Company With Benefits,2022-03-21,5.0,Senior Software Engineer II,"Shutterfly is one of the great companies to work for. It offers good compensation. If you are a developer, you can learn various technologies in a short span of time. Learning is key to career growth. Shutterfly offers company-sponsored courses in LinkedIn Learning, Udemy, etc. Besides, Shutterfly has good benefits like employer matched 401K contribution, health insurance, free legal support if you need it,","Some employees feel health insurance can be better. 
No stock options."
6,Shutterfly,Product Manager,2022-03-21,3.0,Senior Product Manager,Nice company to work with,Not much growth opportunities at Shutterfly
7,Shutterfly,Love it,2022-03-19,5.0,Marketing,Shutterfly is a great company. No complaints at all. Management is transparent and works hard to share company direction and strategies.,None really very happy so far
8,Shutterfly,Used to be good but not any more,2022-03-17,1.0,Director of Engineering,"Reasonable salary
Health benefits are reasonable, though it used to be great.","Nonethical upper management,
A few 180-degree decisions by CTO, no consistency on the decision process.
A lot of the micromanagement process is getting pushed down with a lot of reviews
No full bonus for the last 3 years, but on your offer letter it is a full bonus."
9,Shutterfly,Shambles,2022-03-11,2.0,Employee,"Management doesn't hold any one accountable, so you can pretty much do what you like.","Management doesn't hold any one accountable, so you may have to pick up the slack of those that are either sucking up to senior management or just there to show face."

11,Shutterfly,Great,2022-03-09,5.0,Production Process Technician,Great benefits and treated fairly,Very strict clock in / clock out times (not flexible)
12,Shutterfly,Awful,2022-03-06,1.0,Photographer,Your commute to and from could count towards your scheduled hours which was good so you get paid a lil more. Plus you were given a gas card to pay for gas as often as you needed.,Horrible work environment. The shifts were always much longer than they needed to be. Communication was poor. It looks weeks just to get your work email set up. Employee badges took just as long to receive. The 200lbs of equipment you keep in your car to and from schools were constantly breaking and they rarely fixed them. The company essentially capped the pay for everyone at 15 an hour including senior photographers with 20 years at this company. As a school photographer our shifts were twice as long as a school day for no extra pay. Shifts ranged from 10-12 hours with no guaranteed breaks or lunch breaks. Maybe if they were paying 21$ or any semblance of a living wage if would be doable but it's awful.
13,Shutterfly,...,2022-03-05,3.0,Photographer,If you're a manager you get hours,You're overworked for little pay
14,Shutterfly,Good company,2022-03-04,3.0,Senior Software Quality Engineer,"Challenging projects

18,Shutterfly,Can be great,2022-02-24,3.0,Machine Operator,"Oportunities to learn lots of machines and keep busy most of the year.

Lunch room

(If you are in the right department on the right shift) communication is great.

Hard work is appreciated and rewarded (most the time)","Management would rather have one person working many peoples jobs and have 'voluntary' overtime during peak seasons because they couldn't get enough temps and the temps they do get just stand around doing nothing half the time. Or work so slow it's like they aren't there. 

They say yes you'll have oportunities to move around to other shifts and areas but if you know a machine no one likes to run your attemps to go to another area or shift are blocked most the time."
19,Shutterfly,Do more with less,2022-02-22,3.0,Manager,Job is ok. Down time is ok,Not worth the pay. Managers are beyond reasonable
20,Shutterfly,Leadership and culture is lost,2022-02-21,2.0,Director,"Great team executing the everyday, lots of opportunity for the transformation of the organization and business.",Leadership is constantly only focused on short-term growth and can't prioritize - everything is always important. Leadership is often distracted by new ideas like the metaverse/NFTs and loses focus on the core consumer product or experience. Company continues to cut resources/people but refuses to change process. CEO does not have skill set to lead a customer-first culture.
21,Shutterfly,Wanted to love this job,2022-02-21,3.0,Senior Product Manager,"I met some amazing people and made some great friends. I found a few leaders who had my back and truly tried to help.

There are some good ideas that will be amazing if they can find a way to pull them off.","-Trying to do more with less staff has created a culture of burnout
-Too many shifting priorities
-Salary and benefits are not competitive. They changed the tiers so most people who were in the middle tier are now at the top and can't get a raise without being promoted
-Many important roles are doled out to offshore which adds challenges"
22,Shutterfly,N/A,2022-02-17,3.0,Account Director,Product discount provided to employees.,Management support the the employees.
23,Shutterfly,Lots of resources to get comfortable in new job,2022-02-15,5.0,Account Manager,"I made a big job change from healthcare to come work at Shutterfly, and it has been a good transition. Shutterfly has so many resources to read and watch to learn about the company, the products and how to effectively do my job.","This is a time of transition for Shutterfly, acquiring Lifetouch who I work for, and a new software, so there are some kinks and duplications being worked out."
24,Shutterfly,People,2022-02-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Good people that want a true mission,Lack of Leadership and transparency
25,Shutterfly,Excellent Place to Work,2022-02-10,5.0,Director,Very supportive environment that has a strong focus on the Customer. rewarding high-performance is a focus for Shutterfly.,"The business is cyclical, so solid planning and execution are required in order to be ready for peak seasons."

- Above-average visibility
- Turnover provides solid opportunities for advancement, especially for more junior employees","- Aggressive targets set by PE ownership creates a seemingly desperate culture at times despite solid performance in the post-COVID macro environment 
- Significant turnover that started well before ""The Great Resignation"" has continually set back progress and hurt swork-life balance
- Lack of clarity on WFH"
36,Shutterfly,sales professional,2022-01-31,3.0,Sales Professional,love the people - great to work with,sometime the labs have issues that you have to deal with
37,Shutterfly,Enjoyed working for Shutterfly until the end,2022-01-31,2.0,Anonymous Employee,for the first 5 years Shutterfly was very interactive and interested in grow as a company as well as helping employees grow in their careers.,After the 5 years of r great growth and enthusiasm in the company the company changed and be came overly obsessed with with controlling growth. In the process they lost sight of the things they were really good at. The overall management changed and the personality of the company changed. Since then Shutterfly has not been the success they had been over the years and it is sad to see that. They were a great company to work for until then.
38,Shutterfly,Horrible,2022-01-29,1.0,Lifetouch Preschool Photographer,Absolutely none. None.Absolutely none. None.,"I can not believe such a big corporation like Shutterfly pays such low wages.

In my time with the company there have been a lot of changes - different CEOs, acquisitions, layoffs - but through that I've seen the characteristics of a company I'm super proud of. There is a strong vision of who we want to be and how to get there and it includes customer-focused strategy, but also strong DE&I Initiatives and a trend toward sustainability and responsible action. And no matter how large it is, it always feels like there's a seat at the table.","Change is always scary and there has been a lot of that. I think sometimes it makes you wonder how long the good times will last, and can build up some scar tissue when things don't go well. But I think that overall, the leadership team has found a way to start healing those scars and finding ways to make sure the change is more positive than negative."

The support is great, and there is good transparency from estaff. Love the recent focus on employee resource groups and diversity goals.","No paid parental leave, cannot max out 401K if you are a high income earner, and potential that in office days will be required.

Our CEO and executive leadership team participate in weekly Q&A sessions with the company and I've been impressed by the level of transparency and openness with employees. It's so appreciated and sets the tone for how we act and handle difficult conversations throughout the org. 

We're experiencing change and it can get messy, but people are trying hard to make things better and improve the company for our customers and for employees. If you're willing to navigate through the challenges of change, then you're in for a wonderful experience!","There are difficulties that come from change/transformation that can make it hard to be productive: lack of clarity in roles/responsibilities or decision-making; tension between the old and new ways of doing things; many new people onboarding, which can slow things down, etc. But over time, these challenges will fade away and those who are still around will have created a better, stronger organization."

Hired Amazon CEO that ripped apart the culture, what used to be one of trust and support became one of fear and finger pointing. Executives sitting around conference rooms afraid to speak up for fear of getting torn apart by the pedantic full-of-himself CEO was pathetic. Once he was walked out, another forgettable hire (5 months and Millions to pay him out) , followed by the current forgettable CEO. She's fine, but no experience leading a retail organization is clear in how she engages with the business. She also has brought in her team of eh talent. President is a narcissist who has no tolerance for details, Dilbert principal heavy at work here-wish he was more aware and engaged.He touts himself as a leader of teams and transformative work, but has no tolerance to do any of the actual work and pushes down to his minions with little oversight. The PE firm that has taken over will be the ruin of the company. Balloon debt payments have driven ridiculous cost cutting on already lean teams. Moving the teams to Minnesota when there is no actual cost savings for most roles feels like it will be the nail in the coffin for this company. So sad how quickly this has all played out."

•If you don’t learn ""fast enough"", they treat you that you are completely incompetent 
•Lack of direct communication and support from management

•If you ask too many questions about what you are learning, they assume right away that you aren’t getting the information provided and then you aren’t good enough for the job position
•Training coaches may not be very patient with you if you don’t get everything right and then they report you as a not smart enough trainee with management
•If you report a bug in the system, they don’t believe you and they assumed immediately that you are not doing your tasks in the right way

As customer service rep your job is to be very attentive to the customer"

299,Shutterfly,Sfly,2019-10-22,4.0,Shift Manager,Good place to work most days.,Life/Work balance was often an issue.
300,Shutterfly,"Pay was decent, but toxic culture",2019-10-17,2.0,Client Service Representative,"Was paid pretty well, fun on-site activities, great discounts and freebies on products, direct manager was wonderful","The leadership is not good. It’s a bit of a “good ol boys club” among the senior leadership team, especially on the commercial/business side- not sure how the retail side is run. 
Cross-functional teams struggle to work together; lots of pushback and lack of ownership which make it very difficult to appease clients. There seems to be  strong resistance to working together internally, rather you see people wanting to make themselves look good and shift responsibility. 
Major lack of processes in place... there are no P&P’s, no training, nothing seems to be standardized, it’s a scramble to get things done and clients are flat out lied to about what the company is capable of. I had issues with the ethical implications of the way things were presented to external clients. 
There is zero work-life balance during peak season. I was advised I was expected to be “on call” during the evenings and weekends and there was little care given to the fact that employees have families and personal lives. This is not a life or death industry; it’s print materials. 
Very high turn over, that is pretty telling."
301,Shutterfly,Decent company if you can avoid the layoffs,2019-10-02,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Company culture is better than other places I have worked. I truly enjoy the people I work with and the office is comfortable enough. I love my job and have always had fantastic managers.,"Unless you are high-level, the pay is not a live-able wage and the hours can be long depending on what your position is as well. If you're on the production floor expect 12 hour days and strict lunch schedules & rules. If you work here seasonally, there is a high chance that you WILL be let go come January. Be prepared for that - Shutterfly is a very seasonal company."
302,Shutterfly,Collaborative company but can feel stunted there,2019-09-30,3.0,Business Manager,"Colleagues generally have a good, can-do attitude; appealing company mission, good work life/balance, desire to evolve and improve the C/X","The desire to make Shutterfly a better product/service is frequently curtailed by pragmatic and basic fixes.
Managers are neither well trained nor held accountable on how to develop their people.  As a result, career development is sub-par vs other organizations."
303,Shutterfly,"STAY FAR AWAY, DO NOT ACCEPT OFFER, CONTRACTORS STAY AWAY!!",2019-09-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"In the beginning Shutterfly will treat you so well, they'll take you out to lunch make you feel apart of the time but that niceness does not last long
Free drinks / snacks (but every company has that, and at the end of the day it's just junk food and some fruit)","Where do I begin? Many people on different teams don't know what they are doing because Shutterfly continues to hire people who are unqualified for their jobs. And if you somehow end of being a person that knows what you're doing...you will feel out of place and realize how you're not paid enough working here.
-This company is going down, there's a high turnover rate and honestly I don't know how they've been running for so long.  They also are switching from public to private Apollo acquired Shutterfly and the deal will be finalized at the end of the year. 
-Work environment is toxic from the head down from HR itself down to the team you are own, pretty sure it's even bad at the very top. 
-People are fake they talk about you for no reason because they are miserable with their own lives. No one knows how to work together or to get along, you may need to do something but someone from another team will make your workflow difficult. Even if trying to communicate with them there's a lot of people in certain positions that have a BIG EGO that will just drive you insane.
-Lack of diversity, a lot of caucasian people work here—if you're a POC you will definitely be reminded that you are POC
-No growth opportunities 
-LOW pay compared to other companies
-Only interested in hiring contractors than full time employees (it's sad to see this is becoming such a NORM for the bay area and everywhere else in general)
-People in management don't have EXPERIENCE in management and yet are allowed to manage certain teams? Obviously there's issues here. Management can be very condescending, rude, for no reason at all
-*******AGEISM AT IT'S FINEST! If you are too young they will treat you like a baby. You will DEFINITELY encounter it if you choose to work here. People will treat you like you are incompetent 
-No work life balance, the traffic in the bay area is getting worse. I'm sure wherever you are coming from you will have to sit in traffic you will be so drained from the commute that you'll feel like you're going insane because you are so exhausted

Overall there are so many cons to Shutterfly from the career growth to the ageism. It is not healthy for anyone to work here. I will be looking forward to this company shutting down because they do not know what they are doing. Their competitors like Minted do a better job. Besides Shutterfly product isn't great and all of the employees currently working there are DEFINITELY aware of that and don't even love their own products. 

*WARNING!!!! CONTRACTORS STAY FAR AWAY, THEY WILL ONLY USE YOU FOR A MONTH (ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE QUARTER THAT THEY ARE IN) AND LET YOU GO—ANY CONTRACTOR POSITION WILL NEVER TURN INTO A FULL TIME POSITION. UNLESS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE FOR WORK, DO NOT WORK HERE*"

Discount on products.","Over the years, Shutterfly has lost its long term vision and putting the customer first, and focused too much on immediate, short-term gains, resulting in tech-debt and short-cutting on product development. This can make it frustrating as the issues pile up year after year, short cut after short cut."

Minimal Backfill - They haven't been backfilling all those that have left the company.

Mostly good co workers if your in customer service but not as much if your in production.",No room for advancement. They say you can advance but it’s extremely hard and it’s basically more about who you know instead of how good of a worker you are. Plus you have to be there for most of your life time before you can advance to a position you want. I was there 2 years as a temp employee until I finally got upgraded to permanent with benefits. Others have been there more than 3 years with no advancement to being a permanent employee. And we all do the same work it’s just based on who knows you and cares enough to try and get you promoted. And if your trying to upgrade to a different type of job you have to be a managers favorite before they will accept an application for consideration. They also lie a lot by saying they will promote you then it never happens and sometimes they fire you instead of keeping you in the same position.

Work life balance (unlimited PTO, work from home), flexible scheduling (based on your life), incredible benefits (RSUs for senior FT employees and above), competitive pay, and some of the best leadership I've ever seen. Transparency actually exists here, and so does teamwork. I have been here over a year and still love coming to work every day.","The HQ is in RWC and there are disconnects between that culture and the other facilities. Not necessarily a bad thing because that means other locations have the flexible of the Bay/Tech area culture, but can be hard to get ""noticed"" since execs are not around as much. Multiple departments have only one person who knows what is going on. Start cross training to make sure if such an employee did leave, it won't be detrimental to the organization."

422,Shutterfly,Untapped potential,2017-07-26,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some of the positives about Shutterfly are its culture, manageable hours and cross-functional collaboration.  Aggressive behavior is generally frowned upon (excl a few leaders), as most people assume a positive intent amongst their peers.
Decision making is based heavily on data, so the analytic capabilities are strong. Most people want to make a difference, even when feeling disenchanted about the ""must prioritize, that's for 2020, too little resources"" response.  And many consumers love Shutterfly, particularly our Holiday cards and photobooks, and think highly of the Ellen partnership.","The downsides of Shutterfly is the heavily matrixed environment which makes it feel bureaucratic and remote from the vision and/or concerns of the senior leadership.  HR does not have much voice, leadership or presence in the organization.  The Executive do not try to get to know people across the organization (putting a man on the moon mentality - everyone has a role).  And a few VPs seem to be weak managers, focused more on managing upwards vs empowering, championing and informing their teams.  And lastly, the company could benefit more from gut, insight mining and true innovation."

Nice new building.,"Shutterfly in Shakopee, MN does not care about the well being of their employees. I have seen people sick at their desks that they wouldn't allow to go home without threatening them with a point system that was completely unrealistic. More then 15 points and you are gone. If you're one minute late due to traffic or a family emergency you get a point. If you're sick you get three points a day. Pray you do not get the flu because you're out of luck if you're out for more then a few days. 
The funniest thing is they have this point system in place but it varies around the building. Customer care is very strict about it but in production it's barely a thing at all. So some temps come in super late and no one bats an eye at it. It really upset me when I heard that. Why was I sitting at my desk sick while people downstairs didn't have to stress about it at all. Seems very unfair.  
I had a lot of close friends in the company and heard so many horrible stories I cringe just thinking about them. If you get injured on the job you're screwed because you're blacklisted forever. They'll bully you out. Actually bullying is a huge part of the Shutterfly way it would seem. 
Mandatory overtime. Why Shutterfly thinks it's okay for people to work 72 hour weeks during the holiday season is just beyond us all. If you love the holidays and your family don't work at Shutterfly for the holidays. You will not be allowed to take any time off even if you give months notice. That's insane. 
Shutterfly also likes to dangle opportunities to hopeful employees to get them to dance like their puppet. I'd love to write a novel on this one alone calling out all the managers but honestly it's not even worth the time. 
In short if you're thinking about working for Shutterfly don't do it. There is other production companies out there that will treat you like a human being."

Innovation isn't in their lexicon.  Status quo is king, bottom line is queen.
Many decision makers have no business being in the positions they are in,  the few that do spend all their energy maneuvering around the others.  Many of them left in the 4-6 months following Housenbold's exit.
Those that you can learn a thing or two from are so overworked they are temporally incapable of teaching you.
Pay is stagnant.  So if you do decide to take a position there, negotiate hard.  'Raises' in my experience were half the Inflation rate... not kidding.

--Flexible hours
--Big brand that people recognize and respect","--There are MORE mediocre, very new (unskilled), or checked out engineers than talented (there has been a serious brain drain and management doesn't seem to care to retain good talent)
--The CFO has put in ridiculous policies (and doesn't seem to respect others...especially if you are a woman)  He is a joke.
--The new CEO doesn't seem to get what makes (or made) the company great.  Still too soon to tell if he will be good or not.
--HR is embarrassing.  They give out incorrect information and are generally incompetent
--There are more managers than engineers.  There are meetings packed through out the day with no one to actually do the work.
--The business doesn't have the gumption to make tough decisions.  Product doesn't speak with tech when making roadmap decisions.  Game changing tech work is cancelled to add more home decor products (because it will add 300K to the bottom line, but passing on investing in the code will cost far more in the long run)
--The constant promise to reinvent and move forward and then shifting gears to stay the course EVERY SINGLE YEAR is super depressing.
--Stock grants are slim to none.  Most employees don't get grants after their initial offer.
--Benefits have eroded over the years.  Health insurance policy is not great, no (never has been) 401K match, forced PTO, and corporate laptops are aging and not refreshed very often."

What is worse, your manager will be very reluctant to think of/implement any new technology/design/concept even using existing tools/stack !!! All your manager wants is to run business as usual, come to office at 10, leave at 5 and hammering same faulty system year after year.

It starts off really good and you feel like you found the best place in the world to work. You find out very quickly that you are wrong.","Management doesn't have a clue how to manage a team. They are downright rude to their employees and there is no warning when hours will change. One week you might work 40 hours, the next 30 hour or maybe even 50-60 hours. Who knows? 

If you're a temp you don't get treated like a person at all. You're just a machine. Management won't even talk to you. Some people have been temps for two years and it looks like they are never going to get hired on but they sure do make them hold on to the hope that it might happen soon. No benefits or raises for temps either. 

They treat their good people like trash. So many people have left because management has just been awful to them. And you can't move up unless you make Shutterfly your life. If you won't spend every possible second drinking the Shutterfly kool-aid then you have no hope of advancement. 

Zero to no training. Shutterfly's idea of training is showing you in 15 minutes how something works and saying okay you're an expert at it now. 

Mandatory time off. Basically after any major holiday you get an extra day off which would seem good but you don't get paid for it. As a temp you don't get paid for holidays and you don't get paid for the mandatory time off so you have to push yourself all week to work overtime to make up the hours lost."

- While the hours were flexible, I often found myself working nights and weekends to finish projects in within their unrealistic schedules and constantly shifting priorities.

-I feel like the company isn't doing well at the moment. Things like snacks were cut back, employees in all parts of the company are being forced to use their PTO days, the interim CEO said one of the core values of the company should be cutting costs. These all happened around the same time and seem like a red flag to me. I don't feel confident that the new CEO coming in will fix or change this.

- They have a hard time retaining good talent. There are some very smart and talented people in the company (and not just in engineering), but around the time I left many of those talented people were leaving as well, getting snatched up by other companies in the Bay Area. Cutting back perks, office location, mediocre compensation, etc all contribute to this. There are a lot of companies in the Bay Area trying to hire, and Shutterfly needs to stay competitive with them.

Some employees wait up to 3 years until they are converted to Shutterfly employee status. 
Contract means you can only get minimum federally required health benefits leading to very high deductibles. 
Have to obtain your own health coverage through other means to ensure a better deductible which in turn results in higher health insurance premiums. 
Contract also excludes you from all company functions outside of work (i.e. company picnic/most celebrations)

Electric car charging stations.

Herman Miller chairs.","Product organization has become a spineless group who serve at the mercy of the GMs. GMs are so involved in the day-to-day that business strategy becomes watered down to copying what the next closest competitor is doing.

In a GM versus PM cage match, GM wins every time. PM org is basically beat down and largely has no energy left to care.

Innovation does not mean the same as it does to the rest of Silicon Valley. At Shutterfly, innovation equates to ""copy what they are doing"" with a different page layout. 

So many people involved in decision making that what could be a great idea ends up being a mediocre middle ground because the teams are trying to satisfy everyone's feedback and opinions.

Though many will say it is a collaborative environment, there is an undercurrent of blame that ripples through the organization. Something goes wrong and there's a witch hunt that is positioned as a way to help us all do better.

No jerk policy - as far as I've seen, never has anybody been overly disrespectful, rude, or tyrannical to anybody. People are treated kindly and overall managers communicate very well with their subordinates. 

Q4 - as tough as it is, it's kind of thrilling and bonding as you're spending so much time with your co-workers (becomes like family) and knowing every day there's so much at stake makes you give it your all.","Unfortunately the culture that made this place so great seems to be fading. There is more of a work work work mentality being pushed on everybody, and it's getting more competitive and cutthroat. People are starting to feel very spread thin. Managers getting more political which is sad. 

Main cons are - for a company so into moms and families, our maternity leave benefits are quite lacking. Also,executive management is a boys club and lacks diversity. It's strange how out of touch old white men in suits are with the rest of the company.

Both of the Bay Area office locations are not really ideal, prepare for a tough commute no matter where you live.

The product is gorgeous and sells itself. Training happens often to keep everyone up to date. Facilities are nice with free coffee/soda, and coworkers are great people.","The contractor vs. full-time employee rift is the elephant in the room. Dangling the conversion carrot in front of contractors ruins team morale. It can take over a year to be converted, and conversion isn't guaranteed.

Hours are sporadic and typically range from 4 to 12 hour days with little notice. Sometimes you don’t know your shift until you show up. It’s common for a 4 hour day to turn into an 8 hour day over the lunch hour. Or the total reverse happens and you are sent home hours early. This is great for flexible people, but otherwise work/life balance is nonexistent.

Being a production designer is a glorified customer service role. You will call customers, leave voicemails, update shipping/billing information, change order quantities, etc.

For holiday it’s mandatory 12 hour shifts, 6 days a week for 2 weeks. You work most holidays and there’s no paid time off. Black-out dates last months at a time. Depending on your shift, you’ll work weekends."

They know less than many of the people that they are supposed to be managing. These people either hide at their desks breaking the rules or walk around attempting look like they ""know stuff."" Floor staff has to pretend to listen to what they say, but know better. Worse, once they achieve these levels of management, they can't be fired or demoted so it just gets worse because they move other people just like them into leadership with them. There are tons of people who are passed over or overlooked because this ""frat team"" moves people into leadership opportunities based on who they like, not how good someone is and what they contribute. Loyalty is not rewarded. Hard work is rewarded with lip service or temporary ""jobs."" During holiday people are moved into mock leadership positions. A lot of these people are better at helping and better at the position than the people who get to keep these titles after holiday. Complaints are ""heard"" but overlooked. When people finally have the courage to bring things to upper level management, those people are silently ousted and treated badly. This isn't isolated to one location either. In all honesty, I don't even think that most of the upper levels of management even know what's going on. Our new SWAT team is filled with the people who had some of the lowest service levels and worst attitudes on staff. These people are rude and entitled and often don't even do what they're supposed to do. Internal surveys are released asking for feedback but I know a ton of people who aren't honest because they fear retribution if it's discovered who sent the feedback. It actually makes me sad to write this because I used to have faith that these things weren't true."

I feel that the disconnect between the front end of the business and the back end is the largest con.  I know that new product offers are a key aspect to the business to stay relevant and maintain market leadership, but sometimes concepts for products are not fully vetted on how it will be produced before making the decision to pursue.

CEO has financial background and manages company accordingly: if results are good - they are hiring, if results are bad - they are firing. - this creates un healthy environment

Beautiful offices in Redwood City and Santa Clara. Free snacks and drinks.","Extremely political. All is managed by product management, just a few people deciding the direction and execution of the entire company.
There is no room for innovation. Developer ideas do not count, all is decided top-down.  Even engineering management has no voice. They just follow direct instructions from product management. People are constantly leaving due to this. Even trivial ideas can't ever come from the development team. 
This company is a retail company, that does not understand how to manage technology. Everything is about numbers, and measuring incremental (proven) revenue each initiative will bring. Forget about R&D.
This is not a company to work for if you love innovation and new stuff.
The company is restructuring itself and everything done is just refactoring of current code to unify the multiple platforms. Would not recommend this company to others."

639,Shutterfly,Worst company in the world,2014-12-05,1.0,Production Designer,Coworkers are awesome! They managed to hire awesome people.,"- Cold-blooded management level and CEO ignore the health of their employees during holiday peak season. We worked 70+ hours a week continously and they will lure the temporay employees to work hard by saying you'll have a chance to be hired as a permanent after that, but the permanent spots are extremely limited. Even if you turned permanent, they can let you go without notice when they don't need you in low season. 

- I got tendonitis and almost got carpel tunnel from working crazy hours non-stop on the computer (I worked as a production designer). My trainer had a brace on her wrist all the time and see doctors for that. Even a coworker from the sales department got issues with her wrist because of continous web chat with customers (not sure if that's carpel tunnel or what). I heard that she turned into a permanent but was disposed of when low season came. 

P.S. Because of the insane hours during peak season (10+ hours daily), employees only have a few hours to go home to sleep (maybe 4 hours?) and get back to work and won't have a chance to ""meet"" their families because of that. Scenes of families ""united"" on Sunday lunch breaks in the break room are still vivid in my memory.

P.S. 2 If you treasure your life and health, this is not a good place for you."

Between what the hiring manager told me in my phone screening, what my direct manager told me in my interview, and what job actually was, I felt extremely misled. It's like they tell you the job is one thing so you'll take it, and once they've sucked you in and you're actually in the office, they let you know what you'll actually be doing, which is way different from what they initially said.

Paid time off is decent, but if you call in sick you get demerits. Beware of this demerits system. It's absolutely ridiculous. Holidays are confusing and I'm still not clear what days are off and what days are overtime pay, and no one seems to be able to confirm those details with me."

Unofficial raises are what I call ones that get you more benefits without a formal promotion. Benefits in terms of salary, health benefits, stock options, 401k are comparable to good companies. The vision plan covers transition lenses for free, and dental plan covers braces for adults up to $1500. Perks include free snacks and free drinks at work, some form of gym.

Health Insurance benefits plans could be improved."

There are flexible working hours for people who have long commutes. There are snacks available. Product discounts, photography, and more.","- Micro managers are abundant and demoralizing. 
- Employees have no power over their own work, yet they are scapegoated. 

- People are often overloaded with work and unnecessary fire drills. 

- Panic and pressure understandably cause mistakes and shoddy work that gets people shamed, blamed and fired. 

- Management is top-down, highly political and there is little fair opportunity for growth.  

- People are rewarded for working long hours, not for working smart. 

- Favored individuals are rewarded openly but the rest of the teams contributions are largely ignored. 

- Can't always trust coworkers because folks operate out of fear."

Some have said there is a loss in confidence in engineering.  Projects have been rebooted several times and some failed to meet goals, deadlines or expectations.  The application core is very monolithic and has accumulated 10 years of code and testing, documentation, and process varies across the organization as a result so does quality.  Some improvements have been made to fix core problems and there is a slow march forward.  Meanwhile leadership is buying solutions that fill in strategic gaps."
