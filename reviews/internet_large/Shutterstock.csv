Very high turnover.

Low pay, poor work life balance.

The CEO is very arrogant. That spills into much of the leadership and ""ownership"" starts to become more about not having a personal life."

There is also a professional development budget if you wanted to take a course on your own.,"Constant change in leadership means constant change in vision and structure. Recent changes to the sales team structure in North America means there is little to no opportunity for sales roles past SMB if you are located outside NYC.

When I was there WFH was mandatory and no budget was allocated for supplies, nor were we allowed to borrow equipment from the office (even though it sat empty and unused), any equipment that was purchased could be deducted from the ""Wellness account"" which is meant for gym memberships etc - this is also a taxable benefit so even though you get reimbursed you have to pay income tax on it. 

AE base pay is lower than Toronto average. Historically comp plans and targets have changed throughout the fiscal year.

- Zero work/life balance. You will get bombarded with emails, gchat and slack messages way past work hours, on weekends and holidays, and you'll get in trouble if you don't respond. If your manager has no life, you won't either. 

- Zero job security. Culture of fear and stress. Everyone is constantly overworked, stressed, and wondering when it's their time to get fired. 

- Management does not care. You WILL be belittled, pushed around, and told how unimportant you are. You're just a cog in a corporate machine and management WILL throw you under the bus every chance they get.

29,Shutterstock,Steer clear,2021-10-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Non management colleagues are great.,"The company has changed dramatically in the last 2 years. The upward climbing stock price has not come without a cost. The business has become very very top heavy. For one job, there may be multiple directors, sr. directors and VPs - many of whom all come from the same handful of companies. The business direction changes every other day which feels less like a strategy and more like 'throwing spaghetti at a wall to see what sticks.' 

Non-management employees are constantly overworked and undermined which has resulted in multiple stress leaves and employee turn-over. 

Vocalizing concerns about mental health and/or burn-out is discouraged. 
Diversity and inclusion is not a core principle, especially for management. 

There is a significant misalignment between how the company operates and what it supposedly represents."

34,Shutterstock,Outstanding turn-around,2021-08-30,5.0,Enterprise Finance,A lot has happened since I joined 2.5 years ago. The company's return to growth stems from a renewed emphasis on culture IMO. The current leadership team is much more thoughtful and better at communicating a vision for the company with clear goals and strategies that support. There are numerous forums to ask questions and make your voice heard. These changes have gone a long way in boosting morale and employee engagement across business lines & functions. I have also noticed more investment in key disciplines like talent development & performance management. Everyone is taking employee engagement surveys much more seriously which is a great signal. I am really happy to be at Shutterstock during this time.,There used to be a list of cons but not anymore. The company has matured under Stan's leadership. There used to be a heavy meeting culture which has since been addressed and there are much fewer meeting which has translated into greater productivity and morale from what I have witnessed.

It's impossible to understand how company of this size & years can operate under system like this. Lack of framework & communications among the teams and functions.
There are sometimes ridiculous amount of competition and lack of transparency among the teams. There are countless times when we hear big changes after they happen and everyone goes ""what? this isn't said before there's the change?""
Critical things like the commission/ pay structure gets changed yearly and quite drastically. Oh and there is 0 benefit other than the pay (I worked in an Asian market, not the HQ)
The work is quite boring, there isn't much different challenges or area of influence an employee can have.

- Constant fire drills 
- Zero work culture: working at the ESB offices was actually quite nice, but post-pandemic company culture has deteriorated significantly. Workload and expectations increased, very few initiatives to address workers bordering on burnout, managers showed lack of sympathy towards employees while the pandemic was raging on. 
- No diversity: higher-ups make promises to increase diversity but continue to hire the same type of folks for c-suite or managerial roles. Very few people of color in management positions.
- Lack of collaboration between certain departments. One of the company principles is One Team, but there is little incentive for people to work together. Clearly some departments are also overworked and unhappy leading to little collaboration and uphill challenges to serve customers."

62,Shutterstock,Terrible experience,2021-05-26,1.0,Senior Engineer,"* Centrally located Irish office a few steps off Grafton street, a bit cramped however and not the best facilities (old building), large very noisy open plan office spaces (noise cancelling headphones are a must)
* Salaries on the higher end of the Irish IT job market
* Average RSUs and 10% bonus structure
* Good tech in Data teams – the latest and greatest Big Data/AI/ML tools mostly (however not so modern tech in other teams as there’s still quite a bit of legacy)
* Free snacks, drinks and all that stuff if you care
* Free lunche once a week
* Good and generally helpful local HR department making good efforts in organizing company events etc
* In general, good, knowledgeable engineers, but this depends very much on team and their managers","* Very stressful and high pressure environment, especially in DataEng, Infra and DataOps teams. The more senior the managers, the worse the attitude and disconnect they have from lower level employees.
* Look for warning signs during your interview – as with any other company, suggest to pay special attention to the managers interviewing you and their attitude, everything matters and can be very revealing of the team you end up working in. If you don't like it, go with your gut instinct rather than risking problems - being randomly fired and similar, as it happens A LOT here, you will get fired with almost no notice, receiving a pro-forma one-week performance improvement plan that will not even get reviewed properly as that is not the real problem. Suggest to start collecting evidence (unpaid on call duties and schedules violating Irish workplace laws, etc) if you notice things starting to go shady and borderline.
* Depending on the team, you might be happy, but overall, I'd say it's a dysfunctional, even toxic workplace for most teams here. Most of the positive reviews on Glassdoor come from managers, if you haven’t noticed already.
* Senior managers and directors mostly disconnected from teams they manage, offering no regular support but very high expectations. Lower level managers are probably experiencing quite a stressful environment here.
* No on-boarding process, lack of proper written documentation, a culture of secrecy even between team members, you might get one or two one-hour meetings during your onboarding period and that’s all - you’re expected to figure things out on your own and make friends with the right people. This is a place to write obfuscated code as nobody cares about proper written documentation and code comments.
* High pressure among employees (many on sponsored visas) causing them to compete against each other instead of supporting, helping and collaborating
* In some teams at least, a clear trend and preference towards employing offshore employees who are bound to the company by their sponsorship of their visas/work permits, so expect a lot of self-centered and competitive employees finding even the most minor flaws in your own work and making them disproportionately appear as large issues to leads and managers – political darwinian games a visa-bound employee needs to play along to survive.
* A bad work culture disregarding work life balance: overwork, ultra-competitiveness even among team members, if you complain about this (unpaid on-calls...) and offer reasonable improvement suggestions you WILL get fired.
* A clear visible trend of downsizing their USA based offices and re-hiring for the same roles in their expanding Dublin EU headquartered office, cutting on their workforce costs and probably availing of Ireland’s tax haven status (of course, other companies do this too). Clear focus on short-term share price only in the quarterly public company wide meetings. Lack of long term vision – CTOs changing every year. Hardcore capitalism at its finest, lack of any principles, unethical practices, complying with self-censorship where authoritarian countries request them to do so, and similar dubious practices.
* Note the same job adverts popping up every couple of months - this is a hire & fire place - you will be fired if you don't conform to their unreasonable expectations. Multiple team members I worked with that ever raised a slightest issue did get fired eventually. This is a place for yes-men only. Very unethical and unprofessional. I've never seen an IT company with such a high staff turnover.
* Completely unpaid and uncompensated on-calls, crazy schedules with sometimes up to 24 hours and 3 weeks per month of on-call duty per team member. Disorganised, unoptimised on-call paging setups triggering low priority alarms at night hours regularly. If you like to work for free and being woken up at 3am regularly, go for it. You will be given no holidays in lieu of the on calls. You might hope for a role promotion someday perhaps.
* If you’d like to work here and are willing to take the risk for a somewhat above-market average salary and benefits, suggest you to find and talk to an insider here first - ask them team about the team you’re applying for and their work culture to get the real picture, and pay attention during the interview process – ask the right questions. Otherwise, RUN AWAY!"
63,Shutterstock,"Amazing Benefits, Deteriorating Culture, Terrible Management, Limited Career Growth Potential",2021-05-25,2.0,Billing Operations Specialist,"Benefits are excellent, especially the extremely low-cost high-value medical plans (especially low costs for adding spouse/family). However, some benefits are trending worse. For example, when I started, 401k match was 50% unlimited with 100% vested from day 1. Now they've worsened that to a 2 year vesting schedule. Still very good, but not as good as before. Bet it won't be long before they start capping the match.

In office perks like lunch and breakfast provided 1 day a week and a breakroom stocked with a variety of free snacks and drinks are nice (although it's been since pre-covid when that perk was available). It'll be interesting to see what the future return to office life is like.

Company is successful, profitable, and seeing growth. Great growth during pandemic while so many others were hurting.","Culture is changing rapidly for the worse. Turning from a fun exciting company to just another cold corporate ""you're just another number"" company. Awesome talented people are leaving quickly as a result.

Management (at least in Finance, per my experience) lacks people management skills (at least in finance). They're all really knowledgeable about the weird illogical quirks of the company (and they seem to want to keep it that way), but there's ZERO real effort toward development of employees, no effort to cultivate a strong positive team atmosphere, and a complete lack of any fun personality or positive energy. It's really just a ""come in, do your work, collect a paycheck, and repeat"" mentality.

Tribal knowledge reigns king. Long-time employees dominate management and leadership roles, and as a result there are very few fresh ideas. It feels as though the long-timers prefer being the gatekeepers and holders of knowledge, and don't want changes or improvements that will render their knowledge useless.

This is a tech company that is actually actively moving AWAY from remote work rather than embracing it. If you value flexibility and ability to WFH, look elsewhere. Seems they're really focused only mainly hiring at HQ in NYC (at least for USA) and are expecting you to be in the office every day. This was the trend pre-covid and while it's of course been WFH since, it's going to go back to rigid, corporatized,  everyone in the office every day.

I've been at the company for 3 calendar years and each of those years they've changed to a different HSA company. Makes it very frustrating to have to migrate accounts every year, often creating a period of no access to your funds."

93,Shutterstock,"Deeply Dysfunctional, Regressive, Pseudo-Tech Company",2021-02-04,1.0,Engineering,Pay is relatively good in order to compensate for all the negatives,"At the executive level, it's the blind leading the blind. Recently installed exec team is largely composed of individuals hailing from ""legacy"" non-tech industries (who also have installed their own lackeys from prior employers in positions of authority, who have subsequently brought on their own lackeys) that are decidedly not tech-forward across dimensions of culture, transparency, respect for employees, gender/race promotion/pay equity, openness to dissenting opinions. What I mean by that is that these so-called leaders share the worst qualities that we all look to avoid: blatant authoritarianism intended to shield themselves from ""tough"" questions and to railroad through any harebrained scheme they come up with.

For example, at a recent all-hands meeting, the product org had the gall to state with a straight face: ""We have 4 weeks to figure this out! Well, 3 if you want to celebrate Christmas."" The thing that needed to be ""figured out"" was the fact that product had, for all intents and purposes, single-handedly decided that the Eng org would be restructured in accordance to their uninformed world-view of tech companies, by shuffling teams and transitioning to a ""squad"" model which they declared was not the Spotify model, which was subsequently refuted by the CTO as being ""loosely based"" on that model... 

The present CTO is solely concerned with his own ambitions and is the epitome of a ""yes man."" He is totally incapable of managing the org for which he is ostensibly responsible, but is absolutely superb in managing upwards and taking credit for any and all substantial work done by his org. On the other hand, when things go wrong, he's the first to point out the team/person in his org who was responsible. Since he only manages expectations upwards, he's unable to push back on ridiculous proposals that come from various parts of the company, but simply assents and pushes the work downstream with little to no meaningful communication about the rationale or purpose of such initiatives. 

The thrashing of product decisions, headcount, compensation happens on a quarterly basis. The exec team is so hyper-focused on pumping up the stock price as their sole measure of success (while fattening their wallets with overly-generous RSUs) that, almost without fail, before every quarterly earnings call, they will fire staff to create the superficial illusion of increased company performance. Initiatives will be canceled outright and those teams reassigned to the next shiny thing they hope will make them look good (which decision is completely divorced from providing actual customer value).

Unlike most companies, Shutterstock is trying to and succeeding in transforming from a tech company to a tech-enabled ""media"" company run by non-technical people from traditional publishing backgrounds. Whether the whack-a-mole ""strategy"" pays off is irrelevant since the work environment is toxic af and not tech- or people-focused.

Avoid at all costs."

There are no true leaders in the office, and the managers in place serve to only stifle and suppress any 'voices of dissent' (ie employees who care). All important decisions and outcomes are decided far away in New York, and Montreal is given the scraps off the proverbial table in terms of influence, rewards and general feeling of purpose. Talented individuals are hired, put in a corner and told to stay in line, receive extremely sub par management, are consistently refused promotions, and then eventually leave, or are unceremoniously laid off en masse.

The UX leadership was great and supportive. My colleagues were very pleasant to work with. The work life balance here was great and I enjoyed the little perks like summer Fridays. 

The pay isn't competitive for product design but had great 401K plans and a nice office. Working at the Empire State Building gets surreal sometimes if you are someone who has dreamt of working in the big apple.","What was actually depressing was the leadership. It's difficult working for a company and mission when you don't trust the leadership and you never feel like you're being supported. There was very little communication between leadership and employees. The work culture is very top down heavy so there were times when I had to drop everything and work on a random project or make sudden changes in decisions with very little context or transition. I've seen leadership fight in front of employees and make sudden random decisions. For instance, we were one day told that no one was allowed to WFH and several employees had to leave due to their circumstances. Or we'd see a big part of a department/org get let go. A lot of the decisions felt very meaningless and sudden to me and things were very chaotic. Not to mention that I've seen leadership change so many times in the time that I was there: 2 CEOs, 2 CTOs, 2 CFOs. It was also depressing to see the lack of diversity and talent in leadership. The future of a company doesn't seem bright when the leadership is uninspiring and mediocre. 

Which leads to my next point. There is 0 diversity in the work place. You probably have seen pictures on this platform even and noticed how there is no diversity. This isn't the greatest environment when there is very little room for diverse opinions and perspectives. How can one be foreword thinking and progressive if you aren't opened to diverse perspectives and people?

It's not to say that it is a difficult time for Shutterstock given that content is cheap unlike 10/20 years ago. Shutterstock failed to be progressive to make adaptive business decisions and now is going through some tough times. Not forgetting to mention that Covid19 doesn't help. Nonetheless, Covid19 just expedited the failure of a bad businesses and I hope Shutterstock can bounce back up."

Aside from work-related activities, Shutterstock allows us to participate in Tech Talks, Cultural Awareness Events, and join/participate in diversity groups. A lot of companies could care less about inclusion or development outside of the realm of work, but that's not the case when you work for Shutterstock.

Shutterstock has occasionally received negative feedback, and it boggles my mind quite a bit - especially considering the amount of growth and love that this company has to share. I want people to remember that at the end of the day, we are still a business and Leadership has to make tough calls to make sure that we can run within the green and expand our business.

Good benefits (stocks, bonuses, gym membership, medical insurance etc)
Decent pay","Toxic management
Management personel keeps changing and so does their thought process.
They set up a Editorial office in Dublin and closed the LA  office making several people redundant, now they have closed the Dublin office making 13 people redundant (hearing more to follow in the IT department) and re  opening the Los Angeles office and possibly New York.
Because of the redundancies they are  looking at automating a lot of editorial content, editorial photography is a creative industry where manual image selection and the editing of pictures/captions is necessary for quality control with the majority of contributors. They  seem hell bent on concentrating on red carpet events, thats a false economy even before Covid -19
They used to keep banging on about Editorial standards and quality. Looking at the websites the standards have went right out of the window but clearly nothing being done about it from management looking after standards.

Just over a year ago the editorial team in Los Angeles was made redundant and a team was set up in Dublin which management have now made redundant to set up a team in the US again! 

Editorial is losing serious money and the plan for the future is to focus on major red carpet events with company photographers while automating everything else. However editorial photography is a creative industry where manual image selection and the editing of pictures/captions is necessary for quality control with the majority of contributors. You can’t automate the creative arts. 

The current management team decisions are being driven by one employee who has their ear by highlighting colleague mistakes to throw them under the bus and make himself look good. He was rewarded with a promotion. I have no faith in the current leadership to turn things around especially given the current climate for editorial photography.

It also doesn’t help my opinion of Shutterstock that they support and foster censorship in China. In editorial one agency supplying pictures which are then syndicated by Shutterstock is basically the propaganda arm of the Chinese government.

195,Shutterstock,Apply Somewhere Else,2019-05-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,You will work with some very smart people at a non-management level that are solving problems for the future while trying to keep the wheels form falling off the bus.,"About those great people mentioned in the Pros section, they are handicapped by management that sows fear, uncertainty, and doubt among the employees. They are consistently thrown under the very bus they are trying to keep running. There is a toxicity here that is supported and even encouraged by management. Face time with management counts for more than actual ability to deliver real results.

The company has shown no ability to maintain any kind of continuity in senior leadership. In the time I was employed there was constant churn in the highest echelons of management. Many of the big plans envisioned by the leadership are multi-year efforts that are hard to accomplish without some kind of stability to guide them to completion. 

During my time at Shutterstock there was a steady cadence of removing employee benefits to the detriment of morale across the company. 
- PTO roll over was removed.
- PTO was changed to be granted and not earned. The company now only does this in states with a legal requirement to do so. 
- The Employee Stock Purchase Program was terminated. 
- After many years of allowing and fostering a remote friendly culture this was terminated and it became tough to even get management to consider hiring additional fully remote people."
196,Shutterstock,Shutterstock Custom: Stay far away from this dysfunctional workplace,2019-05-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are no positives to working at Shutterstock Custom. Attrition is extremely high, good employees are fleeing and the rest are scared for their jobs and will throw colleagues under the bus to protect themselves and their positions. This includes managers using subordinates as scapegoats for their own poor performance.","What you can expect working at Shutterstock Custom as a talented, competent new hire:

1. Is your performance stellar? Are you hitting your numbers and then some? Then expect your excellent results to earn a target on your back from your manager. Rather than ask ""How did you do it? We'd like you to teach everyone else to do what you're doing,"" prepare for managers to think you're cutting corners to hit your goals so easily and treat you as a pariah accordingly.

2.  Do you ask questions when you identify a possible weakness in the business? Shutterstock Custom is failing fast, and while everyone knows it no one will ever acknowledge it to be so. Asking ""Are we sure this is still the best way to handle this process?"" or ""What is the long-term plan?"" will instantly get you in your manager's bad books.

3. Do you set normal boundaries around your work, like not taking projects home at night or waiting until Monday to complete non-urgent tasks? Because managers are on 24/7, you are expected to be, too.  Leaving at 5? Prepare to be branded as a lazy lout regardless of your performance. Also, working from home and flex hours are not permitted without manager approval which is rarely given - beware of this fear-based work culture.

4. Are you getting positive attention from colleagues in other departments who love singing your praises? Closed a massive deal? A client sent you a gift because they love you? This is the exact moment your manager will go AWOL. At Shutterstock Custom, the one person you can never count on to praise your work - publicly or in private - is your manager.  Fearful managers see everyone around them as either predator or prey, and if your performance is excellent, be prepared to be labeled as predator and mistreated accordingly. The kind of managerial hostility to employees I witnessed at Shutterstock Custom is unlike anything I have ever had the misfortune to encounter professionally."

239,Shutterstock,Top NYC Tech Company,2018-08-16,5.0,Software Engineer III,"I don't even know how you ""review"" a 1,000+ person company. What I have found is each department is it's own experience and I've only experienced one first hand. The best I will be able to do is review the Tech department which is a large portion of those people.

The Tech org is full of amazing people I enjoy working with every day. We have many interdisciplinary teams each with a designer, product, tech lead, developers, and SDET. Yearly road maps for each team consist of executive plans and the best ideas from the teams building the features. These road maps have always allowed me the time and flexibility to work on and polish features and code cleanup I have wanted to do. Since developers can develop from anywhere I've had the privilege of working from home any day I need to which is very helpful with doctors or parenting tasks.

Shutterstock Tech is super duper remote friendly. Every meeting room has a TV with chrome box hooked up and every calendar event auto makes a google hangout/meet video link. It's just habit to join it and include whatever remote folk are in the meeting. This transfers greatly over to working from home as the habit are already in place to accommodate it. Remote folks are included in all tech events and meeting and swag is usually sent out in a timely manner.

Shutterstock has always had many amenities that I have enjoyed even as they change over time. From great fruit for breakfast and on tap cold brew to daily lunches and snacks and a facilities staff always looking for good suggestions for lunch menus. There is also money for team events and lunches as well as fun in office food surprised along the way. There is a robust donation matching platform which I really love. There is also a private balcony in the empire state building office and though it can be windy it’s an amazing place to have lunch on nice days.

The Shutterstock tech dept devs are always encouraged to find and solve issues around not only the tech stack but also the company. This has resulted in whiskey and tech talk sessions, open source hack meetups, multiple committees to improve different company functions, and lots of code fixes and cleanups all without it needing to be organized by upper management.

There are many opportunities to advance in the tech department. Many advance to manager and above while others become high proficient in areas of knowledge and advance though different engineering levels. There is also opportunity to switch teams and work on different stacks and many take advantage of that.","A 15 year old company has many tech stacks that have not kept up with the times. Though there are some amazing new tech stacks in the works some teams are stuck working a bit with new code and a bit with old code. Depending on how you like to develop this can be frustrating.

Because many teams are interdisciplinary it's very easy to get comfortable working just with your team which then makes cross organization projects seem bumpy as folk relearn how best to coordinate.

Shutterstock often feels like a startup. Small interdisciplinary teams feed that startup feel. But Shutterstock has 1,000+ employees spread all over the world and has 15 years of code and apis and interdependencies. While small start ups can take great ideas and new practices and lunch them quickly Shutterstock is not a small startup any more. This just means that a lot more has to be accounted for when advocating those great new ideas and how large changes can affect different parts of the business in ways you might not expect.

Certain teams work more with the older tech stack then others. My experience has been that certain devs enjoy the challenge of bending a older system to their will and other enjoy the new growth experience of a fresh tech stack. If you don't know which you like you might have a bad time when you find out which the team you are joining does more of.

As with many companies communication between upper upper management and on the ground employees can get lost. This often leads to hearing about a decision second hand and it seemly making no sense. ""Why would they do that?!"" a common response to hearing about weird decisions.  Though I have always found that once I track down the person in charge of the decision I do understand the roadblocks that exist and how the current decision was reached. Then even if I disagree with it the decision at least makes sense."
240,Shutterstock,Stay Away,2018-08-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free food, nice office and location","Horrible leadership, no transparency, constant layoffs, everyone is living in a state of constant anxiety when it comes to communicating honestly with management for fear of being fired.

The office itself is beautiful.  3 floors in the Empire State Building, which has to be one of the coolest places to say you work on Earth.  Beautifully designed and cared for, with tons of interesting and fun little spaces all over to hunker down and work or brainstorm with colleagues.  
Great benefits package.  My family was very happy with the health insurance offerings, the 401k, the fitness package, etc.  No complaints whatsoever with those offerings.
As many people have said - breakfast, lunch, snacks, drinks... given NYC's prices, having these things available and free every day really adds up and is incredibly convenient.
It's worth mentioning again... the people.  My team was incredible, and I miss them.  The caliber of talent, and the interesting and diverse personalities made for some of the most fun conversations I've ever had at a job.  
Management never holds a company-wide meeting without offering the floor to any question from any level of the org.  I found this very interesting, and often quite fun to watch people step up and ask tough questions.

They give the impression of having a great culture but its all just smoke and mirrors."
249,Shutterstock,Don't!,2018-07-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Because there's high turnover, you can get promoted quickly if you work in New York. Good for your CV.","1. Upper management doesn't care about it's people or its business. It ONLY cares about its short-term stock price movements. This is why we have to endure hiring freezes and a massive lack of resources every quarter despite having zero debt and $250M in cash.  

2. Org structure: The company changes its org structure every couple of years. Just before I started they had a GM structure in place, then moved away from it when I started, then switched back to it last year and now they are considering moving away from it again. The worst part, you can work in an office where no one in the office shares the same boss within the same department! They all report into management in NYC.  As a result, you don't feel like you're part of one big team.

2. Turnover at C-level: If you don't believe me, feel free to look it up. I've worked for the company for 2 years. Everyone in the C-suite except the CEO and the COO have been replaced at least once, if not twice during that time. Each time, a new C-level person comes in, including the CTOs we've had, they change everything which puts the company in constant state of migration (especially when it comes to tech). More on this below.

3. Turnover for general employees: For the reasons mentioned above, turnover in the organization is very high. This leads to huge problems, especially for developers because there is no one around who can explain how things are built. In 2017, they replaced all but 1 tech VP. 
 
4. Migrations: The company is in a constant state of tech migrations instead of actually creating something of value for its customers. They sign big SaaS deals with third party providers and then realize they don't want or need the service anymore. This is partially due to the high turnover. Essentially, the people who sign the deals don't stick around long enough to see the services being adopted within the company. When new people come in, they suggest we change services and the cycle starts all over again. All 400 developers are working on migrations as we speak.

Example: Front end platform: The company took 2 years to build a new platform for all of Shutterstock.com. It was completed in 2016. In January of 2017, a new CTO joins the company. He doesn't like the new platform, so he decides to scrap it and built another one. Well, 1.5 years later about 50 developers are still building it.

Example 2 Backend services: For roughly 5 years the company has been trying to migrate out of an old tech stack that literally no one knows how it's built. This migration continues and has blocked us from being able to innovate. 

More examples: The company has switched large scale CMSs at least 3 times in the last 2 years. Each one takes about 6 months to integrate.  In addition, the company has been migrating toward using Salesforce for roughly 4 years now with no end in sight (literally). Also, most of the companies web properties are in the process of being moved to AWS. I can continue but I think you get the picture. 

Bottom line: Trust the reviews on the Glassdoor. They are poor for a reason."

They need to in order to attract high end talent because the culture has gone downhill. It's become a company where the best performers feel they can be fired for no reason - every time there's a new Director, VP or C-level that gets hired they bring in their own people and fire prior employees. There's an insane amount of turnover at the top - actually at every level.

The company is super liberal. 

They even had Chuck Schumer come in to talk to the company at a Town hall before the 2016 presidential election. Then this year in a Town hall someone asked the CFO how the 'Trump tax cuts' were going to affect the company's finances, the CFO (who is actually pretty fantastic and has a great sense of humor) replied that we shall not use that word (Trump) in association with the positive effect the tax cuts have had on the company's tax liability. I list the pervasive liberal culture as a positive and has led to the company being extremely diverse in appearance, but with ZERO diversity of thought or diversity of political ideology. If you're a fan of a mindless group think liberal culture, and don't like to go against the grain, then this is the place for you.

Really fantastic office space.

Which is a big pro and helps the company sell the image of an open casual flourishing tech company culture. It's a good thing they have great office space because if they had typical cubical farm office space like an insurance broker they'd have some serious trouble hiring strong talent.","Lots of group think. Poor leaders across the board - most of the good ones have moved onto greener pastures. (with the exception of the CEO, CFO and the Denver and Montreal offices) Denver and Montreal in general have their own cultures and have a ton of talented people in those offices. (this review is mostly for NYC)

They're an image broker. Essentially the middle man of creative digital assets instead of say insurance. Not the sexiest product/business, but the tech stack being used is at least headed in the right direction."

The board doesn’t care what happens to the company, why should they when the ceo owns most of it? Does the CEO care? Nope, he’s already a billionaire and is CHECKED OUT. Okay.. does the management team care? Maybe, but they are INCOMPETENT. All of them are from slow growth old-school companies like Revlon cosmetics?? Seriously? Not exactly ex-google or apple pedigree. One person in particular is named Steven Berns: the cfo/coo, he has created a 27 step process for promoting a single person, no staplers are purchased, no offer letters signed, no one eats, breathes or THINKS without his ok. Hear that?? >>>No one thinks without his ok<<< Steven Berns giveth and Steven Berns taketh away. Blessed be the name, Steven Berns. Zero empowerment. American company? More like a Soviet company.

People under the age of 40 must* feel empowered to do their jobs. Shutterstock can’t empower their people because they DO NOT trust their people. Shutterstock only wants mindless pawns. Which is exactly what they have.

I have never in my career met a greater gathering such disenfranchised and simultaneously maliciously opportunistic people. Everyone who has bothered to stay at shutterstock exists to just take as much money from them as possible and run. No one cares; this place is toxic to millennials. Anyone in their 20s or 30s who really cares about their work has left long ago.

There are plenty of great companies to work for in the world, Shutterstock is dead. It will always be dead. No amount of praying at its grave will change that.

good work life balance","1. Management (disorganized and ever changing)
2. Poor Communication
3. Loss of benefits
4. Lack of support for Engineers (you get to be devops, infra, SRE, and a software developer!)

This is gonna get long. There are a large list of issues with the way this company is ran. The biggest, as most people have said, is management and communication. 

The issues with management stem from having a founder/CEO. Which trickles down to everything. The org has a new CTO almost every year and goes a long time without one. Every new CTO obviously redos everything. This causes an never ending shift in priorities. One day it'll be lets do feature X, scrape that, do feature Y or let's follow this strategy then they'll drop it midway through and pick up a new one. There is also a new head of product about every 1-2 years. There are good direct managers and teams though but the overall company is horribly managed. 

The communication problem is absurd. They'll fire swaths of people and no one will know why. They'll do it mid week for some reason. I've seen quite a few people clearing out their stuff midweek, can't they just wait until Friday? They take away benefits but bury them inside random emails. We used to be able to roll over 5 vacation days, that was taken away, buried deep in some benefits email. We used to have an employee stock purchase plan, that was taken away. In general when any of these things happen there is poor communication on why. I was in a meeting where a person was let go, they said they wanted to hire someone closer to the team (NYC) so they hired a person in India...not even kidding...they said that all in the same row of sentences.  The CTO has yelled at people in meetings as well.  Always odd how upper management can act in ways that other people would be fired for. 

If you've read this far you'll realize they are cutting back on a lot of benefits. Theres no real financial reason to, the company is very profitable. They got rid of 

1. Summer Fridays
2. ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan)
3. Rolling over vacation/Cashing out vacation days.
4. Massage Fridays
5.  Happy Hours for teams
6. Summer Party (used to be amazing, now cancelled with no communication)
7. Taking a date/spouse to the winter party 

The culture and mood really reflects these realities. It does not feel like a fun place to work and the general mood isn’t what it used to be. There was a time the company was actually fun to work for.

Lets get to the work aspect. You get work life balance. Projects are generally disorganized and planned poorly. Priorities change constantly. You’ll plan work for 3 weeks to have it scrapped for another project. I had been on probably 4 projects where this happened. Its hard to really care about anything you are doing. If you cannot do everything within the confines of your team it will not get done. Its nearly impossible to get anything done from another team unless a C-level forces it."

People get fired a few days before their stock vest or bonus. The firings are almost always a surprise because no proper performance feedback has ever been given. 

Most frequently, the firings happen because a new C level comes about and brings his or her whole team from a previous job and then let's go of the previous C level's hires. In the past three years, Shutterstock has had multiple departures - CIO, two CTOs, 1 CFO, 2 CPOs/Head of Product, 3 CMO/Head of marketing and 3 CHROs. The last two CHROs lasted 3 months and 9 months . Because of this constant turmoil at the C Level, there is a constant change in vision , or tech stack or migration or re-org happening. Company really can't get much done as a result and you end up just getting tossed around from team to team and then if your group's C level leaves and a new one comes about, you are probably going to get fired. 

If you are looking to go to Shutterstock, do yourself a favor and don't. As you'll see from the many reviews here, its an extremely unhappy place and you will most probably be mistreated. If you think it is a tech company, it is not. It used to be. But the current CTO and COO come from the likes of Revlon and Pearson that are not tech companies and have taken the tech back about five years. All innovation has come to a standstill."

284,Shutterstock,"Sad to go, best job I've ever had",2018-03-11,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"If you love engineering as an art itself this is a really great place to be.  The only reason that I am leaving is because the experience that I was provided here was so valuable that I got an offer with compensation so good that I could not refuse it from another place.

I have worked in many different environments before, agencies, corporate, small and large and this is by far the best job I have ever had.  

Starting with the best part, the people.  My co-workers are great engineers/designers/product folk and good friends and I will so miss them.  I've been able to learn from people at the top of their field and authors of major open source projects, people that I hope to be like someday.

Just as examples to demonstrate how close we were as a team/company: they have a video game room at the office and we would sometimes play together after work or play board games and we would always get lunch together (Shutterstock has free lunch btw).  It's challenging but I'd say they did a great job providing a quality experience to remote members of our team as well, they would be flown in for a week every few months, and we would sometimes set up times to play video games online together after work when they were remote.

I've had ideas for various technically challenging projects/features/applications that I've prototyped and ended up presenting directly to the CEO and/or the whole executive committee and had resources dedicated to them.  I know of winning company hackathon projects that have turn into real products with teams of developers dedicated to them.  The CEO himself has a strong computer science background and has had conversations with many co-workers about emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies (he may or may not have named his cat Satoshi :D).

I was interested in machine learning and they flew me to SF for a class they paid for and offered to have me flown to another office to pair with one of the company's top machine learning engineers for a week and I'm now listed on a pending patent related to machine learning.","I read some really harsh reviews on here and that's what made me think I for sure had to leave a review about my own experience.  I think some of these reviews made valid points, but I think the company has is doing its best to respond to direct and indirect feedback.  Running a public company is very hard, I don't envy the amount of pressure they must constantly be under.  What I can say is that I was given bar none intellectual and career growth opportunities and I had a blast, I will miss it dearly."

The truth is its a great place to work if you are young, want to say you work for a tech company, easily confuse perks (free lunch) with benefits (decent healthcare) and don't care about upward mobility. True, you will meet some good, smart people - however those people will quickly leave as anyone who spends more than a few months here realizes its a hot mess. SSTK once had a smart, dedicated president who cared about employees - he took time to get to know team members and to help build a strong culture.  That has all diminished thanks to the CFO turned COO and the CEO, both of whom have little regard for employees.","An emotional CEO who has challenging people skills at best, defers to the COO / CFO on all decisions. Problem being that the COO/CFO could care less about human capital so employee well-being is never factored into decision making. Since he joined the company there have been rounds of layoffs every year, firing dedicated employees without reason - usually just before their options vest. I've seen high achieving employees marched out of the office leaving those around speechless and frightened. The good thing about so many people leaving (or being fired) is there is always someone to blame when things go wrong.  This goes along with the me-first attitude exhibited by many - especially in management.

The C-level suite turns over every quarter. Smart, strong executives do not want to stick around this place, leading to disfunction with very little progress.  

It's a shame, what was once an exciting leader in the space is no longer."

I’ve had “better” jobs for lesser products and, for me, it’s really important that I actually like the thing I’m helping to sell. 

Ability to cut through the noise. People seem to complain that senior management isn’t listening but they appear to be to me. They just have made some hard decisions like letting people go at times that made others upset. Their job is not to make everyone happy but to run a business, and they seem to have their priorities in order. 

The facilities team is off the hook. I can’t believe people complain when there is free lunch every day, loaded fridges with fancy stuff in them, rotating snacks, vegan options, kombucho, cold brew, soy milk, almond milk yadda yadda. I don’t know what jobs other people had before but this is a pretty huge plus for me. My managers have been very understanding and helped me set career goals, have gotten out of my way to let me do my job the way I thought was best, and have been professional and fun to work with. I’ve been able to take initiative and show my team better ways to solve existing problems. There is a big sign above the stairwell with a quote by Grace Hopper “The most dangerous phrase in the language is, ‘We’ve always done it this way.’” Which means you can change things here (that’s not a guarantee it’ll be easy).","That same quote by Grace Hopper also reveals the uncertainty of working here.

328,Shutterstock,"Great People, Organizationally Challenged",2017-05-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The People:
The people at Shutterstock are its greatest strength. One of the company's values is to “attract top talent.” Attracting top talent isn’t the problem, it’s retaining them. You’ll have the privilege of working with an incredible group of people. They are smart, creative and collaborative - some of the best. This is consistent across teams and departments.","The Turnover:
You need to be comfortable with being uncomfortable; change is constant. If you’re not up for this, Shutterstock is not the place for you. Turnover is high. At all levels of the company. This causes frequent reorgs and a frustrating amount of organizational dysfunction.

The Culture is Toxic:
Instead of sticking to committed initiatives and empowering the people in place, fire drills are frequent and take precedence.

People are fired without cause or warning (at all levels). There’s an effort to improve communication around some of these decisions, but for too long it wasn’t, which left employees to gossip and speculate, leading to an underlying culture of anxiety and fear.

The Lack of Career Pathing:
In large part, this is reflective of an organization with high turnover and little to no documentation and/or institutional knowledge. Nor is it valued. Employees left behind spend a significant amount of energy navigating new management (it’s not uncommon to have multiple managers in a given year). Without clear, documented goals, career opportunities are inconsistent and subjective."

There are a number of very smart people here, though the list is shrinking by the day.
The kitchens are always stocked with food and drink, which come in handy when you're working a 60+ hour week.
As a global company, you may have opportunities to travel abroad, which will lead to the realization that you'll be much happier in a remote office.","Oh, where to begin...

First off, disregard the 5-star reviews you see. These were written by the ""People"" department to make the company seem less horrible, and to boost its rating.

If you enjoy having a life outside of work, this is not the place for you. Employees are often asked to meet impossible deadlines and work ridiculous schedules, usually due to terrible planning and inept leadership. Features are prioritized above all other work, and missing deadlines is about the worst thing you could possibly do in management's eyes. Thus, features are usually pushed without adequate (or any) testing, leading to extended outages and a severely crippled user experience. The company not only refuses to learn from such mistakes, but instead blames other departments and personnel who were just trying to do their best to keep the site up for these issues. Production outages are commonplace, lengthy, and generally involve tons of finger-pointing and shouting. Even if action plans are created during post-mortems, they're almost never followed.

As mentioned above, the kitchen is always stocked with snacks and drinks. This is useful, because the catered lunches have been known to cause severe gastric distress in those unfortunate enough to eat it. Meals clearly have been sitting for several hours since they were cooked, making several items dangerous to consume (shrimp immediately comes to mind), and that's assuming the food was properly cooked in the first place. Overall, the catered lunch is to be avoided, and many often order from one of the many restaurants in Midtown instead.

Preventing the company from having high uptimes is a massive pile of tech debt, the fixing of which is often prioritized out of existence. Several attempts have been made in splitting up the monolithic Perl app that runs the store into several smaller microservices; however, since no resource planning, performance measurements, or any other sort of proactive actions were taken by the developers, the microservices have only increased the number of single-points-of-failure. Compounding issues is a relatively-new directive that all new services *must* be written in NodeJS, and while this is a positive trend from the previous directive of ""you can write your code in any language you want"", the extremely-questionable choice of NodeJS was made by a small committee of developers, with no input from other teams in the company.

As such, development at Shutterstock is a nightmare of Lovecraftian proportions, which both developers and infrastructure being ill-equipped for the scale and challenges that need solving. Projects at Shutterstock used to be in pretty much every language under the sun (Java, Python, Perl, Ruby, NodeJS, and Go used to all be supported runtimes), so it's commonplace to be handed code in a language you're unfamiliar with. As a result, services are rewritten every time the assigned developers change (which is frequent, due to high turnover), and as a result, there are many instances where two or three microservices running to serve the same function.

The developers themselves are a mixed bag. As stated in Pros, there are some very smart people here, but they're sadly dwindling in number as the days go by. Instead of hiring experienced developers to replace them, managers instead hire very-inexperienced developers, often right out of college, or very inept developers, who actively make poor coding choices and lower the overall stability of the site further. Since these developers often function by pushing untested code into production with minimal test coverage, problems go undiscovered until they cause production problems, and only after several hours of looking at red herrings first.

The toxic nature of the culture at Shutterstock means that teams are rarely willing to work together, instead hoarding infrastructure resources and institutional knowledge in blind grabs for power and prestige. Shadow infrastructures are commonplace, only being discovered when they cause production outages or break in some other way that affects the developers who created them. At this point, the Infrastructure team is expected to support and fix these solutions, without being given either the manpower to do so, or the authority to remove these teams' abilities to create their shadow servers again. As a result, the infrastructure is in a constant state of flux, and a recent decision to move the entirety of the infrastructure to the cloud was both poorly-justified and badly-planned, and will lead to more outages in the future.

A lot of these faults and problems lie squarely at the feet of management, who have to be among the most inept group of executives I've ever worked for. Middle management is easily the worst, with good management is often coached out of the company, replaced by others who are too busy playing politics to manage effectively. There are way too many middle managers, and others are promoted to management positions without experience or a clear directive. As a result, managers often battle with one another over responsibilities and power, and burying each other in meetings is far more common than it should be. This directly affects morale and productivity, and engineers are often paralyzed into inaction for fear of making the wrong move and losing their jobs.

At the C-level, the poor performances continue. The CEO is a megalomaniac who micro-manages the site and the work teams are doing, often wasting tons of resources and time by refusing to allow more-qualified employees to handle the day-to-day operations. The tasks he sets are almost always impossible to complete on time, and he has no qualms about dismissing managers that he feels have failed him, even if the failures were due to his poor planning or lack of understanding of his own company's technical stack. This further increases stress and fear among the engineers as well. 

Overall, working at Shutterstock is a frustrating, unfulfilling experience, and there is almost certainly a better company in NYC that would make better use of your skills, and respect you more as a person. Avoid!"
331,Shutterstock,The Worst Is Far From Over...,2017-04-22,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The snacks and drinks that they stock the kitchens with are great.

You will encounter some genuinely smart people.

You will get the chance to work with a variety of software and hardware solutions.

The benefits are very good.","While the snacks and drinks are great, the free lunch is so terrible that it has actually raised some food safety concerns. The constituency was once polled to see if they wanted better food, but most of the employees who existed at the time seemed pretty satisfied with terrible products.

While you will encounter some smart people, you will only be able to learn about 10% of what they have to offer, as they will be too busy running around trying to satisfy the hideously unreasonable expectations and deadlines forced upon them by management.

While you will get to work with many different types of infrastructure, you'll never be able to call yourself an expert in any of them, as you'll only be able to utilize them in a superficial capacity. Some solutions will be brought in by highly overpaid contractors, who will then spend the next 18 months trying to fix 10 years of technical debt before searching for better opportunities elsewhere, others you will be able to use just enough to keep management happy, but never have the time to really learn in depth.

While the benefits are indeed quite good, the company will not hesitate to trim and alter them to save money, and will often fail to be up front about it.


The Management:

The CEO is a man of a singular personality who tries to promote the ""glamorous"" developer lifestyle while making terribly rash decisions that constantly change the direction for entire teams and always seeming to end up wasting their time, burning them out, and abusing tons of resources. He cares more about the public image of the company than the inner workings of the company itself. This means he won't notice major problems until several hours after they've occurred, and only when they cross his direct path. After that, all he will do is whine and complain to the people who have already been attempting to fix the situation, thus constantly adding to the problems instead of being a part of a solution.

He constantly searches and pushes for short term fixes, never possessing an ounce of patience for long, measured solutions that would actually solve ongoing problems. He instead will never plan for the future, and only react harshly to problems, forcing terrible fixes upon the company that constantly keep it chasing its own tail. 

The CFO has made many changes that have been felt across the entire company. I've worked at companies before where a new CFO will tighten the company's cash belt in an attempt to reduce fiscal losses, but Shutterstock is the only company I've ever worked for where the CFO will impose his own will and policies that will abruptly halt all progress and operations of entire departments, leaving them to just spin their wheels. He doesn't care at all about the work/life balance of his employees, constantly supporting the company's ridiculous deadlines that force support teams to work 10-12 hour shifts every day for long periods of time, and then not understanding how people get burnt out.

This is the same man who was also named the new COO because so few human beings can stand working closely with the CEO.

Under them are 30-40 VPs which is more than twice as many as there should be, and most of whom spend more time playing politics to keep their phony positions intact than addressing the company's ongoing issues.

Beneath them are a myriad of team managers, only some of which can actually perform that role. Most, unfortunately, have no business managing anyone as they have no desire or confidence to take on the additional responsibilities of a leader. They also have very few people skills, no regards for company policies, and detest working with other teams.


The Culture:

Half the people at Shutterstock exude a patented combination of entitlement and immaturity. They want to be granted whatever they want without them having to deliver a decent product. Since the CEO makes it very clear that developers can do no wrong, the devs constantly throw code at the wall to see what sticks, and have no desire to understand how their work performs in an actual production environment until it causes an outage. They have no regards for the company infrastructure, often building their own shadow environments with no reprimands or authority figures to stop them from wasting truckloads of company resources as well as the man-hours of the support teams they will inevitably come to in a panic once their haphazard applications implode.

The support teams at Shutterstock seem to integrate much better than the tech teams, in much the same way that soldiers on a battlefield will bond together to stem back the tide of mayhem. When you're in the trenches having to deal with the decade of technical debt that was produced by hordes of developers that were allowed to do whatever they wanted, you'll develop some lasting relationships. These support teams are all constantly burning out, leading to a tense working environment. This is only exaserbated by a mountain of turnover, so more and more of the people you work with are still ramping up and not at full potential. 

The company is, of course, aware of these cultural issues, and is constantly bringing in professionals to change it for the better, never realizing that company culture will always begin at the very top and trickle down, and won't change if the way the company is being run stays the same."

Thirdly, nobody cares about you. Everyone is in and looking out for themselves .

Honestly the benefits are the only reason I rated 2 stars instead of 1.","It's hard to pick a thing to start with on where the cons are at Shutterstock.  This is a company that's constantly in search for the magic solution that will save them and make them rich.

Not a single person in upper management with any ability to make decisions has ever worked with a high functioning, highly scaled web site.  That should be your big red flag right there.

They're completely incapable of investing in basic engineering fundamentals to power their platform more than one outage to the next.  Deadlines are quite literally randomly picked based on what upper management feels ""reasonable"" (despite what anyone below them claims how unreasonable with however much data to back it up).  As a lowly employee, don't even think about missing a deadline because they'll shame you and pile the work on afterwards.  You're better off launching a terrible broken product than delaying it even a day to do better testing / quality control.  Deadlines are the golden metric at Shutterstock - not quality.

The teams are partitioned and siloed, and there's absolutely no incentive to collaborate with other teams unless you're required to.  The engineers there are all in a race to guard themselves from the mistakes of the other engineers on other teams at the company.  There is zero ownership - teams are constantly throwing terrible code over the wall and then blaming them when it doesn't get launched.  In order to launch one product (or even just relaunch an existing page) you have to coordinate between a minimum of 3 different teams, all of which have their own projects that aren't necessarily aligned with your goals.  It's a constant mess of spending and acquiring political capital within the company just to do your basic job.

As for work-life balance, engineers are thrown on to on-call schedules immediately with no training, no overview of the infrastructure and no runbooks.  Pages can happen at any time and there's no desire to mitigate the pages waking engineers up in the middle of the night and on weekends.  The page qualifications are determined by managers that they deem ""reasonable"", with no data to back up those expectations.  To no one's surprise, managers are not the first, second, or third people being paged, as to not be inconvenienced themselves.

I could go on and on about any other of the numerous aspects that makes this an awful place to work ... because they really don't do anything right.  Save yourself the confusion, lack of direction and hostile work environment and go somewhere else."

For one thing, you should like it when management tells you what to do. Lots of command & control, and you should accept that. The directors and VPs who focus on people over deadlines get fired. Deadlines are the most important thing.

The CEO is also the company’s founder. He cares passionately about the company and his vision for it. Everybody is equal, in that he will get rid of anybody at any level (including C-level) who he thinks is in the way. Does that make everybody nervous about losing their jobs? Yes, so you should get used to it. If he doesn’t like you, you’re gone, because if someone disagrees and tells him that you should stay, they’re gone too. To give a different opinion is to be fired. Better to go along with what he says.

The CFO gives a lot of the talks you’d expect to hear from the CEO. That’s weird, but at least you understand what’s important to the company: money.

You should also be very self-directed in your career. You won’t get mentorship or guidance. Those people are gone. If you want to learn something new, take your own time to learn it. During working hours you should be doing things to help the company, not to grow your skills.

This is not a smiling company that looks after you; it’s a company that freaks out when something goes wrong and looks for people to blame and get rid of. But that may not be you, and you might be able to get promoted when someone you like leaves the company. If you get the politics right, you can climb the corporate ladder. If you get it wrong, there are other jobs, and you have plenty of company in people who were forced out."

- There is a revolving door in the C-suite.  It seems like there is always a new CMO/CIO/CTO/C-3PO/etc which results in very little and/or confusing executive accountability or leadership.
- The executive team/company seems to be run by a bullying CFO with equal parts of arrogance, willful ignorance and shouting (yes, this should sound familiar).  
- Technology is aging and increasingly challenged to keep up with the competition and capitalize on emerging/changing client need.  This is a shame as Shutterstock’s technology at one time was a true disrupter in this space.

If you join now, you'd be doing it for the salary, but it will come at a price. What is happening regarding office perks (i.e.: free lunch, pingpong table, sofas in the office, etc) is being mistaken for startup culture. What is being forgotten is that culture is something more intangible and needs fostering each end every day. But the senior leadership that has take over the management of the company does not have the sophistication to understand that, and what is even more scary, they don't want to try and learn. They have resorted to their old play book of Corporate America.

- the work is actually interesting, and as many people mentioned there is potential to make something amazing at Shutterstock, but in my opinion this will not happen as they have completely lost track of the vision for the company. There is no clear strategic plan for any of the products the company has and everything is a priority. So, it is rare that you can actually get yourself to a place of doing any real work (that is interesting), instead of attending endless meetings where one person bullies everyone to submission. 

- incredible turnover of employees leads to complete lost of know-how at this place. The people who are recognized as doing well at the company are those who do what they are told by senior leadership and never question it. Those who voice any opinions are quietly eliminated w/o notifying anyone on the team, and the work falls through the cracks. 

- I joined Shutterstock because I wanted to be part of a mature start-up that needs help growing in order to get to next level.

• The ""open office"" environment is very LOUD and finding a quiet spot to concentrate on work is extremely challenging (“pop-in” rooms have been taken over by executives). Overall this attributes to wasted time trying to get work done."

361,Shutterstock,Hitting some growing pains,2016-09-27,3.0,,"They make an effort at good company culture, there's a great perks, a beautiful office with terraces, a yoga room with classes, fitness reimbursements, and pretty good paid vacation. There's a very good crop of talent on the tech side of things. They know how to move fast, set goals, and stick to them. Everyone at Shutterstock is shockingly nice and helpful. There's not a big competitive side to Shutterstock, so I found that if I ever needed to reach out for help to someone, even outside my team or department, everyone would always be responsive. 

Even though Shutterstock has grown, they really do try to keep some kind of culture. It might not be the same as when it was a startup, but at least they try. I appreciated that. I also think that even though there were some growing pains and some low morale at one point, it was something that became out in the open. I saw an effort by management to openly admit that things aren't great and need to be fixed, then I started to see a little bit of movement towards that before I left.","I was there for four years, so my view is different from a lot of other employees. I saw Shutterstock during its biggest growth period and I saw it go public. Culture had sort of slowly been changing since we went public and then moved into the Empire State Building. It's a great office, but suddenly we were big, and you didn't know everyone anymore. In the 6 months to a year before I left early in 2016, there was a shift that seemed to happen. The business side of Shutterstock, or the non-tech departments seemed to really not grow well; it had bad management, low morale, and a CMO that was only there for three months. There was a period where execs dropped off like four at once or something. Then in late 2015 hiring stopped. And during all this time people are just quitting left and right, and a lot of them were key folks who had been around awhile. So everyone sort of knew that things weren't great. There were little things that felt weird like they wouldn't let us bring a +1 to the holiday party anymore. And they made the party december 18, which everyone took to mean that Shutterstock, in order to save cash, hoped people would be away traveling and maybe not RSVP. It used to be this big fantastic party that I looked so forward to. So now there was just a little bit of low morale and pessimism going on. 


Of course there's typical disorganization and mismanagement that can happen when a company grows fast. I think Shutterstock can get past this period if they do things right. Or maybe it's still kind of a mess. I don't know."
362,Shutterstock,short term focus and no employee involvement leads to high turnover,2016-08-24,1.0,,"What makes working at Shutterstock good are the people who work around you, toiling on the factory floor. I have made friends for life there.","The company is all about short term profit over long term sustainability. This means understaffing, ignoring necessary tech upgrades, no maintenance, no promotions, minimal salary increases, and this year they even cut back on health insurance. Each day you need to do more with less while the expectations and demands are higher. You might as well be working for Wallmart

You will have endless meetings about numbers, but none about product quality or necessary development. The result is a never ending string of barely functioning vanity products with no value other than to impress Wall Street and a revolving door of disappointed employees."

364,Shutterstock,An experience like nothing else,2016-08-01,5.0,Software Engineer III,"Shutterstock is one of the coolest places to be in NYC. It's office spans 2-floors of the Empire State Building and hands-down it was one of the nicest offices to work in (we had Prince William show up to our offices for a day while I worked there - really surreal.)

You'll notice three things when working at the company:
1) everyone around you is really smart,
2) everyone is willing to lend a helping hand; and
3) the company is super transparent about the inner workings/news within the company

The opportunities within Shutterstock are very flexible, you can grow in the direction you'd like and it's encouraged to seek outside classes that further enhance your education (they'll even pay for some of them.) I took public speaking courses and grew from more than just a developer to someone that was active within the Shutterstock culture by contributing Tech Talks and sitting in panels to discuss important architectural changes we were making.

We follow a mentality that anyone can contribute to anything, you just need to ask.

Shutterstock is switching to a larger Node.js ecosystem so if that's your thing, you'll have plenty of say in how things get done.

You'll find some of your closest friends and mentors within Shutterstock.","Upper management (C-level) has been shakey since I started but with each transition came in someone stronger than before. We also went through a brief period of transitions amongst developers to help focus on a larger migration effort. With the transitions, we expectedly haven't fully implemented some much-desired processes. We see progress made everyday, however.

We're a fast-growing company and with that is coming the expected growing pains. Our CTO set a clear path for developers which was lacking before and so far the changes have been outstanding; however, we still need more time to find our footing as a larger corporation that maintains the startup feel."
365,Shutterstock,Do your homework,2016-07-31,3.0,Software Engineer,"Pros:
- They are trying to reform the management of teams. They are currently trying an OKR process that google has. But the basic idea is to get everyone to get buy in to doing what the process prescribes, and shout that out from the rafters and make it difficult to flip flop later. They have done the buy in part well,  lets hope the rest works out, ‘cause everyone knows the employees want this.

- There are some good mentors if you can find the right team.
- The location to work is good, and they have a good system of showing progress across teams and keeping folks motivated with cool hackathons.","Cons:
A tech company that tries to aspire to be a great one but keeps falling down all the time For example, a very fickle ops team keeps a lot of things from taking off, tech debt is a big issue certain teams are all about just solving tech debt. Try getting a good feel for it if you are interviewing.
- As if CXO layer leaving was not a pain enough; the main issue is the continuous change of priorities from under your feet. You can be working on one thing today and have to drop everything and do something else. 

- There are extremes in this organization: Some teams have folks who really want to drive the
quality of their product through proper rigors of process, communication and effort. But what can you do when the larger things around you don’t work?  What do you do when tech debt piles up?
There is wayy too much attention to quality of code in some teams and quite poor in others. If you change teams after a few years you can find it hard to adjust

- What ever you want to do, web development (don’t even think), ops(go to google), search (go to Facebook). I say this ‘cause its not just that there is a company out there that does each one of these things better (of course there will always be); Its all the pretending to have the “efficient” standards of a large company and not implementing them correctly nearly as well. Is this a problem unique to SS? Of course not. But they have been trying to solve these issues for many years and they are still an embarrassingly long way away from getting close to the solutions that are simple. 
When you join a company as I did, after all the grueling days of research and the 3 phone session and 5 hour 1 day interview, and you *think* it has all awesome. Its only on the outside. Perhaps, I did not do my research well enough and I don’t know how to feel out people. Do yours before joining.

- The recruitment system is terrible. Dunno why they employ recruiters who are always pushy(to be fair thats their job). But why not hire more organically especially when you are in NY? One important thing: The foreign worker visa handling is abysmal, I have seen  colleagues suffer because of this."

367,Shutterstock,A great tech company where I learned the most,2016-07-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. ShutterStock is a great technology company.  While there are many other start-ups in NYC, ShutterStock is unique in that the CEO himself and the early employees were intimately familiar with technologies.  As a result, it is a great place for software developers.

2. ShutterStock has a lot of opportunities.  The company is still young and growing rapidly and there are so many opportunities within the company.  As long as you are driven and smart, you will be respected.  In many other companies, seniority counts a lot.  But in ShutterStock, talent and ability counts.

3. ShutterStock is fun.  While the company grew and changed over the years, the overall atmosphere has always been fun.  There are quite a lot of fun things to do, ping pong matches, company sponsored triathlon races, company parties, open mics.

4. Most people in ShutterStock are down to earth and try to do things for the company instead of their own benefits.  I found most people I worked with to be sincere and always looking at the bigger picture.  That in itself is liberating because even when people disagree sometimes it was because they care about the ultimate success of the company.","ShutterStock is still growing rapidly, you will be challenged and learn a lot, that in itself is not a con but it may not be for everybody."

- Pay / Bonus
- Office
- Perks
- There are still some great people to work with there","- In my opinion, getting close to the CEO/his initiatives means getting close to the door -- or at least an unpleasant work life

- In my opinion, too much of middle management is inexperienced, reactive and disempowered. Many are consumed by the task of managing expectations as opposed to their direct reports/teams. Many of these expectations stem from unrealistic promises prematurely made by individuals under pressure or seeking promotions

- Expect any tech company that has difficulty retaining tech talent and tech leadership to abandon associated tech initiatives pretty regularly

- In my opinion, many public displays of company values and culture are outdated or misleading. Much of the exciting recruitment footage and staff interviews are delivered almost exclusively by ex-employees

- In my opinion, the loudest, most critical voices are often impractical or out of touch. The pushiest of ""big company"" thinkers generally don't coordinate, plan or execute.  

- In my opinion, the most obvious, age old, meaningful challenges and opportunities still remain stagnant while initiatives that give the appearance of progress are aggressively staffed and encouraged

- In my opinion, too many hastily appointed, un-humbled new leaders were handed the cultural reins without caution. They influenced staff departures and later exited with little to no positive impact

- In my opinion, it has become difficult to justify a sense of urgency/intensity based on the work as opposed to deadlines/pressure"

Be prepared to have an entire group of new close friends. When I got the offer, it was BETTER than what I had discussed with management over the phone and during the interview process--I immediately accepted. Upon starting my new role things got even sweeter--the benefits are top notch at an affordable price, beverages and healthy snacks are provided in the office at all times, weekly team lunches, monthly massages, tons of vacation time, travel to some pretty neat places for work and an incredibly relaxed atmosphere!

Unfortunately the ones who didn't know were senior managers and did not help the company in any constructive way.  Most of the backbone of the eCommerce part was done in spite of higher managements' interferences. The company wouldn't have been as successful as it is/was unless a brave crew were working to put structure and making sure staff could concentrate on what they were good at, instead of going on wild goose chases at executives' whims.  This crew was in the end ""rewarded"" by all being demoralized and in the end fired. They were not seen as ""adding value"" to the organization in a concrete way.  Their manager was consistently more interested in playing with the ""cool kids"" instead of stand up for the department. Normally a manager is supposed to be supporting and build up his department into a leading force to be reckoned with within the company.  How the teams are being managed right now I have no clue but a majority of the original crew has left the company as top programmers/team-leads were put into pseudo-PM/Admin positions instead of being able to do what they are interested in and great at."

Some teams aren't as lucky, and have had a lot of instability in terms turnover and higher levels of stress. But many teams function very smoothly, have only very talented and smart A-players, never work nights or weekends, and have very little turnover.

Other reviewers have brought up the topic of long hours, but the NYC office is relatively emptyish before 10am and after 5:30pm. Everyone on my team works approximately 40- or maybe 45-hour weeks. There is a lot of flexibility in working from home, and that also helps when the work does start to become stressful.","- a lot of changes and turnover, which is both good bad, as new management tries to steer the company in a better direction in terms of process.

- lunch and snacks need to be better and more plentiful so that those of us who want to put in a extra hour or two don't have to leave the office to get food. This is a complaint I hear from almost everyone I dine with.

Nice office","The company is suffering from a lack of vision, leadership, and enthusiasm. It is a very draining and taxing environment due to this. The poor communication only exacerbates confusion and toxicity in the workplace. 

Work/Life Balance: It's very difficult to find people whom are not working on their time-off or weekends. There is a perception among some that folks might be lazy, it's quite the contrary and engineers devote a lot of personal time to the company for little or no reward.

Culture: If you're looking to work at a company with culture, this isn't one; that being said, given enough time, one may get fostered. The current culture is one of negativity and infighting with a general lack of distrust between engineering and management.

Management: There is a lot of new management that hasn't clicked yet. There are also a lot of new first time managers that the company has not setup for success, there was little or no prior training before those career changes happened. It would have been more helpful to have trained new managers before promoting them instead of afterwards.

It would appear that company cares more about how it's perceived from the outside than it actually cares about its employees, they've made tremendous strides in staffing up HR, however nothing has come to fruition yet internally to make things better, it's evident that these types of things take time to implement, some communication goes a long way."

Some cool folks work in the company. Office is nice looking. They get you whatever kind of work station setup you request.

Decent perks such as food (which is rarely filling), drinks, game room, massages, etc. Generous PTO is nice and reasonably priced health benefits. $750 towards fitness, tuition reimbursement, etc.

Working with ""creative"" is fun.","The machine has many weaknesses, and they are showing in horrible fashion. The tech stack is absolutely atrocious and was written in a cavalier fashion. There are no code standards. Node adoption is premature and poorly thought out. There is no tech leadership, and some of the newer ""leaders"" are weak at best and borderline incompetent at worst.

Product is sloppy at running the show. Most projects are stopped when 90% done, leaving a poor UX and bugs to be forgotten. The pipeline is rarely more than 2 weeks out, which is inefficient for a company of this size. Product takes far too heavy a precedent over fixing tech debt, leaving developers to deal with constant pain and ultimately slowing down product development. It's immature and unrefined.

A poor attitude is pervasive throughout tech and product, and it makes for a toxic workplace at times. Most of the best developers have left the company, which is a shame, because some of them were amazing and inspiring.

Both tech, product, and leadership set entirely new goals every two months, leaving everyone confused and accomplishing less than is possible."

There are amazing benefits, sure, but they only stand to detract from a culture of fear and will be slowly eroded as the austerity becomes deeper.  Career progression is almost impossible.  Working on weekends (keeping in mind we're already 9-6 and expected to stay much later) is seen as normal.  The only real concern appears to be the share price, which is currently dismal.  This has in turn began to lead to cost cutting:  Good people are being let go left, right and center for ridiculous reasons in order to save precious cents, yet the company still finds it appropriate to hand out expensive macs and ipads to every new starter.   The firing process is ruthless, and the company will manipulate facts to find cause to cut you when your number is up (somehow I have managed to avoid this so far).  Worse still, customers are beginning to suffer from aggressive sales practices.  Beware joining Inside Sales in particular, which I understand is cut throat, aggressive and generally awful.

It's also good to see some groups that were purely dysfunctional in the past really come around and be some of the top performing groups in the company now - thanks to some of the new leadership that was hired over the past 3 years.

Location & Perks - How many folks get to say that they work in the Empire State Building. The office is amazing, free lunches, bi-weekly tech happy hours, company happy hours, crazy company funded karaoke, front-end whiskey night...and the list goes on and on!!

Pay - The company is willing to compete with the likes of Google and Amazon for top talent. Great compensation package with very generous stock grants!!","The biggest con that you'll hear over and over again is growing pains. Lots of management changes and working in a very competitive market  of stock photos means that priorities keep consistently changing. Though I have to admit, while most of the engineers deal very well with this chaos, there are a few that tend to not deal very well with it as this is their first time seeing such chaos. If you have never worked for a fast growing company which is doing all that it can to become #1 in its space and are scared of chaos, Shutterstock is not for you. 

Many of the administrative services such as recruiting, HR have not scaled with the company."
443,Shutterstock,Opinion to Management,2015-03-09,1.0,,Free lunches daily to save money on expensive midtown prices,"not great with communication to employees, and if you voiced you opinion about something it would be looked at as an issue then you will be the outsider starting problems. Then they will find problems with you and get rid of you with some sort of political way to ensure you do not come back at them."
444,Shutterstock,"Super talented team, lots of business opportunity",2015-03-06,5.0,,"The best part of Shutterstock is the mix of smart, creative, and ambitious people.  Working with them, for me, was the highlight of the job.  They're an amazingly talented bunch, and I learned from them every day.  Within the engineering team, we always looked for smart people who got stuff done (a la Spolsky) who we wanted to work with.  Over the years, that has resulted in an awesome group of people.  There's an entrepreneurial spirit throughout the company that makes coming to work a lot of fun.

From a business point of view, Shutterstock is pretty fascinating.  It disrupted an industry (the microstock photo industry) years ago, and is now fending off competitors from all sides.  But that makes it a pretty exciting place to work.  It has a technological edge over all the players in its space, which sometimes makes it feel like you're racing a Lamborghini against a Yugo -- but that can pretty fun.

The New York office is amazing (in the Empire State Building), and the company has all the perks of a modern dot-com -- free lunch, yoga, massages (I miss those...), etc.","Shutterstock has grown quickly over the past few years.  It still has a number of people who cherish the small community feel of a startup and who are a little frustrated by the size.  That, alas, is the price of success.  At 500+ people, it's hard for Shutterstock to still feel like a startup.  But I think anyone who has worked at bigger companies will be pleasantly surprised by Shutterstock's energy.  It might not be a startup, but it's also not resting on its laurels.

The other cons revolve around that same issue -- fast growth means temporary management gaps, communication breakdowns, and an increase in hierarchy.  But most of the people are committed to continuous improvement, so the bigger problems are usually short-lived."
445,Shutterstock,Perfect fit for me,2015-03-05,5.0,New York,"1) Casual office environment where folks are encouraged to be themselves
2) Creative flexibility afforded in the workflow to achieve department/company goals (i.e. no mandatory instruction manuals)
3) Open door policy goes so far as even all exec's sit among the rest of the employees (and engage in conversation often)
4) Co-workers are brilliant. We've got a lot of very smart, alternative thinking people here. The creativity seen is truly amazing.
5) Management team is top-notch and is trusted to handle the stresses of being a profitable public company while still ensuring our focus is on customers and contributors. Obviously there are challenges in pleasing everyone (internally and externally) but I think they do a fantastic job.
6) For those of us who have been with the company for a few years, we have had the opportunity to live through what it means to create an industry leader (the good and the bad, but all great experience)
7) With such growth, opportunities to get involved in other functional areas is almost a given (cross departmental interaction is encouraged, though often times it is only accomplished through being proactive).
8) I feel a sense of ownership in what I do on a daily basis and enjoy coming to work every day.","Most of the cons (in my opinion) are centered around the challenges of growth and global expansion, especially as a public company. It's not easy, can get frustrating at times and requires strong work ethic/patience. The truth is that many of us are experiencing this for the first time (don't have all the answers) and it's easier for many to complain about the lack of leadership than it is for them to roll up their sleeves and be part of the solution. This negative energy is not enjoyable.  Other than this, I feel that communication across departments in an effort to achieve common goals can be improved."
446,Shutterstock,Enthusiastic Tech Department but Serious Growing Pains,2015-02-13,2.0,Software Engineer,"I worked in the Tech department so I can only speak to that part of the company. Overall, people are really friendly and excited to work here. The engineers participate in quarterly Code Rages and one annual Hackathon. Remote employees are regularly flown out for these events. The office is beautiful and has lots of natural light. There are lots of little rooms around the office to escape to, like the library and the yoga room, as well as 2 different game rooms. Overall benefits, pay, and time off are very competitive. In the past, tech folks had a lot of influence on driving technology decisions. This is an environment that has traditionally been supportive of creativity and innovatoin.","The biggest con is the lack of career development. When you come into a role in the tech department, it's very difficult to evolve into any role other than what you were hired for without a lot of advocacy from the right people. There's just no process for things like team rotations and it's easy to come into a role and just stay there for years. The review and bonus policy is also pretty much non-existent, so expect the salary you come in with to be the salary you leave with.

There's been a huge culture shift as the company has gone public. Someone decided to hire a bunch of ex-Amazon middle-managers into lead executive roles who have brought Amazon attitudes with them like developers are cogs to be kept in line, and everyone working here should feel privileged to work for the company (and that should be benefit enough). I actually heard the phrase ""we need to estimate this in terms of man months"" in a developer planning meeting.. in 2015. New policies that are in stark contrast to the culture of the company are transforming what was once a friendly, non-hierarchical, creative playground into an Office Space nightmare.

In the past 6 months in particular I've seen a huge decrease in work-life balance with execs mandating that Tech staff come to work earlier in the morning and leave later in the evening, expecting 9-10 hour work days. There is no formal on-call policy, so it varies by team if you need to come in and work a regular work day if you got paged at 3am the night before. If your boss requires it of you, there is no recourse, they just got a few extra hours out of you for free. They have no compensation policy for using your own mobile phone for work in the event you are on call.

From a technology stance, development is basically Hackathon/Code Rage 24-7. If someone whips together a Hackathon project and everyone likes it, expect it to be in production within a month... without proper vetting, auditing, and testing. Technology decisions are made by ""ooh shiny"" rather than by real needs assessment. The company is moving towards a services architecture and slowly breaking down the monolithic web application. Unfortunately it's a total wild west and the new management is seeking to tame it by creating draconian policies inspired by the whatever tech management self help book they last read."

Good work/life balance","Everyone is not treated equal. The culture is not what it used to be. Management (tech & product) lack in leadership, guidance, and people skills. It seems like people are viewed as ""tools"", and not human beings. There isn't much team building, instead, they create an atmosphere of competition among each other, which affects morale. Management does not provide much support with personal growth, which leads to uncertainty of your future. There is no transparency, and conversations are not straight forward."
