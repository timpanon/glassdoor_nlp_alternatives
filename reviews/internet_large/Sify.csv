This has in fact earned them a dubious distinction amongst their existing  customers as the account managers keep changing at random
The M.D of the company has a demeanor of typical flagellating  ""Lala""
Others in the higher management are typical arm chair managers making sure their benches are warmed on a daily basis.
The HR department is a sick joke with a couple of robotic clowns in operation
Order logging process is a circus in itself the start of which typically involves constant coaxing with words of embellishment to COPS team followed by a bunch of nonsensical approvals from ""wise people"",  a time and energy expending exercise which one ought to enjoy indulging in,
Orders are typically executed with ""much deliberation"" (pun intended) involving a lead time of 6 months - 1 year 
 
Meaningless team meetings with a regressive, degenerative, counter-productive attitude of team leads and top management involving (but not limited to) harassment using abusive language, embarrassment, contempt breeding, maligning of character, undermining etc

Over that, the company asked all the members in deputation, in the foreign nation (who had already settled with family) to return back to india on a very short notice. We were told that the project will last for 3 years but didnot last for a year. There is no long-term vision in the company.

Also, a software engineer is responsible for requirement gathering, designing the prototype, creating all kinds of documents, coding, client meetings, deployment, providing training and printing the whole lot of documents and sending it to the client. So you have to be multitasking. 

Do ask about in-hand salary before joining as CTC may look handsome but you may end up getting an in-hand salary less than what you were getting in your previous organisation. 

When leaving the company, the HR and managers may threaten you that they will blacklist you in NASSCOM if you leave the company on false pretenses. Don't be afraid, they won't do something like that. This is done for scaring the employees so that they don't leave the company.

5. No cab facility, no conveyance, no snacks... Nothing.
6. and, lastly but worse..sometimes they (sr.Colleagues) use vulgar and very offensive languages."

If you are smart enough you can learn many things and gain knowledge of you find a perfect mentor for you in the company other wise you have to learn yourself,"there are many and i cant say it all. first of all no training is given.Very bad decision making in higher management. It is good to treat customers with priority and extra privilege but employees are forced to support customers with privileged services which they are not supposed to get. Also there are no proper policy followed for any thing. If there is any problem only the higher management will look in to proper rules and policies to blame the employees otherwise if there is any issue with the management the employees will be ordered to forget it. Also the employees are forced to do extra hours even if they are not supposed to do. They were looked upon strangely if an employee leaves work at the end of the shift. These were some of the cons of many,

PS: Glass door team. The above review is not my single personal opinion. all the employees experience the same except a privileged few who are close to the higher management.
