0,Signpost ,Worn out pretty quick,2022-04-07,3.0,Sales Representative,"Young company with a lot of potential
Great training and a great way to start your career
Commission was decent","Base pay
Hard product to sell
Call 80-100 people a day"
1,Signpost ,Great Place to Learn Sales,2022-03-14,5.0,Sales Associate,"Helpful management, fun remote environment, clearly stated expectations, autonomy to structure your day.",Sales is a game of highs and lows.
2,Signpost ,I wouldn't take it.,2022-02-21,1.0,Sales Associate,Make your own schedule. Monday -Friday,Cold calling all day. They give you 6 weeks to make a sale if you don't make it you are fired. You're calling voicemails all day. People hang up in your face constantly. You're basically a telemarketer. And there's no method to success.
3,Signpost ,"Great, Communicative Team That GSD",2022-02-01,5.0,Senior Partner Marketing Manager,"Small company feel. Everyone works remotely so the culture is very communicative. People are authentic and there isn't a lot of politics or ego as we're all striving to figure things out and bring innovation to the company. While the company has been around for awhile, it feels like a start-up, so the world is your oyster! Competitive pay and unlimited PTO.",The company has gone through a rough period in the past in terms of relevancy and product development so it can be a challenge to shake off the old image when dealing with partners. With a complete new executive leadership team and backing from high tech investors- being part of the Georgian Group is making a huge difference.
4,Signpost ,Exciting new product releases + Management is amazing,2022-02-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- I came into the business about a year ago, and I've been impressed and encouraged by my boss over and over. There is complete transparency and I've grown to trust the senior team.

- Honest, number-backed reviews. If you do a good job, treat others well and work hard, they have your back.

- New vision, products, and sales processes recently rolled out that are being well received by our customer base. It is a very exciting time and I'm pumped to be a part of what happens next.

- Talented leadership, especially in my department.",None that I have experienced yet.
5,Signpost ,Great atmosphere,2022-01-28,5.0,Sales Representative,The people and the culture are some of my favorite parts about Signpost. We've made some major changes to the company and the product in the last few months and I'm excited to see us grow more because of it. If you want to start your career in sales they have an amazing training program.,I'd say the base pay is a bit low but commission can make up for it.
6,Signpost ,COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!,2022-01-27,5.0,Support Worker,"I could not be happier ever since Signpost merged with Securus. Such an amazing group to work with and I am so proud to be apart of this company. Everyone is always willing to help others and upper management always makes sure you feel heard, valued and they truly care about you! I look forward to continuing to grow with this company and cheers to many more years to come here!",Nothing! I appreciate this company more than words can describe.
7,Signpost ,"10/10 Respect, Motivation, Opportunity",2022-01-27,5.0,Marketing,"I've worked for quite a few companies in the past decade, in both start-up and government environments. I can say that this is by far the best company I have worked for in terms of having a team that has a high level of respect for one another and a great sense of community. That is a hard thing to achieve in a remote work setting. 
To summarize the best things about Signpost, in my opinion: 
- The leadership team clearly defines their direction and goals, while being open and willing to listen and adapt 
- Signpost does a great job motivating individuals without immense pressure or undue stress
- There is a great opportunity to learn and grow without a sense of overstepping.","It's not perfect, but I think the fact that people are respectful and willing to listen and learn makes all the potential cons seem manageable and fleeting."
8,Signpost ,love,2022-01-21,5.0,Sales Associate,I love working here couldn't ask for a better job,love it here. nothing i would change.
9,Signpost ,Hounding on the calls,2022-01-19,1.0,Sales Representative,Benefits were decent. Good communication for the most part.,"If you're in the business of cold calling, this job is for you. But realize: cold calling over 100 times a day is brutalllllll. You'll get thousands of no's. And it's not fun. And you won't get to a point where you're finding success for several months."
10,Signpost ,Turning around,2021-12-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Signopst is building focusing on serving a specific customer profile, rather than selling to whoever will pick up the phone. The company has a transparent CEO and leadership. The product has more new features than ever before.",The type of employee the company needs today doesn't always match the employee profile of past years. Some team members are resistant to change and unaware of what's happening in the market. It's not the right place for everyone.
11,Signpost ,Full speed ahead,2021-12-08,5.0,Executive,"Over the last 1.5 years, Signpost has been fundamentally transformed. New leaders, new products, new go-to-market approach. We're starting to see results starting with much better client retention, employee statisfaction and higher sales productivity. Because there is more opportunity now, I think it's a better place to work","--There are great people here: who I only get to see over Zoom. I'd love to be back in the office full time to get to enjoy these people more. It's hard to understand what's going in everyone's day-to-day without those informal meetings that happen in an office.

-- Not enough time: it's a big job and sometimes things don't move fast enough."
12,Signpost ,"Not what you know, who you know",2021-12-07,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"Most of the people are great, amazing, compassionate, trustworthy","Interview pitch is down to an art and captures the true essence of the interviewee's hopes and dreams but the reality is the exact opposite. Hostile work environment. Distrust with management and executives due to recent behavior on their part and lack of respect for employees and employees leaving. Very childish behavior and communication from management that has lead to a lot of talk around the office. Most recent rumor is one manager is calling employees and asking if they are ""hearing anything bad about them"". Things are not good. Corruption runs deep, it's not what you know, it's who you know."
13,Signpost ,Poor Work Culture and Toxic Management,2021-12-06,1.0,Customer Support Manager,"There are so many incredible people at Signpost with easily recognizable potential and talent who work hard with the tools and resources they have. The majority of employees are respectful, supportive, and a joy to work with. Most departments are eager to work more effectively together and drive positive change for both internal operations and to provide a better customer experience.","In my opinion there's very short-sighted and unsupportive leadership at Signpost, but the Customer Success department suffers particularly from poor leadership. Although they attempt to convey a sense of considerate long-term vision, every 3-6 months there's a major change that doesn't align with the previous vision that they sell. Despite many assurances from executives that they're cracking the code on how to sell better and provide a better product to consumers, those results never materialize. Soon you'll hear about a new acquisition or product direction that may directly contradict previous decisions that were fervently sold to the company only 6-12 months before.

I also believe that hiring decisions made in the last 8-12 months for CS leadership had nepotistic motivations and were made against the recommendations of numerous other senior employees. Those decisions have led to a toxic and hostile work environment where disagreement is met with immature personal attacks. Senior CS leadership refuses to seriously address issues no matter how many multiple complaints are made about the same employees time and time again. Unfortunately executive leadership refuses to take action to address concerns related to poor organization, or aggressive, hostile, and inappropriate behavior towards other colleagues. I have serious concerns about the future of the CS department (and company vision at large) as long as action isn't taken to address ongoing and systemic issues with their leadership. They said repeatedly (for months), that things will improve, but instead those issues have festered and pose much more problems now than they did before.

Lastly, there's a lot of lip service paid to employees about their value that quickly disappears when you express concern about the company and product's vision even when bringing solutions to the table. Months spent trying to address toxic management issues may not result in any changes. Even if someone provides two-weeks notice in order to transition their role, they can exercise the right  to terminate an employee early. In such an event, one may never receive a single communication or any outreach from either a senior manager or executive leadership to express any appreciation for one's time at the company. They may only take take the time to reach out after you leave a public review. Signpost is really good at telling you what you want to hear, but after 10 years as a start-up is struggling to create any unique and powerful value for their target audience (or any potential customers). If it works for you as an employee or a customer, it's a coincidence and not a reproducible trend.

I also have serious concerns about agent receptionists at the company who report poor working conditions including but not limited to: no breaks between calls, no bathroom breaks without supervisor approval, no PTO until after their first year of work, and feeling unheard, unseen, and uncared for because those problems continue to persist."
14,Signpost ,Good Company,2021-11-23,4.0,Senior Associate,Vibrant Office with great people,Sales based atmosphere. Must hit sales figures.

17,Signpost ,high pressure,2021-09-20,1.0,Local Sales Representative,- teammates were not bad,"- high pressure sales
- little to no inbounds (and inbounds that did come in were of poor quality - e.g. they did not remember submitting a form, were from the wrong industry, etc.)
- product-market fit was misaligned (even our ICP prospects had difficulty understanding the value of the platform)"
18,Signpost ,Great,2021-08-26,5.0,Sales Representative,very fun environment I enjoyed it here,need more internal growth in company
19,Signpost ,Dont work here,2021-08-22,1.0,Customer Success,There are no pros compared to any other company,"- turn-over is extreme
- management is unqualified and has no idea how to grow a company
- work-life balance is nonexistent 
- company is barely funded and unprofitable. There is no long term here. I doubt it will exist in a few years
- failing product with no value-proposition
- Again, management is under qualified for their roles and have no direction for the company as a whole. Nothing is organized, everything is chaos. 
- dont work here. Its a trap."
20,Signpost ,Work environment,2021-08-20,3.0,Business Manager,Good company to learn the business for freshers and give a career start,"No growth in financial and designation wise, feels stagnant after a point of time."
21,Signpost ,My time at signpost,2021-06-04,2.0,Sales Representative,Met some great people working here that I still connect w/ until this day,"Very pushy sales, heavy on cold calling, almost felt forceful to a point."
22,Signpost ,A+,2021-05-24,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Everyone wants everyone else to succeed at Signpost, which is incredibly evident from the minute you sign on. The company is currently investing in its employees with mentorships to help everyone reach their professional goals within the company (which benefits everyone involved). The pay is competitive, and the bonus structure has realistic and attainable goals. I've truly never come across such a transparent leadership team.","I can't think of any cons, but it's a comprehensive product that does take some time to learn. Once you have a firm grasp of it, you're set."

25,Signpost ,Great place to learn and grow,2021-04-12,4.0,Senior IT Specialist,Signpost had lots of opportunities to expand my knowledge as an IT Support professional. The environment was fun and very fast paced!,The sales floor was always playing really loud music and if you're not into that kind of thing it could be very distracting.
26,Signpost ,Decent Company,2021-04-07,3.0,Inside Sales Representative,"Grinder mentality, good phone experience, use of Salesforce which is good experience. Good first job to give perspective that things could be worse","They mask ""company culture"" with touting ping pong and a keg that is only opened once a month for an hour after work. The product is a middle tier product with a top tier price point. Its a game of failure so you have to be ready to make 120 calls a day for maybe 1 sale a month"
27,Signpost ,Just stay away,2021-04-01,4.0,Sales Associate,good bagels they werent cheap with those,"pay, management(abusive physically and verbally) product"
28,Signpost ,L O L,2021-03-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You can come in to work half asleep and do the job. They just ask that you work as if you're part of a call center. The role is perfect if you're lazy, have no ambition, and money is not a factor in your life.","Pay is terrible
Product is terrible
Management is terrible
Absolutely no integrity top down, and almost encouraged to make a sale no matter what. Including lying and be sneaky with customers in middle of nowhere america to take 5k from them for a software that doesn't work. Legit the product just sends a drip campaign email to every customer asking for a review and sending one off promotional emails. Everything is automated so if a customer leaves a review they are then bombarded to leave a review on every other site because there was engagement."
29,Signpost ,"Run, don't just walk away R U N.",2021-03-29,1.0,Sales Executive,"Great people, loved my managers, but everything else is a dumpster fire.","Lousy product that can't keep up with the customers needs and lack of innovation in the product at an insane pricepoint. Constant pressure, changing systems, and the inability to keep up with the demands are reasons I left."
30,Signpost ,Horrible,2021-03-22,1.0,Account Executive,"Flexibility to work from home, okay starting pay, manager bonus","The job is churn and burn. No one knows what’s going on in other teams, different teams selling different prices?? No one knew what was going on ever. 100 dials a day required for the AE’s?? That’s an SDR job. Expecting to close on one call to plumbers? Not being able to self source leads so we had to go off purchased phone numbers. Most people that we called were outright racist. CEO is bribing people to rate the company on Glassdoor instead of listening to employees. It’s sad. I think some people that work there don’t know what a fun sales job is like. This isn’t it. Get out while you can. Looming doom because they don’t even know if the company will be funded. Is this even a company anymore??

Also the job and the earnings were grossly misrepresented by the recruiter. Listen to the reviews. They are all true. Except most of the 5 star ones that the CEO is asking employees to make??? Is this even appropriate?"
31,Signpost ,OK company,2021-03-17,4.0,Business Development Representative,Fun environment to work in,high stress environment with difficult quotas

- The product has improved by leaps and bounds in the last year or so which makes everything about the job a lot easier
- I like to travel a lot and the PTO policy is very flexible and I've never had a problem getting any requests approved","- Pay could be better but if you stay long enough to get promotions it improves a lot
- You will spend a lot of time on the phone which can get monotonous at times"

- The sales goals set are easily attainable but require vigorous work throughout the day","- The company is still in a regrowing phase since Q1 2020

43,Signpost ,"Easygoing, hardworking company",2021-01-21,5.0,Software Tester,"1. The Product Team is easygoing and fun to work with.
2. The employees have an excellent work ethic.
3. Upper management is transparent and easy to communicate with.","None, really. This past year has been a bit of a burnout, but it was a pandemic."
44,Signpost ,A Community Committed to Growth,2021-01-21,5.0,Junior Software Engineer,"Culture:
If you are looking to grow as an engineer Signpost is the place for you. The culture at Signpost emphasizes employees growth and development and everyone is super helpful and wants you to learn. 

People are also very inclusive and encouraging, especially the more senior engineering. As a junior engineer, I feel very comfortable trying new things and pitching ideas. The responses I get are always very positive even when the idea wouldn't work: ""Actually that wouldn't work because XYZ"" or ""Thats a super cool idea, why don't you try..."". And often are followed up with a discussion aimed at helping me to understand the subject in question more deeply.

Engineering:
I find work at Signpost to be super interesting and enjoyable. Since there are a lot of new features in the works, you get a lot of opportunities to write new code which I really enjoy.

Signpost also does a great job of balancing moving fast with code quality. With super well maintained unit/functional tests and seamless devOps, developing in the codebase is a dream.

Overall Company: 
Everyone is super stoked on the product and the vision so there is definitely great energy (even virtually). I think it helps that we have a super important target customer so it's easy to get excited about delivering value and getting the company closer to its goals.",There's no 401k matching which is a bummer.

Great initial and ongoing sales training.,Executive turnover. Changing comp plans. At times high stress. Disconnect in communication between sales and marketing.

- Very easy to WFH/flexible with location
- Product is finally getting the opportunity to better the platform and turn it into what the sales team has been over-selling for years","- Almost all C-levels are new and care very little how much blood and sweat and time any employee has put into the company
- HR is a JOKE
- Employees are overworked and underpaid, pay and comp are below industry standards
- PTO went from unlimited to ""flex,"" and time off is subtly used against you
- Several recent rounds of layoffs
- Culture is mostly gone. It was really the thing that attracted and kept a lot of people because honestly, the job isn't easy (sales or CS)
- Morale is pretty dang low"
49,Signpost ,Inside sales,2020-11-17,2.0,Sales Representative,Solid support system. Good at finding the diamonds in the rough.,Gotta love insides sales. The phones just ain’t for me.
50,Signpost ,Steer Clear,2020-10-28,1.0,Sales,Made some good friends. Learned some valuable lessons of what to truly look for in a company.,"Many things. This company is going through an extreme amount of change during an unstable economic period. When I was hired, I was lied to about the training program, lied about the salary, the environment was toxic from day 1 and there was no job stability for anyone. Once covid hit, the org changes should've been put on a halt to find stability but instead they recklessly insisted sales continue to only push annual contracts and focus on 1 market path instead of staying generalized like the platform is meant to be. Since small and medium businesses were hurting the most and not buying then almost no reps were making sales and no commissions were coming in. From the moment, I started there was no job stability of any kind. Anyone could be fired if they didn't like you and everyone was leaving. It is very much a clique culture. Even with the new CEO and management, there is a lack of a consistent vision being funneled down that it only makes it more difficult to see where they are hoping to take Signpost. Sales is hard work with long days of calls and emails but they need to listen to employees frustrations and make incentives and find impactful ways to motivate and inspire their reps."
51,Signpost ,A lot of change,2020-10-28,3.0,Sales Manager,Great people and the product although basic does the job customers pay for.,The company has been through so much change and uncertainty that it made executing on initiatives extremely difficult.

Upward growth, 
Amazing Training. 
Challenging workplace. 
Great company culture. 
Scrappy.","This is not directed to the current CEO. 

Everyone that made signpost what it was has ultimately left. The turnover happened due to the lack of growth and direction at signpost as well as its new leadership which brought a large amount of toxicity. Sales reps are now seen as numbers and receive little to no direction. Commission is almost non existent since the start of 2020 and base pay is as low as it can possibly be. This all boils down the the horrible sales leadership responsible for creating and mainting a healthy sales floor. Their lack of communication, transparency, ability to listen and support a team is the worst I have seen in my career."

66,Signpost ,Typical Grindhouse,2020-05-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Happy hours and the staff is friendly,"You’re set up for failure. They expect you to sell $17,000+ to graduate from training but the majority of sales reps struggle to hit their $4,000 hurdle to qualify for commission. 
Covid hit and management “understands how tough it is to sell to small businesses right now” but training class was let go because metrics weren’t met and they brought in a new crop of people because they are a standard sales grindhouse"
67,Signpost ,"fun coworkers will make you stay, low base pay will make you turn to other opportunities...",2020-05-02,3.0,Sales Representative,"The best thing about Signpost is the people--your coworkers are young and like to have fun. I made a lot of genuine friends on the sales floor.

The training was superb, led by Adam Kincaid, who is no longer with the company, unfortunately.

This was my first and probably last sales job, but I do feel I learned a lot of useful skills in a short period of time. 

There is high transparency; CEO and other execs will visit office and answer questions, and there is generally proactive top-down communication about the company's strengths, weaknesses and goals.","Cold calling every day can be mind-numbing, even if you are making money off of it. 

The base pay is quite low, so if you have a couple bad selling months in a row it will not feel worth sticking around.

7:30 am start time is a bit harsh (although 4pm EOD is nice). 

There is crazy high turnover even at the managerial level, which makes things feel unstable. Best practices seem to change frequently, so you kind of have to figure things out for yourself once you're out of training.

The product is not as amazing as you will have to make it seem in order to close deals. Customer success/service is questionable, so sometimes it's unclear whether you are helping the business owners to whom you sell, or merely exploiting them for commission."

70,Signpost ,Disappointing,2020-03-12,1.0,,The coworkers I met will be friends for a lifetime. Signpost hired based on personality and potential when I first joined which created a fantastic culture. Until it wasn't.,"Signpost does not value it's employees whatsoever. Not only is compensation horrible, there is poor direction and leadership. No opportunity for growth though they use that to get you in the door. Some people had a new manager every month. They hide bad google reviews, scramble to save face, but their product isn't actually useful for business's whatsoever. I had clients tell me this all the time. Selling for them unfortunately felt like a scam. 50% of the sales floor has left since I have, including upper management. New building is bunk with horrible prison lighting, all the sales rep that are left are depressed."

72,Signpost ,do not work here,2020-03-03,1.0,Sales Associate,not many pros. employees are good people but that's about it,"company does not value its employees or what they have to say. they will use non existent compensation (prizes, gift cards, paid trips) as an incentive to work you to the bone and will not deliver. under new leadership 30% of the workforce left due to lack of direction and failure to provide transparency as well as support employees for future career growth."

• Flexible PTO (NOT unlimited)","• Poor Leadership throughout the company
• Insanely high turnover - most employees last about 6 months 
• Low Pay despite 50 Million being pumped into the company in 2019
• New office has been a huge flop, downgrading the space
• the employees are depressed, constantly complain and move on to better jobs quickly
• Tend to hire low quality Sales Reps with little critical thinking skills
• CEO Stu Wall should have been replaced years ago. He promised the company would be sold for almost an entire year, only for it to be restructured in early 2020 with many employees being demoted. 
• Managers are hired based off of who they are friends with, not their leadership skills
• Product team has slow turnaround on projects, and the projects they do are designed to being short term success (sales) instead of improving the user experience"
79,Signpost ,Be ready to learn and work hard,2020-02-04,4.0,Sales Executive,"Training is paramount, Signpost takes a much more strategic approach to acquire new business. They spend a great deal of time making sure they train their employees on finding the right type of businesses and making sure to not mis-sell. The culture is constantly changing but the thing that remains constant is the support. All of the management wants to see you succeed if you are willing to work for it. They will constantly provide the tools and expertise to make sure the team has what it needs.","The job can be hard.

Good work-life balance and plenty of meetings and check-ins.","Winning a popularity contest is the only way to succeed here and keep your job. Your career advancement/stability is based on if your manager likes you or not. You will make no money if you are not killing yourself in sales/upselling - Signpost has the lowest starting salary in the industry at 24k - way below a liveable wage. Most people work two jobs when they first start to make ends meet. No opportunity for educational advancement. Employees who take multiple breaks to play pool games, take over a month of vacation and make personal phone calls daily are kept over employees who work hard without these abuses of the workplace. Only additional rewards and bonuses are in the form of parties and bar tabs; you will be lucky if you get a $20 Amazon gift card. Extreme micro-managing of employees due to lack of trust. High turn over rate. They are a review management company - if they can manipulate their customer's reviews, they can do it for themselves too. They task senior employees to request the removal of negative merchant reviews from Signpost's Google page and BBB ratings by offering their merchants lower prices. You are not valuable as an employee there, just another cog in machine."

He is legit the best mentor you could ever have, he’s real with you and so sweet and understanding! 
John sales manager is great!! He is one of the best because again he’s REAL with you and so genuine and actually cares about you!!! 
The potential to grow and become top rep is AMAZING i mean the comp plan sells it’s self .. of course if your not a top performing rep or doing the job you won’t make the most money but they give you all the tools to be top rep and make atleast 5k a month and give you so many rewards! Just being there for 2 months i WON a MacBook Air 2019.. it’s crazy any company that cares that much to reward you for doing your job is a good company.",Honestly. There are quirks here and there but it’s a start up .. you get what you put in.. in any job really! I will say that if you are not down for stress and put base pay under cons than sales is NOT for you.. nobody wants to do sales for base pay.. but if your here to make UNLIMITED amount of money and beat records and get high rewards then join this team!! Anything you put in cons normally.. look at yourself and ask yourself.. is sales for me? Because base pay.. hard sales.. sales tactics.. snacks.. ping pong.. pushy.. money oriented is all characteristics of ANY sales job.. if you look at these reviews and look at the cons there’s a reason why they quit or got fired.. sales was not for them. I however love sales but has to relocate for family. This company though was by far the best sales job i have ever had. They look at you as people and not just a number or something the make money off of. They CARE about you and your needs and make you prioritize yourself and family FIRST. That’s why their benefits and time off is SO SO AMAZING.

Additionally, hilariously unique (but determined) personalities fill the Austin office. I’ve worked in several different industries, and I’ve never met a group more engaging on a personal level than this crew. There’s always someone willing to help or lend a hand, or help tighten up your sales pitch. Management gets their hands dirty and there’s no ivory tower perspective here. 

Also, the product works. It’s nice to know that what you sell can make an impact on someone’s small business, and I can verify from some of my own packages sold that this is true.",It’s a sales job. It’s a cold calling sales job. You have to have tough skin and the ability to persevere when A) People don’t understand the product and hang up on you. B) When your colleagues make bank one month and you don’t... My guess is some of the recent poor reviews didn’t make bank.

Poor management in Austin Texas.
A higher turnover rate than a restaurant, you don't matter to management.
Pushy sales tactics; the product itself is coded poorly and instead of fixing issues, developers just keep adding more to a system that really doesn't work. My advice: only consider Signpost to use as a stepping stone if you have no sales experience."

Tons of support through group trainings and one-on-ones. The culture here is outstanding, and I've made some strong business connections as well as great friendships through this opportunity.

While the base salary is a bit lower than similar roles in the area, the commission structure is solid, and most importantly, uncapped. Most similar roles will give you a ceiling, incentivizing reps to stop working once you've hit that ceiling. Not the case at Signpost. An average rep will consistently bring in decent checks, and above-average and top reps will see some serious commissions each month (speaking from experience here.)

Really great role for someone looking for their first or second sales job, as effort directly translates to results.","The job is tough, especially for a seasoned salesperson coming in with preconceived notions about how to best approach the sales process.

Not a good role for someone looking to skate by. You really have to put the work in - especially the first few months getting through the learning curve. If you don't consider yourself to be a hard worker and willing to put the time & energy in, I wouldn't bother applying."

109,Signpost ,Avoid If You Are Serious About Your Career,2019-01-16,1.0,Sales Representative,Office is located in Manhatten next to some nice restaurants and bars.,"No sexual harassment training in place.

Very low pay compared to other cold calling jobs. 

100% Cold Calling - the entire job is cold calling. The job listing says they give you leads, but its just an automatic dialer that will just randomly put you in a cold call with a random business with no previous research. It's a telemarketing job. 
You are expected to do over 200 minutes of talk time every day. 

Telemarketing is a method of direct marketing in which a salesperson solicits prospective customers to buy products or services, either over the phone or through a subsequent face to face or Web conferencing appointment scheduled during the call. - this is the entire role. You cold call businesses and try to get them onto an online demo and then sell to them. 

Micromanagement - Managers will take note on how often you use the bathroom, how long it's been since you made a cold call, or how long you've spent in the kitchen.  They also have a system in place where they can get audio from your headset to hear what you're saying to customers, and will take over if they don't like what you say.  Managers day to day is more focused on just looking over your shoulder, gchatting comments to each other, texting on their phones, and listening to your calls. They are very under utilized. Another problem is that there is 4 managers on the sales floor for a team of  about 20 people. Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. As soon as it hits 5:30, the managers are the first ones out the door while the sales reps are expected to stay in the evening. 

No real training - the training program is more of a ""figure it out"" approach rather than teaching you how to sell the product. The product knowledge training lasted 10 minutes with a vague overview of how the product works. You get leads from Yelp, Groupon, and HomeAdvisor, and just recycle them over and over until you get a deal. You're constantly asked to stick to the script even if you feel it doesn't work for you. 

Low Customer Reviews - Customers are not satisfied with the product, so you're really a sleazy sales person trying to get customers stuck in a contract rather than solving their problems. Its a real morals and ethics kind of decision you have to make to feel comfortable selling a product that doesn't work. You can just do a google search of Signpost Customer Reviews and the BBB and see that customers are not happy with the product.  Whether the company is doing anything to fix that is unclear as Sales is very segregated from the rest of the business. So you don't get the real experience of working for a tech company. 

Insult The Customers - the same people you are trying to sell to are the same people the office is open about making fun of. You try to sell to home services guys, but then openly insult and mock them during morning huddles. It sends a message that you don't really care about the customers you're trying to help, and just trying to get a deal. You're also advised to lie to customers as a way to relate to them like saying you have a wife, or child, or anything to relate to the person. It's just a very dishonest approach to building relationships with prospects if you have to lie to them to relate. 

Loud Work Environment - the sales floor is always blasting very loud music all day, every single day. It can be seen more as a frat party rather than an actual place to do business. I get that they are trying to be uplifting, but it's hard to do telemarketing when there is loud music just being blasted out. Worse if you sit under the speakers. 

Hire And Fire Cycle - the company is stuck in firing people, and hiring replacements at a rapid pace. They blame it in the role, but in all honesty it's because management can benefit from some much needed training. Being upfront that it is telemarketing can also help as people are expecting a sales role at a tech company, when it isn't. Managers are known to raise their voice at staff, gossip about previous staff, and put them on performance improvement plans if they want to get rid of you. They say they can't retain people because the job is monotonous,  but it's actually because nothing is being done to encourage talent, nothing is being done to build team morale, and unless you're part of the clique, you're fending for yourself. 

Promotions And Titles Are Over-saturated - Whether you're a new hire, or an account executive, every title is performing the same responsibilities. There is no unique distinctions between the titles other than salary. Seniors at the companies are performing duties of a sales development representative, which are lower responsibilities than a new hire sales rep. A high title at Signpost can't transition into the same high role at another company."

They constantly talk about local business owners as if they are complete idiots. They see customers as $ and nothing else
- Toxic culture that is company first and customers last. They will do everything to suck every penny out of business owners
- They sell to people who are a terrible fit for the product and straight up lie to customers. Then, in their internal QA sessions, they find themselves not culpable for any wrongdoing. Who would've guessed?
- They do almost nothing to ensure customer success. Once the contract is signed and they have the money, the customer will never hear from them unless they beg.
- Everything is the customers fault. If the product didn't work, customers fault. If  the product is different than the customer though, customer's fault. Nothing is every the company's fault.
- Simply look at their customer reviews and the # of engineer staff vs # of sales. That will tell you all you need to know. 
- They lie to you about compensation and have horrible equipment. They don't even give you a laptop. Instead, they give you horrible computers with cheap chairs.
- Lack of trust. Managers are always breading down your neck. I can't believe how much time managers have to be snooping on you instead of operational efficiency.

117,Signpost ,Sales executive,2018-11-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Start up environment is fun and electric. The C-level leadership is great and it’s mainly a young crowd. Early to mid 20s.,The training and training manager isn’t accessible or as dedicated in seeing you succeed. The sales floor is high energy and that is great when it’s positive but when it turns into negative energy it can be determintal to your success. The company itself is on the up but the training needs to be more precise. I recall some sessions it felt like it was just put together aimlessly and not as organized. Since it’s a small location that one negative factor did affect an otherwise great atmosphere.

Culture/People - really welcoming environment. Phone sales is tough so you need good people next to you and I feel that we have that in our office.

122,Signpost ,Really Miss This Place!,2018-10-15,5.0,Senior Sales Executive,"*Best sales training program in Denver - Seriously, I've worked at a few sales orgs since, and have always felt like I had the best foundation. The training program is thorough, and the skills I developed here made a huge impact at my job now. I wouldn't have been able to succeed without the foundation I learned at SP.
*The people - Met some of my best friends here, still hang out to this day. Genuinely good people that help you push through the grind. 
*Management - Local management cares, and always wants to make sure you're being heard, and my manager always went to bat for me to hit my goal. Execs were less present, but never difficult to get a hold of them if you wanted, usually came by once a quarter. 
*Product is solid - Having sold a few other products since SP, I feel way better about the product than when I was there and only focused on my merchants that cancelled. It's not perfect, but compared to other solutions it really is a good solution.","*Job is HARD - When I was interviewing, they told me the job was hard, and I didn't take them seriously. It's not impossible, but it takes a lot of hard work to do well. If you can hack it, you get back what you put in 2x though. 
*Pay could be better - Wish the base salary was higher, but the commissions were always pretty strong. 
*Job is not only hard, but can be monotonous - The grind is by far the hardest part of the job. Selling is only half the battle, the second half is staying motivated week after week, month after month. Again, this is a necessary skill for any type of sales, so I'm glad I learned it."

As a Recruiter, I have an unbeatable team that supports my own growth and drive. President's club is on the horizon for the Recruiter who kills their numbers. The Recruiting team is well supported by the Sales team and the HR team. There's a lot of praise from the Executive team as well because this company understands the importance of finding great talent.","I think the only thing that is a little bit of a disconnect is the overall structure of Recruiting at Signpost.

Every few weeks I find myself at a Rooftop open Bar, Picnic's, Boat Cruise....Bagels on Tuesdays, Birthday Cakes are made to order, the competition is friendly, the prizes are aggressive....the location is perfect.

Product is amazing and only getting better, so it's easy to believe in what you're selling. Smaller company, so your voice can be heard without going through a million hoops. 

Good place to sharpen your sales skills if you're just starting out.  

Team outings and events are always a great time. Really helps you bond with everyone in the office. Really some great people that work here.","They still hide behind the ""we're a still a start up"" excuse when they make ill advised decisions or changes. Unfortunately the company has passed that stage and needs to acknowledge it. 

There is really no leadership development or training, so most managers are learning on the fly and are not fully prepared when they first start. They'll pretty much hire anyone that has a personality and a willingness to learn, which does not always translate to performance. 

The ""bro"" culture that is mentioned in other reviews is very much real, especially in the Denver office. It is a culture perpetuated from top down, so it's hard to change. The lack of diversity is also a joke, especially for a call center. There is really no  true female leadership, so many women in the office feel they need to have their own chat to voice their concerns amongst each other. 

Sometimes moves are made without any true thought, so a job title can be created or removed at any time. If you're not willing to switch positions at the drop of that change you may be asked to leave. It has gotten better but it still exists. 

Understand that this is a company looking to get acquired, so this will more than likely not be a long term option for a career."

It is hard work, and a grind but you will develop skills that only a seasoned salesperson can achieve.
- Fun happy hour events, quarterly outings as an office, monthly outings as a team, snacks and a keg, an overall fun and engaging community. Worked at the Denver office for almost two years, some of the best people I know were from Signpost.
- Adequate ramp up process for new hires
- close to downtown
- Very chill and laid back environment: no micromanaging, no dress code or requirements, play whatever music you want, themed dress days, understanding managers, flexible time off schedule.
-Health benefits at Signpost are above average compared to other tech start ups

*** The managers at Signpost truly are the reason I stayed as long as I did, Sales is a grind and the closing positions at SP can be incredibly daunting, disappointing, and exhausting. But the support and friendship I got from my managers pushed me to work hard, reach my potential, and improve my overall sales skills.","- Ramping up from sales development to closer there was no training process for that, resulted in two months of giving demos with an incredibly low close rate. Not so much as a power point for transitioning roles. That was a year ago, now they may have changed that but it greatly affected my pay check.
- The product itself can only go so far, and same goes with the job opportunities there. Once when you get promoted 2-3 times (which is really just a pay raise) there isn't much opportunity for growth in the company unless you become a manager. 
- The Signpost product is becoming less relevant, its an exciting tool for a company that needs it, and really does help our customers, but I have trouble seeing the value of keeping it after 2 years. 
- The daily dials are a grind, staying in the cold calling position for me was only worth it until I learned everything I could, then it was time for something new. The day to day gets repetative
- The pay base is pretty low, to get a higher pay base you need to consistently hit quota for 3-4 months, if you have two back to back slow months, you are stuck in your pay base for now 6+ months because you then start from square one"

Best sales trainer Ive ever had. Also its an 830-530 day no over time necessary so you dont have to stay late.,"Let me start with their unlivable base salary in NYC. They will tell you some made up number for OTE that 2 percent of the company hits and everyone else struggles to even come close to hitting 40 or 50 percent of their quota. This is a glorified telemarketing job. There is no real skill or salesmanship involved whatsoever. They tell you when you can take a break, take a lunch, and you're not allowed to leave otherwise. You have to hit crazy talk time numbers by lunch and by end of the day. Every metric is tracked, your managers do not let you breathe and you will burnt out in no time. It was the single worst demoralizing job I have ever had. The only people that stay there have been there 3+ years and probably wont leave.  The turn over rate especially in NY is insane I think my whole team quit or was fired in my year there. On a monthly basis they put 1 to 2 people on PIP (which they claim was to push you in the right direction, but was just a way to fire you if you didnt hit 70 percent the next month), or people quit.  People have been calling the same leads for 3-4 years, its unbearable.  Top level talent is leaving, c-level talent is seeing the writing on the walls and quitting left and right. They walk around and call themselves a start up but they arent. Theyve been around for 7 years, have 3 offices and are just so much of a sinking ship that they cannot grow - so they keep saying its a start up. They also sent around a survey begging people to leave positive glassdoor reviews so if they seem staged, they are."

   • World-Class Training – If you are hired at Signpost in the first place, and don't make it through the training program (A 2-Month Ramp with every resource available,) it's because you didn't work hard enough.

• There isn't room for everyone, and Signpost is a meritocracy. – This is a Pro for me, because I believe in surrounding yourself with the best of the best. Signpost is a lean machine, and doesn't have room for slack. They're forgiving, but if you can't hit your numbers, you're out!","• You're working in a Start-up! – Adaptability is a must. There is constant change, and some people are left behind when they can't adapt.

The nature of sales is such. Sales brings out either the worst or best in people. Nothing says get me out of here better than that.,"No time to adjust in the sales cycle. They expect outcomes right away. Most startup companies (WeWork, CB Insights, Yelp, 1000s more) have a minimum 6 month training period. This company has a 60 day training period.

Yes, the culture is great and you can easily make life long friends but the real benefit is developing your career.

190,Signpost ,Great place to work,2017-01-20,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"At Signpost, you get to work alongside intelligent, motivated people. The talent on the tech, marketing, product, and finance teams is top notch. Apart from sales, the teams are small, nimble, and the organization hierarchy is generally flat. The executive team is open and receptive to feedback. There is a lot of emphasis on camaraderie and I feel like my voice is heard.","There needs to be more investment in R&D. Signpost is extremely sales centric, and while that's fine for ""moving the needle"", it won't make Signpost a world class company. Since the sales team is so large, it really dominates the culture. Their voice is, collectively, very loud and it can feel like Signposts' priorities are always about appeasing the sales team, which results in superficial growth rather than substantial development."
191,Signpost ,Signpost Sales Floor,2017-01-19,4.0,,"Depending on your perspective, almost every aspect of working on the sales floor at Signpost has an up side and a down side.

The company culture: You can wear whatever you want. There are some great people that you will meet and quickly become friends with if you make an effort. There is a ping pong table that is always active during breaks and after work. A lot of people are happy to give advise and share tips to help you hit your goals. 

Selling: The product is great. It is a top of class platform that you will truly get behind. 

Start-up Status: Signpost is a start up and you are reminded of it constantly. It's growing at a phenomenal rate and the higher ups do a great job of getting you inspired by the company's progress.

Signpost really does reward success. They have set you up with a great platform, and now your job is to sell it. You can quickly get promoted up the sales ladder and earn yourself fat commission checks if you perform above what's expected.","On the flip side: 

If you can't perform then don't expect to last long. Not saying this is a con, per-se, but you have to remember that you are there for only one reason. To sell. As a result, a lot of employees contribute nothing to helping others or to a good work environment. 

The company has a sort of quasi-start up feel, so although the culture can be relaxed, each aspect of the company seems very rigid or compartmentalized.   Meaning that there isn't much transparency or cooperation between sales teams. 

Doing 100 cold calls a day is common and if you get really unlucky you can spend an entire day getting shut down by people who don't even give you a chance to talk. Some days can feel like a complete waste. 

Compensation: The pay is pretty meager. It makes sense for a sales organization because it pushes out those who can't hit quota, but at least 85% of people don't hit quota. When you get recruited, remember, what you are ""expected to hit"" is only actually accomplished by a few."
192,Signpost ,First Job Out of University,2017-01-19,4.0,Senior Sales Executive,"Signpost does a really good job at training you and helping you develop your skills as a sales person. This was my first job out of university and now I have a full understanding how to sell a product that someone cannot see, touch or feel. You are basically selling a concept which I believe is the hardest part. The people at Signpost are great and I enjoy working there and going to work everyday. The day-to-day can be a grind but that is with all sales jobs. I feel confident I can go work anywhere after doing this job at a high level for over a year.",Sudden changes all the time. I know signing up for a startup you should expect such changes but management at times does a poor job relaying some changes. Not to say they are improving and wanting to get better but sometimes it does not come to fruition. Internally there are also not a lot of rules that people abide by. I call it the wild west. There are not set rules because there has been so much change internally.
193,Signpost ,Great place to work,2017-01-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Signpost is a wonderful place to start a career. The training team and training program is top notch. Promotions happen as quickly as every 6 months, and tenured reps can move up-market and to a more complex sale.

Management is very supportive and provides top notch training.  The culture is very collaborative, everyone is always high-fiving each other and sharing the energy of closing deals.  Since the initial pay is low and cold calling is tough, I can understand some negative reviews on glassdoor.  But the bottom line is: YOU GET OUT WHAT YOU PUT IN.  As with everything in life.  If you commit yourself to succeed at signpost you will.  With hitting quota month after month you can quickly climb yourself up to making 70k in a year.  Also looks great on a resume (google funded marketing cloud platform in early stage development).","Cold calling is tough and repetitive,  small business owners often are rude and will hang up on you.

Career Progression - Every month you're hearing about people moving up in the company.

Benefits - Signpost pays a healthy amount every month leaving the employee contribution to them very small.",Very few.  Current employees are too good at ping pong for amateurs to compete and bagel Tuesdays contain too many carbs.

As long as you're willing to work hard with good ethics, you'll be given opportunities to expand your skill set, learn valuable communication, presentation and persuasion skills that you'll use throughout your career, whether you continue in sales or not. One awesome aspect is that the executives always had an open door - if you wanted to walk in, talk to them about how to advance your career or be successful, for mentorship and advice in their field or share ideas for the company, their door was always open for mentorship and guidance - even if you weren't a part of their department! *This of course goes with the disclaimer that by ""walk in"" I mean you communicate / schedule some time with them, obviously they're very busy running their departments / the company*","Signpost is a start up. What that means isn't the ""Hollywood"" version where it's all cavalier, fun-loving situations and glory growing up in the tech industry and taking on the world (and I sincerely doubt any start-up is like what hollywood shows depict them as). What that means is that there is a global vision for the company's direction and a common culture to get there. There will be pivots, changes in the 'details' of operations, organization and work-flow to best suit the best need of the company with the times and evolution as the company grows. It means there's a lot of grit and grind and change. If that doesn't suit your personality, then save yourself the time."

Everyone is proud of the product they are selling.","It feels almost impossible to hit quota in your first three months, and they will pip you while you are still on a ramp. Not enough time is given for people to build a pipeline and get their feet wet before you are written up, which leads to churn. It is possible to get lucky, especially on the National team, but luck is all it is... It is really, really hard to keep up with the others if you don't have someone to set appointments for you.

214,Signpost ,Avoid Austin,2016-10-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Product — I encourage you to read customer testimonials. This product does amazing work for Signpost clients.
Senior Management — I’ve met many of them from various offices, and they make a genuine effort to improve the company for their customers and their employees. They truly value and implement feedback. 
Perks Wherever Possible — Creative perks like company-wide AMAs with Execs from other reputable companies and regular cross-departmental socializing are both engaging and educational.","Current instability in sales strategy coupled with ineffective leadership from local management in Austin results in poor compensation and quality of life -- I can't recommend working here.

Incredibly low job security in the Austin office (even for startup sales) with the recent hiring of immature management that has demonstrated no interest or capability in investing in their employees through training or professional development. Reps are managed as if they are ""out of control,"" rather than managed towards success.

Good leaders have a balance of both Power (the ability to inspire and lead by example to empower autonomous work) and Authority (earned respect to make a judgment call, sometimes without offering justification). Unfortunately, Austin local management has neither, and feedback given is focused solely on social intangibles rather than how to improve at the task at hand. 

The result is a hostile environment that focuses on managers' short term favorites over their reps ability to perform. There’s no consistency from management between their verbally expressed belief in the value of training, and the training or guidance they actually offer. Time spent here will not build your skill set or position your career trajectory positively.

Upper management purportedly has an open door policy, but the Austin office has a stranglehold on employees, leaving reps with no ability to express concerns to upper management, or faith that when they do their concerns will be held confidential.

The base salary is very low with the promise of uncapped commission, which is unnecessarily challenging to attain. Take a calculated look at your finances to ensure that you can live off of the base alone for at least 4-5 months (quota expectations are muddled, it's hard to say if they'll keep you around or not). You want to afford yourself an opportunity to independently learn their recently implemented more churn and burn hustle with unstable quota expectations before expecting to profit financially early on. Tip: Benefits don’t kick in until month 3.

Success at this company in its current state is a pipeline dream. If you’re exceptionally self-directed and/or already have experience in a high-volume, short sales cycle inside sales role, you should be ok. Just know that there’s no support from local management, especially at the individual level."

226,Signpost ,Interesting,2016-08-12,3.0,,"Great environment, very engaging.",Base pay and commission scale turns sales into a rat race.
227,Signpost ,It's not all what it appears,2016-08-09,1.0,Business Development Representative,"I am sure you understand the pros from reading other reviews and that is to say the people you work with on a daily basis are incredible. Very cool office in a great location as well! You have the opportunity to have your voice heard from your direct manager, which is nice.","Signpost (Austin) has seen more turnover in the last few months than any company I have worked with plain and simple. A major reason for this is the compensation that you get while working there, which doesn't necessarily work with the Austin real estate market. Secondly, when you work for a ""start-up"" you give up a higher salary with the idea that the perks (free parking, lunches, etc.) will justify it. Signpost currently has a sub par product that is pitched to the wrong people (General Contractors, Dentists, etc.) who don't necessarily have a need for it. 

Signpost is stuck in a tough place (in a uber competitive market) between being a ""start-up"" and something more. My biggest problem with working there was the fact that there was NO transparency between upper management and the rest of the employees. What I believe, is that Signpost received a decent amount of funding and used that money irresponsibly which is why so many of the perks you get at other start-ups were taken away. 

Working there made me feel as if I was in some sort of pyramid scheme at times with a select group of people who are looking to get bought out. For being as mature a company as Signpost was, I felt that most people at the top had no idea how the structure of the company should be built. If you want the experience of working at a tech company just for the sake of working for one, you want to meet some awesome people, and finally you do not care about making money (maybe you have some backing from relatives or previous jobs) then Signpost is for you.

*Final note: I am sure that Signpost is aware of the turnover (how could they not) but didn't do much while I was there to try and address it. It seems that the company is fine churning and burning out employees because they know that they can hire young people by masking the company as a trendy ""start-up""."
228,Signpost ,Great stepping stone startup,2016-08-08,4.0,National Sales Executive,You can get promoted quickly by your own performance.  Fun atmosphere with really good people around you.  A great culture and opportunity to learn new skills.  I really liked the aggressive sales floor.,"The cons are similar to most startups in that the base is pretty low and comissions could be higher.  You have a good amount of base training but it's pretty much personal performance after that, which I liked and was succesful but some may not.  Lots of changes to always adjust to as well."

-Bagel Tuesdays, snacks in the kitchen, good music playing all day, 3 breaks a day
-There is opportunity to move to different sales channels that they are currently building out as they grow, like Inbound, Enterprise, Partnerships etc...
-Every manager I had, I could talk to openly about any problems I was having","-Signpost is experiencing growing pains right now, and there are a lot of changes going on in the commission structure as well as organizational structures of the sales teams
-The base salary is a little lower than similar startups, and it can be tough in NYC unless you are a top performer
-Turnover is very high (but then again, it's sales)
-Get ready to make 100+ cold calls a day to people who aren't necessarily familiar with with industry and don't really want to talk to you
-Competition is extremely high, and it is a very tough sale because we are in a crowded space

From intelligent, passionate managers to a talented, incredibly hard working sales floor- Signpost has a great team working in their NY office.  Everyone here is incredibly knowledgable, willing to help, and incredibly friendly.  The product is something you can be proud selling.","Days can be long in a call center and it's hard to count the number of times I've been yelled at by merchants on the phone.  Sales operations could improve on lead generation and optimizing the power dialer (ie: look at times of day the DM was contacted, NOT when the lead picked up).  The product IS great, but there are ways to improve- adopt a pricing structure that can get merchants the features they need.  For example Yoga studios typically love mind body for its ability to schedule and do appointment reminders, but they may really only need reviews from Signpost."

I was able to work my way up from a Sales Rep, Sales Executive, Senior Sales Executive, Team Lead, to Manager. The career path is transparent and there for those to choose to take advantage of it. Although the starting salary is not super high, many people have exceeded goals quickly and been promoted to a higher position and salary. This isn't an easy job but hard work pays off!!

I would recommend this company for anyone that is looking to jump start their career or someone looking to work at a good company in general.

-Phenomenal location; one block from Coors Field in LODO.
-There are very clear and direct promotion paths within the organization. 

I left Signpost on good terms and for personal reasons. Because of the fundamental and technical sales skills I learned at Signpost, I am fully confident I can go into ANY interview outside of Signpost and receive a job offer. I feel as if Signpost is a trade school for sales. There was not one day at Signpost where I felt comfortable cold-calling small businesses and asking for their credit cards. But, because I pushed myself everyday at Signpost, I am 'leaps and bounds' more confident personally and professionally. If you are ready to work hard and learn, Signpost will be a rewarding experience for you!","-Cold-calling over 100 businesses every day is not easy. It is not for the weak-minded.
-Signpost is a start-up and change within the organization is constant. If you are not good with adapting to change, this job might not be for you.
-Have to work a set 7:30am-4:00pm schedule. As a senior sales executive, I would have liked to set my own schedule as long as I continue to perform.
-Base compensation could be a little bit higher."
249,Signpost ,Sales Executive,2016-03-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Inclusive culture from exec level down to rep level, obvious career growth and opportunity to make an impact on day to day business solutions, leveraging tools to help SMBs and mid markets translates to skills for any career path",Cold calling can be tedious but the processes in place can offset this
250,Signpost ,Sales exec,2016-03-21,1.0,,Signpost has great people working there. It is a fun place to work on the occasions when you are selling well.,"This is where the issues start. All sales jobs are hard work and have down sides, but signpost has unique problems which have one thing in common, one main cause, a terrible product which is priced out of the market. 

The basic idea of signposts platform makes sense, but the execution is horribly lacking. Forget what you are told in the interview, the product sends out emails blasts that's it! It is not targeted and it can not be targeted by the client so in reality it is less effective than mail chimp or consent contact which is free or like 20 bucks. 

Signposts system strives to do more in an automated way but in doing so gives the customer no freedom. And because the automated system is a flop the customer is screwed and gets no value.

So as a sales rep this is the position you are in: trying to sell an ineffective product for 300 a month when in reality there are better solutions for 20 a month.

Sounds like a tough sell right? Well you guessed it, it is terrible. A average to good rep sells one company a week. In that same week the sales rep calls 150 people a day: that's 750 calls a week for ONE sale. 

Why such terrible sales odds:

price is way to high 300 a month

signposts reputation online is garbage ( imagine a company which sells company's on improving their reputation, but has a lot of bad reviews and no credibility)  

There is a ton of competition which has better product and prices

The leads are terrible! They are bad fits for the service and have no vetting. Signpost just pulls any company they can find online. 

All of this leads to terrible client retention. And this is where the lies start from the exec team and managers. They claim a 98percent retention. This number is literally laughed at on the sales floor. I would be shocked to find out the real number of clients whom actually want to sign back up is above 25 percent. 

This is why when I started working at signpost in early 2015 the number of clients was around 5000. It is still near that number today over a year later!! They are not bringing in anymore clients than are leaving and signpost is loosing money the entire time.

Over the entire period I worked at signpost, over the 65 clients I signed up , never once did I hear from a happy client or receive one referral not ONE. There was even a 250$ referral bonus signpost pays to a client who refers a new customeror!! BUT NOT ONE!!!!

You can start to see a pattern developing here. Are some of the execs a little bit slimy? Yes, but they have to sell a bad product to the sales team. They have to lie to the sales reps the same way the sales reps lie to clients. 

The root of the issue is the product!!! It is a cancer, and nobody is aloud to say anything because God forbid the office wide silence is broken, and people are forced to really consider what they are selling small business owners. 

I have realized and I want apologize to all the small business owners I sold to out there."
251,Signpost ,Hoping Signpost can be restored,2016-03-17,3.0,,"Ironic… Signpost prides itself on helping SMB get reviews and now they’re battling some pretty harsh ones. The majority of the negative reviews come from angry termed employees and the glowing ‘couldn’t be better’ reviews have been requested from within. The truth is, Signpost is not as bad as these 1 stars make it out to be, but it is not perfect either. 
So Pros - You will work beside some of the greatest people you’ll ever meet. When you spend the majority of your day at work, that is really freaking important! You share the ups and downs of a start-up with them and those people are what will make you stay when you have a hard day. When your team/office or the company as a whole is having a good sales month, the energy cannot be beat. The amount that your team rallies around you to help you get there is nothing short of inspiring and it’s what builds the ‘Signpost Family’ culture.","It’s a late stage start up. A changing environment is to be expected but management, specifically the Execs, don't know how to communicate that change in a way that it doesn’t cause panic. Changes in game plans, org structure, and compensation are dealt with bluntly. That's fine in Corporate America but you've created a culture where co-workers feel like family. There is no love lost and it can make any employee feel as though the effort they put in is disposable and replaceable despite their tenure."

Whether your fresh out of college or in the midst of your career, you will learn, advance and cultivate. This is coming from someone nearly 30 years old that has held positions in finance, entertainment, public service and head national sales for a large iron and steel company. Wanting some start up experience at the ground floor I didn't expect how much id actually take away from working here. It'll teach you the art of the sophisticated hustle. It'll teach you how to use crucial tools like salesforce and give online presentations. Being a startup- you'll learn how to adapt on the fly, evolve and grow. I can only speak on the sales side but can confidently say it's got such a good vibe and corporate culture across the board. On top of that you'll be working with some amazing people, have some great company outings and happy hours and really work at something like possibly the next Facebook/uber/LinkedIn. The senior management team are some of the most talented in the world and you'll be working directly beside them. Being able to work along side, get to know and be mentored being by such a caliber of people is priceless. It takes hard work and dedication and by some of the negative reviews clearly isn't for everyone, alas hard work is noticed. But if your willing to put in the work- not only will you make some great relationships, learn a lot you can really cut a nice a check.","Hard to really come up with serious cons, if I had to nitpick. The snack selection could have been healthier. The breaks a bit too structured and the music playlist updated.

Management is so out of touch with the fact that happy salespeople are good salespeople that they only care about daily call metrics. The product itself is horrible, Signpost boasts a 98% retention rate but there's absolutely no way that can be true. You grind it out day after day after day, signing up any small business owner you can (robbing them really) and then you go do it again. Managers sit and listen to calls all day, doing little else. They're unqualified to be in management positions, usually promoted because they lied to enough people to put up good numbers as a rep. The business plan seems to be get acquired as fast as possible, and the execs will talk about how great your options are. Fact is IF signpost gets acquired, your options will probably be worth nothing. Terrible environment, terrible product, terrible place to work.

I wish they were here to warn me too!

Signpost hires and fires people just to make it seem like they have a bunch of employees and are thriving. This is the most dishonest company I have ever worked for. They take advantage of people desperate for a job, make a BUNCH of false promises and barely train you. If you don't hit their IMPOSSIBLE metrics they fire you. I didn't work at this frat house for too long - but the amount of people fired was depressing - not just salespeople, but the managers, VP's and a whole bunch of other new hires were fired. Who does that? Think before you hire people!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It is not a suitable working environment - equipment breaks down regularly and free snacks are few and far beyond. The culture is geared towards white men in their early twenties, everyone who does not fit in to that demographic is left out. Seriously, if you are female or a person of color except to be treated differently - the office maybe in the heart of NY, but the culture is West Virginia. The company seems like it is going broke and people are not selling. At least 50% of the entire sales floor didn't hit their quota - and they expect new hires to??

All the sales people I spoke to were unhappy and did not trust the company, many people looking for jobs or hanging around for the social scene. They do have some amazing salespeople and they won't be around for long if they are smart.  Maybe this is all one big scam? The people on top appear to be very calculating and manipulative. Idk - but stay away."
269,Signpost ,"Signpost; A Startup That Apparently is ""Winning"" lol",2016-02-29,1.0,Sales Representative,"The people and friends I had the privilege of meeting in this office.Thats it. No more, no less","I worked at Signpost and I'm not gonna lie; It brings sweet sweet joy to my heart when a flush of REAL reviews begin to show up on their Glassdoor account ;)

-After graduating college, I moved out-of-state to work at this frat house, which from this moment on will be known as FRATpost. Fratpost, as others have mentioned, spoon feeds their new employees on how easy it is to make lots and lots money!! You begin to feel all warm inside as they take you to one of the many gentrified bars of Austin for drinks on the house. Yet, once ""training"" is over, and they throw you to the wolves to harass small businesses over the phone, people soon learn they were served hot garbage.   

-First, you WILL be making non-stop calls from 8:30a - 5:30a. Your lunchtime or break could be cut short for a ever-so-frequent meeting. I made sure to have a hearty breakfast before going into work to be sure I could function throughout the day with a high-chance my lunch/break would be cut SHORT.

-If you're late, no matter the reason (i.e. your child's school bus arrived late, high traffic in the capital of the second largest state in the United States) be prepared to be embarrassed in front of the entire office. While I was employed at FratPost, late staff members had to stand on a table and sing ""The Its Bitsy Spider"", aloud for everyone to hear. (The FratPost name starting to make sense yet?)  

-Don't be glammered by the ""tech startup"" atmosphere/startup they SELL YOU on. If you want to experience a REAL startup, learning to code (which is easy to do!!) and taking those talents to a WEB startup is where the actual startup culture is in ATX. This is a CALL center. You make calls, COLD calls 

(for those that don't know, COLD calling is when you call a small business who is working their 9 to 5 out of the blue and convincing them to drop their hard-earned money on a product that, as you've read in other reviews, isn't the next sliced bread. Having a keg of flat beer and Keurig coffee pods in a basket doesn't qualify you as as a startup..... c'mon Fratpost!!!!     

-Unprofessional management that lacks any real-world experience or training. If you let a customer off the phone because he/she simply doesn't want or need the product, you are grilled immensely instead of being taught what to do to better the outcome next time a situation occurs. But Fratpost wouldn't know this because they fire you before they even get a chance to learn and grow from the outcome.


Oh, and have you noticed they disable comments on any videos and pictures about their company on prominent social media sites? This is to hide the TRUTH from the people who have experienced FratPost first-hand. But what's most ironic is that if you DO decide to work here, you are constantly on the phone with merchants discussing the importance of having social media pages and comments...... lol 

If your are highly considering joining this sinking ship, turn the other way."
270,Signpost ,"Frat life, bruhhhh",2016-02-28,1.0,Sales Executive,"This is a great place for your first sales job. Training has gotten better in the past few months and you can't beat the solid cold-calling experience you'll gain here.. if that's what you're looking for. Marketing is finally existent, which is nice for sales and business development. Sometimes there are decent snacks... but with budget concerns lately it's much more likely you'll find a bare refrigerator and sad attempt at a pantry. New hire happy hours every month make the whole thing slightly more bearable. Ooh, and how could I forget, cold-brew on tap! ..Until that runs out, too. 

I will say the employees make the job great. It's the reason people tolerate the work environment and and grind for so long. Also, team events are pretty fun.. again, because of the staff.","Military style call center. The job is definitely a grind. Remember when your teacher would walk the class to recess and be there to pick everyone up afterwards? In kindergarten. This is what the regimented breaks feel like. Don't dare walk in a minute late or be in your seat a second after 8:30 or they send out an office wide e-mail to humiliate you with an announcement that you'll be on dish duty for the day. I guess this is an upgrade from the dunce hats they used to have. Oh, and If you leave at 5:30 on the dot you are a leper. 

Do you like working in a frat house? Then this boys club is the place for you! I thought I was starting my ""adult"" job until I realized Fetty Wap would be a regular thing. I'm sorry, but I'll pass.   Upper level management, with one or two exceptions, need extensive training on basic management skills, professionalism, and a general ""how-to"" in regards to human respect. Favoritism is a real thing and if you aren't having a good month you might as well be invisible to the office ""leader."" There is no female voice in the office or company. Let's talk about all machismo everything. 

There is no transparency either. Smoke and mirrors all around. CEO should have sold when he had the chance. Reps are encouraged to sell to anyone and everyone.. even when it's clearly not a good fit. Client retention rate is a fraction of the advertised number, 97%, because the product is ineffective. 

Non-essentials are being let go and reps are dropping like flies. They tell you this entry-level position will be a ""launch pad"" for your career, then punish reps who leave before they have decided it's your time."
271,Signpost ,Going downhill quickly,2016-02-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Amazing people. One of the only reasons I've stayed here so long
-Office is in a good location
-Lots of social activities and can be a fun environment at times
-Good PTO policy","-This is a high pressure, high stress and VERY fast paced environment. Downright frantic at times. You will never have a free moment here. While this can be fun, the risk of being burned out is high
-Loud environment is draining. Imagine if you turned a frat house into a business and this is what you get. Complete sensory overload. Blaring music while you are talking on the phone with clients - so loud that there is a bowl of ear plugs for the taking!
-For the amount of work we do the pay is not near enough. This is the reason so many people have been quitting lately.
-Recent lay-offs to the C-Team as well as other positions.
-Signpost reeks of desperation. The product itself is terrible and lacks many basic features that a CRM should have. Only about 15% of our clients are actually in NEED of a product like this yet we are forced to lie to them to convince them they need it. I've never seen a company so strict about letting customers cancel. If you are having to beg people to stay on board then clearly there is a problem
-Like many other reviewers said, we claim the retention rate is over 98% when this is clearly false. Only a very small segment of our customers are actually doing well with this product. We sell to the wrong verticals all the time and simply do not care
-90% of managers here have no experience. While some managers are great, others have no clue what they are doing, as this is their first ""big boy job"" out of college
-For being a start-up company micromanagement is bad here. You are told set hours you have to work and have a set lunch hour every single day. If you are running more than a minute late you are expected to notify your manager. No thanks.
-Calls are routinely listened to and critiqued to make sure you are doing everything you can to bully someone to sign up or not to cancel their account. Managers spend more time listening to calls than doing more important things"

Company has seen explosive growth over the last 2 years, good VC backing.","So many cons - It's a sales company focused on new revenue and not improving internally.  Operates like a call center.  Most managers are promoted from within and have no experience (or training).  Lack of professionalism and leadership.  

No structure or support, sell people on opportunity to grow but unless you're a super seller, there is little growth."

The training program is also first class. You get to fully learn and understand everything about Signpost and no matter how much experience you have in sales you walk out with a the confidence to crush it. 

It is a startup company and is a startup environment. The people here are great people to work with and there is always something fun going on in the office.",It is a sales position so you will have some ups and downs. If you aren't competitive or don't have drive this isn't the place for you.

Extremely high turnover so if you can preform and do well there is room for advancement.  This includes a slight bump in base salary but the job is essentially the same.,You are cold calling all day every day for low pay.  They just lowered the sales commission payout significantly.  Hard selling a software often to people it won't work for and over promising on the results.

It's up to you to take those tools and use them to sell sell sell.","You have to be on the phones for around 7 and 1/2 hours a day where people tell you no all day, hang up on you, and sometimes yell at you.  You have to let rejection roll off your shoulder and work insanely hard to make your sales goals for the month.  If you don't you get a period of time to hit your sales goals before parting ways.

We are constantly looking for ways to improve as a team and there's a ton of great engineers to learn from on personal level. Really its everything I'm looking for in a software engineering job.",Just normal growing pains of a rapidly growing startup
282,Signpost ,"Needs a leadership overhaul, and renewed transparency",2016-01-31,1.0,Sales,"- Exposure to the start-up industry
- Infrastructure. Infrastructure. Infrastructure. There's no doubt - Signpost is cash rich, and has top notch resources and a very tightly knit organization. From their Biz Ops team, to a multi-channel sales team - all the way down to the most cutting edge sales enablement tools - their process is super clean. 
- The people. The main reason the majority of folks stay at Signpost is the relationships you make. The biggest loss for me were the relationships, and people I could no longer see everyday. 
- Earning potential. For a start-up, the compensation model is very aggressive. Obviously, funding is what makes this possible - a business operating on it's own cash could never sell low and compensate high.","- Leadership. Leadership. Leadership. If you're a ""head down"" or ""don't give a rat's tail"" kind of person, Signpost is a great out of college opportunity to get your feet wet. Not great for long term.
- Directors seem to never be held accountable. Likely you'll find emails in your inbox on a weekly basis, that are stressful and pressuring, all the while you constantly feel like your job is on the ropes.  
- Moving the needle and making a difference in a rep's performance. You never seem to feel inspired, instead, you likely feel you're always spoken to in a condescending matter.
- Experience. Looking at their recent hires for heads of key departments, you clearly see that Signpost is now bringing in very seasoned professionals. However, a large theme seems to endure in their previous leadership model: rewarding tenure, and ""hitting quotas"" above competence and merit. Just because you can sell, does not mean you're stacked to duplicate yourself and lead. 
-Suffering at the hand of inexperienced/young micro-managers
- Keg openings seem like the only form of motivation rather than getting in the trenches with the team 
- For you. For me. Against me. These are three things you'll find that most are trying to discover about the people they engage with. You find yourself feeling that most the leaders are for themselves, and in some cases - even against you.
- Churn. churn. And not the butter making machine. Highest churn rates of all time. On the client side: retention rate in said to be in the 90 percentile - this can't be true. On the rep side: Majority of tenured reps seem to be looking for other work, or gone. No sense of real value to the job - seems like most learn very quickly that they're not being developed, so it becomes a means of building a resume to move on."
283,Signpost ,Sales Representative,2016-01-30,5.0,Sales Representative,The training at Signpost is the best in class. In all sales there are highs and lows but the managers and the people who work at Signpost make it worth it. I can't imagine working anywhere else and having the same professional and personal support. Everyone wants you to be successful and they give you the support and tools to make it happen. At the end of the day it's sales and the success won't happen unless you work hard and make it happen.,Like all startups there are a lot of changes and challenges. If you want to learn something new everyday and have a challenge then startups are for you.

291,Signpost ,Extremely happy with this company!,2015-12-05,5.0,Sales Executive,"I moved to Austin to work at an internet marketing startup which after researching, found out was the best place for that. I interviewed at many of the marketing startups here. Ultimately I chose Signpost because of its more comprehensive product. 6 Months later I couldn't be more happy with that decision. 
This job is a grind and I love it. If you want a sales job and want to succeed you are going to have to sacrifice some of your personal time regardless of where you go. You will not meet a successful salesman anywhere that says sales is easy. But this is most definitely a pro.
PLEASE do not even apply here if you consider yourself to have anything other than a very strong work ethic and drive. You will not be happy and you will not make it very far (just like a lot of the scrubs who have posted reviews on here as ""former"" employees.) 
On the flip side if you like to work hard you WILL be rewarded in every way. If you commit yourself you will make somewhere in the general 6 digit realm after no time at all. Also promotions come very quick. Not to mention all the small perks such as constant free meals, fun events, benefits, friends, stock options etc.
Management is great as well. I've seen many people on here say the management micromanages way too much. If you look at this logically, yes the people posting that probably were micro-managed. But due to the fact that they are no longer there means they probably needed that because they were getting distracted or weren't putting out simple effort metrics that the vast majority of the rest of the company is. In my experience, my managers have helped me out tremendously not only to become a better salesman but a better person in general. Communication and time management skills are vital in any career. And Signpost does a fantastic job of instilling these skills into muscle memory.
Management is very open about the fact that they don't expect many people to work at Signpost for the rest of their life. They make it clear Signpost is simply a great career stepping stone. Regardless of what you want to do in the long term, the skills you will learn at Signpost are invaluable. 
There have been many successful reps at Signpost who have moved on to very high level enterprise level sales roles with other companies.
Being part of a startup is exhilarating. The constant change ensures nothing becomes repetitive or stagnant. The executives dump large sums of money not only to ensure the reps are happy but that we have the most cutting edge tools at our disposal. Also recently the money invested into allocating better leads as well as getting marketing collateral on the tables of small business owners around the country is sure to pay off.
After 6 months Signpost still gets two thumbs up from me!","This job takes a lot out of you. But the rewards of your hard work will not go unnoticed and will surely pay off both short and long term.
There is a learning curve as with any entry level sales job, but Signpost has put together a fantastic training program that will ensure if you make it off the training team you will be a killer rep."

Snacks, beer, bagels, happy hours, and fun team based culture.

Signpost is a great intro to sales, especially the SMB market. If you're looking to launch a career in sales, SP is a great place to start; but don't stay too long unless you want management. It's perfect to get your foot in the door at another position that will require 2-5 years of entry level sales experience.

The product is great, but 85% of the leads are for industries that make no sense for the platform, they're just easy merchants to sell to.","Signpost not only fully embraces micromanagement and high pressure sales in a boiler room, transnational atmosphere; it's proud of it. 3 hours of talk time or 150 dials. Nothing wrong with that, just know going in. 

Your manager will spend most of the day sitting in the pod, barging your calls so that when an opportunity arises, they can jump on and feed you lines - usually 30 minutes into a sales conversation that he/she didn't listen to at all. They will not only micromanage your activity, they will micromanage your words as well.

For vast majority of the veterans, that's all they've ever known of the sales world, so perpetuating the standard of 150 dials is very important for the culture. Very high turnover rate and people will sign up merchants knowing they are a terrible fit for the platform - most SaaS companies will turn away people who the platform will not work for."

There is a clear promotion path that allows anybody who can sell consistently over 3+ months a chance to move up and increase their base salary. The culture is fun, and if you're just getting out of college and are in your early 20's then working at Signpost could be ideal for you. Hopefully you're comfortable around alcohol, too, cause there's a keg in the office that flows on occasion and drinking at work/work events is preferred.","This is an entry-level position. Management micromanages their employees. Poor communication, contradicting ""leaders"" and incompetent at times when faced with different/challenging situations. It's like they can't think outside of the sales script and status quo, and this hinders growth and innovation.

Also, extremely high employee turnover. A lot of talent slipped away because of poor management and a questionable product. I understand this is sales but the retention rate is ridiculously low and that's a bad reflection on leadership. Maybe don't act like you know everything all the time and people will be loyal to you instead of laughing under their breath about what a joke Signpost and its software can be. The culture is fun and i appreciate the social aspect, but within just a couple weeks of starting here it is painfully obvious that the job sucks and many people feel this way not just me... I promise.

Maybe 5 out of the 100+ employees are at $100,000/year so sure, you can make a solid income if you work really hard, but you can work hard somewhere else and definitely be doing something more enjoyable and then make even more money. Don't get stuck on this idea that ""you can make a lot of money here"" pitch that management will certainly preach. Most employees are making just more than minimum wage. It's kind of a joke, really.

If you want to party and get a little sales experience and make some extra beer money then work at Signpost. If you're a professional trying to make a career and do something with your life, this is not the place for you."

309,Signpost ,We win.,2015-09-02,5.0,,"Signpost Wins. If you have a positive attitude, a desire to win/succeed, and the abilitiy to sell or communicate then Signpost may be for you. If you're lazy, incompetent, or have a poor work ethic you WON'T make it here.","Parking sucks, and Denver traffic is always horrible. Also building insulation is bad."
310,Signpost ,Sales Representative,2015-09-01,5.0,Sales,"This is by far the best work environment I have ever been in. The coaching I have received from the management team, in addition to the support that everyone in the office gives to each other, is incredible. I come into work knowing that I'm going to continue to grow every day because I'm going to be pushed to the point of being uncomfortable. This job is hard, and it isn't glamorous. But the confidence I have gained in myself and my abilities is irreplaceable.","It's very cold in the office, and we're always out of Dr. Pepper"
311,Signpost ,Do your job and you will make lots of money,2015-08-31,5.0,Senior Sales Executive,"I have worked at Signpost for a little over year, and in that time I have received a $15,000 pay raise and two promotions. I also generally do well with commission.  The thing about sales is that you have to put in the work to make money, and it is no surprise that if you slack off your checks won't be as big. They make this very clear from the beginning of the interview process. I have had months of $10,000 in commission and $0, but the great thing about working here is that every month you get a fresh start, and it is super easy to pick your head up and try harder, as long as you're willing to stay positive and put in the work. 
As far as the promotion path goes, it is a clearly laid out plan, and easy for anyone to achieve. Upper management is extremely supportive and really cares about their reps, and they work  hard to make sure that we are successful.  It is also very hard to get fired from here, you literally have to be drunk or just not doing your job to be terminated. I've never felt like my job was in jeopardy, even when I have had bad months. 
These are some of the best people I have ever worked with. This is the only place I have ever worked where I actually look forward to seeing my co workers everyday. I also really appreciate how often my voice is heard, upper management is really great about listening to us when we have suggestions.",Too much hard house.
312,Signpost ,Signpost Wins!,2015-08-31,5.0,Sales Representative,"There are many great things about working at Signpost: the culture, the people, the many activities (in and out of the office), the encouragement, the keg...but the thing that probably stood out to me the most is the constant training. Make no mistake--especially if you are new to sales--you WILL work. Hard. Sales is not an easy job. But Signpost definitely provides you with the tools to be successful. While it may be intimidating when you start dialing that phone, the one thing you won't be is unprepared. At least as far as knowing what you're selling--those people on the other end of the phone can be unpredictable!! And the training is constant. From product updates to strategies on being a better salesperson, you are constantly learning. From there it's up to you what you do with it. Okay, now that I say all that, maybe the training is 2nd to the people. Because they are the ones providing the training, the encouragement and the feedback. Everyone here does their best to help one another out and the culture makes you want to do the same for them. It is definitely a team/family atmosphere.","Like I said above, sales is not easy. Don't come in expecting a constant party. A lot is expected of you--that in itself is not a con: if you don't want to work hard then don't bother applying. But it does take a certain type of personality to work in sales. I guess none of this stuff is really a con about Signpost per se, but more a warning to anyone who is looking for an easy job. You gotta work hard to play hard!"
313,Signpost ,Signpost: Or the Unexpected Virtue of Maturity,2015-08-19,5.0,Senior Sales Executive,"Reading the reviews that have made their way onto this page lately would make one think that Signpost is literally a pyramid scheme of indentured servitude, when it is obviously anything but. Reader beware, what follows this review is a long a sordid tale of the CLEARLY vengeful and disconsolate. People want to work at Signpost, as I think is evident by the amount of fervor one individual has chosen to convey in their poorly written tirades. The truth of the matter is that this is a JOB first and foremost - poor attitude, work ethic, and LYING are reasonable grounds to terminate employment.  If you want to succeed at this job and continue to be held in high esteem you must do three simple things: work hard, be coachable, and have a positive attitude. Sales is not a career for everyone, but anyone who says that they came into this job with a  promise of making big bucks right off the bat is nothing but a liar. Everyone and anyone who goes through the interview process is put through a rigorous test. For christ sakes, we are cold calling small business owners. I came into this job with little to no sales experience and in 10 months have been promoted twice - because I worked my butt off. I actually have no butt anymore that is how hard I have worked. The culture of Signpost is yes, that of a start up, but ultimately the clear vision of the executive board has allowed for it to be open to growth and improvement. There is a clear path for promotion, how to be successful, a team that legitimately cares about you if you put forth the effort, and a desire to be the best. What I gather from people that do not succeed here, or ultimately ones that get themselves fired, is that they have little to no understanding how real life works and have been coddled by the frame of immaturity since birth. If I leave you with anything from this jumbled composition of words and phrases.... please let it be this, ""grow up"". If you want to work for a company that will challenge you in ways you never thought possible, work  at Signpost. If you want to work for a company that will hold your hand until you are ready to fly free... find another place.",They no longer play Pitbull.
314,Signpost ,Selling your soul for 25k,2015-08-18,1.0,Sales,"I am attempting to think of one but quite frankly my physics homework was easier.

Ok, ok... The free bagels were nice and you will make some good friends.","If you want to make 150 dials a day and your landlord only cares if you can make rent half the year--by all means, apply.

I have been with this company for over a year and a half and I'm warning all applicants to not fall for the lies during the interview process.They have a hiring quota to fill and will do almost anything to hit numbers.
 
Every person I know who works here is either looking for another job or riding the short high of a promotion. (This will die out very quickly and then they will return to their initial state of melancholy) 

To give you some insight to what it looks like to work here:
Your superiors pretend to care about you as you miserably cold call 150 people a day. In fact they care more about you hitting metrics than you making money! Oh and the great part is that about 140 of the calls you make result in getting yelled at or hung up on. Meanwhile, the 'superiors' will partake in  countless elitist meetings (even a catered weekly lunch) where they congregate and literally just talk poorly about their reps. Also, they discuss how to 'push reps out' if they aren't doing well so they don't have to deal with firing them. This means ignoring them and making their life even more unbearable till they quit. 

So there's that. 

The company will sell you on its culture. (Consequently, something that all startups have.) What you have to ask yourself... Is free beer (even though the keg is frequently empty anyways) worth the of risk making only 25k a year? Oh and that 25k is before the severe taxes that come along with the job. But go ahead and enjoy the stale brew. 

Other perks of the job include selling a product that doesn't work. You get to screw over innocent small-business owners daily! Everyone who works here is aware of this but management still pretends to believe in it. (Maybe it's all the kool-aid they ingest during their top-secret meetings) The best lie you get to tell is that we have a 97% retention rate! I would be shocked if the actual number was over 30. Again, this is something they will never admit.

In the end people are disposable at Signpost. The second you begin to waiver in your position and stop making your manager money... See ya. Wouldn't it be better to work with your reps rather than disregard them and kick them when they are down?They even fired the one  manager who actually cared about her reps and was top in the company without a second thought. If you see the review entitled ""lacking loyalty"" below you will see this is a habit of Signpost to fire even their top employees. Additionally when they do so, they do it in a distasteful manner and if there is controversy over the firing they will make up fallacious reasons for the termination. Overall a quality group of imbeciles running the Denver office!

316,Signpost ,Best culture around and 100+ doors will open,2015-08-07,5.0,Senior Sales Executive,"I have made some of my best friends here, and met lifelong career mentors. Cold calling is not easy, its not respected the way it should be, and it definitely takes a certain type of person to succeed at this job. If you see yourself being successful at sales, there is no better place to start that training than here. I get recruited by Forbes listed top companies left and right because of my affiliation with Signpost.","Don't apply to Signpost if you are just ""looking for a job"" and ""aren't sure of what you want to do when you grow up"" This place takes hustle and dedication. Cold calling is a true art and if you want to make some serious money here, you have to take it seriously and work hard. Some people aren't cut out for it."
317,Signpost ,Best Place to Start a Sales Career,2015-08-03,5.0,Senior Sales Executive,"Signpost's leadership is dedicated to consistent improvement across the board and the wellbeing of it's people - especially those who continue to perform and grow. Over the past year, I've personally experienced 4 different pay raises and 2 promotions. Management continues to take feedback seriously on the quality of work/life within the organization and a very black and white picture has been painted for promotional paths - there's no gray area when it comes to the sales floor. Up front there is very clear and attainable criteria for getting to the next level, next pay boost and next perk. 

As with any tech start up there are learning curves, changes and evolutions within the company. What's more important here is less that these things happen and more how the organization from the top down approach those changes - which is always with taking care of people first in mind. Everyone at the executive and upper management level is 100% approachable and open to feedback from their sales reps. I've had multiple situations where VP's, C-level execs and heads of departments asked me for feedback on the sales cycle from the floor - a trait that usually gets lost in most companies when they scale to being large organizations. In other words, it still feels like you're part of a 5 or 10 man crew in terms of being close-knit, while having all the perks and benefits of larger corporations.","The largest team at Signpost is the sales team, know that if you aren't prepared to have sales as a career, it's probably not going to be a great fit for you (unless you're applying for engineering, account management, etc) and it will probably be frustrating because of the nature of sales. But know that if it's something you're looking to develop as a skill, that you're in the best hands possible."

Signpost, however, proved me wrong about my assumptions.  I was immediately warmly welcomed into the office and realized that although all Signpost employees are very driven and hard working, they are also incredibly friendly and helpful.  It is amazing that such a large office can maintain a positive attitude and high spirit everyday.  Signpost prides itself on a ""Work Hard, Play Hard"" philosophy.  All employees come into the office ready to kick butt and Signpost does a fantastic job rewarding them for their efforts.  We host tons of Happy Hours in order for the staff to mingle outside of work in hopes to promote team work at the office.  We love for everyone to feel comfortable with each other.

The people definitely make my job awesome; we're all close in age and have a solid team mentality.

The culture promotes a winning attitude and a family mentality. I definitely feel the ""we're building this together"" vibe from all departments.

The product has improved exponentially since I started and continues to improve. It's great to know that Account Managers can help guide the direction and development through their regular interactions with clients.","The product still needs improvement but this falls under pros and cons. 

The starting pay isn't great for Account Managers (typically starting at Junior Account Management) as a whole but this improves as you continue to work there and prove yourself. 

The environment is fast-paced and constantly changing. I personally enjoy this but some people can't handle it or simply don't enjoy it.

It was been an absolute pleasure to work here. The office is filled with young, bright and extremely knowledgeable individuals, always willing to help. The atmosphere is energizing, and a great balance of work and personal life. Signpost provides great benefits. The company does great things as a whole, between office events, happy hours, etc. They participate in Sports leagues which builds relationships, and every day is a new learning experience.",Can be overwhelming at times.

Start-up culture","They are misleading about the role and the company during interviews, especially regarding promotional path
There is a ton of turnover at entry-level positions, they don't seem to value employees at that level
High pressure, minimal pay
Management is misleading and deceptive
The product doesn't work 
Highschool-esque drama - and lots of it"
331,Signpost ,"In the market of selling hopes & dreams, I was just hoping to make rent",2015-04-08,2.0,Sales Representative,"The culture is the one thing Signpost really has going for them. They have hired a group of enthusiastic young adults that get to share in their success and team work. This could be completely false now though, few people last longer than a year there (just long enough that no one has shares that ever vest).

The managers are great and try really hard to make the best out of a tough situation.","Everything else outside of the people around me. In my interview, I was told there was a direct path for vertical advancement, in your first year, you're likely to make over $35K, and that over 60% of the office makes sales quota (providing a whopping $1,000 commission check). Within a couple weeks into this new position, I realized both of these to be explicitly false. Management had been a long-term goal of mine in the office, but after seeing over 5 people overlooked for upper management, I realized my yearn for advancement would be just like basically everything else there, just a hope and dream. 

I also realized that if you can't make quota, you're basically not making a living. What is interesting to me is that I was struggling on their $20K base + commission, but if you are a new applicant to this position- say goodbye to the base, you're on 100% commission (so good luck eating dinner every night). Oh yeah, and for those who don't understand taxes, commission is considered a bonus and taxed heavily- typically between 25-42%. 

The training process is yet another downfall of this startup. Though the managers were great at teaching basic sales tactics and objection training, but you build a relationship with them upstairs, apart from the actual sales floor, gain comfort on the phones, and then as a reward to you “graduating” training, you’re thrown into a pit of basically strangers, with a manger who does not know your selling style or how to help, essentially putting you back to square one for a couple of weeks until your team warms up to you. 

Welcome to a glorified boiler room. Signpost may have a keg, snacks, and fun music on all day, but you’re a work horse living on scraps. Signpost is trying to make a name for themselves in an extremely saturated market, their product has far to go in order to become a key player in their industry. For those with ANY sales experience, your talent is best put elsewhere. If you're right out of college with no work experience, this may be a job for you, but you'll probably make more money as a server."
332,Signpost ,Feel-good,2015-04-02,3.0,Sales Manager,"Your coworkers are your friends, the culture is young and feels deliberately like a startup. Reps and managers alike are held to standards and metrics that are clear and articulated, and upper management does a great job inspiring everyone to buy-in and actually care about the team/continued success of the company.","There have been comments about the lack of transparency within the company, and to a certain extent that is true. However, my biggest complaint is that my training as a salesperson and as a sales manager did not expand my skill-set or add significantly to my sales toolkit. Being a Sales Manager here felt like being a Junior Counselor at summer camp. All fun, no substance."

I really am grateful for the time I spent here and the amount of support everyone gives each other.","The base salary is not that high, but if you put in the work and realize you will have good days and bad days you will be successful.

They hire social, personable youngsters to work the phones, so making friends is a breeze. The Denver office is very nice, happy hours are in no short supply, and there are some running distractions that border on fun most of the time. Making a sale is legitimate rush, and as an experience thats in my rear view I'm glad I spent a few months here. I'm also am glad I shoveled sand for a summer a few years back, but I wouldn't do that again either.","Its a call center. You are making 130 dials a day, most of the 'leads' are legitimately and openly bothered by you. These are business owners who are getting called ALL DAY by people trying to sell them everything from cash registers to shampoos to marketing platforms.

Regardless of tenure or performance, the managing team there always has your side and takes the time out of their day to help you instead of sending an emailing or just barking at you what to do. Cannot say enough nice things about this place, I'm so lucky to have had the experience and recognize what good management looks like.",Finacially it can get difficult.
337,Signpost ,It's... a company.,2015-03-17,2.0,Sales Representative,"The people who work here are amazing-- you'll meet a lot of people who care about you, you'll make a lot of close friends, and you'll have a lot of fun with your coworkers, both at work and outside of work. The perks aren't bad-- lots of potlucks, happy hours, and the ability to win prizes in contests. Salima is cool. People honestly seem to care about training you to be a good salesperson.","Where to start... the company is growing too fast and it's creating a lack of solvency with the product itself. There's a lot of suspicious separation between sales and CX/ a lack of transparency between the two divisions because people aren't satisfied with the product. You get the creeping feeling that you may be screwing people over. There's also a fair amount of favoritism-- upper-level employees make it pretty clear who they like and dislike. As someone who grew up in the north-east, I was also shocked at the level of racism in the office. Lots of white people, lots of weird, anti-Asian sentiment. If you're on the sales team, get ready to either never get time off or very begrudgingly be granted time off. I once asked off for a close relative's funeral and was told by my manager I couldn't go because my numbers weren't high enough (in the second week of the month). 
You'll also end up working late hours/ weekends some months-- it can be hard to justify 50+ hours a week for a 20K base. That's probably everyone's biggest complaint-- the base pay is nothing. Every other tech sales company is going to pay you more. Mainstreet Hub, Oracle, Yodle, LivingSocial, anywhere. 
Also, since the company can't seem to hire a good recruiter OR generate any good leads, get ready to work overtime for no pay hawking the company for new hires and ""sourcing your own leads"" (they act like they're doing you a favor by allowing you to do this extra, unpaid work, also)
Basically, if you want to work for no money doing a repetitive, mindless, stressful job while loud music blares from sun-up to sun-down while some white guy in a polo yells at you about your ""numbers"" and you wonder whether or not you're actually doing any good in the world, apply here. It's a call-center that plies its employees with booze and small gifts so that people forget that it's just your run-of-the-mill churning out revenue/ churning out sales call-center."

- The staff does a really good job of creating a hip, ""start-up"" culture environment
- Great location in close proximity to breweries, restaurants, and bars","- This is a telemarketing position, plain and simple. You're calling small businesses (over 100 calls per day) and HOUNDING them aggressively about an over priced service. Your sale to call ration = 1:150.
- Your motivation = a bribe of snacks and happy hours.
- The product is nothing special nor worth the cost.
- Sales Representatives = Cattle. During the interview process it was very apparent that they were simply looking for bodies rather than personalities and team members. Furthermore, THERE IS AN INCREDIBLY HIGH TURNOVER RATE (hm, I wonder why...) hence why they are constantly hiring and have such a great referral rate. 
- It is evident that the higher-ups are simply exploiting the large ""sales team"" in order to boost numbers so that they can cash in once they are bought or go public."

342,Signpost ,"Incredible company, world-class people, great place to grow",2015-02-15,5.0,Senior Sales Executive,"If you're hard-working, competitive, and teachable, the opportunity at Signpost is practically limitless.

I work with people who broke six figures in their first year on the phones.  Six figures, as in they made over $100,000.  These are the outliers, not the norm, but my point here is that if you work hard, and you're good at your job, you get compensated very well.

Managers give lots of personalized attention and genuinely care about their reps.  Training sessions are organized, instructional, and very hands-on.  Even if you have no sales experience coming into this position, if you apply yourself you'll be given the tools and the direction you need to be successful.

Comp and training aside, my favorite things about Signpost are the people and the culture.  The happy hours, the kegerator, and the ping-pong table are all great perks, but what I really love about Signpost is that I'm surrounded by positive, hard-working individuals who are dedicated to helping each other achieve their goals.  I've never worked someplace where coworkers are this supportive of each other, it's like playing on a sports team again.

I love my team, I love my office, and I love my company.","To anyone interested in working for Signpost, here's what you need to know before you start:

1) If you want to succeed here, you need to be prepared to consistently work very hard.  You control your own destiny, and if you are are lazy and/or negative, it will adversely affect your compensation.

2) This is inside sales, and you will be cold-calling small business owners.  Meaning you will get hung up on, cursed at, etc.  You have to be able to manage your own personal psychology and still be positive, cheerful, and respectful in spite of some of the people you talk to on the phones.

3) If you don't produce, the base salary is low enough that you will not last longer than a few months.  Plain and simple, the commission structure is set up so that if are good at your job, you will get paid very, very well, and you'll actually get huge bumps to your base salary in several months once you've proven yourself.  Otherwise, if you aren't working hard and you aren't producing, then you probably aren't cut out for this sort of gig and should go work someplace else."
343,Signpost ,Fun place to work... for the most part,2015-01-28,3.0,Sales Associate,"Very active and fun company culture, Management was always willing to assist those in need for the most part.",They hook you with a great recruitment speech... then you get out of training. If you don't fit the culture or if they don't think you do your left to fend for yourself.
344,Signpost ,A fun but challenging line of work,2015-01-09,4.0,Sales Representative,"Plenty of training sessions that are actually helpful for any sales career. The office and the people are fun and energetic (average age is probably around 28-29 with music always playing, usually rap unfortunately; ping pong, Bball, team building exercises, monthly pot lucks). Team leads are all very supportive and selflessly want their reps to succeed. Great transparency of the company to all employees. Promising future for company growth and expansion meaning the chance of getting promoted is encouraging (""No one has worked here for a year without getting promoted""). My first and only sales job that I've actually enjoyed so far. I would recommend this position to any young and hungry entry level sales people.","Hard to live comfortably on this income, but there is great potential to make a lot of money. I think if you meet quota you get about 30-35k. Unofficially expected to put in time outside of work hours. No lead development so most calls are dead ends. Pretty high employee turnover rate, as with any start up. I've seen people show up late and have to wear a dunce hat for half the day... that's probably illegal. The market for this kind of product is pretty saturated."
345,Signpost ,Recent graduates beware - this is a cold calling center.,2015-01-03,1.0,Sales Representative,"Nice peers.
Cool office.
Handful of very talented inside-sales individuals. 
CEO is a nice guy.","This is a glorified call center and you are the telemarketer, do not let any job description fool you.
A handful of these five star reviews are written by interns who are told to do so...
Only five days of training and for a recent graduate this could feel very rushed and overwhelming. 
After your second week you will begin to realize that the service offered is not very unique and does not seem to work.
Feels like you just joined a fraternity or sorority.
BBB rating dropped to a B- over time and then mysteriously shot back up (read some of the reviews and determine if you want to be selling this sort of service all day long to small business owners who do not have large marketing budgets)
Sales management is your friend half of the time and not present or aloof the other half of the time. 
Sales reps drop like flies.
Path to promotion is clear but the promotions are actually just 5k pay increases. You will continue to do the same work (cold calling) regardless if it is your second week on the job or if you are a senior sales executive. 
Very few reps are actually making the amount you read about or are told of on an interview.
Turnover rate is extremely high, but this is not just with Signpost but inside sales as a whole. 

You would be much better off in the long run finding a entry-level position with a  formal training program even if it isn't with a flashy company or industry if you are truly interested in starting a career in sales."
346,Signpost ,I have been working at Signpost for under one year.,2015-01-02,4.0,Sales Executive,There is no politics involved in the promotional path.  Equal opportunity for growth among all levels of the sales floor.,"Compensation is low but as is to be expected with a sales role at a startup.  However, while the salary is low the possibility for high commissions and bonus's are possible.."
347,Signpost ,A Dream for Young People Looking to Start Their Professional Career,2014-12-21,5.0,Sales Associate,"Signpost is an amazing place to work. While it is easy to love the obvious benefits (startup environment, keg in the office, regular events and great camaraderie), this place is really amazing because of the support they provide. Constant regular training, managers that are always willing to help out and coach you (even while on a call), and a real sense of satisfaction in signing up a new small business knowing that this platform will really help them.","Sales is sales! Not everyone is a perfect fit for a high pressure phone sales environment, but if you are able to take the right attitude this job can be immensely rewarding."
348,Signpost ,Great place to take on opportunities,2014-12-16,5.0,Product Manager,"As the company grows, so does the set of responsibilities and opportunities, and employees are rewarded for taking initiative and responsibility.  I generally have control over my hours for the most part.  The office has a fun and encouraging work environment, that includes a ping pong table and a lot of positive energy.  Things move quickly at the company, which generates a lot of challenges (a good place to grow your career if that sounds like a positive to you).","With rapid growth and change, coordination between teams can be a challenge, but is improving."
349,Signpost ,A real whirlwind,2014-12-08,4.0,,"Fast paced, fun environment, keg in the office, super casual. There are lots of ways for you to hone your skills, and plenty of opportunities for you to train yourself in different things. Very motivated team, really great camaraderie. 3 weeks paid vacation plus flex holidays.","Not a lot of opportunities to move up in certain departments. Free pizza instead of overtime pay. Pay can be a bit low as well. It's a start up, so there's lots of growing pains--the building is a bit small as well, but they're working on changing that."
350,Signpost ,"A fun, energetic company with a vision",2014-11-19,4.0,Sales Associate,"The training program is great and concise, the healthcare benefits are awesome, and the management go out of their way to help every employee learn and succeed. The atmosphere is fun and there is a lot of camaraderie and friendly competition between coworkers. Rapid company growth means great new opportunities with the product, which really is helpful for small and medium size businesses.","Company growth is not necessarily a good thing for longer-standing employees, and the turnover rate is incredibly high. High-pressure nature of the job (cold calling businesses) is certainly not for everybody. While opportunity for decent earnings is present, it is very difficult to achieve and base salary has a lot of room for improvement."
351,Signpost ,The best decision I made to start my career!,2014-11-18,5.0,National Sales Executive,"If you had asked me 2 years ago when I was graduating college that I would be doing inside phone sales I would have told you that you were crazy. I was drawn to Signpost because of the product and the culture - being part of a startup was appealing to me. Little did I know that I would be where I am today. I've been promoted 3 times in a little over a year, and now hold one of the most senior sales positions in the company. Talk about upward mobility.

The product is fantastic. I've seen it change, evolve and improve enormously over the last year, and I'm proud of that. A product should never be stagnant, especially in the tech space, and I'm confident that our team has been improving the product based on EXACTLY what our clients want and need. We truly do empower small businesses every day.

The culture is equally as fantastic. The organization is very flat. Everyone always claims that executives have an ""open door policy"" but at Signpost it's actually true - there actually are no doors! You have lunch/drinks with the CEO, can ping the VP of Revenue when you need something, and direct management is extremely supportive in improving your sales skills. The training is great, as it's ongoing, and EVERYONE from management to the people next to you, is willing to help you out.","Things change. That's understandable though. The offices are growing, policies that were never necessary before change, sometimes career and promotion paths are altered, and sometimes communication between different departments can be difficult."
352,Signpost ,Make an impact on the company and on your personal skillset,2014-10-10,5.0,Software Engineer,"Here's a list of things I've come to love about Signpost:

Contribute - impact the codebase or infrastructure in a real, meaningful way (from day 1) and get the much-sought-after opportunity to witness the positive effects your contribution has made
 
Feedback - you'll know when something is right (or wrong!), and quickly. Signpost encourages high visibility for all its projects and requires candid code reviews for every code change.

Atmosphere - a high-energy start-up environment is energizing in many respects, but Signpost knows that engineers work best when given personal space to get work done. The main takeaway: the engineers care about the product and want to see it succeed.

Culture - I'd describe the culture as thoughtful and results-driven. It's always best to get a problem solved quickly, but make sure to think hard about what 'solved' means to you and your customers.","I won't list any cons here, because every real issue I've come across has been quickly handled by a quick conversation. I'm confident that will be the case for all future issues, large or small."
353,Signpost ,You Get Out What You Put In,2014-10-08,5.0,Sales Representative,"Signpost is an extremely interesting and exciting company to work for.

The company culture is great! It is the epitome of a start-up, tons of young people, direct access to top management including the CEO, a keg, etc.

The way the company is structured their is a ton of room for upward mobility. Basically, if your good you'll be given opportunities. Additionally, if you get started in sales that does not mean you have to stay there. After the first year you have the opportunity to move laterally within the company based upon your level of success and openings in the company.

Success in the sales division definitely takes a specific type of person/personality (self-drive, never quit mentality, lack of intimidation, ability to speak to communicate ideas clearly). However, if its for you you can do very well.

Finally, Signpost provides its employees with the tools they need to succeed. The training program is thorough, informative, and provides you with the skills necessary to hit the ground running from day one on the phones.

The interview process is straightforward and painless. The recruiters answered my questions honestly and fully informed me of the details of the job I would be performing.",This is a phone sales division. Like any other position of this type there are ups and downs.

-Direct line of communication between all ranks of employees, you will be getting high fives from JD (director of Denver office) after each sale, as well as encouraging emails. You will speak with the CEO about the weather or the quality of the coffee that day.
-Large social budget, ensuring that the toughness of a phone sales job will be rewarded with fun activities with your coworkers
-Massive support from management, weekly one on ones that help you figure out what can be improved on to make the job easier (including listening to play-backs of your own calls so you can pinpoint your own mistakes instead of just being told what they are)
-Emotional support from management- I have seen my manager, on more than one occasion, pull somebody outside because they were frustrated to talk to them and let them vent and help them get back to a point where they were feeling comfortable

-Benefits are good and kick in after graduation.

If you are not and you are hot-headed, probably not for you
-There are months that just don't go your way. There are months when you make tons of money and months when you don't. Have to understand sales."
358,Signpost ,*YOU GET WHAT YOU GIVE*,2014-09-25,5.0,Sales Representative,"Signpost has incredible employees. The people here consist of young/motivated individuals; and in-order to succeed here you need to be exactly that, MOTIVATED. Everyone that works here are the type of people you WANT to be surrounded by when it comes to not only a job atmosphere but also at a bar or at Wash Park on a Sunday afternoon. Everyone knows how to balance the seriousness of the job and put their noses to the grind stone but also kick back and enjoy life while they are doing it.

Some other reviews on here have complained about the interview process being long and honestly, if you aren't coming into a business to interview more than once then that business isn't taking enough time to hire quality individuals. My interview process consisted of two interviews... same as everyone here... and it actually gave me a better chance to understand the business, the culture, and if I actually could see myself working here. Throughout the interview process, no one beats around the bush, it's a hard job. And they come right out and tell you this.

The rewards of working here and being on the fore-front of something incredible is worth the struggle. Ever hear the saying, ""Nothing worth doing ever comes easy,"" well it couldn't be more true here at Signpost. You work hard, you play hard, and have a heck of a time doing it. Could not be more happy to be here.","It is not a job you are going to be able to come in and do half-a**. Because it does take a lot of effort and energy.

Cold calling is hard for anyone to do, and this is a great place to start getting some experience, especially for people right out of college. This is a rapidly growing company backed by top investors, you would be dumb to not take the opportunity to be a part of something with such great potential and regardless of the challenge, will give you great experience.","Compensation is tough to work for.

Gross.,"It was never mentioned that I would be joining a call center, where yelling is getting the sale. Fear tactics and threats to be fired by my third day is unreal in any HR book. I watched employees drop left and right; i.e. you are let go at two months automatically if you aren't selling the minimum (which is hard to do and the commission is worthless)."

If you don't take your lunch or break at the assigned time, then you don't get one.  You're cold calling Boiler Room style making 150 dials per day and begging and pleading trying to get people to listen to you talk.  Managers and directors also pop you with a whip if you don't hit nearly four hours of talk time per day.  Significantly over priced product in a market saturated with people doing the same thing."

We are all so positive and supportive of one another, and it's great working some place where we both compete against each other and cheer on each other's successes. Also the happy hours are super fun! 
-Career growth: The fact that you have the potential to raise your base by 10K in less than a year is huge, and with it the opportunity to help train and support new hires is huge. And the fact that the company is growing so quickly means that opportunities for greater management roles are there for those who work hard and want to make it happen for themselves!
-Product: For so many small businesses, Signpost really does help boost their online visibility and have a dramatic impact on their remarketing and retention. I love that I don't feel like a sleazy salesperson when I'm pitching people and getting people signed up. I know that I'm helping small businesses do something good for their business that they wouldn't or couldn't have done themselves.
-Leadership: I think the management team does a really good job of taking and implementing feedback, to the best of their abilities. Compared to other places I have worked, my opinion and ideas are valued tremendously here; that's part of what makes Signpost such a great place to work","-Lack of diversity!!! Especially in leadership positions, with regard to both race and gender. We're in the middle of freaking Texas, how is the office almost all white people?

370,Signpost ,A Great Place to Build Your Career,2014-06-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been at Signpost for less than a year and I have built my career more than I could have imagined. I started in sales, and found absolutely no success, but because of my hard work, the company offered my a position with the customer experience department as an account manager. 

Working for a start up, there are challenges, especially working in the developing customer experience department, but it also opens opportunities that would otherwise never be available. Since starting in account management, I have moved to a different office to help start the customer experience team in the Austin office and been promoted to a team lead promotion.

The environment is exactly what you'd want from a start up and everyone is driven to succeed.","If you're looking for a mindless easy job, you've come to the wrong place.

371,Signpost ,Exactly what I was looking for,2014-05-20,5.0,Software Engineer,"My many unrealistic goals in finding a new startup, all of which were met:

o A mature, experienced, gelled tech team with good communication skills.
o Broad full-stack opportunities to learn new technologies, do big things and take ownership.
o Top-of-the-line professional tools and processes (code reviews, continuous integration, deployment automation, etc)
o Passes the (modernized) Spolsky Test and Jeff Atwood's Programer Bill of Rights.
o Trustworthy and technologically adept leadership.
o Tolerant of remote employees and flexible for working at home periodically

Biz
o Get-it-done startup culture but with above average compensation and a highly professional environment.  
o A business model that doesn't need virality to succeed.
o Already making money with a solid sales team.
o Solid executive leadership with benign, helpful investors.
o Transparent, inclusive decision-making and information dissemination.
o Don't be evil.","Everything on my ""cons"" list from a year ago has been fixed and then some. Same for 6 months ago and I expect that to continue.  The main pain point right now is that there's so much we want to do and don't have enough tech resources."

Some of the more sr reps are frequently brought in on ideas and planning meetings to give their feedback and help shape the direction of the company.

- happy hours
- good training 
- opportunities to win prizes (amazon gift cards, bottles of liquor, etc) through competitions 

This is a good job for someone who is interested in sales. Unfortunately, I found a lot of the people hired either haven't done sales before so don't know exactly what to expect coming in or didn't want to do sales but ended up accepting the job because they ""had to"" and realize this is not a good job for them.","SALARY: base salary is really low. You could be hitting your minimum quota every month and only make a little over $30,000 per year. Few reps (maybe 15-20% out of the entire company) are making  $40-45,000+ per year. They'll say in the interview that top performers are making up to $80-90,000 but keep in mind these are only a handful of people and given the stressful and repetitive nature of cold calling it's not common people are consistently performing at these levels. 

SALES RELATED: 
- sales is hard and cold calling sucks unless it's what you're really passionate about. you should think hard about whether you want to be making 100+ outbound calls a day trying to persuade people who don't want to buy your product to buy. I had never done sales previous to this job and overestimated my ability or desire to cold call. 

- can get stressful having to constantly worry about hitting quota. you may be above quota one week or even one month but then it resets and you start from scratch again. this might be a stressful work environment for some 

- a lot of times you can only control your success to a certain degree. you can't control how high quality the leads you pull on a certain day are or how receptive the people you talk to will be. you could be doing the exact same thing one week to another but not see the type of performance (sales) you saw previously. 

- the job gets very repetitive and mundane. you're cranking out calls everyday giving mostly the same pitch to merchants. 

CAREER GROWTH: 
- they'll show you a career path with quick opportunities for promotions but all these promotions mean is a little bump on your base salary (5k each promotion). the job you're doing stays the same regardless of whether you get promoted from rep to exec etc. 

- no good career advancement after you hit senior executive status. In the Austin office at least, a lot of management hires are happening from the outside. and after hitting the senior exec status you can either move to the account management side (which is generally a pay cut since there isn't much of a bonus structure involved) or move to national sales which is just more of the same cold calling. 

- after you've been doing the job for a couple of months you don't learn any new skills. 

MANAGEMENT: 
- micro manage 
- not very good at empathizing-- they act like cold calling is rewarding and fun and never address the common pitfalls it can have 

OTHER: 
- turn around is REALLY high. (within 9 months 99% of the people that were in the office when I started were gone) 

- employee loyalty is low. even if you've been there for a long time and have been successful the company doesn't do anything to reward your loyalty (like being lenient when having an off week or month) and generally act like you are disposable since they are hiring extremely rapidly."

They had plenty of company happy hours where co-workers made me feel comfortable and part of the team. You can also make pretty good cash if you do well with sales.","Management is very unprofessional and rude. 1:1 can sometimes be awful. It's more about lecturing you than giving you advice or plans on how to succeed. Beware of mgmt. they will make it seem like they are nice, but once you are having a bad month, forget about it. On top of that, the Director was dating a Sales rep, who suddenly became a Team Lead? Isn't that against some company policies? Not at Signpost. Also, we feed a bunch of lies to most of our merchants. Sad to say that a lot of our merchants don't receive what we actually pitch."

The Denver office is a beautiful historic building in a great location near Coors Field and a handful of great local bars, and the office environment is optimistic and energetic. Everyone is supportive of each other and excited to be here, and it is great to be part of a company that is successfully growing while still maintaining a small business vibe - regular ""all-company meetings"" give an opportunity for everyone to get a peek behind the scenes and feel involved with the direction of the business, and the CEO can be just as approachable as the office manager. Base salary is a bit low, but opportunities to earn uncapped commission give everyone the opportunity to succeed. I never dread coming in to work in the mornings and often find myself making plans with my colleagues in the evenings and weekends.","Phone sales can only be so enjoyable. Though we receive numerous trainings and opportunities to develop as salespeople, a rough day on the phones can still be difficult. Be prepared to experience rejection a lot, though helping small businesses that do choose to sign up helps make up for it. Personal drama can often be an issue, an inevitable side-effect of a relatively young sales team."
376,Signpost ,Stellar team and management that listens!,2014-03-31,4.0,Senior Account Manager,Every division and every manager wants you to succeed. Your success is seen as the ground work for the organization. Best healthcare plan I've had in my professional career. Executives take feedback seriously and genuinely want to improve the Signpost experience.,The product and the makeup of the staff is constantly changing which takes adjusting to. There is a lot of project juggling; you really have to be organized to stay on top of things.
377,Signpost ,Great Place for an Entry Level Job,2014-03-28,4.0,Sales Representative,"The people here are all fun and supportive of one another.  The office is filled with young professionals who definitely embrace the work hard, play hard environment.  There are company happy hours, holiday celebrations, and there's even a keg in the office.","Not much to say here - would have appreciated a few more sicks days, but understandable that not too much time can be taken off in the field of sales."
378,Signpost ,Best Office with a Mountain View,2014-03-28,5.0,Sales Manager,"Signpost is such a great place to work for anyone looking to start a career. I started my career at Signpost right out of college with no sales experience, and I owe a lot to the company and management team in molding me into a successful sales rep that was able to be promoted to the Management level in just a little over a year. It is a great company for anyone to work at if you are looking for career growth, but also have an impact on the future of the company. If you put in the hard work and hit your numbers, you will be rewarded. 

One of my favorite things about Signpost are the people. You will never find a cooler much of co-workers at any other job. It isn't uncommon to see teams doing push-ups to amp themselves up after a sale, or another rep throwing a pie at a manager's face for losing in a team contest. Team v. Team or Office v. Office contests are a regular occurrence, as are office happy hours. 

Overall this is a great place to work and I owe a lot to them. Signpost has all of the benefit that most startups have - culture, keg in the office, awesome view of the mountains, general fun, we may or may not eat our lunch in a former horse stable - but also has the benefits that you look for in a job when you want to be successful and have a career.","It is a sales job - there will inevitably be good days and bad days. It can be hard for some reps who come to Signpost straight out of college with no experience to deal with rejection at first, so it is something that some reps have a hard time adjusting to."
379,Signpost ,Coolest office ever- right next to Coors Field!,2014-03-28,5.0,Sales Manager,"95% of the office is under 30 years old, so the environment is very fun and fresh. There is always music playing, and a keg in the office they open up at the end of the day. Like most tech start-ups, commission is uncapped and there are plenty of opportunities for career growth. You have the ability to get promoted with a $5K salary bonus in as little as 3 months from your start date. The office itself is a large brick building and a Colorado landmark, so the space is really unique  (the lunch room/conference room used to be an old horse stable). Contests are held regularly- I've won a Kindle, massages and free lunches in the past.","Training within all departments could use a little more structure, but it's a common problem with start-ups. I also"
380,Signpost ,Great company culture for young professionals,2014-03-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Challenging, fast-paced environment with very competitive compensation plans.  Beautiful office in the heart of lower downtown Denver.  The company has a very fun and competitive culture which is paired with an exciting product to sell.  The business model is strong and designed around helping small businesses grow.  The company promotes internal  promotions and leadership plans.  This company is growing and is the right place for determined young sales professionals to improve their sales skills.","The office structure is a little confusing because they are growing so much, but that seems like a good problem to have!"
381,Signpost ,"Best culture, Great opportunities, Free Beer",2014-03-28,5.0,Manager,"Awesome place to start my career. Started as a sales rep, promoted to Sales exec, moved across the company to help open up a new office, and have grown into the management team. 

There is literally no other company where I could have the experience I've had at this point in my career. What I tell people about my job is ""Although I never really enjoy getting up in the morning, I literally never dread coming to work.""

I left college ready to work, and this company gave me the tools and the opportunity to have the success that I have today. Couldn't recommend this job any more highly to someone who is ready to work their tail off to get what they want.","Typical startup growing pains - not as cushy an infrastructure as you might be used to, but that's part of the startup fun - never a dull moment. The base pay isn't what you'd want it to be, but that's because we reward overachievers with a strong bonus, not people who coast through the day. 

Also lots of hard work - this is not an easy sales job. If you're competent and exceeding your job, expect to get extra responsibilities. If you're the right person, you're probably not reading that as a con."
382,Signpost ,"A great culture, great growth opportunities, great place to learn",2014-03-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Signpost is a great place to launch a career in the tech space. All three offices have a very collaborative culture, one that builds individuals and teams up consistently. If you want to progress consistently, you have to make your own luck, which is a good thing. Hard work, innovative ideas, and going the extra mile are recognized and rewarded. Regardless of what department you are in, you will be able to learn how the company operates on various levels. If you ask for learning opportunities, you will receive them. The management team is young, but ""punch above their weight class"" in growing the company consistently. I've worked here over a year and now find myself in a management position, interacting with various teams working towards a common mission of building a great company.",Start-up growing pains will be a part of day to day life
383,Signpost ,Awesome place to work,2014-03-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The culture is one that I have not ever experienced.  Signpost is a great place to not only meet co workers but also long term friends.  Being able to work with people that are so great makes the actual job easy in my opinion.,Figuring our your groove is essential.  Everyone operates differently but you have to come in here determined in order to succeed.
384,Signpost ,Great learning experience,2014-03-26,5.0,Sales Manager,Signpost is a great place to work mainly because of the people that work there. It is a really open environment where you can learn a lot about sales/company growth. Hard work is acknowledged and rewarded.,We need to get more snacks!
385,Signpost ,Exactly as expected...Awesome!,2014-03-26,5.0,Current Employee,"Freedom of start up environment, great leadership and vision, fearless in adapting to small and medium sized business needs, perfect environment to learn the craft of inside sales","As with many start ups the fresh crop of entry level sales candidates have unreal expectations, and have trouble adjusting to the patience it takes to cultivate a real sales career"
386,Signpost ,Great place to learn sales and grow. Great company with a bright future.,2014-03-26,5.0,Sales,"Great Execs
Managers are sharp and very helpful
Great culture
If you work hard, you can make a lot",Cold calling is better here than the other company I worked for
387,Signpost ,Best NY start-up to launch your career,2014-03-26,5.0,Sales Manager,"Exceptional new hire training.
Young, start-up culture.
Talented execs across all departments - learn from the best!
Clear, structured promotional path.
Uncapped commission. 
Happy hours, keg in office!",Lower base salary than bigger companies (make up for it in commission though)
388,Signpost ,Awesome company,2014-03-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great company that is always updating and changing their product.  A lot of room for growth if you are a hard worker and a top performer.  Really good training program for those that have little to no sales experience.  Also really good culture/environment.  Highly reward high performance and hard workers.,Intense job that requires working hard and making a lot of calls.  May not be fitting for people that are a little lazy or uncomfortable getting outside of their comfort zone.
389,Signpost ,An opportunity to have impact on a growing business every day,2014-03-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The mission of helping local businesses and the people I'm working with at Signpost make it that I go to work excited every day. Everybody here has a voice and can have an impact on this growing business if you take charge.,"It's an evolving startup with an ambitious vision so you'll need to be prepared for unfinished products and processes, and as this is being addressed there may be significant changes from time to time."
390,Signpost ,Positive experience,2014-03-20,4.0,,"Smart people, in a hot a market",In a hard market to crack
391,Signpost ,Growing Office and lots of opportunity,2014-03-17,4.0,Sales,"- Tons of growth offering a lot of growth opportunity for hard working and dedicated people. 
- Great product that is taking over the marketplace
- Smart and Focused executive team driving the company in the right direction
- Fun and fast pace culture and office environment",- Still a start up so a lot of changes come with being on the ground floor - good for people who are flexible and like to work in a changing environment!
392,Signpost ,Signpost is an exciting place to work,2014-03-14,5.0,Software Engineer,"Working on the engineering team is awesome. Everyone is very smart and knowledgeable. You are given many opportunities to learn and develop as an engineer. There are several different teams, but we collaborate frequently. Meetings are kept to a minimum, so there is plenty of time to focus. The company really makes an effort to give engineers a great place to work. Signpost itself is growing very quickly.",Sometimes we run out of diet coke :(
393,Signpost ,Signpost Wins,2014-03-12,5.0,Sales Representative,"Culture! This is what attracted me to the company in the first place. I've worked in corporate offices with ""casual fridays"" as their attempt at culture and fun. Each day at Signpost is an adventure. Yes, there are some days that drag but there's not an employed person who would say each day working is awesome. Ultimately, there is a strong sense of team here, when people say Signpost wins, it's because there's a sense of community, we're all in it together, to make some money, bring home some fat commission checks and have some fun while doing it. Don't apply to Signpost if your in-chair dance moves are lacking. 

Ultimately this is a great place to work and one that rewards it's employees. Signpost truly does work to promote from within so if you want a chance to make some money and move vertically within a company (within a span of as little as 3 months).","Usual sales job cons. Sometimes the people you talk to are rude, they won't let you talk, etc. Also I would say the current white ale in the keg is a disappointment."
394,Signpost ,A great environment,2014-03-05,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Signpost is my fist official job out of college and I don't think I could have had a better experience thus far. The culture is by far the best part. On hard days of cold calling, it's nice to kick back and play a game of ping pong or enjoy a cold beer from the keg with good people. On days where merchants are hanging up on you, everyone is very supportive and positive. I have learned many techniques that will help me with in my future in sales. There is potential to make a lot of money and to be promoted fast, but you have to be willing to put in the work.","There are a few things I wish we had: There isn't much to learn after the initial training--once informed on the product and how to pitch it, not much changes and you will continue having meetings everyday on ways to ""improve"". The one thing I am disappointed in, is that there are not a lot of opportunities to move up in the rankings; instead of hiring and training within, they hire from outside for management/upper level roles. It would be nice if the company wanted to reward loyalty and hard work."
395,Signpost ,Great start-up company with unlimited potential for growth.,2014-02-28,5.0,Sales Executive,"I have been working at Signpost for the past 6 months and it has been one of the most beneficial experiences of my professional career.  As many of the previous reviewers have already stated, the culture of the company really is bar none.  Signpost has the heart of a start-up, and is recognized as one of the top 100 fastest growing companies in the United States by Forbes.  That being said, there is ample opportunity to grow within the company itself.  Promotions are based on performance and the upward mobility structure that is in place rewards hard work, ability, and determination.  Another great benefit is the uncapped commission structure so your performance is appropriately compensated.

Keep in mind, it takes a certain type of individual to be successful within an inside sales environment. The continuous training provided will provide you with the necessary skills to develop and nurture your potential, and give you the opportunity to advance and grow with a company that has nothing but positive outlook.  If you are hungry, determined, and looking to develop you career with a company that has an incredible culture, Signpost comes highly recommended.","As I mentioned earlier, it takes a certain personality to be successful in a position like this.  There are monthly quotas you must meet and there comes a certain amount of pressure with this.  Not necessarily a con, but be prepared."
396,Signpost ,"Fun Atmosphere, Bad Product and Management",2014-02-19,2.0,,"Atmosphere, most of the people are great. If you want to wear casual clothes and drink beer this is a great place for it.","Everyone wants things to get done but no one wants to do it. They talk about ownership but the upper management (directors) don't do anything. They don't know how to treat or retain their talent. There business model and numbers are fake and product is sub par at best. There is a lot of inter office relationships that happen between exec level management and entry level employees and you will soon be able to notice who the favorites are, which sadly are not the best performers."
397,Signpost ,"Great culture, challenging but very monetarily rewarding work",2014-02-18,5.0,Sales Executive,"There's an opportunity to have this as a first job and make as much as someone with 5+ years experience at a non-commission-based job. 

The culture is second to none. The people you work with are your true friends with whom you tap the keg at 6pm, go to happy hours and enjoy every day. 

Work stays at work--you won't really find yourself working after hours or on weekends. 

The company is growing non-stop.","To be a sales rep can be grueling, as effort in the short term doesn't always lead to short-term success. However, if you work hard and are adaptable, you will do well and the checks will reflect your effort. 

If you're not performing well, there is a lot of pressure and turnover rate is naturally a little higher than at companies where performance isn't measured in such a black-and-white way month over month."
398,Signpost ,Not worth your time and effort.,2014-02-09,1.0,Sales Representative,"""Start-up"" feel, young environment and team, casual dress code, 15 days of vacation, keg in the office, office events outside of work.",Very cold atmosphere overall. Office drama/gossip is a huge problem which makes the office incredibly unprofessional. You'll learn very quickly that the product doesn't work. The salary is low which is why there's such high turnover. Very stressful environment and upper management wants to have all the power.
399,Signpost ,"Positive, Rewarding Experience",2014-01-16,4.0,Senior Sales Executive,"As I was a Sales Representative throughout the entirety of my time with Signpost, I will only speak to that position. If you are a young, hungry individual who is eager to prove your worth in a sales role - Signpost certainly provides that opportunity. The environment is highly stimulating and generally very fun to be a part of. You will be properly trained and given ample time to shine. It is sales, of course, so whether or not you are successful ultimately will come down to your work ethic, your skills, and your willingness to learn - but that comes with the territory. Come in prepared, passionate, and ready to go and you will have a very good chance at success. 

The company itself is growing at a very fast rate. They just secured significant capital from an investment firm and I believe that will go a very long way. The CEO is as sharp as they come and is generally a very positive presence in the office. Executive Team is solid. Engineering is superb - led by a brilliant guy - continuing to grow. HR Manager is as good as you could ask for. Very fair, very reasonable - easy to talk to. Management in the NY office is excellent - they want the best for each and every representative there and will do whatever they can to further that initiative. 

Quick shout-out to the Director of Sales in the Denver, CO office. Used to work in NY, was my training manager. Absolute stand-up guy, excellent trainer, highly motivated - would recommend him to anyone, anywhere.

Enticing incentives to exceed quota are in place, competitions here and there to re-ignite motivation. Great people, positive culture, rewarding experience.","It's a start-up. There will inevitably be some hiccups along the road. Accept that, and you will be fine."
