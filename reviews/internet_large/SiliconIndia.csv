The company stoops to such a low level that it has to plead the 'terminated' employees to come back and work for them. 
They treat their employees like servants. Even if your health is critical, they expect you to come to office and work and sit for 10 hours. Not even a single leave is allowed, even if it is a sick leave. Only 2.5 leave is allowed that also quarterly. After that for every leave you take, you are marked LOP.
On probation no leave is allowed even if it is an emergency. The company expects you to work continuously for 6 months without taking any leave. 
And if you take a break in 10 working hours (apart from the lunch time), you will be marked LOP.  Even if you have worked in the company diligently, they will still hold back your salary. Every time you want to go out, you have to get a note signed by the TL without which you are not allowed to go out. 
Furthermore, they take away your incentives by telling some absurd story about how the incentives you earmed cannot be given to you. 
Apart from working from Monday to Friday, they will ask you to even take work home for the weekend for which you will never be paid. No extra money for overtime or working on Saturdays."

Regardless of the designation, be it writing, designing, sales, marketing or others, siliconindia ensures you work, no suffer for 10 hours a day (minimum) and ensures that you have absolutely no work-life balance. 

Known to promise a heavenly work environment for freshers, a 6 month probation (when you may be fired at any minute) period ensures that the innocence and smile is ripped right out of youngsters and prepares them to face the cruel world for the rest of their lives.","If your dream is to work in great ambiance, flexy hours, cabs to travel back & forth, sipping on hot coffee and eating food from the cafeteria, do not worry, siliconindia has absolutely none of these facilities. Employees are often found on their knees, virtually begging for leaves whilst HR ensures that your hard earned salary does not entirely reach you without any issues, each month.

Fresher's will have a good experience about how a company works, the office environment,etc.. they will establish a good base before stepping in to the other company i.e. you will be prepared for bad after seeing worst.

2.  The only learning you will have is by interacting with collegues and googling. Dont expect to learn core industry skills unless you want be a sales person or an EDITOR  ( not sure about that too!!)

1.  The environment was way better in ex-CEO's presence. Now it's just a pool of micromanagers. 
2. One day you are managing 3-4 teams as a manager/TL and the next day you are handling only one single team as a TL.......YES....DEMOTION.
3. One day you will wake up and you will be announced TL/Manager ( verbally or on so called sheets/mail) without any hardcore proof (no changing the designation in I card or salary slip,etc) and then read second point again. That's why you won't get any proof.

4. Sometimes it feels bad to ditch clients about the facts and figure but that's what you gotta do.

5. The only relaxation you will have is during smoke breaks/lunch/dinner and rest of the time you will be under BIG BOSS's eye.  You do anything(except work) and you will have a screenshot shot of that in your mail by HR/surveillance team.

Not every employee seeks money. Good environment brings good vibes thus good results but a bad environment is just contagious. Anything good happening to a employee will spread and anything bad happening to an employee will spread even more","Such a healthy and friendly environment. 
Lots of growth and learning. 
They will treat you like a family.
You will have a personal-work life balance.
Nobody will torture you mentally.
Your innovative and creative ideas will be supported by the management. 
Regular hikes with good pay scale.
Flexible working hours. No strict login-logout timings.
Nobody will monitor you through cctv.
You will be given paid leaves for sickness, your own marriage, personal work.
The HR will truly understand your problems and will always think about employee's benefits.

Never use harsh words to employees. The only F word I learned here is fun!!

Management's affection and care is more than what family and friends can provide.

No cons as such. The best company I have worked so far. 

I wish I could be part of this organization till my retirement.

Mostly into backend or into sales. Worst management, if you give them a good revenue doing sales, you will get whatever post you want. (GM-Sales, VP-Sales, etc) This company is just money minded and is not professional. They publish multiple magazines, SiliconIndia, CIOReview, CIOoutlook, Pharma Outlook, CIO Insights, and etc. All magazines are published from Bangalore only and they give wrong circulation figures to the clients. Maximum they publish is 100 magazines for each edition. Even this figure is more.

- The atmosphere of the work is completely depressing, as they do not believe in spending on the interiors of the office making it look like a hospital with old furniture.

The CEO used to come by every 2 days n ask people what they're working on, pick a fault and make it a point to insult them and make fun of them in front of the entire office.. People who had enough sense wouldn't laugh back but most of the people would.. Sadly, the management thinks they haven't hired employees but have bought them.. And paying them salary means they can treat them however they wish to and behave like they bought the employees.. Another thing id like to mention is that when I had had enough of all the drama the management did with me and decided to talk to the CEO about it, he nodded his head very empathetically to what I was saying..
