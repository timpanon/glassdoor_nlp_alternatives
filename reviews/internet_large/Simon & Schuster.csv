Flexibility in taking on outside projects if they interest you.","Salaries were not generally adequate to the cost of living in NYC. (Many coworkers commuted from LI or Jersey.) That's true of a lot of book publishing, but companies really need to do all they can to make their employees' lives better. 

Bouts of layoffs, restructurings, and early retirement packages left a general feeling of fear about employment status."

Compared to other houses, the people and management are laid back but still putting out great work. S&S and management care about the staff. Really positive place to work and reasonable hours so long as you get your work done.","The money is a joke compared to other publishers. Bad salaries, bad raise or growth potential."
37,Simon & Schuster,Not for the faint of heart,2021-01-25,3.0,Assistant Editor,"The people are generally wonderful, the authors are great, and you can't beat free books! The vacation time is decent as well.","It is almost impossible to move up, the pay is lower than industry standard, and working overtime WITHOUT PAY and working on weekends (also without pay) is not only expected, but consistently reiterated to junior staff from higher-ups as something they have to do if they want to make it in the business (which is against the law in New York, I might add). Although most of the employees are great the culture is generally very toxic. I strongly recommend not working in publishing unless there is nothing else you can picture yourself doing (and if that's the case...more power to you! Again, the people are generally really wonderful, and that can't be said for every company out there)."
38,Simon & Schuster,It's fine for what it is,2021-01-22,3.0,Business Analyst,Autonomous work. Stress isn't super high.,Culture is too corporate. They don't really care about career growth. Processes take way too long.

53,Simon & Schuster,Great company if you're blonde and hate money,2020-06-13,1.0,Subsidiary Rights,There are some genuine people who work here. Some of the books are readable.,"S&S has been using the same internal systems for decades. They have no idea how to upgrade systems and get up to speed where other industries are. Publicity doesn't even know what digital publicity efforts look like yet. It's insane how behind the times this company is. There is a huge lack of diversity at this company like any publisher - nearly everyone is blonde haired and blue eyed. Corporate is attempting to diversify by hiring a lot of Asians in lower level positions which is hilarious because that isn't diversity. Now they claim they will look into ways to support black people entering the industry which is laughable because the best way to attract diverse talent is by having attractive pay. No INTELLIGENT self -respecting college graduate is going to just sit there and accept a 1% annual pay raise and a starting salary of 37k without a bonus or incentives. After 5 years I have yet to break 50K in this company and I've been in publishing 10 years. We work too hard for too little. S&S also gives less time off than any of the other big 5 publishers. Why stay here when we could at least get more time of elsewhere? 
If you have issues relating to bullying, sexism, harrassment, etc, HR will not back you up. My supervisor enjoys tracking my lunch and bathroom breaks and has been doing so for at least a year. S/he eventually came out and accused me of a two hour lunch with zero proof - s/he confused a bathroom break with my going out to lunch since s/he never bothered to walk by again with his/her side glance to see that I came back from the bathroom and then later left for a lunch break. When I proved I didn't take this lengthy lunch s/he imagined up, s/he didn't apologize. Apparently butt and seat time is more valuable that the revenue I've generated for an ailing dinosaur company.

I have heard similiar nasty stories from others who work in the company - bosses making them do things unrelated to actual work, bosses that say racist (cough subconscious bias as HR is now calling it) things to their staff, etc. This kind of atttude is not isolated - you'll find it throughout the higher levels of the company."
54,Simon & Schuster,Poor Management,2020-06-08,2.0,Sales Manager,Free books and a lot of office space.,"In my dept, VP's and higher have no idea what is going on in their departments. Inadequate and weak middle management with very little experience. Total lack of communication. So frustrating."

57,Simon & Schuster,"Good opportunity for growth, average publishing problems",2020-01-07,3.0,Associate Marketing Manager,Love learning from the people with decades of experience!,There's not a clear raise schedule and compensation is not exceptional--even in an hourly position you're expected to work overtime without compensation for those hours.
58,Simon & Schuster,Close The Chapter...,2019-12-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are some brilliant, hard-working people that are passionate about the industry and excellent at their jobs. They deserve to be fairly compensated and recognized for their talents, but unfortunately they are not. There is a generous amount of PTO (you'll need it). The benefits are decent.","The pay is abysmal. Not once was I ever approached about how the job was going nor was a discussion about career growth/future opportunities ever in the periphery. Both diversity and a warm culture are lacking (i.e. gossipy culture). Senior management seems burnt out/overwhelmed and has little idea how to effectively promote a positive atmosphere. There are minimal opportunities to engage with your team beyond day to day tasks, leading to an individualist environment. Meetings are generally run without everyone having a seat at the table, quite literally. Turnover is remarkably high."

- Low starting salaries
- Refuse to hire extra help when needed"
69,Simon & Schuster,Terrible,2019-07-09,1.0,,"Free books, summer Fridays, location","Working in book publishing is a risk in and of itself due to the constant downsizing in the whole industry. S&S particular is not adapting well to the changes in technology. The older executives in positions of power who make the decisions don’t understand how to adapt to the changes in the book market, and lower level employees often do not have a voice, even though sometimes they know better. 

The salaries are way below average for NYC standards, so the majority of employees are getting financial support from their parents, resulting in a poor work ethic all around. 

There are also way too many white people at this company and most executives could care less about genuine diversity initiatives - it’s all talk. 

If you’re good at your job, older employees will see you as a threat and will want to keep you down. There is no trajectory for moving up. 

Despite what everyone says, the overall culture is disturbingly similar to CBS, the parent company."
70,Simon & Schuster,Look Elsewhere,2019-06-06,1.0,Publicity Assistant,"Free Books, Great HR, Fun Activities","If you are a person of color, book publishing is not a holistic environment for you. I've had to deal with multiple racist incidents; management is top-heavy and doesn't reflect the diversity they claim to support. Additionally, S&S is not up-to-date with technology, and with that comes the mindset of top-heavy management who still abide by 1990s corporate mindset (if it worked well in the past, why change anything?) Almost no room for growth unless you are a favorite, meaning you'd have to grovel to get noticed."
71,Simon & Schuster,Solid Place to Work,2019-04-08,4.0,Systems Analyst,"Good People, they want the best for you. Incentives to stay",Standard cubical work environment. DC runs 24/7 so need to work a lot.

S&S automatically gives major holidays off to all employees and does Summer Fridays
Benefits and Health, Denatal, and Eye Insurance are great

Office is in central NYC near Rockefeller Center and easy to get to.","Sales department is very cliquey and if you are not willing to “drink the Kool-Aid” they can get very nasty and make your work life miserable
My pay was above average because nobody wanted to work for the supervisor and that above average pay meant I couldn’t change positions within the company (labor laws prevent companies from downgrading employees pay when it’s not at fault of their own)
HR knows about the problems in the department but does not or maybe cannot do anything."

There's a lot of trust in employees, which translates into a lot of freedom for young employees to take on responsibility. 
Very good health insurance. 
Lots of meetings, which takes up a lot of time, but it allows for corporate transparency. There's always a sense that management is working to improve the company, which is a big morale boost.","Very top heavy structure. There's a large assistant pool and a large executive pool, and not a lot of room for promotion.  A good company to start out at, but not one you'll be able to stay at. 
Culture of overwork and unpaid overtime, and the belief that you'll do it because you love books, though that is endemic to the publishing industry as a whole."

The pay is comparable to other publishing houses, and the health benefits are good. 

Most people are friendly.

Most people leave at a reasonable hour and do not have to check emails at night or over the weekend.","The company does not close for the winter holidays. You only get a day or two off making travel to visit relatives very difficult--especially if you need to travel to both your family and your in-laws. If you want more time, you have to use your paltry 10 days of vacation time. 

Highly filtered communication. There's communication with your direct report and none with the upper management. Meetings are often with department heads only. Anyone at the associate level will not get facetime with upper management. Haunting the kitchen seems like your best bet to getting some name and face recognition with higher ups.

There are no work from home options.

There seems to be little room for promotion, and what room there is seems to be in title only."

196,Simon & Schuster,No opportunities for growth and poor management. Insular environment.,2013-05-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Summer Fridays, Rock Center location, easy access to transit.","Compensation is awful and turnover is high because people often find the need to move to another house to get promoted. There is no investment in employee training and retention and lower-level staff takes on responsibilities greater than their level but do not get compensated for it.  All internal systems are outdated and archaic.

Senior managers are resistant to change and innovation, despite the industry chatter that change is needed in order for our business to survive. Most higher ups prove to be fairly incompetent towards any sort of new or social media. The ""Boys Club"" mentality still exists and there is no respect for someone with an advanced degree or real business knowledge. 

No one is promoted based on merit; all promotions depend on someone leaving for you to take their place, and promotions are only allowed once a year during the month of April. 

HR is very unresponsive and reluctant to challenge upper management."
197,Simon & Schuster,"A good place to work, but not great.",2013-05-03,4.0,Editorial,"Supportive, creative staff, nice perks (free books, summer hours.)","Low pay, slow to promote from within. I've seen some wonderful, creative people leave for better salaries elsewhere. Simon and Schuster has a good reputation but that can only go so far, especially in New York. You can't pay NY rents with a company name."
198,Simon & Schuster,Decent place to work but culture a bit stagnant,2013-04-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Reasonable expectations of employees, good benefits, relatively stable and profitable company considering the upheavals in Publishing. Mostly quite likable and interesting people to work with. Good books. Discounted and often free books available. Now and then, some inspired changes get through.","With few exceptions, very few growth opportunities. Basically a slowly shrinking company in a rapidly shrinking industry. A few entrenched long serving people who serve no discernible purpose except to make it harder for others to get their work done."

200,Simon & Schuster,The business is changing (not for the better) and publishers who operate like S&S will get rolled,2013-02-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The pros relate to the golden years  (prior to 2008):  a wonderful variety of books to be involved with; supportive management who encouraged risk-taking and boldness; exposure and access to a variety of worlds through the authors we published; the sense you were helping to better the world with important work (and paying the bills with mindless commercial books).   Sigh. Now it's 50 Shades of Heaven or, whatever....                                        

On the practical side, I can't think of many areas where S&S is an industry leader any more.  Well, their network and computer systems are actually quite advanced thanks to corporate owner CBS.  Digital team has made more impressive efforts than any other house with the exception of Random House.  Their art department is very talented.  Um... That's about it","A craven and small-minded senior management team whose true colors presented themselves when sales slowed down (i.e., when the chips were down, they effectively stopped being leaders, burying their noses in spreadsheets).  Bonuses for execs have been and will always be prioritized over jobs with the current senior management in place.  

Some business strategies: reducing xeroxing and making price points for books end in .99 cents vs .95. You can see where the Big Thinking is.

Layoffs are a reality in this biz now (no getting around that, its everywhere) but S&S's inept, bloodless and insensitive handling of firings is so demoralizing it has corroded morale in the worst way.  Are the people that work there motivated?  No.  They are scared for their jobs."

You get to work on some nice books (especially if you work with the children's department).,The company is overall is not supportive of growth among their employees. It is the most unhealthy place to work due to all of the cliques and back stabbing that take place. The SVP of Sales and the CFO patrol the hallways at night to see who is still in the office after 5pm. It is by far the worst corporation that I have ever worked for in the publishing industry.

People don't really interact with one another, other than on outlook. Most of the staff is also middle aged so it can be hard for a young person to connect with them."
