They love long lunch and travel very far from 12 till 3pm. The only time they started to work was like 7pm and sometimes stay till late night so as to be seen working hard.

280,Singapore Press,Soul destroying  & mentally depleting place to work,2019-10-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Being part of media means you receive press gifts (which Editors usually keep for themselves anyway even if they're aware the team are doing the writing / sponsored post / all the hard work) and you receive press events. 

Although cannot really attend events if management decide you're too busy to leave your desk.

Pretty much only pros I can find.","The cons far outweigh any possible pros to work here and it comes with a heavy heart and deep advice to warn anyone to steer clear and look elsewhere for employment:

Anytime you're offered a 'pay rise' for all your hard work and even a redesignation to match - top tier management will try manipulate you / trick you into accepting your own due hard-earned Xmas bonus as some monthly pay rise instead. Or, they tell you it's a redesignation with all the extra workload but no pay rise. 

Severe gaslighting is rife with management - it's always your fault. Even if it's their idea. Even if they decide it's a great idea to begin with - it will end up not working out and it's entirely your fault.  Management will keep quiet if they know it's their fault, whilst you take the 'blame'. Yes, it's all blame here. No-one is positive or uplifting. 

Management change their mind every other week and then blame everyone else when the direction isn't clear. Management also give the worst direction for projects, thinking their ideas are great and declining anything the team contributes -- because by doing so they keep themselves in a job and act as if theyre the only one needed / only one with talent. Ironically, they have no idea what they're doing. 

The wrong people have been put into upper management roles - these people are talentless, clueless and instead push their limitations onto the team, projecting their own inabilities to fulfill their role to everyone else.  These people also concentrate on their own personal projects and social media first before they think of the magazine. 

Bullying is rife. Bullying from upper management down to team members. This includes personal remarks on looks, style, life choices etc.  Even when team members are in tears over the bullying and find the courage to confront it - management deny ever saying it or blame team member for being 'too sensitive'.

Management cultivate a negative team spirit, playing blame game between team members to then turn team members onto each other.  

Many management heads go on press trips and DO NOT do their own work - instead enjoying the fruits of the press trip then forcing writers who are already doing 12 hour days to do the hard work. The writers didn't leave the desk. Management did - on epic flights to cool locations.  Not a great ethic is it? 

Pay DOES NOT match the working hours or environment. Bad pay. Bad bad bad. BAD. 

Nobody in SPH cares for the emotional, physical and mental welfare of their employees. You work until you have a breakdown. Then you're blamed for not dealing with pressure well or being too emotional or being too slow or having too many MCs or being disorganized. When reality is, management set an impossible working lifestyle with tasks THEY SHOULD DO and instead delegate it all down to their team... only then to blame team when they person cannot cope at all. 

You will never be good enough as a writer. Ever.  Yet when management rewrite your work - it's stripped of personality, flair, style - it becomes boring, disinteresting and painful to read. If you want statistics and stripped down information - there is a thing called Google. That's free. 

Why hire talent only to squash all the creative talent? How backwards.

Management hire their friends and mates into positions that they're not very good at - rather than searching and paying for genuine talented professionals. 

Management do not communicate properly. Except when they want to bring someone down - then they will cc the entire world into an email or @ everyone in a Whatsapp group chat. 

One of the most unprofessional soul destroying confidence crushing places I have ever worked at."
281,Singapore Press,It's a trap,2019-10-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"For the portfolio, considering Her World is a very reputable name in Singapore. That's about it — though the workload and micromanagement from upper management is just not worth your time.","Way too many ""editors"" governing a team (when there's only one writer). The workflow is unnecessarily convoluted; it's a case of everyone wants a say, and the bulk of the work ends up on the writer to execute. You're expected; even obliged to work OT just to finish up your work because of unrealistic timelines. Best of all: no appreciation, efforts taken for granted."
282,Singapore Press,In the middle of transformation,2019-09-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Passionate people, really interesting industry","Uncertain future for media industry, some high-level hires who are not performing"
283,Singapore Press,Journalist,2019-09-25,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits , especially health care and transport loan",Too stringent in reporting. focus too much on positivity of the community.
284,Singapore Press,A sunset industry.,2019-09-19,3.0,Journalist/Reporter,"AWS if the company is doing good, a decent canteen with a variety of food and the privilege of medical benefits. If you are a journalist, the established reputation that the company has benefits you as you will get first dibs on the latest scoops or launches.","The first thing you will notice about this supposedly legendary publication company would be how inept upper management is. They adopt a method of ""empowering the youth"" but in fact, are quick to turn on them if something goes wrong. Expect a lot of ""do as you see fit, we trust you"" but with no direction on what is ""fit"" in their eyes which is more often than not, a dated view of journalism. Do not expect them to give you concrete feedback on your work though, they're probably hiding in their rooms to surf social media or posting lewd photos of themselves. 

Prehistoric views of digital content is also the norm. No one from upper management knows what the proper KPI, ROI or metrics are regarding the digital space which means you will often be held accountable for unrealistic expectations. The merging of print and digital teams is also done as a mean to cut costs but KPIS or a proper workflow is often never discussed in detail.

Management's favourite reply to everything is ""we will work it out"" which means you are more often that not, held accountable for ""not fulfilling your duties"" without reason.

The company also has an odd habit of installing digital editors who do not have the chops or the visual eye to execute digital campaigns. Expect a lot of work to be shuffled to you if you are a junior member of the team as the editors are ""too busy"" laying out the ground work which in actuality, involves them just forwarding said emails to avoid responsibility."

""Prestigious"" company name on your name card can open doors for you if you're in a business / negotiator role. 

Great place to see how traditional media setups work. Whole gamut of operations from reporting to publishing to business support and somewhat of a technology support to keep the machine going. 

Front line editorial staff sees everything and anything. Grows you up quickly. 

Some people are great. I repeat, SOME PEOPLE only. 

Located at a relatively accessible central area, access to food and transport. 

Free newspaper subscription, great savings scheme (Thrift & Loan), 90% of medical consultation at Parkway Shenton paid by company, $200 dental benefits per year, free passes to Zoo / Bird Park, gym in the building,  canteen upstairs to slack, cheap Spinelli coffee, even cheaper drip coffee at 90 cents per cup.","For TL: DR: If you're looking for a retirement ground, look no further. But if you're looking to carve out a career, please look elsewhere. Even Mediacorp would be a better choice. This place is at risk of falling out of relevance altogether in before 2020. 

---

SPH has no inclination to grow as a company. They're just looking at balancing their P&L sheets and really nothing else. The threat of being obscured by other media setups comes so very real but SPH does not embrace any changes. 

Super silos - SPH is a strange place where people and products have to work within their little sandbox environment. Despite being a sprawling media conglomerate, there is zero collaboration between different business units, because everyone guards their work (can't fail) and P&L is key priority. In many cases, SPH had set up many adjacent business units set to compete against one another. So if you're working in one of such silos, good luck - you'll spend more time strategizing internally than with your market competitors.  

Come think of it, did SPH launch anything successful in the last 20 years? Apart from a radio station (which was largely bought) and STOMP, nothing really changed. Think about it - throughout history - only media companies who were more technologically advanced than their peers survived. Think Reuters and their telegram line linking US to UK, think BuzzFeed / HuffPost / Qz. 

Staff has no capability to discharge their roles if they are not equipped - be it tools, knowledge or skills set. That led to many who are unwilling to step up in their roles. Huge costs associated to failure in this company - no one is willing to take risks. You get people and products doing the same stuff from 20 years ago and today - and knowing their downward spiral. 

Super hierarchical in nature - despite management trying hard to be flat."
