28,SkipTheDishes,"Used to be okay, Skip `Skip` Now after Merging",2022-02-27,3.0,Engineer,"Diversity? Seems like a recognized app in Canada?

It all depends on which team/org you are in

But the fact is there were a lot of Great engineering leaders/ICs left the company since 03-2021. This leave is from top to down comprehensively.
The new global CEO is business-focused, knows little about engineering, and looks down upon the tech.","very low pay in the market nowadays, no stock option as a global public company.
Used to have startup blood with both its pros and cons but after it was merged within a global company, with no stable big company's pros but keeping all cons from the big company. (not competitive salary, poor management, slow workflow anywhere) 

If you are a seniorE, Skip it, you will thank me later.
The level move and promotion process are time-wasted:
you spent several months(2-3), editing, refining, gathering feedback, formatting, waiting for approval level by level, then luckily, you will get at around 5% lol increase in each level move (usually once a year), for promotion, the number will be bigger than 5 but it is still very low comparing the post-covid market.
The company in Canada is hard to hire great ppl, yes, there are still ppl in, but considering the hybrid work policy (2-3 days on-site) and the small package, hiring is hard to great ones. It has to hire from East Europe and South America."

Good pay, benefits and rrsp plan for manitoba standards. Various linked in premium courses and training courses are available.","Growth and skill development comes at a cost. It depends on if you are on your manager's good books or not and to get on their good books you will have to be available for 24/7, know everything, be prepared to work extra and get the same pay and recognition as those who don't. In the end you end up compromising your values and your mental health. Most people in the company are either burnt out or in the brink of burnout. Turnover is high. There's a huge disconnect between what the upper management thinks is good for the company to what translates to execution in operations. They are all words and no action. The company almost thinks that pay is the main factor for turnover but the main factor is their culture. It's terrible. They have mental health programs but their leaders have no idea how to support people's mental health. The people have just become numbers and replaceable causing them to lose top talents left right and centre."
31,SkipTheDishes,Disappointing Chaos,2022-02-24,1.0,"Human Resources, People Team","Global organisation, monthly credits for employees to use app.
Can negotiate for permanent remote at hire.
Pays above market for HR roles for new hires (they are desperate and the money is main reason you’ll stay after first few months) ask for higher salary/vacation than what you are expecting as corporate division likes to negotiate down.","Highly disorganised, lack of actual strategy or direction just vague claims of how far they’ve come. Blame culture and lack of accountability in team. Team members were either overworked/stressed or doing the bare minimum - very much an environment where talking about how busy you are and bad mouthing others gets you further than producing actual outcomes."

- Under resourced both across design and research vs. product (1:6 or 2:6 ratio with research/design with product teams)
- Having a healthy amount of work can be challenging as UX researchers are limited and in very high demand internally (between 1:3 to 2:5 ratio UX research to designers and 1:5 or 1:6 between research to product)

Really grandiose stuff about how we aren't just delivering food, we're enabling lifestyle experiences and making the world a better place, said with a straight face. Surveys or presentations about culture that make claims like ""we know having fun at work is a baseline expectation for everyone, and we know that if you aren't having fun you'll just quit"" with a straight face. A lot of very young staff (20-somethings) who are naive enough to eat this up and then perpetuate it further. If you're uncomfortable with this kind of rhetoric it can get unpleasant fast.

If you are a recent graduate and/or looking for a company to start your career in tech, it's not a bad place at all.","Leadership: A lot of great people left the company in the past two years, including several leaders. As a result, some unprepared engineers took leadership positions like Technology Manager (fancy name for Team Lead). This is sad because some of them didn't even have Senior experience or were recognized as leaders before taking the position.
Technology: Back in 2018 the company used to have several experienced Principal DevOps engineers and Principal Architects driving the evolution of the platform. Now only a few of them.
Career & Salary: The salary is good BUT be careful during the negotiation. Salary reviews are hard, and some folks wait for months to have a 5% increase. So please do your research and don't take anything below market average."

Only one possibility to get promoter per year, with a cumbersome overcomplicated process. If you start as a mid level engineer expect at least 2 years until you can even think about getting the senior title.

The culture is great, but it keeps getting eroded by bullheaded top level decisions. No work from home planned after the pandemic, we're supposed to go back to the office full time. I'm sure that will erode the talented workforce even more."

Recognized employer in the resume;","Pretty much everything that was not mentioned in the ""pros"" section.
SkipTheDishes is not just the cheapest company on the market. They redefined the definition of being cheap. You need to bring your laptop to work as a software developer at SkipTheDishes. You can forget about words like RRSP, weekends, and work-life balance here.

The company was founded by three Simair brothers:
* Daniel “The manipulative one” Simair,
* Joshua “The walkie-talkie one” Simair,
* Chris “The junior one” Simair.

The Simair brothers managed to get the $5 million financings into SkipTheDishes. That increased the value of the company. And soon after the financial support from Manitoba, the Simair brothers sold the company for $200 million. This is how tax-payers' money went straight into Simair brothers' pockets. I am surprised why nobody is investigating how provincial money was spent.

And after the bros left the company, new management kept their toxic sweatshop legacy.
The Simair brothers moved on to create other scammy and shady projects like Pivot Subscriptions. 
Few employees at skipthedishes have stock options and it makes sense for them to work overtime. And for the rest of employees at Skipthedishes the salary is far below average on the market. And don’t expect to have any salary appraisal or any career advancement here. SkipTheDishes expect you to work on evenings and weekends without extra pay.
Do not work here. You can find a better place by sending your resume to almost any other company. You can thank me later.
Couriers are underpaid at skip as well. And that you can read in the other reviews here.
You may ignore 5-star reviews because the majority of them are fake.

P.S. Also I do not recommend ordering via SkipTheDishes app. The company makes huge cuts from the order so the restaurant does not earn much from it. And the restaurant has to increase the price via the SkipTheDishes app compared to the prices in their original menu. So if you want to support local restaurants it is better to go and order from them directly."

Management is also finally paying me more in my shift supervisor position than they had been when I was a call centre agent. A lot of things are automated, and you have the opportunity to learn a lot about tech advances in the company even if you're just a call centre agent.","My managers want me to get after agents for being away from their desks for more than 1.5 min without telling us about it, and for more than 5 minutes even if they do give us a heads-up. If you're bilingual and speak French, management will understaff you and tell you to prioritize English tasks, and then wonder why French-language tasks aren't getting done in a timely manner. You have to submit any potential schedule changes 6 weeks in advance, which isn't possible for students signing up for classes despite students being their target employment group. Because they change so much internally, any training you receive after the first week will be via PowerPoint sent to your email inbox. The company says it wants everyone to be friends on the floor, but you aren't supposed to socialize with your coworkers when you have work to do--which is always--so how we're supposed to make friends is a mystery."

- Unexperienced devs got promoted to managerial roles and lead positions simply because company can't hire good ones. 
- Toxic place to work and lots of politics between employees. 
 - No clear vision on career growth and promotions
- No clear vision or goals of the company and product development. Each team is working on separate things and sometimes they work on contradicting stuff. (no alignment)

Fast paced environment - It's always changing, growing, adapting. For me this is a good thing. It's never boring and you get to problem solve frequently. This might not be for everyone but I absolutely love it. 

Amazing talent - I've worked with some of the best people in my career. SkipTheDishes attracts world class talent. Getting to collaborate with such high caliber talent has been a huge highlight in my career. 

They care - Now that the company is leaving it's startup days, the leadership team truly cares about the company and it's employees. There is still tons of opportunities for area's of improvement and you can see every day that the People Team's and Leadership teams are always trying to incorporate these into ways that work for our company.","Growth Driven - Can feel like you are only there to drive the bottom line at time. 

Disorganization - This has gotten way better and it's always trending in the right direction, but sometimes you might feel a clear direction is lacking in a major decision.

Speed over precision - Because the atmosphere is so fast paced, decisions can be made that make sense at the time. But then just as quickly that decision can become glaringly incorrect but you have marched 1000KM is the wrong direction already.  This is more caused by the nature of the business and less so isolated to SkipTheDishes, but it is still something that happens."

426,SkipTheDishes,Deceptive.  Manipulative.  Upper management both disconnected and terrible at communication,2020-01-07,1.0,Developer,There's a vegan restaurant nearby.,"Deceptive: They told me I was hired during and after the skype interview.  Then they said to come on site to get a feel for the place.  When I arrived, they moved me to a room and conducted another hour-long interview.  I got the job despite being blindsided.  

Manipulative upper management: During the surprise interview, a founder joined in, asking about my motivations to join.  I answered.  They responded with it isn't enough and that they weren't convinced.  Regardless, they hired me, before closing off by saying, ""you better pick things up quick because you're underqualified.""  

They will take away as much from your income as they can: this is why they got into legal trouble a few years ago.  Their drivers were being severely underpaid and their justification was that the drivers were personal contractors.  Except a personal contractor gets to negotiate the price and does things their way.  SkipTheDishes decided on the price to pay their drivers, and they did not cover operating costs.  Drivers only got a percentage of the tips you give through the app.  

***Tip the driver at your door!*** If you take nothing else from this and you somehow still use this service, tip the driver at your door.  Only a percentage of the tip given through the app makes it to the driver.  

Their treatment of developers was just as bad.  They pay you as low as they can, well below industry standards.  They expect you to be on call without compensation.  ***They only give you part of the income.***  The rest of the income is given to you as credits for their service, and it's taxed.  You can't opt out of the credit system, so you'll always be paid under what you're contracted, and the rest is locked so you can pay them to use their service.  

Bad Training: They told me that I had to pass through what they call the ""incubator"".  The tasks involved working on a dummy site that was far behind the live version that I basically just went through a free online course on web development.  It was so out of date that none of it was very useful when I was given real tasks.  

Disconnected superiors: your direct supervisors may be nice and chummy at the beginning, but they ghost you when you're looking for help.  Worse still, the higher ups bypass your supervisor and directly contact you, demand your work and use their positions to threaten you to deliver things sooner than estimates you provide.  

They don't ask about how things are going.  They don't ask how long it will take you to do it.  

They set a task they never trained you for.  

They threaten punishment for missed deadlines.  You panic and try to make it.  It's impossible to make it on time.  You have no choice but to make it late or dedicate your whole waking life to this company.  Then, when you don't make the deadline, they pressure you to output faster.  You finally finish.  There's no punishment whatsover.  It's like nothing happened.  You're handed another task.  The cycle starts again.  

Don't work for this place.  It's toxic.  Don't use their service.  It operates on manipulation, both of their customers and their employees.  Give tip to the driver directly.  Never tip through the app!"

• Abysmal Pay
• Lack of Central Organization
• Still a Startup Feel
• Always changing (Not always positive)
• Unattainable goals

Starting from the top, an account manager/territory manager spot is not in their respective area like most other companies but all in the same office. So account managers all sit in the same room making calls there is NO face to face interactions with accounts. It feels like a call center job. Pay offered in most positions is below average. A big con is the startup feel to the company that never really went away and no central organization. An example of this is they use excel spreadsheets for everything including CRM.

- you only make money if you get an order

- I've had days when I had a four-hour shift and only had three deliveries

I’ve read that people start out making good money and then it dies out, so I’ll be interested to see what happens but for now I can’t complain. Not sure if work ethic has something to do with some of the bad reviews? I check in early, I’m in my car at start time, I never decline a delivery, I never cancel a shift I scheduled, and I don’t waste time. Maybe that’s why I seem to be paid so well?",No cons discovered so far
502,SkipTheDishes,Terrible company to work for,2019-02-15,1.0,Food Courier,"No management, choose your own hours when shifts are available, choose as many shifts as you want. Weekly payroll is accurate and on time.","30% of customers do not tip and another 30% only tip $2.00 or less. Average order value to the driver in this market is $6.00 . Dispatching is terribly flawed as some drivers continuously get excellent orders despite rejecting orders and having a poor work ethic, while hard working couriers who diligently perform duties get orders of small value. If you wait in a restaurant zone you'll watch maybe a dozen other skips get orders while you sit there for hours getting none. There are far too many couriers in this market and only the fly-by-nighters who are there for 2 or 3 shifts a week will do better than those who truly need the work. You will burn more gas getting to restaurants than delivering, as it seems you get called back to an area you have left, If you stay, you won't get an order, as if there is an intentional desire from the dispatching team to make sure you don't have any profit for your work. Your inquiries to chat are answered by canned responses. They treat you like an employee and pay you like a Calcutta rickshaw puller. While you work hard and do not complain, others who have a poor attitude and are lazily turning down no-tip orders will do well, as if they are the ""chosen ones"".  The wear and tear on your vehicle with the St. John's road condition and harsh snow and salt will cost you dearly if you perform this work for longer than a few weeks. There are no shift bonuses. On call shifts are downright stupid to accept (sometimes no other shift is available within seconds fo the schedule being released), as your best case is $25 for 4 hours. I have made a low of $6 in 4 hours and a high of $48 doing an on-call, but the average is $17. The average for a regular shift used to be $60.00, but now it is $45.00 . This data is based on my last 400 shifts."

Ability to reassign orders
SKIP gives you the ability to sign out early
Easy money
Your vehicle and cell p hone can be a tax deduction

I only do this job to get me out of the house.","Lots of customers will not tip and only pay delivery charge.
Delivery charges can be as low as $3.75.
When at the restaurant you can wait up to 20 minutes for food to be ready and SKIP will not compensate you for lost time and if they do it is very minimal like 25 cents.
Your car takes a beating. Make sure you have a fuel efficient car.
Some municipalities/cities/towns will require you to have a business licence to operate.
Some restaurant managers/supervisors/owners think you work for them. I have been asked on occasion from the restaurant manager/supervisor/owner to show them that I have accepted the order on the SKIP app, which by the way is not their right. Sometimes these people will give me directions on how to drive, which by the way is not their position to do so. Once I told a restaurant manager I do not work for him, I am an independent driver. He would not give me the order unless I showed him the personal information on the SKIP app, which I did not do. He then called SKIP and complained. I received a call from SKIP where the agent started to gaslight me on the phone based on the restaurant manager.
SKIP hires too many drivers and has too many drives on any given shift which will reduce your ability to make decent money. You will get frustrated only making $30-40 per shift.
SKIP does not properly tell you what tax deductions you are entitled to as an independent driver nor do they tell you that you must keep a driver log in order to claim proper tax deductions.
The SKIP app sucks...There are many occasions an order will appear for your acceptance, then when you accept you sometimes get messages that your order has changed and then disappears thus you have now lost an order.
The SKIP app will fail and lock up.
The SKIP app uses Maps and can burn through your data. Make sure you have a good data plan or you should know how to down load Maps off line to use. SKIP will not tell you this.
The SKIP Call Center is horrible. Good luck getting someone and if you do most of them do not speak English that well. I had one person cancel my shift because they thought by me having an order reassigned I wanted to end my shift.
If you get a cash order and that cash order turns out to be a fake order (yes there are fake cash orders) or the customer does not want to pay for the order, SKIP will only compensate you for the order not the delivery charge or stated tip.
Cash orders are paid out of pocket. My experience is most customers will pay with $50 or $100 bills and you dont have enough money to make change. SKIP does not provide you with a means to have customers use debit or credit cards at the door when delivering a cash order. I carry at least $100 on me at all times not their suggested amount.
Driving for SKIP can keep you up very late depending on when restaurants close.
If you have to pick up from a McDonalds/Burger King etc, be prepared to pick up your order through the drive through...Yes thats right, even if the drive through takes you 20 minutes to go through. The restaurants do not give SKIP drivers the ability to collect after hours order in the lobby. This takes more time, more money out of your pocket waiting to get through and it is difficult collecting and storing large orders this way.
The SKIP bags can be too small for large orders. They should provide larger bags.
You have to buy your own bags. Once pizza bag and one standard delivery bag.
The SKIP app does not give a driver an opportunity to rate his/her experience picking up the food at the restaurant. Dirvers do not have the ability to provide feedback on their experience.
Drivers do not have the opportunity to identify problem customers.
Drivers do not have the opportunity to chat with one another.
The SKIP app does not show how many drivers are on any given shift at any given time. Nor are you able to see how many orders are being placed by customers, how many orders are being processed. You do not get any relevant stats on your shift.
If your availability does not match the schedule being released you will not get shifts.
When the schedule is released and you do not get shifts, the majority of the time you will get on-call shifts...basically what that is saying is you will not get any orders because they have enough drivers per shift or too many drivers per shift."

- since i started this summer it was great pay no complaints. now, the transit fee is reduced. Skip expects you to go through the hassle of pickup order drive park and deliver while paying you $2.99-$4.00.  how can anyone feel motivated driving when they know they are getting paid $2.99-$4.00 transit fee and no tips?
- certain areas of Vancouver have not conformed to the canadian culture of tipping.
- some busy restaurants in the skip network want to make more money so they sign up with skip but they cannot handle the volume. couriers we could end up waiting 10 to 20 mins for an order because the restaurant did not even finish making the order in the kitchen by the time courier drivers arrive.
- Skip will pay you to drive long distance to deliver order but they do not match you with an order so you can drive back out. they expect you to use your own gas to drive out of a low demand volume neighbourhood so you can be matched to another order."

I have sat for 4 hours with $0.  I have worked for 12 hours and $90.  This is without any expenses.
You will need a special insurance endorsement.  If you dont have, they won't cover you as its not for personal use.

Dispatch not very supportive.   They tell you it's the computer that dispatches the deliveries accordingly, however I am 99% sure they have a hand in ...they remove the 1 ingredient on your profile and you won't get matched as per the algorithm 
My advise, drive at your own risk.  If you really need the money.  Otherwise if you need your car, dont risk this.  What If something happens to your car with skip... they don't care...some other driver will take it and you...will have to stress because you cant get to a job that does care?  
While the mgmt lies to you on how slow it is, you can figure out by sitting at a very busy skip restaurant and watch many many drivers come n go.

I make on average $750 in any 7 day period. I drive almost every single night from 5-9 or 6-10. I track all my earnings from every day in a spreadsheet. My average gross earnings are $34/hr, not including any expenses like fuel cost and maintenance overhead.

Depending on your vehicle, that will vary, but for me it is pretty small as I drive a subcompact car. I factor in $0.12/KM for costs, including fuel, and come out on average $30/hr after these costs, which is pretty impressive if you ask me.

Wages are heavily dependent on tips, though. Earnings from tips are approximately 40% of my overall earnings, so if people don't tip, my earnings would be cut by 60%. I most likely wouldn't do the job if people stopped tipping, but since most people pay online and I believe a 10% tip is selected by default I usually get a tip. 

From when I started driving on February 8th up to and including last night, March 7th, I have a total of over $3100 in earnings in 90 hours of being on shift in about 30 days.

I expect your results will vary depending on where you live, but Fort McMurray is an easy city to get around, the service just started here on February 1st 2018 and people seem to be loving it. Maybe it will die down after the initial excitement, or Winter ends and people are more inclined to go outside. Only time will tell!","- Sometimes app bugs out and have to call Skip

The work is very consistent in terms of pace. You won't ever be rushing to do something which is nice.,"You do need a fuel efficient car and valid insurance. You still have to pay for gas from the money you earn.

598,SkipTheDishes,Great way to make quick money,2017-08-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,make your own schedule daily,can get slotted into a slow time and not make much
599,SkipTheDishes,Work only if you can not find another job,2017-08-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Flexible work schedule for part timers.,"Very low salary

Incredibly poor work culture

Micro Management- The top management is involved in almost everything.

Inexperienced and Incompetent management- The managers working there are 19-23 years old kids who never worked in a corporate environment and never had any experience in management. There's no specific experience or degree required to become a manager there. It's up to management.

Management is neither professional nor friendly. Managers get personally rude, occasionally."

606,SkipTheDishes,Great Experience,2017-04-21,5.0,Project Manager,"- Fast Paced work environment
- No politics (compared the old boys club I used to work at). Everyone has the opportunity to make an impact
- Constant change is exciting
- Great young, motivated people to work with
- Very principled  and innovative workplace","- Fast pace and constant change isn't for everyone. 
- Odd, long hours are occasionally required. Not a typical 9-5"
607,SkipTheDishes,Proceed with Caution,2017-04-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Many great, motivated young people 
- Very easy to get a job (due to high fluctuation of staff)
- Easy to get ""promoted"" 
- Flexible schedule possible, especially if work part time

A good way for students and people looking for a flexible part time job. As long as you don't care too much about what's happening around you.","- Basically glorified call centre work
- Low wages, even after promotion 
- Exploitation of employees and contractors, always on the brink of legality (up until recently there were no lunch breaks, unpaid overtime for salaried employees, bullying tactics used by management etc)

High stress, unrewarding, underpaid work. New employees are promised interesting work and great opportunities for advancement, but most are crushed by the reality of working at a call centre and being treated like disposable robots within weeks. Therefore the company loves to hire young and bright immigrants, who rely on the opportunity for immigration purposes and then get stuck, without alternatives. The ones who can, get out as soon as they can."
608,SkipTheDishes,A good job for someone who is willing to work hard.,2017-04-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This job will give you a lot of hands on experience. As a young professional not many work places will allow you to run projects and have hands on feedback and mentoring from upper management. SkipTheDishes has helped me grow as a professional and a person. 

Management has allowed for lateral movement to other teams and increased responsibilities to help me grow as an employee. They do a really good job of investing in employees. It's a good place that fosters and incentives personal growth.",Every position at SkipTheDishes is important to the companies success from an entry level position to an executive manager which comes expectations. You will be pushed and you're expected to work hard. It is not always a 9-5 job. Some days you're expected to work more than 8 hours or come in on a day off when it's necessary. This is not for everyone but hard work is noticed and rewarded.
609,SkipTheDishes,Great Company,2017-04-18,5.0,,"Great company, they allow you to be yourself, and encourage you to grow within the company.","Fast paced environment, must be able to adjust to change."
610,SkipTheDishes,"Exciting work, phenomenal people",2017-03-28,5.0,Software Developer,"The people are by far this companies best aspect. I worked in the Saskatoon developer office (spent a week in the Winnipeg one) and I can say that they have some of the brightest and most talented developers around. They are all friendly and knowledgeable, and after-work hangouts were frequent, whether it was meeting up for drinks, or organizing board games in the office after hours. 

There is no shortage of work, over my year and some at Skip, I can honestly say I was never bored. The work is challenging and there are many opportunities for you to create a niche for yourself, whether you want to get involved in DevOps, Business Intel, work in the Front end or Back end.

You'll be given a say in how you accomplish your work. While you have to follow style guidelines, if there's a library out there that best suits the piece of work you're doing, you can use it. There's a lot of new tech being used as well.

If you have to take time off for meetings or jet out early to look after your kids, that's fine as long as your churning out code and have proven yourself to be a solid employee. You can also work from home when you're ill, again as long as the code still gets churned out.

All of the upper management are phenomenal people. They're incredibly intelligent and driven and want you as an employee to exceed. They're also workaholics, you'll never be able to complain to your friends about your bosses slacking off. If you have questions, they'll give you a straight answer, no BS, but they're witty and fun on occasion and the work place is generally light-hearted. If you can get into the Stoon office, guaranteed the office will be laughing at least once or twice throughout the day from someone's off-hand remark.

They named the birds outside the office in the spring/summer Rob and Beyonce. It's nice to take a break and watch them build their nest when you need a break from your monitor.

There's the potential for non-negligible bonuses/raises given to people who work hard for them.","There is pressure on occasion to get code out asap, which may involve a couple hours in the evenings or some weekend work. It's not required, but you do get a lot of kudo points for being available to help out with issues after hours, or giving up a weekend to get something out the door. Some people live for that stuff, and it's cool you can take ownership of your work and get it out to meet demands. This is a symptom of a start up company, not so much Skip in general. It's only a con if you're looking to put in your 9-5 and nothing more. 

Hackathons aren't quite discouraged as much as upper management would rather employees spend the time working on actual work, instead of fun features for the websites/apps.

If you're a new grad starting at skip, you should show up before most people and leave after most people to get your code-output higher and keep at this until you're comfortable with the system and have earned everyone's respect. This is still more a symptom of a startup than Skip itself, but it's the reason I docked a star off Work/Life Balance."
611,SkipTheDishes,Operations Manager,2017-01-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good company to work for if you are a student as they are very flexible with scheduling, also very fun and young work environment that does not have a strict dress code.",Pay is just above minimum wage and job is very repetitive with limited room for growth. You do not get a paid lunch break even for an 8 hour shift.
612,SkipTheDishes,Associate,2017-01-11,3.0,Anonymous Employee,it allows you to develop and working with a large team allows you to grow in terms of developing your skills. Can be tough sometimes though.,working hours sucks. Workload can sometimes be super heavy. Staff does not do a better job of training employees. It can be hectic working for skip the dishes.

-New and exciting challenges daily
-Opportunity to make a large impact (compared to more corporate environments)
-Fast paced and constant change","-It's a fast growth company, there are changes on constant basis, employees must be willing and able to adapt to change. I personally view this as a positive since I came to Skip from a corporate environment where change happened at a snail's pace, but understand how for some this is a negative. 
-Lack of structure - structure is being built as the company grows."

615,SkipTheDishes,Mixed experience,2016-06-25,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall a good experience. The staff here are young, friendly, fun, and welcoming. Getting to know the other people at Skip was one of the best parts of the job. It does feel like a startup, and does have the hustle and bustle of a fast-paced workplace. Good location downtown, lax dress code, spacious office.","I worked in a few departments, so I feel like I got a full experience of Skip. Contrary to what you would think, a lot of the positions here require almost no skill and are extremely repetitive and monotonous. Around 80% of the company is essentially a call centre. Career advancement is practically non-existent at this company. You don't learn anything from the job in most of the roles, and are not challenged at all. There is essentially no HR department at all, and entire departments are wiped out with a day's warning. Team leads would be taken out of their roles and started at the very bottom in another department at a moment's notice. Very chaotic."
616,SkipTheDishes,It is what you make it.,2016-05-19,4.0,Operations Support,"Like most people have been saying, it is a start up. You can learn more in a month than you would in a year with a larger company. There seems to be a lot of growth and promotion opportunity if you are looking for it, and if you are not happy with your position they'll usually let you switch departments. Friendly staff, it's like a family.","If you're looking for a job to lounge around at this is not the place for you. If you don't pull your weight you'll get fired eventually. Also, there is a lot of shade being thrown around with the Skip name, it can be kind of depressing dealing with customers and partners that feel Skip is the devil reborn as a software company. There's no way to stop it, but it really sucks."
617,SkipTheDishes,SkipTheDishes,2016-05-12,5.0,,"We're all getting a good experience working at a startup like SkipTheDishes.  In my few years working at other companies (like government), this company is miles ahead of them in terms of innovation and speed.  There's a lot of camaraderie throughout the team.  Lots of growth, seeing new people every day.  Health and dental benefits too, which is pretty rare for a startup.","With any startup, there can be chaos, and the work can be demanding (and sometimes stressful) dealing customers, restaurants, and couriers.  Lots of new hires and there sometimes isn't a way to meet all of them (which should be encouraged since its a startup)."
618,SkipTheDishes,"Fast growth, challenging work, and opportunities",2016-05-06,5.0,Operations Lead,I'm always challenged at work. The growth is crazy at Skip. I've worked in several parts of the company now.  The team is overall really smart.  We get to work with brand new tech with new tech releases all the time.  We are the most dynamic and fast-paced team that I've heard of.,The work is mentally challenging.  There are a lot of tech releases that we need to work with and learn with short timelines.  Sometimes I'm not sure how I can keep up.   The work never really seems to stop since we're growing so much.
