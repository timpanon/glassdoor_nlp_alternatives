3,Sky Betting & Gaming,Great place to work,2022-03-26,5.0,Senior Operations Executive,"Culture, people, perks and brand",Not sure if they paid the same as other companies in the industry
4,Sky Betting & Gaming,Pressured and understaffed,2022-03-26,3.0,Safer Gambling Officer,Excellent benefits. Great new office.,Poor shift patterns. Only 1 weekend off in 3. There’s not enough staff to take inbound calls in my area resulting in taking staff from other areas of the business.
5,Sky Betting & Gaming,A great place to work,2022-03-25,5.0,Service Lifecycle Manager,"Flexible, fast paced, challenging and interesting.","Other than the obvious odd bad egg, nothing else i can think of."
6,Sky Betting & Gaming,Good work-life balance,2022-03-22,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"You can pretty much work as you please as long as you are around for the many meetings. Not a lot of pressure in terms of deadlines, it is up to you to set your own expectations and goals. Exciting and fast-paced if you're into sports. Plenty of perks, especially for those with families. Some effort is put into diversity but most of the time it fails to materialise. Great office space in Leeds.","Failing to attract and retain talent. Slow to keep-up with the market in terms compensation. Failure to reward those that went above and beyond at times and then when the yearly results are not as good they ask you to give it all for the team. Wish there were more perks/benefits for single people (don't care about child vouchers, adding family members to benefits, etc.)"
7,Sky Betting & Gaming,Great place to work,2022-03-22,5.0,Risk Executive,"Very friendly environment, great development opportunities, amazing perks, and just such a brilliant place to work!","It is fast paced, however that’s something I really thrive on. But, that’s not for everyone."
8,Sky Betting & Gaming,Fantastic people first place to work,2022-03-17,5.0,Head of Engineering,"- People are always put first. There is a realisation that people are the most important part of a business and it's acted on.
- Great engineering/operations/architecture culture. Really passionate people who are respectful of each other and value teamwork.
- Development is a constant with L&D time, each employee having a fund for L&D and internal promotions being the norm.
- No blame culture. Even if you bring down production, the focus isn't on you but upon the tools and processes that led to the outcome.
- Competitive salary and benefits. The baseline salary is average for the industry but the benefits and bonus make it a great package. Pension, bonus, death in service, Gym, Sky TV & Broadband, healthcare, paternity/maternity pay, etc.",Nothing worthy of the words.
9,Sky Betting & Gaming,The Best Place You'll Work,2022-03-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great place to work where employees are valued highly and the culture is second-to-none. Overall benefits package is very generous.,Salaries take a while top catch up with the wider industry.

Members club with ""GLT Ops"" etc. Hard to progress career-wise, no longer seems to be a focus to keep talent and employees, not scared to loose knowledge and skill sets from teams, which affects the people on the ground who still have targets and deadlines to meet."

17,Sky Betting & Gaming,"Not what it once was, it's going downhill...",2022-02-11,3.0,Software Engineer,People. They have a great culture and have amazing talent. The managers are great and have really good knowledge. However all the best people are leaving / have left and taking all that talent and amazing culture with them. Benefits are amazing ! One of the best places to start your career very fun for younger people not too fussed about high salaries . Free beers and pizza are great when you don't have a mortgage and little ones to care for !,"Slow monolithic corporate machine. Stuck in ancient process and feature focused. Absolute mountains of tech debt that gets worse everyday. As you will see the reliability of the of the product is getting worse it's because more things are being duck taped on to add new features. There are queues for promotions when employees clearly deserve them but a ""slot"" has to be come available so they just leave then we lose great people.
Engineering is more tech support these days with lots of maintaining legacy systems, everyone knows they are not fit for purpose but just lives with it. Lots of fire fighting."

21,Sky Betting & Gaming,Growing pains,2022-01-25,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- exciting industry and scale
- products are some of the best in the market
- a genuine care for Safer Gambling and responsibility throughout the company
- generally really good people to work with","- impossible to get anything done due to significant single points of failure. The company could move so much quicker by addressing this.
- pay is poor and you have to fight for any movement due to a strange pay review process (based on recency of last pay review as opposed to merit).
- progression (in terms of role) seems random with some areas of the business (in particular Product and Tech) not even knowing what the next steps look like for roles. There are some great learning opportunities, but a lack of transparency in what someone needs to do to progress."
22,Sky Betting & Gaming,Good benefits but poor progression,2022-01-25,2.0,Commercial Executive,"Benefits are overall great. Good bonus, Sky TV and lots of events. 
It's changed massively but the people used to be great but has seen a lot of people leave so the good culture has been hit hard. 
Throughout lockdowns though they were absolutely class and kept everyone in secure jobs. 
The social life is great and hard to match elsewhere","Pay is pretty poor and is renown for paying less than a lot of businesses. No real desire to change this even though it's frequently brought up to leadership. 
They are really behind the curve with flexible working since the pandemic and from most accounts still are. 
Progression is absolutely terrible and you can see this from how many great people are leaving. The vast majority of discussions about pay and progression are so political leaving managers helpless to actually keep good staff. Ironically you see some people progress after being involved in scandals that could have got them fired showing that it's very much who you know not what you know a lot of the time."
23,Sky Betting & Gaming,Fantastic place to work!,2022-01-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The people make the palce

37,Sky Betting & Gaming,Great place to start but you can outgrow,2021-11-15,4.0,Principal Software Engineer,Operationally mature with a strong supportive culture,Engineering doesn't have the strong voice it used to have.

42,Sky Betting & Gaming,Don't believe all you read about their DI strategy,2021-10-28,3.0,Engineering,"Great opportunity to learn from some very intelligent people who work here. The tech is often cutting edge, you get to work with some exciting tech stacks that a lot of other companies have yet to adopt.

The benefits are good in particular the pension and the free Sky TV.","I have experienced and witnessed discrimination, homophobia, bullying and a lad culture that seems to plague certain parts of the business. Which is often described as ""banter"". I have seen this being reported on numerous occasions with little long-term change. Some people's opinions matter more than others it can often come down to who shouts the loudest to be heard. Certain people seem to be invincible as they keep progressing no matter what they do or say.

The business has a lot of issues with communication between squads and management. Deadlines are often directed in a top-down manner with little input from the engineers completing the work. This leads to completely unrealistic deadlines which are never met and with large amounts of pressure exerted on the team, causing conflict and burnout for the team members. For a company that likes to claim they care so much about their staff members' mental health, they often don't seem to realise the way they organise projects often creates these problems.

Since the rise of remote working the pay offered isn't competitive with the rest of the market. Many great members of staff are leaving to get significant salary bumps"

55,Sky Betting & Gaming,Glad I made the leap,2021-08-13,5.0,Risk Operations Manager,"I had been working at my previous employer for almost 20 years and my development had stalled. It was a big step for me to leave this area of comfort and I was very anxious about joining a new company. But Sky Betting & Gaming couldn't have been better! Their onboarding was slick and welcoming, keeping me up to date at every stage of the process. And when joining up with my team, everyone has been very encouraging and supportive. There is genuinely a culture of people here where everyone is valued as individuals.",The only con would be the time I joined. Working remotely for the first few weeks comes with it's challenges of integrating into an existing team. But I honestly feel like my colleagues have done everything they could to limit this feeling of isolation.

I feel like I have hit the ground running and people are listening to my ideas across all levels, along with getting the recognition I deserve for my heard work which is so nice. It's like a breath of fresh air working for a company that put the people at the heart and forefront of the business. 

The benefits are amazing compared to other businesses I have worked for in the past - including free Sky TV and broadband, a great pension, perks and a self development fund each year to spend up to £1k per person!

198,Sky Betting & Gaming,My best job yet,2020-09-28,5.0,Head of People,"It's been really rewarding to work with Leaders that are genuinely invested in making decisions that centre around all of us. 

Throughout the pandemic our Senior Leadership Team have been transparent and clear communicators throughout which really helped to put our minds at ease and demonstrate that they can and will stand by our values. 

I've had a lot of opportunity to progress which I'm not sure I'd have got elsewhere and the people here are some of the best you'll get to work with in your career, it's rare (In my opinion) to find a workspace were there's so much cohesion and a willingness to support each other.","There's not a lot to grumble about especially with how we've been treated over the last 6 months, it helps you value what you've got."

200,Sky Betting & Gaming,Great Company,2020-09-25,4.0,In Play Football Trader,"Great culture, Good bonuses and benefits",Base pay is bit disappointing for a company that wants to lead the way and be the best
201,Sky Betting & Gaming,"Best Place to Work 3 Years Ago, Not Anymore",2020-09-24,3.0,Software QA Engineer,"- Benefits package is pretty strong, free Sky TV package for permanent employees and a discounted gym membership. 

- Nice offices in a central location, only a 10 minute walk away from Leeds station. 

- If you enjoy sports betting & gambling in general working in the industry is absolutely fascinating. 

- There's a bonus for non contact centre staff which is pretty competitive. 

- Some genuinely passionate and intelligent people work there. 

- The social side of the business is really strong, plenty of staff parties and random beer/pizza days (pre-Covid).

- The leadership team are really visible and will genuinely consider anything that is raised to them.","- The area that I worked in was a really diverse group of people, by the time I moved it was a total boy's club made up of former William Hill employees and people that had worked together in some capacity so had been fast-tracked into the company. This has totally killed the culture within that particular area as hiring managers have just hired people that they've worked with before. 

- The salaries on offer are pretty low in comparison to what other companies in Leeds pay, particularly in technology. The justification for this is the benefits package but if you're in an area that doesn't receive Sky TV (or you just don't want it) there's not much left in the package to shout about. Is that really justification for paying 15%-20% lower than the market rate? 

- After the merger with the Stars Group I had no line manager for around 9 months. I didn't have a 1-1 for the entire 9 months. I genuinely think I could've not turned up for a few weeks and nobody would've actually noticed. 

- Far too much praise is heaped on people going as fast as possible in technology with a total sacrifice on quality. Junior engineers are praised for having a high output, even if the quality of their work is appalling. This has led to massively inflated egos and junior engineers that will encourage everyone else in the team to cut corners to save time. 

- The Product teams are largely made up of 20-somethings who have a much bigger social budget than other teams. 

- There's a big 'lad' culture in the office in general. Whereas the technology teams tend to be pretty inclusive the rest of the business is awful in this regard. 

- The quality of line management in the technical teams is generally really poor. There are no strong characters or managers who will stand up for you and fight your corner when you both know you are right. Far too often I was told something that I was raising was important but that it wouldn't go any further because my line manager just wouldn't be able to get their point across. 

- Covid - whilst people have been kept on, redundancies have been minimal and nobody has been furloughed (to my knowledge) there's a definite feeling that we should all be grateful to just be in a job. Other companies have looked into making remote working more permanent for those that want it, offering reimbursements for home working equipment, offering allowances for increased expenses when working from home. All of this has been suggested and shot down by the leadership team. When you know how much the enlarged group is making profit-wise it's a drop in the ocean to offer some of these initiatives."
202,Sky Betting & Gaming,One big family,2020-09-21,5.0,Gaming Operations Executive,"Great benefits, lots of opportunities to improve, whether other jobs or just courses for yourself.",The hours can sometimes be tough
203,Sky Betting & Gaming,Recently poisoned by far-left propaganda.,2020-09-18,1.0,Engineering,"Not much accountability, so you're in for an easy ride if you’re not looking for career progression.","- Very recently, far-left political propaganda and activism have started to be broadcast company-wide. If you do ANYTHING to show disapproval, you will be formally interrogated for hours and ""disciplined"" by clearly a biased People ""Support"" team.

- A toxic political internal culture which demonstrates true discrimination, complete with political Slack echo chambers dedicated to mocking anyone who sits anywhere to the right of far-left.

- An anti-white-male agenda has started ""progressing"" through the company, with even senior leadership demonstrating support at company events with comments such as ""there are too many white men in this room!"".

- To conclude, if you want to turn up to work and do your job without being bombarded by irrational activists and transparent cringeworthy indoctrination, this isn't the place for you."

So much flexibility for the employees and a great management team.,I can't really think of anything. There are always a few niggles but they exist at all companies I have worked for.

216,Sky Betting & Gaming,Where the culture is treated just as important as the commercial side,2020-08-23,5.0,Community Partnerships Manager,"SB&G is a super unique company, with a culture you just don’t find anywhere else. I joined just two years out of University and was given the opportunity and support to do pretty much anything I believed in. The CEO and leadership team always supported me and others, no whatever level of seniority or job role we held. The culture is fun, trusting, and inspiring. I left after five years for an international opportunity but had it not been for that I would have been happy and still growing at SB&G. One thing that is true is that the business treats its culture just as important (if not more than) its commercial arm.","There are not many downsides, however I remember thinking I wouldn’t like to leave for maternity at SB&G as the culture is so fast paced ( or so I thought at the time) and from the outside it didn’t look like an efficient or smooth journey back, however I believe a lot has changed and they have been working on this area of improvement for some time."

Decent bonus. 
Can be chilled out (though very dependent on squad)","They’re very good at shouting about what they’re going to do but I rarely see it delivered. 
Lack of direction from leadership. 
If they put half as much effort into keeping their staff as they do trying to recruit new ones no one would ever leave - beware their recruitment hype. 
Lad culture. 
Managers pick favourites. 
Baffles me how some people have got to their position at this company. 
Claims not to have a hierarchical structure but definitely does (and increasingly so). 
Little (or no) career progression. Pick a good starting salary."

Dont leave your current job for a job here under any circumstances!,"This is honestly the worst place I have ever worked. 

Once you are in, promotion to the outside world about 'how good a place to work it is' is thrown down your neck. You are almost paid to promote the Sky Betting and Gaming to the outside world. 

People are treated as numbers no matter what level you are at. One minute you can be doing an amazing job, the next minute your job is taken from under your feet and they will pay you the absolute minimum requirement to get rid of you, almost chucking you out on the street. 

Imagine you had given up a great role elsewhere, that was paying you well, that you had worked at for over 10 years and were headhunted for an 'amazing job' but less than 6 months in, the role is 'no longer required' leaving you with nothing - this is not abnormal and can be seen through various reviews how ""cut throat"" they are.

My advice to anyone thinking of joining this ""amazing"" company is DONT. You will regret it for the rest of your life."

- Relaxed atmosphere with few rules; serious work done in a non-serious way.
- Accomodating place to work: flexible hours day to day (simply agreed with manager on a mutual respect basis), great understanding for last minute holiday or emergencies.
- Amazing support for health and family issues.
- Extremely competent and very intelligent people working here.
- Lots of individualism; people wear all sorts and it's all accepted.
- Exciting work; it's a fun and fast industry with a lot of creative design work, fun experimentation and great front-end websites.
- Cutting edge tech stack.
- Hugely profitable business means lovely benefits and daily perks.
- Benefits list is amazing, from a nearly-free top-end Sky package, to free gym membership, local discounts, saving schemes and so much more.
- Decent machines to work on (choice of i7 PCs or Mac Pros for everyone not in the call centre, who have decent desktop machines).
- Comfortable office environment with great facilities, few 'stupid' rules which are common (like don't drink at your desk, or don't have hot food in the office): we're adults and we don't need rules which make it weird and uncomfortable to 'live' in the workplace; if someone spills, they clean it up. Simple.
- Little travel required between offices for many jobholders.
- Slack is used across the entire business, allowing great comms (between meetings) between Marketing, Change, Customer services to 
- Agile and Waterfall working used (mostly Agile) and well understood by all of the business
- Excellent graduate scheme to bring in developers.
- Each squad (team) is responsible for their own area and has a LOT of autonomy to choose their best tech stack, their own architecture; DevOps environment.","- It's a gambling company and we're providing entertainment for people. sadly, some poeple struggle to see when they should slow down or stop spending money. Whilst SBG are one of, if not the best company for identifying people struggling with gambling and helping them, it's still doesn't give you the same feeling as working for e.g. a charity.
- Relaxed culture might not be up your street!
- True blue-collar workers would struggle with the relaxed atmosphere here. It's playful and jovial very often.
- The average age of employees is probably around 28; could be good or bad but a lot of people outside of SBG see this as a bad thing, a limiting thing.
- Management can be very hands-off which can be good and bad, depending on your style/ability/needs.
- Higher management can push throuhg ideas which railroad ongoing work.
- There's usually one or two things a year which can affect a lot of other work, but the required changes are important/worth doing, and everyone rallies to ensure delivery."

A good portion of the management team are for want of a better word, children...sometimes it feels like lord of the flies in the office.  Worst of all, you can't speak your mind... HR beckons if you do !.  Also do not trust anybody, you can't keep anything a secret..it always get's back to management who then go crying to HR.

I honestly think the Leeds office will be shut down very soon and all the IT shipped to Canada to be controlled by their parent company The Stars Group...after all why keep 2 offices open when you can train up staff and only have to pay for one !

Opportunity to progress, and shots taken on newbies, often into roles you're vastly unqualified for, providing you're friends with the hiring manager.","The company culture is entirely based upon what senior management (who see you for 10mins a week) think your personality is. I've benefited from promotions I probably shouldn't have got, cos the management likes me, and been passed on ones I was by far the most qualified for, and management have no issue privately telling you it's because they don't really like you. 

People in power (in customer ops) have hired their friends into senior positions from outside the company, and then fast tracked them up, to cement their own positions. They then establish a stranglehold on the truth so that the wider business has no idea what's going on. 

Those hired into management either have management backgrounds but no idea how to work in SBG or with the products, or know the products but have no idea how to manage. In either case no training is offered and this leads to a wholly incompetent lower management structure. 

Management is abusive and closes ranks if anyone raises a grievance, creating a bully culture and a sense of hopelessness for anyone who's their latest target. People raising mental health issues are passively mocked and smirked at. 

Oh and to top it all off, the company has just been subject to a takeover, the new owner's first actions was to cancel the profitability bonus (the company is still very profitable), lay off 10% of the workforce and start outsourcing to India."

Decisions are made on little to no domain experience and often borne out of nepotism. This has a detrimental impact not only on day to day delivery but the morale of those expected to deliver. Couple that with a practically nonexistent forum for career management and progression (ironically, this is contrary to a huge investment in developing people managers), this all but erodes one’s confidence and willingness to stay.

* Great set of benefits.
* Tribe culture means teams are empowered within their own teams to deliver without much corporate red tape.
* Agile pedigree, lots of teams operating in different ways and more is being done to share that working
* Work hard, play hard mentality with some great annual events
* Lots of leadership will take the time to talk to you in person if you ask for it
* Has been lots of opportunity to move around and try new roles in the last few years
* Worked with some of the most capable people of my career at SBG
* Probably learned the most I have at any company in the shortest time
* Would have been 5 stars but the last 6 months have been rough (see below)
* I was well paid and made it difficult for me to find much of a better offer elsewhere","* Techies are treated like children that need to be pandered too the amount of money squirrelled away to allow techs to do what they want with tech instead of delivering valuable product is on the rise. There is a very unhealthy culture of tech having a say so with some pretty negative and non pragmatic people in senior roles.
* Recent exodus of very well respected leaders that got SBG to where it was and unclear expectations from strategy and new leadership.
* Recent acquisition will mean lots of change over the next year or two which may or may not be for the better depending on your role
* Some leadership unable to let go of their old roles and help those below them thrive by giving responsibility and ownership
* Some areas of the business get completely washed over whilst others have budget for parties, better office space and furniture and more time out of working for events (the division of tribes is grown by this)
* Say goodbye to any predictability on bonuses (they are paid and usually pretty good) but its impossible to tell now they are not forthcoming with financial results (like they were previously)"

There is a 'lad culture' that makes it a hard place to work sometimes if you're not 'one of the boys'.

Tech staff seem to be treated like they are special, and as a result it means that rude, ignorant, and unfair behaviour towards non-tech staff is widely tolerated.

Offices in Leeds are fragmented and have different cultures despite being in the same business park!

They are laying off 10% of the staff. They are cutting back so much they have had to remove Yorkshire tea for a cheaper version and even losing flavoured teas. I mean what kind of company asks its employees ""how can we make cuts"" Clearly no idea from a financial point of view.
There are managers in place that seem to have no real meaning, input or relevance but are ""part of the original team"" very much a look after their own culture. The shop front is so well run you would not believe what is behind the door. They run a great PR Game.

Getting nearer probation end and dared to negotiate a 1 month extension after asked wrong substitute question. Obviously upset someone.

1 month extension, 1/2 of which was leave, was constant opression. Afternoon of day going on leave where probation would have ended while away I was suspended for Gross Misconduct (kneejerk reaction). I had seen the text of an old chat on a summary of recent contacts that was clearly an RG concern so I had raised it. I hadn't seen the text at the time otherwise would have had the same reaction and raised it then or had seen part of it and stood up and asked if anyone had already had that customer through. 

Customer had engaged with someone else on chat minutes before that day and had been told to phone in. Came back on empty chat with same person, but did not engage. Came on empty chat with me, and did not engage although I paste in standard text to let all customer's know there is someone there.

I love how social the business is too - we have regular social events as a team and also have bigger company-wide events like the races, charity ball and the gathering. 
SBG also has a great benefits package which includes a free gym membership at a gym across the road. This means I can exercise on my lunch break and therefore have more time to relax at home in the evening.

Starting with telephone and FaceTime interviews, completing online tests and being invited to an assessment day. The online tests was definitely a concern for me, I always felt like I can’t show my true potential, however unlike other schemes, selection isn’t reliant upon those results. In terms of the interview process via Skype and telephone, Anna was incredibly friendly and supportive, and wanted to get the best out of you. This took the form of a discussion rather than an interrogation. Upon being successful to the assessment day, the day involved ice breakers, networking with the teams and Graduates, a group activity, a presentation and 1:1 interviews. The staff at Sky Betting and Gaming were so friendly and so willing to share their knowledge and put you at ease. They shared their passion for the company and gave the opportunity to ask questions and have interesting discussions. The interview was also relatively informal, they were very friendly and just wanted to get the best out of you. I had never attended an assessment day before, and this was definitely an amazing experience for me. Similarly, the recruiters were absolutely fantastic. They provided consistent support and guidance, from the first interview, calling to give advice before the assessment day, and being on hand on the day if you had any questions or needed any support. The selection process was also very quick. The whole process was seamless and would advise anyone to apply for a position with this company!","As the process was so efficient, and the teams were so supportive, it is difficult to provide cons.

More focus on generating development ideas for process improvements from people who do them day in day out is probably required

386,Sky Betting & Gaming,Great place to enjoy the work you do; Not the best place to rise through the ranks,2017-09-12,2.0,Product Owner,"The people are fantastic; really friendly and enthusiastic
There is a lot of room to take on more ownership and responsibility
Lots of exciting socials
Best place to work in your first year with the business.","Responsibility isn't fairly acknowledged or rewarded
Salary quickly becomes noncompetitive as responsibilities grow
Many operational teams have glass ceilings
Lack of structure makes SBG more entertaining but can jeopardise the professionalism of employees early on in their careers."

391,Sky Betting & Gaming,Trader,2017-08-02,4.0,Trader,"Free Sky TV, internet and broadband.",Far too many meetings held every day; meetings about future meetings then another meeting to debrief the previous meeting they'd already had the initial meeting to plan.

395,Sky Betting & Gaming,the culture,2017-07-11,5.0,Software Engineer,"The culture here is amazing, not just a place to turn up and type some stuff. The learning and development opportunities are fantastic, the management all seem to focus on the people working here as well as the turnover",Big(ish) company can sometimes feel insignificant
396,Sky Betting & Gaming,Great people!,2017-06-27,4.0,Software Engineer,An amazing place to work. The people are what make it. Brilliant benefits. Teams are relatively independent in how they work with internal tooling and services getting better all the time. Amazing opportunities to learn and develop your professional skills. Without doubt one of the best places that I've ever worked. Awesome zero blame culture - learning and dealing with issues as a collective group.,"Product features often take priority over the correct technical approach, usually leading to hours of incident / emergency work catching up with squads. Salaries are very inconsistent both internally and in comparison to external market rates. Due to rapid growth in recent years promotion from external candidates has been prioritised over internal applicants resulting in stalled careers.  Lots of process overheads can cause very slow release pipelines. Scary dependencies on third parties."
397,Sky Betting & Gaming,Treated like grownups,2017-06-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,It's nice to work somewhere that doesn't treat you like a child. There's autonomy in what you do and how you do it.,The salaries - while good a few years back - aren't keeping pace with market rate.
398,Sky Betting & Gaming,Good company but limited growth,2017-06-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Clear company direction from senior and direct managers.
Decent benefits, especially TV although they only offered the cheap broadband (which I then cancelled because it was too bad).
Lovely offices.","Massive focus on KPIs made the company impersonal at times.
Not supportive of career growth unless you're one of the favoured ones.
Assessments were sometimes opaque which is bad considering it had a direct impact on salary reviews and bonuses."
399,Sky Betting & Gaming,Great place to work,2017-06-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The people and the pace of the business is amazing and there is always something new and innovative to get involved in,The amount of structure changes is a little crazy sometimes.

404,Sky Betting & Gaming,Great Place to Work,2017-04-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The best thing about Sky Bet is that the company is large enough to offer lots of perks, but there is still a small company culture. By that I mean you have freedom to work on areas you feel need to be a priority and everyone is open to trying things differently.","There really aren't many. Career progression could be better and there only a few opportunities to be promoted depending on where you work. Most promotions seem to happen from being in the right place at the right time, like an expansion of a department, rather than due to performance."
405,Sky Betting & Gaming,"Agile, but short term focussed & moody management",2017-04-21,3.0,,"- Great agile delivery culture in tech
- Start-up mentality still persists in some areas
- Young workforce, good work life balance
- Good benefits & offices
- 1000 pounds per year to spend on conferences or training
- Commitment to continuous improvement","- Very short term focussed, focus is always purely on hitting this weeks numbers
- Snr management can be very moody (depending on whether or not they have hit said numbers)
- Lacking some structure and process for a company of its size

Personally I was never happy with the continued management focus on how to squeeze more and more money out of customers.  There is little to no regard paid to responsible gambling and whenever regulation does come along the focus is on getting past the regulation without impacting bottom lines.  Ie. paying lip service to a toothless regulator"
406,Sky Betting & Gaming,"The best place to work in Leeds, but still room to improve.",2017-04-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Of all the companies I have worked for who say they are Agile, SB&G is the only one that actually took this seriously from the top to the bottom of the organisation. Experiments are the norm and even lean start up type approaches are possible. Training and development are high on the agenda with money available and time allowed to persue personal development.",The organisation is tech lead which sometimes means people who are not developers or architects etc are not recognised as much for the value they add. Some roles and responsibilities are confused. Lots of young staff sometimes miss an experienced head in the mix. Growth and reorganisations take a toll and some high quality people have left the business as a result. Quality and understanding of good practice can be inconsistent.

It's in Leeds city centre, albeit a long walk away from the centre itself","The people who work here are not worldly, parochial. Staff pretend to like each other but the mask is hard to maintain, everyone talks behind each other's backs. I work as part of the Transformation team, good people have left and yet the poor ones remain. We all hate the programme lead who is useless."

8. Support & acknowledgement from the Leadership Teams
9. Rewarding working for a huge brand
10. Demographic of colleagues
11. Equipment that's provided to staff
12. Business-casual attire","1. City Centre location means extortionate car parking costs
2. City Centre location also means employees can get stung by rising train fares (when perhaps pay doesn't rise in comparison)"
413,Sky Betting & Gaming,"Friendly, agile company",2017-02-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Still feels like a small company, there's very little BS and everyone's very friendly. The tech is good and improving all the time. Culture is excellent - openness and honesty are cornerstones and incident reviews are truly blameless.",Company is still finding its way after separating from Sky TV and there are a few teething problems in IT and reshuffling of organisational structure.

Tech Ninja fund is a nice perk. Management always approachable and happy to listen to new ideas or concerns. Company is growing fast and there's lots of opportunity to get involved in shaping the way we work as we change over time.  Working environment is really good.,"The pay is average for the industry but doesn't really reflect the calibre of the staff.

In the contact centre where I work I have a manager that is like a friend and does everything he can to push me to achieve more every day, I have friends in the training team that I will help out when needed and they treat me like one of the team every time and in the contact centre itself we have management in and amongst us, not hiding behind an office door,  sharing conversation and always there for support.

And thats before even mentioning the benefits! Free Sky TV, Internet, BUPA health care, Dental, Discounted TV's, Ipads, phones etc the list goes on.",I cannot think of anything
417,Sky Betting & Gaming,Great tech and staff,2017-02-10,5.0,Software Engineer,"+ Squads are mostly autonomous with lots of influence in their technical stack. Plenty of cutting edge technology.
+ The staff I've worked with so far have almost all been amazing and most willing to help out.
+ If in Bet you get Friday afternoons for learning and development.
+ Great benefits (£1000 tech ninja, income protection, healthcare plus subsidised dental etc).
+ Quality hardware (Macbook pro + 2 Dell monitors). The macbook allows for mobility and pair programming which is also great for learning from others.
+ Great space to work in with the new office
+ Random perks such as free food and snacks, raffles for Amazon vouchers or football tickets","- On call bonus could be better or at least have a full 1 in 6 rota for all squads
- Some systems/technology in other squads sound like they could do with some TLC and updating.
- A huge amount to learn, especially if on call and supporting systems out of hours."

A 24/7 business culture that isn't reflected across all support teams."
419,Sky Betting & Gaming,Internationally lost,2017-01-12,2.0,,"Great technical employees, £1000 tech ninja fund per year is a great benefit

Definitely a company on the up on the whole, just not in this ""tribe""","This applies mainly to the Sheffield International team, I have heard it's better in Leeds, hence the 2nd star...

""We bet you've never worked anyway so Agile"" is an absolute joke - everything is dictated from on high, technical debt piles up with no chance to fix and if a test environment works for more than a week straight it's pretty much treated as the second coming. Roadmaps are non-existent, leaving developers working week to week on tickets, often changing requirements mid sprint.

Not really a ""collaborative"" environment, you're not allowed to have an opinion on anything or you'll be labelled as one of the troublemakers. Don't argue with management or you'll be shuffled out the back door quietly one lunchtime, joining a long list of ex-employees seen off the same way.

On call is compulsory (or at least they'll try to bully you into it), and badly paid, with no training offered.

Morale is about as low as it could possibly be, with other employees openly talking about looking for a new job in the middle of the office. Management have seemingly no idea, although given the frankness of it it's more likely they just don't care. Career opportunities are non-existent too, developers are expected to stagnate and fill mulitple roles for the same money until their specific part of the business makes money, which isn't due any time soon."
