0,Skyscanner,On the up again,2022-04-10,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Travel is recovering and the company is getting back on track as it does
- Great ground level culture, with a committed diversity lead in Jenna 
- Salary ranges were reassessed in March 2022, with Scotland now competitive again 
- The focus during covid of trimming excess services and tech is starting to show a positive effect
- Great positive and proactive attitude by Office Managers. Most people still like to spend half the week at home, but the time in the office is good because of the people who put the effort in to make it so","- Too many pieces of work in progress at one time leads to slower overall progress
- A higher than healthy percentage of junior experience engineering managers leads to them having few good examples to emulate. Hiring drive in progress should help"
1,Skyscanner,Dream to nightmare,2022-04-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working with some of the brightest engineers and developers you’ll meet anywhere. Generally, people really care about the traveller, their colleagues and more broadly as well. There’s a really strong social conscience among employees.","COVID and other factors led to an almost complete overhaul of top leadership - several senior leaders were brought in from outside in quick succession, who didn’t align closely to the brilliant culture created by previous leadership and existing employees.

On a more basic level, holiday allowance wasn’t great compared with many other UK employers"

12,Skyscanner,Things are on the up!,2022-02-20,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Since the development of the 2025 company strategy, the morale in the company feels as though it’s on its way up out of the gloom that has been the pandemic years. 

The move to hybrid working will be a positive one in my opinion (though some may disagree with me on this)… and it seems senior leadership have listened and are making efforts to make sure the culture of the company is still a major draw card for the current and any prospective employees.

Recent announcements have also seen some benefits that were put on hold due to the recovery mode we entered (a result of the pandemic) reinstated - and that’s certainly lifted spirits as well. I feel hopeful about the company’s future once again.",Compensation reviews can’t come soon enough - (and we’ve been told they are).

16,Skyscanner,Salaries are low,2022-02-10,2.0,Software Engineer,Nice people and people take care of each other,It amases me that Skyscanner continue to ignore and argue that their salaries in Spain are competitive. The whole of Europe recognizes there is a change and opportunity in this city but the team have ignored this and continue to focus on their UK based offices. Its shortsighted. Theyre gonna lose that office eventually.

20,Skyscanner,Best place I ever worked,2022-01-25,5.0,Chief Product Officer (CPO),"As an exec my vote should count less than others / take with enormous grain of salt! But six years in, I still love this place and I am reminded every day how lucky I am to have found it. 

Pros:
* Small team with massive WW impact - feels like a family, but gorilla-sized impact
* Great brand, loved and used by literally hundreds of millions 
* Great people - world class talent, and ""no a-holes"" policy
* Great tech - huge scale engineering solutions among the best in the industry 
* Great values, especially ""Traveller first, Partners second, Skyscanner third"" -which is used every day to make the right decisions","* Sometimes we choose ""nice"" over ""direct"", and avoid conflict
* COVID gutted international travel, causing much stress. Coming back strong but not out of it yet."
21,Skyscanner,Only if you want to get stuck in time,2022-01-22,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,Pay and benefits are good,"* Slow moving and difficult to change anything. If you propose anything different from the status quo, the default answer will be NO.
* Lots of politics and egos to please.
* Documentation and bureaucracy in excess. You are going to spend more time writing confluence documents than writing code. (And no one will read it)
* Very poor onboarding process. They just throw you a bunch of confluence and that's it.
* Endless discussions on technical topics. Everyone has a different opinion and no one seems to reach an agreement.
* Lots of duplicate work. Different squads solving the same problems in different ways 
* Technical debt is huge. Poor code written everywhere, no standardised way of doing stuff.
* Very hierarchical. Senior managers and tech leads say how things should be done and everyone else follows, no questions asked.
* Having to go back to the office twice a week.
* Promotion process is bureaucratic and full of politics.
* Teams are not diverse.
* Senior engineers are treated as mid-levels.
* No opportunity to learn anything new, your career will get stuck in time."

That's about it.","Extremely unexperienced engineering managers, some of them are actually toxic. It's not uncommon to change managers few times per year. The performance reviews are toxic as well, rarely lead to anything.

The pay is extremely low for the expectations. It's also super hard to request any sort of support for personal development.

Low amount of holidays, pension match wasn't great either.

Some well established processes
On the surface there is a group of people working to improve diversity and inclusion.",Had to delete my other review taking about their diversity problems since I was sort of threatened with a legal action. I see some similar other reviews have also been deleted. This is essentially further suppressing minority groups. I wouldn’t join this company unless I’m a WWP (white western person). Legal note: Totally my opinion and perception and like all opinionated reviewers this review may not indicate reality.

47,Skyscanner,Great work life balance and well structured team,2021-09-05,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Amazing work life balance where your well-being is always prioritised to the fullest,Slow in execution. Take too much in planning experiments.
48,Skyscanner,Real culture with real impact,2021-09-03,5.0,Engineering Manager,"Everyplace talks about the importance of their culture but is often difficult to see it applied in the every day job, that's not the case for Skyscanner. Since the moment that you join the company and everyday from there you will feel how ""people first"" Skyscanner really is.

Your personal development is the key focus of you manager, the balance between work and life outside is always present, learning new things is encouraged in every role and everyone is super friendly and happy to help.",Diversity is one of the weakest points for Skyscanner. There is some work going on to improve it but is not impacting enough yet.
49,Skyscanner,Used to be great but has lost its way,2021-08-23,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Interesting problems in the data space
- Great attention to work/life balance, you're given complete flexibility over managing your time
- You'll meet some talented individuals within the company
- Good core benefits","- Impossible to progress unless you know the right people or are given opportunities. Openly told I would never get promoted
- Team atmosphere that once existed has gone, making it a challenge to get support when needed and harder to make changes to code
- Data as a group lacks a coherent identity and vision 
- Constant changes to the stack and tracking have reduced what data specialists can achieve
- Work was occasionally taken by other individuals and presented as their own without credit
- Bullying behaviour existed between teams and senior employees, with attempts made to discredit the work of other employees
- Significantly lower pay based on which office you work in"
50,Skyscanner,Great place to work,2021-08-23,5.0,Human Resources Manager,"Great Culture, great product, great future",Covid has made trading hard just now but that is short term.
51,Skyscanner,Afraid to be good at your job,2021-08-09,1.0,Marketing Director,Lots of really clever people in teams with the right intentions and smart ideas and creativity,"Too many people in their jobs without the experience or know how, yet incredible power and influence - often stop things and people progressing or succeeding, mostly female employees sadly, from the Edinburgh office. 
Then there are the male egos to contend with in Exec, again some of which have limited know how on key topics but spout brilliance. 
This has left me afraid to be good at my job for fear of the marketing and commercial teams based in Edinburgh and the product teams based in London."
52,Skyscanner,Good employer,2021-08-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company cares about the people, as much as how they care about the business. Generally considering a good place to work.",Management capability is not consistent. Internal process is sometimes messy and lack of structure & standard. Cross department collaboration efficiency is also not satisfying.
53,Skyscanner,okay,2021-07-09,2.0,Analyst,good working culture and benefits,nil - nothing much to mention
54,Skyscanner,Decent place considering the pandemic,2021-07-03,3.0,Product Designer,"- Some interesting problems to solve
- Great work-life balance","- Management would prefer to keep toxic leadership people
- Judgy vibe from other designers"
55,Skyscanner,Decent place to work but not what it's hyped up to be,2021-06-27,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"At Skyscanner you generally feel well taken care of. The offices, IT, equipment, induction etc are all great. The pay is fairly competitive too; for the roles I was aware of in Edinburgh, I don't think you could really do much better.

The people are generally good and they certainly pay a lot of lip-service to fairness, respect, equality etc in the workplace. I never felt like I was under an undue amount of pressure or that I was treated badly or spoken to rudely by a single person ever.

In the good times (pre-COVID), it was still a growing business with great economics that genuinely believed in letting the staff share the rewards of that growth. I'm sure those times will come again and, when they do, it'll be very enjoyable to be part of that journey.","The company is extremely processes-heavy and it's very, very hard to really get anything done. They are tied up with bureaucracy and legacy and asking for endless business cases for doing even the most trivial things. They somehow hope to catch up to the competition by going slower than them. 

The leadership talk about a 'bias to action' but the reality is there is a bias to documentation. The endless, endless documents can really drag you down. If you ask a simple question, you will be hammered with links to about a day's worth of reading instead of getting an answer. 

The product side of the business has far too little drive and too much ownership. They seem to gate-keep the resource for everything while contributing very little in terms of initiatives that actually take the business forward. Trying to fix or improve even the smallest thing, like replacing an outdated airline logo, can take days and days of being passed from squad to squad because nobody wants to take ownership of anything.

Engineering resource is impossibly limited, despite something like 60% of the business being engineers. I literally have no idea what they do all day. They're very proud of their 'ship rate' but so little actually changes that you'd be hard-pressed to spot the difference between the site today and 12 months ago.

The actual product itself, the website, is getting desperately behind the competition. I myself use Kayak when I'm booking my flights because it's better! Rank and file staff often suggest feature improvements but they are hand-waived away by senior leaders as being not important, while instead, they focus on 'brand' and what they *think* travellers want/need.

The old leaders of the business that made it great are long gone and those in charge now seem to lack real vision. Although there are a lot of talented and dedicated people at Skyscanner, the overall standard is surprisingly low for somewhere that has such a ridiculously onerous interview process. There are a lot of people, including at Director level and above, who have absolutely no business being in their positions."
56,Skyscanner,A once great company sliding into obscurity,2021-06-27,2.0,Engineering Manager,"If you're at a lower level (pre-senior), you won't be exposed to many of the cons listed below, which makes things more tolerable.

The day to day is usually quite pleasant, the issues are often only when dealing with people in leadership.

You have the opportunity to be exposed to a lot of different areas, which can be good for career development. I've learned a lot at Skyscanner about what to do (and what not to do).

I really can't fault their work/life balance.","Skyscanner operates like a company 10x its size, with all of the disadvantages that come with that and none of the benefits.

The much-vaunted culture is a facade. 'Traveller first' used to mean something, but these days it's ignored in favour of adding over-the-top tracking and features that nobody wants or needs. Skyscanner's app in particular is filled with technical debt but Product keep pushing new features instead of allowing teams time to fix it.

Salaries are not competitive. The company gaslights people into thinking they're lucky to work there while paying well below market rate. Alongside this, they continually waste money on useless third party tools and closing offices that were inexpensive to run, which necessitates hiring replacements in very expensive markets. They have money, they are just choosing to waste it on other things instead.

Promotions are a mess, optimising for how well you can talk about the value you deliver instead of actually delivering value. They take months, can be rejected for the most trivial of reasons, and even if you get one you won't get the salary increase for months (and it's not backdated when it does come through).

Tribe leadership is full of passengers who maintain the status quo and do nothing to try and improve things.

Skyscanner replies to a lot of these reviews, encouraging people to provide feedback internally to raise these concerns. Reader, know that I and many others raised concerns about these things over and over for years, then eventually left when I realised nothing would change. They are listening but not actually doing anything in response."

Its constantly an old vs new and the new talent attracted typically leaves soon after as they find that new ideas or improvements are blocked 
- Leadership: Many leaders have been promoted based on length of stay and not true skills, experience and talent as leaders. This is seen mostly in Commercial and some other teams where it seems they are untouchable even if they are no longer contributing and they are not able to bring the company forward 
- Lack of strategy: It seems in the past there was no strategy around what was built, and even now there is a process in place and structure but the strategy is lacking in terms of considering external cues and aligning across the business"

74,Skyscanner,One of the best Company Culture I've seen,2021-03-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company shows empathy in the wellbeing of it's employees(awesome work-life balance). Skyscanner also offers the space to be open and also there are very frequent townhalls with the executive team so as to provide a high level of transparency, especially going through very tough times. The collaboration between internal teams are very supportive, one phrase that I hear often is ""I'm happy to help"" which speaks volumes of how we collaborate to achieve.","It may have to do with the covid situation, but there have been frequent change of leadership, I'm hoping that this will stabilize during the recovery."
75,Skyscanner,A place to coast,2021-03-26,2.0,Principal Engineer,"I’ll start with the good - Skyscanner are exceptional at promoting a healthy work-life balance. They genuinely care about the employees and want to do what is best for them. Their offices are an extension of this trait by providing healthy snacks, coffee bars, relaxation areas and an effective working environment.","Where Skyscanner starts to go wrong is in the beliefs that they have a high bar of entry and that they are still a startup. The former is repeated as a mantra by management as if saying it enough times will make it true.

Product is driven from the bottom up, using the latest fad of OKRs. While this gives teams autonomy, it also results in a lack of alignment across product verticals and an endemic propensity to reinvent the wheel. There is so little buy-in from across the organisation that silos have formed even within Tribes and as a result each squad does its own thing to reach its end goal without Product Managers ever talking to each other. This then causes frustration when a squad is forced to have to interact with another squad (either within the same tribe or in a different tribe) and nothing quite meets in the middle.

This propensity to reinvent the wheel also extends to platform services in Skyscanner, in something of a snowball effect: any given opensource tool doesn’t quite match our ill-conceived requirements at Skyscanner so we’re going to write our own from scratch - and then because we wrote this tool from scratch we also have to write another tool that depends on it from scratch. Ad nauseam. As a result, by working for Skyscanner you lack the exposure to tools and libraries that the rest of the industry is using because you are forced to work within the confines of this square wheel utopia - and as a result will likely deskill over time rather than upskilling alongside your peers in other companies.

And god forbid if you ever call this out - dissent in Skyscanner is crushed without mercy. The only way to get promoted out of Senior/Principal level as an individual contributor is to be part of a clique. The clique that drives this kind of reinvent-the-wheel decision making and backs it to the hilt. Whenever the political nature of The Clique is brought up in an all-hands meeting, senior leadership denies that this is a thing at Skyscanner.

This same clique then enforces that all squads adhere to magic numbers to show that they are healthy. Let’s take test coverage as an example: we all know that good test coverage makes us feel safe to make future changes as the tests will likely catch any bugs raised due to backwards compatibility breaks. The Clique’s idea: mandate that all code must have 80% test coverage (which is then folded into another magic number rather than even being displayed transparently). But 80% test coverage simply means that 80% of your code is executed during tests. It doesn’t make those tests valuable, nor does it actually guarantee that your code is good. But squads are forced to add tests for getters and setters just to hit that magic number.

This isn’t helped by the lack of presence of the CTO, who has delegated all of his engineering responsibilities to one individual, and all of his management responsibilities to another individual. The only time you remember that Skyscanner has a CTO is when the rest of the exec team joke about forgetting the CTO.

On the subject of the exec team, they have largely been absent during the coronavirus crisis and have adopted a “let’s close our eyes and cross our fingers and hope everything is back to normal soon” approach to the pandemic. Trust in the exec team and their vision, as shown by the latest company-wide survey, is at an all-time low. The convenient departure of the CEO responsible for this vision and a round of redundancies back in September of last year may be a step in the right direction but more work is required here.

More work is also required on dealing with people that are not performing well - another recurring theme in the company-wide survey. Managers have significant difficulty in either providing negative feedback or recognising poor performance - I like to hope that it’s the former rather than the latter, but given that some senior poor performers have been promoted in the last year this hope may just be false.

Last but not least, the pandemic has hit Skyscanner hard. This has been the case for the whole travel industry, and is largely outside of their control. But this meant that Skyscanner had to cancel all additional benefits that they once provided (working from other country offices, extended leave, milestone bonuses, share options) making it a much less competitive company to work for when compared to companies in other industries. This is something driving the attrition rate to record highs and if Skyscanner are not careful will result in complete brain drain - leaving only The Clique behind."

Very strong leaders coming from companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft to learn from. A lot of software engineering experience accumulated over 20 years makes it a great environment to thrive. About 50% of the employees are, in fact, software engineers and there is a lot of autonomy. I can say my team was amazing, from  the Product Owner to the most junior member. 

It's a pity attrition during COVID-19 slowed things down but Skyscanner is as strong an organisation as always in my opinion, and still a great place to work. In fact, I would consider joining again in the future.","Negativity around the pandemic and how it affected travel, that led to a snowball effect resulting in high attrition, could have been handled a bit better / faster at exec level.

If you are the kind of person that likes to have an impact by adding value, do yourself a favor and stay away. The only thing that matters is to please senior management and if you don't play by their rules you will be marginalized and ignored.

The pillars in Engineeing are Build it Right, Run it Right and Create the Right environment and they are given truly equal footing.

There is a 'can-do' attitude in most teams and a sense of humour and connection across locations. This has really made a difference during remote working. The majority of people at Skyscanner are also passionate about pushing for positive change, so the surveys get high response rates, the I&D initiatives have lots of active voices and participation. People aren't afraid to speak up and most people feel that they can make a difference. There's been great support and empathy from leaders during the pandemic to accommodate personal situations. This is a low point for Skyscanner, but still better than your average company. We should be aspiring for better though.

The new CEO could be the fresh start Skyscanner needs for our company recovery and a cultural reset.","Skyscanner has a problem with its leaders. Not necessarily the exec team themselves, but the people they are relying on to make things happen. As Skyscanner has grown there are more and more middle-managers who don't embody Skyscanner's original culture or the culture that is talked about in town halls or other events. There is a disconnect between what we say people experience and what they actually experience. There continues to be people skating by, while others deliver huge output with minimal recognition.

This is common in lots of companies, but especially bad at Skyscanner
The staff have been telling management this for years in employee surveys and it is worse than ever.
Humiliating calibration sessions where department management and team management go through each member of the department, the manager puts forward their rating and management pushback with all the reasons why that person is not that rating. Not sure why this has to be done with all team leads - most of whom are your peers and you work with daily - and can't just be with the people managers individually?

The disappointment comes more from the expectation, and because we still care.


Too much to share but i'm just gonna focus on one.

Leadership Team
Credits to them handling such an unprecedented challenge in the company's history, as well as for the entire industry. Tough to layout 25% employees, and not easy to deal with all the direct and sometimes 'rude' questions in townhall.

But.... i still cannot hide my disappointment to the exec team
1) we have very little trust to what they tell us
frequent changes of the exec team, lack of transparency in big decisions, and all the ""politically trained answers"" in town hall. aargh.... what a waste of time 

2) Increasingly corporate and company outlook is pretty negative
Even before Covid hits, there were many issues with Skyscanner: increasing divide between offices, recognition of voice over output, lack of transparency in promotions, and slowdown of growth over the years are making Skyscanner ""just another company"". 
we need visionary and capable leaders uphold Skyscanner culture, and keep the best talents to execute the Recovery Plans. 

It's a dilemma if it's still worth staying loyal and fight through this pandemic together with the team. I hope the exec team can give us more faith."

The last few months have been tough for everyone. The redundancies made - and more importantly, the way they were communicated could have been vastly improved. Prime example: announcing promotions in the same week 25% of the company were made redundant. The emails were unclear and chaotic.

Scotland/London divide which is only growing bigger
Felt like you could never really open up as you felt like what you were saying would get back to you somehow
Senior management never told their direct reports on big decisions made. As such, gossip was rife in the company

140,Skyscanner,Difficult moment for a company with good values and brilliant people,2020-09-25,3.0,Engineer,"* Traveller-first value. Everyone, from all disciplines, cares about providing better experience to the traveller

* Blameless culture. People and teams share and learn from failures. This works well because the organisation is more focussed on how to get better than on who was at fault for a failure.

* World class engineering. The engineering organisation cares about solving large scale problems well. People are encouraged to help their team get better 

* Great and smart people. Brilliant people. Willing to share, teach and learn. 

* Transparent internal communications. Very open. 

* Beautiful offices. In central locations. Some perks. 

* Work life balance is a core value","* Culture of launching. Launches are celebrated and overshared, for instance in the #what-we-shipped channel. Following up after those to demonstrate business value is not demanded or expected. Which teaches the organisation that what one needs to do is have visible launches, do visible experiments, release things often without consideration of their business impact.

* Little accountability when big projects fail. Unlike with individuals and squads, when things go wrong for bigger projects or initiatives the company is not proactive to publicly acknowledge and learn from the mistakes. Recent examples could be when tribes fail to deliver their OKRs, or when projects that last nearly two years are cancelled, or when when big infrastructure projects disrupt everyone. No retrospectives are shared publicly, no ILDs are done. Which is not in line with failing forward and learning from one's mistakes

* Handling people during the recent layoffs. Recent COVID-19 disruption of the travel business has forced many changes in the team, the culture and the exec. Many people were laid off abruptly, the smallest offices were closed. People, who were voluntary working reduced hours to help the company, were laid off with little support in difficult times. This was not in line with the Skyscanner way of taking care of its people

* Lack of product vision. In my opinion, Skyscanner has released very few impactful features over the last couple of years. 

* Glass ceiling for Senior to Principal IC promotions. For years, the path for getting from a Senior Engineer to a Principal Engineer has not been clear both for the senior engineers and for their managers. Which leaves good people frustrated and they eventually leave. 

* Preparing engineering for scale. The engineering organisation is preparing itself for when it will be 10,000 people even though it has not reached the first thousand yet. There is an extra cost in enforcing a structure that is meant for 10k people on a smaller and leaner org

* Compensation adaptation. It is difficult 
to adapt the compensation of people who raise quickly though the levels. Those rock stars often stay at the lower ranges and it can take years to compensate them fairly.

* Data could be much better. And the Data Science organisation should have more impact on a business with so many users.

All that said, Skyscanner is a good company with strong values and brilliant people and I think they have what it takes to get through the COVID-19 crisis and lead the global transformation in travel."

Good life and work balance.
Smart, funny and talented colleagues, especially in low/mid level.
Free snacks, fruits & barista coffee machines (pre-COVID).","A bunch of talented people I personally know haven’t been promoted in years. It doesn’t matter if you’re a high performer, the promotion is only possible if you know the right people that can lobby your career progression. Meanwhile, people who do almost nothing but skilled in brown-nosing, organising useless meetings or writing long Confluence documents containing a lot of buzzwords tend to rise to the top. It’s all about the politics and self-advertising at Skyscanner. 

Full remote working is still not embraced (especially by the Scottish leadership), although everyone has been working from home for the last 6 months. Instead of allowing people to work wherever they want until at least 2021, every town hall starts with ‘We’re expecting our employees to get back to the office next month’. Come on, the world has changed. It’s not 2002 anymore.

With Gareth’s and Bryan’s departures, the company has become incredibly corporate. This is reflected in the way we talk and think as a company. Newly appointed senior and principal managers coming from corporate backgrounds don’t care much about the users, but rather how much money we can take out of their pockets. ‘Traveller-first’ company only exists on the paper surface.

New CEO Moshe doesn’t have a clear vision and strategy where the company is headed: he’s trying to win at everything but you cannot have too many North stars, there can be only one. As much as you would love it to be so, but ’Be the best at X' doesn't sound like a solid strategy.

Over the course of COVID-19, a lot of questions were asked about the runway and possible layoffs, but the answers from execs were extremely generic and vague, and unfortunately, it’s still the case. It feels like they’re all reading from one script rather than give honest, human answers.

The redundancies had been expected but the way they were made is questionable at best. The previous CEO Bryan Dove gave his employees a false glimpse of hope that Skyscanner could be ‘saved’ if the majority would switch to work 3 or 4 days per week at pro-rata salary or take unpaid salary (let alone the bonuses). The people who did that felt deceived because a couple of months later they would get an email from Moshe that they’re affected, regardless of how much they have sacrificed for Skyscanner so far. Yes, to find out whether you’re at risk or not, you would sit staring at your inbox and wait for an email that’s written in incredibly complex legal language, so that you wouldn’t sue the company. A great example of how much trust they have for their own employees."

146,Skyscanner,"Loads of good people, a great potential, poor execution and missing the point!",2020-09-09,2.0,Software Engineer,"Work / Life balance was excellent. So many great people were around to work around your schedule with regards to family or other commitments. I never felt the pressure of working hours before or after COVID times. 

When we were in the office, it was really fun and social on Fridays. Now on Zoom, although not replacing that experience, still, there is an effort to keep people connected. 

The People Team, IT, Payroll, Internal Portals for Benefits, Internal Communications and all these supporting functions work really well for the company. The offices, meeting rooms, social areas were excellent. You could definitely see that company invested really well in these areas.

Laptops, monitors and office desks were top class. After COVID, company allowed people taking their chairs etc. for a better WFH setup.

Most of the internal tools connected to Slack. This made certain chores much easier.

Most of the processes were written. Most of the domain knowledge were available via Skyscanner University. These helped understanding the business during onboarding days.","Most of the below are towards my perception and interactions. I cannot say 100% of the Skyscanner is like this. However, I'm still sharing for future references and maybe, just maybe, for improvements......

There were some critical managers in critical roles with really poor leadership. They were mostly first time managers and most probably learnt the job on the go. This is not wrong in general but it has became so obvious and inefficient in the time of crisis. Let alone crisis, even before COVID, these people were so hesitant to change and taking risk. It looked like as if this company will be making money forever and these people are going to be here forever with their benefits, salaries etc. a.k.a Status Quo 

These managers were so inefficient that even if number of people produce reports and in-depth analysis to steer away company from certain practices and technologies, they decide and inform without even talking to those individuals. Instead, those decisions were made in a 100% top-down approach. Some managers even regarded certain technologies and practices as their pets and maybe their only meaningful connection to the engineering and the company was that. This has created so much pain for the engineers to do their best job. Most of the time these pains and reports ignored with a very well executed lip service. At the end of the day, you always go back to square one.

CxO level has lost some important names. The biggest lost was obviously previous CEO, Bryan Dove. Bryan's leadership was replaced with greater amount of lip service, cooperate success theatre and loads of scripted cold messages.

The town halls perviously in Bryan's time were fun and motivating. When Moshe took over, town halls became an exercise of answering questions asked a week ago with well-played choreography. Some town halls even felt like a pre-recorded video in motion. The connection to people started to weaken everyday.

Competency Framework for career progression was one of the manuals you would never understand as an engineer in one go. The challenge was the asks in the document compared to what you have in real setup. The promotion process and the use of Competency Framework combined with poor leadership turned the whole setup impossible to progress for some. I have seen people admitting that the best way to promote is actually switching to another company. Some people even sarcastically mentioned that it is easier to join Skyscanner at a higher level than hassling for the promotion.

Internal tools for Cloud computing were intentionally good but execution wise were really poor. Instead of working and using well known public cloud practices, you start to practice internal tools. This leads to be deskilled in the long run if you stay very long. Because, as an engineer, you always work towards someone else's abstraction and understanding of the core technology. The amount of levels you need to get through for a simple POC in production was getting harder everyday.

Spotify's cursed squad/tribe model, even Spotify don't use it, turned the whole engineering organization into two-pizza sized teams working on half-slice problems. Not so many people and teams had the chance to solve a problem end to end. They were either stopped midway due to change of priorities or new OKR storm came by and reshuffled their focus. This has led so many half baked products in production. Even internally in so many channels, people admit these but never take any action.

So many of these were shared with managers but as part of lip service, I didn't believe they made it to the top level, CTO. There were even criticism around certain projects and teams being elitist. While some people agreed, most of the things didn't change. This lead funding wrong parts of the product and missing the foundations.

The biggest issue I perceived was the existing tech, people, leadership & management took Skyscanner to today but will very much less likely to the next level. If not in the next 2-3 years, definitely in the next 5-8 years, Skyscanner will be much gone and eaten by Google and Airlines themselves. It is just sad seeing this very big opportunity slipping through the fingers and very less number of people without power and influence see it."

166,Skyscanner,party over people,2020-07-20,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"To echo another Glassdoor reviewer, Skyscanner is one of the most polite companies I ever worked at. Everyone says sorry and thank you. Leadership wants to build a harmonious society.

The continuous delivery stack is pretty slick and something that the enablement teams can be proud of.

There are some excellent engineers in the company, and there are opportunities to mentor and learn if you are lucky enough to be assigned into a good team or have a manager who will give you the freedom to work across teams.","Most employees in the Shenzhen office are not hired through the same process as other offices, so the culture is not aligned with the rest of the company. Good engineering and design principles are not prioritized. People are told to never disagree with their manager. Meetings are frequent and inefficient. Although nobody is officially asked to work overtime, many people still do. Rather than trying to address these issues, leadership has doubled down by bringing in batches of contract workers who have a deadline-based reward structure and even less incentive to meet the quality standards expected in other offices.

Skyscanner also has a problem with teams not collaborating with one another. Many teams facing similar problems tend to favor building custom solutions that only work for their own use case, which leads to technical debt getting accrued very quickly.

The biggest con is the gap between the ""hip tech company"" culture Skyscanner presents publicly and the reality, which is that the company is not very diverse and has leadership that is far behind the times on social issues affecting both employees and customers. There is strong pressure to toe the party line on any topics that the Chinese government considers sensitive, which undermines the global brand and makes the workplace unsafe for critics, dissidents and their allies in all offices."

Pay is decent. Low/mid level colleagues are friendly and approachable.

You can work from home (WFH) two or three days a week without anyone batting an eye.","The newly installed CEO (Moshe Rafiah) is a mouthpiece for the parent company Ctrip. Devoid of vision and likes to spout empty platitudes. Quite clearly brought in to slash headcount at the company, close offices and cut costs. 

The company as a whole lacks any coherent vision for the future. Product leadership is weak - the evidence and data led approaches from when the founder Gareth and his appointed successor Bryan were CEO is gone and the usual 'features for the sake of features' mindset has set in. Features are shipped and then teams are reallocated without measuring RoI or the effectiveness of what was added. Long term I see the stagnation of the core product (cheap flight search) as the leadership is running scared from Google Flights and is desperately trying to stay relevant. 

Product management is overstretched and without focus. All low level product managers within the company were served redundancy notices, leading to the already distant and distracted senior product management to be further overstretched. 

The more competent offices in the company are being closed and the staff made redundant. The Budapest office contained the bulk of the mobile app experience and expertise and the Singapore office was staffed with hard working and competent engineers and product leadership. Instead the company has chosen to renew its focus on the lacklustre, disorganised and error prone teams in China.

Progression is nigh on impossible at the company. Expectations for promotion involve impact and reach that aren't possible given the extremely hierarchical and closed off Tribe/Squad structure that Skyscanner uses. Expect stagnation and stress when at every 6 monthly performance review meeting you're told to stop writing code and to focus on generating more confluence documents, setting up meetings to bloviate endlessly and deliver nothing of value to our travellers.

This review sounds extremely negative and you may well be asking ""why hasn't this person spoken to their manager"" - management at Skyscanner exists to maintain the status quo. If you want to change things for the better be prepared to be called out for your difficult attitude, then marginalised and ignored.

The teams in China work distressingly long hours. It's not unusual for them to be responding at 3 or 4pm UK time (close to midnight in Shenzhen). The management in the UK see this as a positive, despite the output of those teams being enabled by other squads in the company and the constant stream of incidents those teams generate.

The company has a progressive attitude towards WFH but refuses to contemplate remote working patterns. The initial WFH attitudes were set by the founder and original Scottish leadership. As the company has become more corporate, American and Chinese led these attitudes have ossified and progressive changes to working patterns are dismissed or outright refused.

Employees who deliver no value and who do little work are rarely put on performance improvement plans and dismissed. High performers aren't rewarded. It's a culture of ""keep your head down and get through the week"" that rewards mediocrity over all else."
170,Skyscanner,Used to be great,2020-07-14,3.0,Software Engineer,"Laid back culture on the lower levels, friendly people and good engineers. Working is flexible, and you get everything you need in and out of the office.
If you’d like a switch, plenty of teams to transfer to, even if you don’t have a lot of experience in the area - people are expected to learn fast, but are also rewarded for it. Pretty good pay as well!","Over the almost 4 years here and in different offices and roles, I have started to experience that politics is more and more important and visibility counts rather than the actual work done. Since everyone wants to lead things to progress, lots of people end up inventing little projects for themselves to lead, without much substance.
Over the past year or two especially, it seems that the company culture has transformed from friendly and personal to slightly cultish and bureaucratic (the chanting at the company get-together was the cherry on top).

I honestly believe that Skyscanner is a toxic environment, as many have reported here already. 

This is not a good environment, you (at any level) are expected to do as you are told, full stop.
It is not safe to express concern or (god forbid) try to report it.

But what I find more disturbing is the fact that they preach and claim the exact opposite.

Be prepared to be spoken over in meetings.
Be prepared that other people take credit for your work.
Be prepared to be cornered and set aside if you are not part of the cool kids club."

They say they are open and the staff opinion counts.
In my experience it's quite the opposite. 

Very few people have all the say, and you better not disagree with them, or you will be set aside, marginalised or even bullied.
My experience is an experience of zero tolerance towards different opinions, even in our technical field of expertise.
We are paid to make an intellectual contribution but in reality we are there only to execute orders.
This is very demoralising and humiliating.

This also explains why Skyscanner has not been able to innovate and has been doing the same thing for the last 20 years: they happily live in their echo chamber."
190,Skyscanner,Awesome company and brilliant culture!,2020-04-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Just had a quick read through some previous reviews and the negative ones really do baffle me. I'd hate for any potential new employee to be put off by these. While everyone has their own unique experiences, depending on variables such as line manager and team etc, some of the negativity is quite frankly, just nonsense.

If someone is unfortunate enough to feel that they are being bullied or are suffering from feeling a lack of inclusivity then there are several channels for employees to report this (Glassdoor probably shouldn't be the starting point), whether this be confidential or otherwise. The company is so protective of its unique culture, especially as the number of employees grows. 

Personally, I've never worked with such a diverse bunch of humans - it's brilliant! So many people from different countries, faiths, gender identities, sexualities (the list goes on).  

The company are inherently generous. They are always looking at new ways to make sure we are happy at work. Never settling for just the 'standard', they always try to go over and above. Whether that's something small like a fully stocked soda fridge and fruit bowl or amazing summer staff BBQ's or the lump sum they give us every year towards our own holiday. We're so lucky.

The way Skyscanner has handled the current COVID pandemic internally has really been quite outstanding. While our travellers and partners remain our priority, the Exec team have made every effort to ensure employees don't have undue pressure during what is a difficult time for everyone. On a personal level, it's helped me massively - knowing that there's breathing space. The consistent motto has been ""do your best"" and they know and trust that every single one of us will.","None, zilch, nada, nein, ninguno (there was a 5 word minimum requirement)."

193,Skyscanner,Nightmare for females in technical roles,2020-04-01,1.0,,"Lots of lip service about diversity and inclusion, I guess?","In my experience:
- Skyscanner does not proactively hire females into technical roles. 
- Skyscanner certainly doesn't work in a data-driven way to help females get promoted into senior data science or engineering roles.
- If you are a female in engineering or data science, don't expect to be able to contribute in technical leadership forums because they're reserved for Principal engineers and above - and of course you're unlikely to ever get to that level.
- Prepare to be spoken over in meetings, to have Principal engineers take credit for your work, and to get excited about new 'initiatives' to help females that make no actual difference then ultimately fizzle out.

There is a possibility for pushing your idea to production as an engineer if you are happy to take on the non-engineering related responsibilities regarding your feature. Benefits and Salaries are pretty decent. Never really had a lot of problems with it.

If you are an engineer that somewhat cares about the product but care mostly about your code, then you will be successful. 

Loved the postmortem and no-blame incident management techniques, it was a totally normal thing to present your team's fail (p1 issues) on a company wide meeting and to talk about the fixes, future improvements to avoid the failure again and the financial impact.

Transparent financial reporting for employees. You know how much the company makes.

The company is not afraid to make 90 degree changes if needed. And if you don't like change in your teams then you will have a bad time here. changes are a constant here.

The CEO is able to make hard decisions.","As the company grew, 4 years later I left I felt like the company was turning into a more bureaucratic place day-by-day and Engineers have less opportunity to get out of their comfort zones.  At the end I felt like working on the wrong things and making similar features to what we have already done and retired years ago for other reasons. Its like the new management hires did not read upon the history of the company and started coming up with the same ideas we tried years ago. 

At the end I felt that engineers around me lost the drive. I mean the new employees did not care about the product as much as I did at the beginning and I felt like it does not really matter to care.  I could not really have the same say as years ago as an engineer which was a massive set-back for me and I felt bad.

The rest of us who got on with our work without complaint (because there wasn't anything to complain about) could feel sidelined.  I personally felt there are over-communication to compensate for those in the organisation who felt there was too little.  It goes to show that you can't please everyone all of the time.

In the last couple of  years as staff numbers grew dramatically, the culture did change because there were many who joined who just didn't get the culture or weren't interested in being part of it.

Talked with some friends, and they went through exactly the same episode, some didn’t accept a lower position than they applied for (and went on to get a job at other company where got offered above their expectations), some did accept and end up frustrated (wondering why they negotiate so badly).

Again, different to everywhere else I've worked, this company really lives and breathes it's values.  At first, this can come across as almost cult like but you come to realise that everyone is genuinely committed to doing right by their customers and that's not a bad thing.

Nice offices in nice places you get to visit. 

All the clichéd tech company perks. 

On a day-to-day basis, it's a very pleasant place to go to work.","The previously excellent company leadership has been replaced by a team of puppets effectively. The new CEO pulls the strings and they do as they are told. The previous company culture was largely thanks to the previous COO. He was never replaced and there has been a noticeable void in leadership ever since. As a result, the company culture has been in freefall since the end of 2016. 

That isn't helped by an HR function with no evident desire to do anything about the deep issues which exist. To be fair, HR is really good at supporting you and your lifestyle but not the problems in your working life. Toxic behaviour by senior people goes unreported, because people don't feel safe enough doing so.  

The design team leadership is comically bad. They are more concerned with impressing company leadership than trying to support and protect the team.  Leaders in the Design Team steal the work of the designers doing the actual work then claim it as their own in front of company leadership.

The Design Leadership is a boy's club (this is the term designers use internally to describe it), some of the treatment of my female colleagues has been appalling. But as I said, there is no security to report such things. 

Otherwise your chances of progression as a designer lie in how nice your slidedecks look when you present them internally.  Designers have learned this and there is more concern about presenting nice-looking work to colleagues than making any useful changes to the product.

The Design Team behaves like the end user is the CEO rather than the millions of people who actually use Skyscanner.

Management hasn't got a clue how to run the business
People resign on a daily basis
Only 4 black people work in the London office and a similar number in the Edinburgh head office - lack of diversity and management doesn't seem to want to do anything to rectify this lack of diversity
You are expected to accept any feedback given to you regardless of if it is true or not.  If you try to explain/defend or give any feedback you will immediately be fired.  I was told nothing that I had to say was important.
As a new starter, you are expected to know how their system works on day one and if you make a mistake on day one that will follow you in month 3 even if you are no longer making that one simple mistake that you made on day one of starting with the company
Bullying environment 
Management sit around in meetings all day wondering why so many staff are handing in their notice even though these leavers feedback the exact same things I am describing here to them in their so-called ambushed leavers exit interview and on Glassdoor, they still don't accept these reasons and act oblivious to it
Worst company I have ever worked for in my 15 years of working in this field
The engineering management team don't have a clue about what they are doing.
The manager I supported doesn't seem to know how to open a word document when I was asked to create an end of the day task list in order to micromanage me even though they preach that they are an open inclusive culture where you manage your workload with no micromanagement. He's afraid of making any decisions, hides behind his management team to make key decisions for him
If you do join this company be sure to keep your mouth shut and not give any feedback even if they encourage you to do so and say they are open to feedback - this is a trap
The company’s future is questionable when compared to their other top competitors who treat staff with respect and value.  At Skyscanner, they have a high turnover with staff and are constantly recruiting because people are constantly leaving

Genuine team contribution is not valued - if you don't sell yourself, hard - you won't make it.

As challengers they are utterly useless as they have no clue on the substance they're challenging on. They often lack basic understanding of individual markets (eg, they only know Spain from their beach holidays but consider themselves well placed to challenge the native's growth strategy) and they haven't used Google Analytics / SQL / Tableau or other tools anytime recently. As disrupters they're out to destroy individuals and their support networks to manifest their power. 360 degree feedback or multi-rater feedback is supposedly in place to facilitate fair performance assessments from a number of colleagues.

Nice Colleagues
Flexible working","Ever since the Ctrip acquisition and the new CEO, the company feels like an episode straight from Silicon Valley circa when Jack Barker takes over Pied Piper and makes them pivot to build ""boxes"".  They are filling leadership spots with ex-Microsoft, Amazon, and Netflix Execs with no travel or e-commerce experience--  quintessential salesmen without product vision.

Other Cons include:
* Frequent Restructuring- your project will drop in 6 months and they will tell you that they are being ""Agile"" as an excuse
* Lack of Diversity in Race and Gender: I've never seen any Black or Latinx women, let alone any white women in product or engineering.
* Super bureaucratic, requiring heavy documentation for EVERYTHING: The company puts so much effort into creating confluence documentation no one will ever read or care about. For a company that is agile, it takes 3 months to create a business-case like brief and a bureaucratic process to get everyone's approval. By the time you start working on it for a month-- your project gets nixed anyways under the guise of ""Goal-Setting"".
* Too much consensus decision-making: I'm not sure why they keep promoting this tribe/squad structuring when tribe leads refuse to lead and do their job. I believe it's b/c tribe leads don't want to be accountable for anything and make ppl vote and debate for the most petty things. 
* Very political and hierarchical: It's impossible to get promoted here. Engineers with 6-10 years of experience will get passed on for some inexperienced person who  sucks up to one or two ppl."

Frequent reorgs that don't solve problems and kill momentum. Increasing cynicism it'll just happen again in X months as a demotivating factor.

Teams swamped with services and tools (lots of which they inherit from others, so lack domain knowledge of), leading to tech debt and poor quality data.

Top-down decision making both in terms of what is worked on and - increasingly - how it is worked on e.g. restrictive production standards.

- Hotel budget is fairly poor - same budget globally which means there's a high chance you'll stay in a 2* hotel in a city with a high cost of living. My last hotel stay was in a red light district. 
- Legacy Skyscanner folk on the whole are fairly unimpressive. A problem of moving up the ranks because they've been there for years and years.

Coming from a large organisation where the employee brand did not resinate with life on the inside I  had been burnt!

All of our values are true- we are direct, there are zero politics, everyone is great at what they do and yet there are no ego's and no arrogance. So refreshing - I love what I do here, I love the people I work with and I love the challenge as a business we face. I would recommend working at Skyscanner to family and friends",Skyscanner is quite an ambiguous business - if you are not comfortable with an element of change  and an element of flexibility with business direction then my advice would be to think through how you can learn this and how you can develop this skill more. I was comfortable with the challenge ahead and excited about managing the transformation- to me as long as I felt like we were moving forward I understood that as a business we move quickly and change direction quickly. This is not so much of a negativity point as everyone can learn how to coupe with change better but it is just something to think through. Its never felt too overwhelming as I recognised that these are just some of the challenges when growing teams from scratch.

But not a big issue for me.
300,Skyscanner,Senior Software Engineer,2018-10-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Lots of learning opportunities as it's a highly dynamic place to work in. In my experience you just don't find yourself doing the same thing for multiple years as you can either step up or find out that the company is reorganizing itself due to e.g. shifts in strategy. For me this is a pro at the end of the day.

Being able to use cutting edge tech. Awesome dev enablement teams cranking out awesome and forward-looking internal tools for CI + CD, monitoring, alterting etc. I think the company is pretty mature in terms of thinking about what good engineering looks like. Putting something out to production for a feature your team owns is literally a matter of minutes which is a stark contrast from what I've seen at other companies so far.","Reorgs are fairly frequent and sometimes it's hard to let go of the things you were working on. Such situations also cause quite some overhead for the teams as ownership of services / features need to be transferred which can be a tough process at times. Still, probably better than just being overly rigid in structure.

The company is in the process of learning how to operate well as a business as headcount and overall size scales.  At times change management and communication feel suboptimal and messy.  I'm positive that it'll work out but it definitely needs more work."

People are generally friendly and well meaning
Culture is good and open
Modern equipment
Generally good policies on corporate travel/expenses etc
Decent pay and perks
Good work-life balance for engineers and flexible hours/WFH.","Terrible management - my line manager is overbearing, micro-manages and incredibly corporate. 
Too much talk and not enough doing.
Decisions are opaque and consensus has to be reached by too many teams to get anything done.
Goals changed every 6 months, and work wasn't maintained so be prepared to throw everything in the bin you've worked towards.
Teams don't practice what they preach - lots of talk about engineering best practices, but in reality all codebases are a total mess and product just want stuff shipped. Seeing as you'll throw everything away every six months it just leads to more and more crap in production.
Meetings - you'll spend most of your work week in unnecessary meetings, even if you're just a standard developer. 
Difficult to be promoted - the criteria are clear for promotion, but unrealistic to attain for most developers. All about working cross-tribe and cross-squad, which most developers won't get the opportunity to do so."
305,Skyscanner,"Nice company, good tech stack but somewhat stifling",2018-06-22,3.0,Software Engineer,"Skyscanner has (in my opinion) a noble ambition: providing travellers with the best prices wherever they want to go and generally being a champion for consumers in this sector. If you are passionate about travel this is a great company to work for.

They also work hard write software in the best way - so it's a great place to work with up to date technologies (GRPC, React Native, Docker, Kubernetes) and use some impressive internal tools to get the job done.

The company does really seem to try to look after their employees with flexible hours, working from home, nice offices and positive attitude to training. That translates to an overall nice atmosphere - probably the most polite company I've ever worked for!","The company structure is very hierarchical with  a lot of management layers. It always felt like getting any decision made require consensus with a huge number of people - so as an engineer I felt that I struggled to make an impact outside the small bit of code I was working on.

It's a very distributed company relative to it's size (engineering teams presently in Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, Barcelona, Sofia, Budapest, Singapore and China) so can feel a bit remote at times."

You are encouraged to be the best you can be with regular work in progress sessions and peer feedback. This has helped me in some cases to completely change my thinking and attitude and has helped me immensely. Flexible working environment is excellent. Culture and values are wholesome and genuinely believed, encouraged and form part of our working day. We truly do believe in helping every single traveller and putting them first!","Can be difficult to be promoted as a sole contributor if you do not want to go down a people management route. However it's not impossible, our competencies allow for people to move forward even if they do not wish to people manage. 

Environment can change and pivot pretty fast, you need to be prepared for this and be adaptable to change.

+ Good salaries
+ Opportunities to travel
+ Reasonable autonomy: your goals come from above but you can decide how to tackle them
+ Plenty of money to spend on equipment, team outings, user research, etc","- Terrible line management: you’ll see your direct manager once a month if you’re lucky and it’ll be a status update rather than a meeting about your personal development. This is true for product but totally the opposite for engineers, who seem to have plenty of great well-trained line managers.
- Slow pace: it’s like wading through treacle trying to get anything done. There’s so many people you have to consult with/get buy in from and then the engineers in your team will spend a third of their time in meetings not related to the team’s work
- Zero commitment to diversity and inclusion: there’s a lot of talk but the gender ratio is still worse than Uber’s and nothing actually seems to get done 
- Product managers often placed in teams that don’t need PMs or where the work doesn’t match their skills. You never know what team you’ll be in before your first day at the company, and sometimes it’s totally unsuitable. Once a PM is assigned it’s slow and painful to get reassigned, and even then there’s no guarantee your new assignment will be any better."

- Good work-life balance, support for working remotely. 
- Really smart people so you can learn a lot day by day.
- Multiple offices in many location so you get to meet lots of different people from around the world.
- Possible to travel between offices for business reasons.

Generally good atmosphere, thanks to the full stack ownership one can get around many different technologies and great variety of problems (this can also overwhelm some).  The company puts great focus on customer experience and tries its best to deliver good service.","- Tons of ceremony for everything
- Micro-management - (The very opposite they advertise)
- Slow to adopt technological changes
- Chaos in coding culture (Gets better slowly)
- Lacking career development 

Company self-image is inaccurate in terms of engineering. Leadership tends to compare the company to Google / Facebook and we try to copy lots of things from them. But what works for multiple thousands doesn't work or isn't effective for couple of hundred. We sometimes invest in months to something not so promising on the other hand we almost never invest in code quality. Coding culture is not healthy (maybe getting a bit better) and all the smart people are dealing with so much ceremony day to day that it kills all productivity.

Hard work, overtime, great knowledge goes mostly without recognition so people gets less and less involved. Promotion is basically non-existent, after several iteration on competency framework it is still not clear what is expected. The best way to get promoted is to leave your day-to-day job and instead take on some random tasks and roles with questionable impact and grounds (also make sure you communicate this on many forum).

Product vision is usually communicated but the path that leads there is not. Most of the time it is not clear how big is the impact of the job you're working on. There is a high chance that a project will be cancelled that you've been working on for months."

- Good range of benefits","Overhyped by the job agent who assured me I won't have worked at a company before with a culture as good as Skyscanner. Wrong. 

It's like any other company yet with a poor engineering culture and management (in the London Office). It thinks it's an agile culture, but it's a long way off. Very enterprise-like in many respects...
- Very little autonomy
- Lots of upfront design and documentation, sign-off
- Isolated squads, people working individually (almost expected so)
- Micro-management, bureaucracy
- Code first, test later

If you want to learn how to become a good developer/engineer this isn't the company to do so. Products are long and progress slowly as do decisions around them. 

Career progression is slow and lacks visibility. Too much dependency on being liked by managers (who are a large part of the problem) rather than just being good at what you do. Too much chain of command/feedback as part of it. 

Poor hiring policy. Seem to value CV titles from large enterprise companies, which affects the culture hugely."

- Great mixture of people (50+ nationalities) who are smart / care a lot about the business","- Constant change/very fast paced which is unsettling if you're not used to it
- Need to focus on 1/2 things & do them well"

365,Skyscanner,Great Place but Struggling with Growing Pains,2017-01-03,4.0,Software Engineer,Good place to work with brilliant benefits. Free fruit and juice in the offices. Promotes a good work/life balance. Nice office to work in.,The process for progression is very vague and makes it really difficult to progress. The company is very Edinburgh centric.
366,Skyscanner,A Truly Exceptional Company,2016-12-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Skyscanner is a company with humble beginnings founded by the most humble and down to earth CEO you will ever meet. The company's transparency and trust in the hired staff is what truly makes it a special place to be in. Great benefits, fantastic people to work with and I always found room for growth. I learned a ton every day and I see a bright future ahead for the company.","There could often be too many meetings and being in the smaller offices, one could feel pressured to attend although it wasn't relevant. There could also be difficulty with communication between the different offices around the world."
367,Skyscanner,Strategic Manager,2016-11-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"the most advanced company in London, United Kingdom. Very good salary, bonuses. Nice food in the office",I am now happy them it was sold to CN company; I expect that it will be some optimizations in number of personnel and new managers. Not very fast in classic ads
368,Skyscanner,"Culture, People, and Travellers first.",2016-11-28,4.0,Lead Product Designer,"Skyscanner's culture is what it makes it such a unique place to work. We're not a start-up anymore, yet we've been able to keep maintain much that a start-up culture offers such as autonomy and ownership and the ability to say it as it is and be heard. Skyscanner really values its culture and people and I believe its the single most thing thats helped us grow to who we are today. Have an idea? Find the people and get on with it! No problem is someone else's problem.

Skyscanner is unique: it puts its travellers first and will often take a financial hit for the good of its users.","Change is constant. We are a large organisation but are incredibly nimble and able to pivot quickly, be it objectives or org structure. If you want a place where every day will be the same from the day you start until the day you retire this is not the place for you. However if you want to work for a company which has the ability to shape itself according the market, this is the place for you."
369,Skyscanner,Amazing company to work for.,2016-11-16,4.0,,"Flexibility to work from home, autonomy to make own decisions, better than average annual leave, amazing office space",Due to timezone differences meetings can often be held very late
370,Skyscanner,Great place to work,2016-11-10,5.0,Undisclosed,"Skyscanner is a great place to work, we're constantly challenged and challenging each other. the Culture I have experiences is open and honest.  We have a good trend of sharing thoughts, opinions, questions, failures and learning across the team.  We talk and learn from each other all the time, the team and out leaders understand how Lean, Agile, Lean Startup, Theory of Constraints and other approaches can have a massive impact on our effectiveness.","Change is a constant at Skyscanner, if you like certainty and continuity you may struggle here.  We don't just need to apply Lean Startup thinking to our products and services but also to the company itself, that means changing the way things work and the structure is maybe more common that in other companies.  But this keeps us focused on delivering value and reduces inertia and path dependence."

375,Skyscanner,"Humble management, people often matter more than product, industry at the doorstep of possible revolution",2016-10-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Despite using the latest in agile product methodologies and engineering, company feels decidedly different than VC fueled Silicon Valley startups. In a sense, it still recalls memories of the honest and respectful ideals of entrepreneurship. The level of caring and personal attention is not typical for an 800 people company.

The travel industry is at the brink of some great changes, Skyscanner has the unique combination of investing enough to become a tech company but with very strong travel roots, due to going after each partners in travel individually instead of buying or crawling for bulk data.

Absolutely fantastic CEO, who is already rich enough to resist the urge to micromanage, introvert enough to listen carefully to his people.","Persons often matter more than product, which sometimes prohibits moving fast and early enough to catch up with the market. Though being a market leader now, the company would need some very deliberate and radical advances in product strategy to warrant longevity.

Also, carrier development path with some areas are less than clear, some line managers have way too many direct reports."

2) Generally the compensation is not bad.
3) A very good place if you just wanna stay safe, as travelling is always the right business.
4) If you are good at talking, thats the right place to go","1) Too many inexperienced mid level managers, as Skyscanner has been growing for more than a decade, many people ONLY work for Skyscanner for their entire career till now, no outside experience, which lead to a very bias mis-impression that, they ""are"" all good, and will not listen to any tiny little negative feedback. 
2) No visible bar, when discussing about performance, the bar varies, not clear or visible bar given. 
3) 3 times major re-organization within 12 month, I did ask 3 times whats the expected outcome of re-org, the answer remains, ""there is no diff from your site"". Pretty much game of thrones.
4) The company is heading from a very transparent culture to a game of thrones culture with the 2 years I served. eg: laid off all the testers without much info given till the very day. 
5) C level encourage employee to challenge their manager's decisions, but end up firing."

Flexible approach in a friendly atmosphere","Too flexible, no real guidance from management as to what you are actually there to accomplish.
No real plan for going forward in your role.
Too easy to fall into a 'lazy' way of working as no pressure of feedback on what you are doing.
If you're that way inclined you could do the absolute minimal amount of work and no one would bat an eye lid
Impulsive and longer standing members of staff haven't quite grasped that it isn't a small company anymore and changes to process or system hhas a bigger effect than it did a couple of years ago
In my time there I met my manager once for 10 minutes"
382,Skyscanner,Great company to work for,2016-07-11,4.0,Software Engineer,"Working with really smart people and having the opportunity to learn new tech frequently.

389,Skyscanner,Fast pace environment with errant managers,2016-04-26,1.0,Product Owner,"+ 2 weeks of home-country working (not available to employees away-from-home based in the same work country)

+ toyota way and lean principles are now embedded in the culture (sometimes used as argument to test the obvious when one is against a proposal)

+ fail fast, learn fast is spreading (slowly)","- ""daytime is precious"" so you are better off leaving the office early and continue your increasing work overload at home (aircon is switched off after 8pm)

- ""collaborate to complete"" is superseded by ""collaborate to compete"". One has to fight against high-priority projects (often non-novelty features eg multicity to keep it up with competitors) 

- ""master, teach and learn"" may be offered, but not ubiquitously in all offices around the world. Be prepare to wake up at 5am or to stay up late to join online sessions. Learn and Master the work-life-balance and be prompt to Teach if you survive

- ""our mother uses skyscanner"" has not been democratized with a persistent product development that is UK-centric and a business development which is Euro-centric

- the hiring of new employees is a depressing process that seems unsolvable"

Casual work attire",I have nothing bad to say at all
391,Skyscanner,"Best Place I've Ever Worked: ownership, independence + great culture",2016-02-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Culture of ownership and independence; rather than having managers breathing down your neck, you are given high level direction, but it's up to you to choose the best way of getting there

- Interesting work; being in a high-growth area means always looking at new ways of doing things, and experimenting. Generally the attitude is: got a good idea? Go ahead and test it!

- Very multi-cultural and international; with > 50 different nationalities working here, it makes for a very stimulating environment if you're interested in the world at large

- Modern, flexible working practices; Skyscanner has realised that #hours worked at your desk does not = productivity. Instead they have implemented methods which allow a good deal of flexibility to your work life (for example: everyone has a laptop, everyone has Skype, every meeting booked has a skype link added to it) - which all fosters the philosophy that physical location doesn't matter (we have offices around the world). Just getting sh*t done is what counts. 

- Has maintained most of the 'start-up' culture despite its incredible growth; the company has gone from about 100 people and one office, to ~800 people and 10 offices, in the space of about 5 years. Yes - there have been some growing pains - but overall, the company has managed to maintain the feel of a lean and agile organisation.

- Great perks! Share incentives, the chance to work from other Skyscanner offices around the world, the chance to work from your home country (remember we have > 50 different nationalities) and the forward-thinking attitude to working life mean that people want to be here.

- Being part of something pretty unique - Skyscanner is one of the few UK 'Unicorns'

- Getting to work with a great bunch of smart, motivated people",- The rapid growth can mean frequent changes to the way things are done. This can be unsettling for some but it's certainly never boring!

I feel that I can always learn new tech & skills which I think is really important for a developer. Every service / product has a distinct, small & focused team with end-to-end responsibility. Because of this, most of the time you have a say on the direction things, you're rarely told what you should to from upper management.","At a company of this size, you need to deal with bureaucracy which sometimes can be daunting.

412,Skyscanner,Am continually turning down offers to work elsewhere automatically.,2014-10-07,5.0,Principal Engineer,"Mostly the Culture -- it's unlike any other place I've ever worked:

Daytime is Precious: flexible hours that are really flexible - the policy is ""as long as the work gets done and you attend your teams ceremonies"" - need a day off to fix your ceiling, no problem, work around it. Also don't waste time when you are together.

Your mother uses Skyscanner - everything we do is used by people who are probably less tech literal than us - that's really important and we mean it.

Collaborate to Complete - I've found that nearly everyone is approachable at Skyscanner. We work together and we play together.

Master, teach, Learn - you are expected to learn and to help others learn -- almost every week there are staff organised presentations or lightning talks about something cool that people want to share.

Add in the fact that we employ people from all over the world and there is a really interesting mix of people at Skyscanner - I work with a team of Spaniards, a Dutchman, a few Chinese colleagues - which is great.

Finally I feel like I am trusted to largely self govern myself - obviously there are management things but mostly I feel like if I want to do something because I feel that is the right thing to do - the chances are that, if I can argue for it, I get to do it.

My career has exploded at Skyscanner - I'm picking up skills continually - from a beginning as a developer working entirely in SQL I know build entire web scale platforms in C#, python, scala and use a bunch of NoSQL techs.

I get called by recruiters all of the time which is flattering and even though the jobs they are presenting to me are usually better paid, I can dismiss them out of hand.

I love working here.","Its a rapidly growing company so there are some awkward adjustments sometimes. Compensation is only so-so - I could get paid quite a bit more if I worked in a bank for instance - but then, I'd be working in a bank and it just isn't worth it.

Sometimes if feels we are a little top heavy - too many chiefs.

Also sometimes we seem to have a lack of focus -- too much work going on all at once."

Not only does Skyscanner focus on continued learning, but they encourage their associates to speak their minds and problem solve.
