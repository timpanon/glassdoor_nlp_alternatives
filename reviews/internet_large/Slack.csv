- Flexibility and work life balance are very well managed at Slack

1,Slack,"More of less good company, but starting to head downhill",2022-04-04,3.0,Customer Experience Agent,"Good managers, good product, some opportunity for advancement, good culture .... especially historically.","With the Salesforce acquisition, has become more and more process-based and less transparent. Starting to really lowball people with comp adjustments, few actual advancement opportunities. Kind of standard growing pains but really sad to see. Lots of tenured folks are either leaving or starting to talk about leaving given that there's better compensation and opportunities from newer companies looking to attract top talent."
2,Slack,Highly Recommend,2022-04-03,5.0,Customer Solutions Engineer,I have never been surrounded by such an inclusive culture focused on working and succeeding together. Everyone I speak with regardless of their title or tenure at the company speaks very positively of their experience also.,"I honestly have nothing to report. It is a process to get through the recruitment, however they do that to ensure the culture they have worked so hard to create remains protected. It is definitely worth the wait."

Employee experience has been terrible (tech issues, duplicated calendars & email accounts, compensation plan mistakes, etc). Lots of leaders have jumped ship resulting in a loss of institutional knowledge.
- Working in Slack all day every day is exhausting and feels very reactive. Constant fire-fighting and extremely difficult to 'switch off' after hours
- Salary bands and equity offerings decreased significantly post-acquisition making it difficult to attract & retail top talent.

The company culture is truly amazing, and I was able to quickly ramp up into my role in Sales. Everyone is very driven and hardworking, yet humble and kind. The company and the Slack platform really screams people-centric.","I have yet to find a true con of working at Slack. If anything, it can be challenging to prioritize tasks due to the multitude of opportunities here. Especially in joining forces with Salesforce."
25,Slack,Incredible organisation to work for!,2022-02-17,5.0,Customer Experience Agent,"A company that truly does care about employees and making customers work life (as well as employees) simpler, more pleasant, and more productive.

34,Slack,"Good, but not great",2022-01-31,3.0,Customer Experience Agent,"- Culture is everything here at Slack

- Team members are willing to help and are supportive

- Great compensation and benefits

- Work-life balance (but weekend shifts are required)

- Ability to collaborate with other teams","- Management can come across passive aggresive, often micro-manages (comes off as though there's no trust in your ability to get work done)

- Led to believe you belong in the first month, which quickly changes after you've completed onboarding. Bit of a let down. 

- Feedback delivered with no real direction or advice provided"
35,Slack,Slack is changing and it's TBD whether or not for the better,2022-01-28,3.0,Software Engineer,"I reviewed Slack before the Salesforce acquisition and it was a glowing 5 stars so I'll just repeat what has remained after being a newly minted Salesforce employee for 6 months.

- Work-life balance is still amazing
- Benefits are great
- Very impactful work depending on your project/team
- More diverse than most tech companies","The culture has very much shifted and many engineers like myself feel more like a cog in a machine than ever before since the Salesforce acquisition. 

I can respect this model works for some as it depends on where you are in your life but as someone who wanted growth and challenge, you really need to make sure you're on the right engineering team at Slack that is doing the visible work. 

Because I felt like my growth had stagnated and that the bureaucracy of working at a big company was getting to me, I decided it was time to leave after several years of being at Slack.

- very high turnover since the acquisition of Salesforce (mostly folks getting higher titles at startups)
- dealing with Salesforce culture and bureaucracy (worse at D&I)"
36,Slack,Amazing!,2022-01-27,5.0,Account Executive,Management and growth opportunities are great.,Get used to some of the changes with the salesforce acquisition
37,Slack,"Awesome product, very good atmosphere, weak career progression",2022-01-26,4.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Slack has a very good atmosphere throughout the whole company and the people are very supportive and helpful. You can always reach out to the management. The hierarchy is definitely flat. 
For a Sales Position, they definitely don't put too much pressure on you and put more emphasis on quality than quantity.","The one thing that really bothers me is the career progression. Slack has many talented young sales people that would be ready for more responsability and the next step. And although Slack is growing substantially, they prefer to hire externally. 
I am sure that this is a genereal problem in the Tech Industry, but it makes an awesome employer only a good employer."
38,Slack,A company that ACTUALLY cares!,2022-01-20,5.0,Customer Success,"The best part about Slack is that people ACTUALLY care about other people. Since day one I have felt included, welcomed, supported, encouraged, and best of all - appreciated for joining the team. 
Pros = transparency (even at the top), care, friendliness, work-life balance, benefits, meaningful work","Con: The acquisition with Salesforce has made some processes slightly more confusing or difficult, but I expect that it will be resolved over time."
39,Slack,Excellent recruiting experience,2022-01-18,5.0,Software Engineer,"Working with Slack recruiting was one of the most professional and enjoyable recruiting experiences I have had. My recruiter, Grace Lee, was personable, prompt, and knowledgeable about Slack.

Very very generous. Co-workers and managers are very smart, friendly, and easy to work with. Executive team are good people with sound, long-term priorities. Obviously the product is excellent, and it's awesome to work on something with such a worldwide impact. The company generally walks the walk in terms of supporting remote work and work/life balance.","Lots of legacy code. Huge learning curve with regard to the technology behind the product, even as a relatively senior engineer. I've been here for a few months and still feel like I know next to nothing. Some of the deployment processes are onerous and slow, though it could definitely been worse, and it makes sense for a product that so many people depend on."

The walk the walk and I swear it's not just kool-aid chatter.,Growing pains. Lack of clarity from marketing leadership is a huge pain point on every project. Bad management without the ability to move teams besides just leaving the company altogether.
91,Slack,Awesome place to work,2021-07-12,5.0,Account Executive,"Cool product, great culture, top-notch talent everywhere",Hard to find something to nitpick on this
92,Slack,It's not the company it used to be,2021-07-06,3.0,People Team,"- Great salary & benefits
- Beautiful offices
- They hire talented people
- Cool & likeable product","Between 2017 and mid 2020 I absolutely loved working for Slack. The work was enjoyable, the offices were great and the local teams are really good people.

The opportunities for growth were very limited; I was only ever promoted once and I had to really push for it. The reasons for not being promoted were completely out of my control (e.g. the company isn't growing fast enough). I worked above my pay grade and did managerial level work for no recognition or development opportunities.
Management, on the other hand, were promoted annually. Even to the point of the most recent promo cycle this month, many promotions in BizOps went to Managers who are now Sr Managers / Directors. Everyone 'beneath' this rarely gets a look in. 

I always commended Slack leadership for being very open and transparent. Due to the upcoming Salesforce acquisition, the company has become incredibly secretive. The employee acquisition FAQ stated that there will be *no* redundancies -- however, there have been countless people being pushed out, including several people on my own team. But Slack doesn't communicate this, it seems everyone is keeping quiet to avoid ruffling feathers. In the end, I left before I was pushed out, which was a real shame, as I loved my time at Slack for the most part. 

If you're in PDE or Sales, Slack will look after you. Everyone else is at risk."

From the application process, over onboarding through daily working business - you never feel like being alone (which is not too easy during COVID). Slack has a great culture, is very open to everyone and has great people. They pay fair salaries, provide great benefits and support your remote work. I really feel great and like to be at the right place.",i cannot say anything negative at the moment about Slack.

98,Slack,Work/Life balance with a product that works and users that love it,2021-06-21,5.0,Learning Specialist,"I've worked so many places where the product makes every position within the company feel like hell. Slack's product makes working there so easy and the culture and benefits around it make it even better. 

Work/life balance is the best I've ever had and I'm hoping this stays similar post acquisition.

- Fantastic people in the company. Values are great, though not always followed (see cons).","- Almost no growth perspectives for EMEA employees. Most the opportunities and decisions are US centric.
- Leadership doesn't live up to our people values with 2 redundancies during the pandemic while the company amassed all sorts of success.
- The benefits in the last 2 years have been cut by a lot. It feels like a totally different company than the one I joined.
- All employeesare asked to write glassdoor reviews while in onboarding and are reminded every now and then. The results may be skewed due to the ""first few weeks hype"""

124,Slack,Honestly the best interview and onboarding experience I've ever had,2021-04-23,5.0,EMEA Recruiter,"I'm with Slack a little over 4 weeks now. My hiring and onboarding experience was excellent. The interview stages were quick, comprehensive and allowed me to reflect back on the work I had done. The Hiring manager was transparent at each stage, was happy to answer all questions and kept me in the loop at all times. Each interview stage was robust and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. 

My onboarding was equally as comprehensive. We had two streams of learning. Self paced learning and ""bootcamp"" which was fun training. I was afforded the time to learn and gain institutional knowledge of the company before being expected to go out and start recruiting. I was given a ""buddy"" to show me the ropes and talk me through various procedures. I was able to shadow them while they did their work and was slowly but surely given more and more responsibility that I had the capacity to deal with. 

Both the hiring stage and onboarding stage were 5 stars and I can't think of anything I would change. I'm delighted to be working with Slack and look forward to my time here.",I have no cons at this time.

Commitment to inclusion is shallow. The nail that stands up is hammered down. Sr Leadership are insecure and do not tolerate challenge, strong vision, or actual proactive improvements. Work-life balance is rapidly decreasing. Leaders are trying to squeeze blood from stones. Product is rapidly becoming unreliable and customer good-will being burned. Slack's early success was via taking the time to do things properly, now there is not even time to do things half-assed.

They have a history of talking down on the team and taking away marketing projects because they think they would do a better job. As a result, it’s extremely hard for anyone on marketing to progress their career because they get such little visibility and respect.

The company also claims to support inclusivity but doesn’t actually do it. Most senior leaders are white, and in the past few months, many POC leaders left citing lack of support as an issue. They have been replaced by White people, significantly tipping the diversity scales. HR won’t address this and everyone is expected to act like nothing has changed."

I´m sure Slack differentiates by this very well executed process alone.

In addition, I really liked the different steps of the process and the format of the conversations they conduct to both get to know the candidates but to also to let them take a glimpse of the company culture and values.",I´ve not come across a single negative thing yet.

155,Slack,Recruiting members are dropping like flies,2021-02-24,2.0,Recruiting,"The level of talent and skill of the individual contributors on the recruiting team are some of the best in the industry. Leadership has also invested in elevating the talent through industry trainings with internal and external partners, which continues to uplift the already awesome talent on the team. 

Teammates genuinely care about each other and really empower each other to help one another through their work and projects together.

Slack is and will continue to be an amazing product and I only hope that more and more organizations adopt the way that Slack is used at Slack.","No accountability from leadership (Directors and above) on the decisions they made that impacted the ability of the team to deliver and have enough resources to perform. There was a ton of organizational change and thrash in the last one year, not to mention everything going on with the pandemic/social justice issues/the election/etc. and, while senior leadership made statements about how folks would be supported through all of that and to take the time they needed, it was all just empty platitudes. 

Many decisions were made by senior leadership that impacted how the team was able to perform and deliver on targets, and the workload only increased even more while the team had been under-resourced for a long time. There was an increase in recruiting pipelines, increased number of required trainings, and increased number of required projects. After all of that, there was barely any value or recognition represented in the very small compensation increases across the team (or none at all) compared to previous years, and no equity refreshers for anyone in this organization. There was a severe lack of visibility from senior leadership and the previous culture of empathy and empowerment is no longer felt. 

Many people on the team have shared feedback with leadership about creating shared accountability and trainings with hiring partners but it ended up no where. Hiring partners will continue to point fingers at recruiting for not delivering even if they are a big reason why targets are not met. Executive partners don't see the value in recruiting and that was made very apparent in many ways. 

Team morale has been down for a long time (more than a year) and nothing meaningful was done to address it - leadership would just dodge feedback and/or questions from the team or spin the narrative around team feedback and morale. So disappointing because this was not the culture of the team for a long time and things had really changed in recent years. 

There's also no growth opportunities beyond a certain level. The outlined career paths for each level on recruiting changed drastically in 2020 and negatively impacted many people, leaving them with no opportunities to grow into higher level roles. Many changes were made to how each level was outlined and what was expected for each level, with a severe lack of clarity or visibility into those decisions. 

Now is not a good time to join the recruiting team at Slack. They're losing a ton of tenured and very skilled recruiting members on a weekly basis and they're just trying to fill holes and put bandaids on very big open wounds."

- As a result, the company's culture is a strange mix of entitlement, self-aggrandizement, with some deep-seeded insecurity
- From the C level on down, the company says the right things -- from strategy to cultural engineering -- it is about ""vision"", ""diversity"" and so on
- When it comes down to practice, such as hiring, review or planning, the decisions are often arbitrary, and clownishly contradicting
- Yet the enforcement of those decisions is nothing short of authoritarian. PeopleOps operates like a secret police force: some lunch time bantering about the company's direction would be reported, recorded, then came back to haunt you during reviews"

Truly. I pinch myself every day with how lucky & blessed I am to work for a company like Slack. Stewart is such an amazing servant leader. I respect him & his dedication to the wellbeing of his employees & the health of this company. I really enjoy being apart of the Sales & CS team. They are very supportive & encourage opportunities to lead within the team & through different company initiatives & programs. There are vast opportunities to explore different & parallel career paths within the company. The D&I program is also one of the best I've been apart of. I am inspired every day by my fellow colleagues.,"Slack operates within a ""start-up"" atmosphere at times and there are growing pains that are very understandable. There are opportunities now that management is taking to improve their D&I hiring & promoting initiatives from folks entering Slack as an intern all the way to C-level executives. I am happy to report that due to Slack's open & collaborative culture, I admire their honesty with any of the growing pains that come along & Slack's invested interest to constantly improve, grow & evolve."
199,Slack,"A group of brilliant, warm and empathetic humans 🚀",2020-10-19,5.0,Manager – Technical Architect,"Culture encourages people to naturally be themselves, it stopped being classified as work for me a long time ago and more of a place my brain goes to think about people collaborate.
Work life balance is not just talked about but demonstrated here. Work hard and go home was painted on the wall of my office and it's respected and adhered to. I had a life event and my manager simply said, ""go and do what you need to do, your family comes first"".","It is a big responsibility to handle the collaboration of the size of customers we have, it is not necessary a negative but something to remember from time to time."

201,Slack,Incredible team and company,2020-10-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The way that Slack has handled 2020 is incredible, and gives a great idea of what to expect when on this team.

We moved to WFH optional back in early March, before many companies had done so. We were given a stipend for at home office needs. The timing of this meant that we were ahead of other companies, and when ordering a desk and monitor, etc..they were all still in stock. Slack took on a day a month to all take the day off. They introduced a new type of Time Away that didn't use up sick time, but allowed us to miss work if needed for impact caused by all the uncertain circumstances. 

I'm able to work remotely with an incredible team that I still stay really connected with. I've felt treated very human during these difficult times, and empowered to treat those around me and that I manage with that same care.","It's a lot, things don't ever shut down or quiet fully. It likely depends a lot on the dept you work for what cons come up. I would say that there is not a lot of interaction with others outside of my department. Now that we aren't in an office, my circle is pretty small."
202,Slack,Inspired by Slack,2020-10-19,5.0,Senior Recruiter,"Wonderful, smart, and humble co-workers; Lots of improvements to make as we scale; Inspirational company that offers above and beyond benefits and culture to prioritize family, mental health, and great work.",Odd dynamic between recruiting and other parts of the business. Definitely need to optimize to improve the effectiveness of recruiting. Interesting groups of people with various perspectives depending on tenure at Slack.
203,Slack,People First Mentality,2020-10-19,5.0,Senior Manager,I interviewed during Covid and was concerned about switching organizations during a tough time. The people during the interview process came off sincere and shared the value of people first. I have months in and this is very true.,"Very steep learning curve. If you have not worked in Slack full time, it can be very overwhelming. It is a very different way of working."
204,Slack,We're building the future of work,2020-10-15,5.0,Program Manager,"When you work at Slack, you're literally building the future. From the work we're doing to continually improve Slack's software to the way we're leading the industry in providing a supportive work environment for our employees, I've been continually impressed by our culture, our customer focus, and the way we are focused on achieving our mission.

From the way that leadership acted quickly to pivot to remote working during the early days of Covid to the thoughtful benefits rolled out to improve home offices and express solidarity with working parents, Slack takes care of its people!","We're building the future of work. It's HARD. To excel at Slack you'll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, be willing to experiment (and fail every once in a while!), and have an attitude to try, try again."
205,Slack,"Inclusive, progressive and intellectually challenging place to work and grow",2020-10-15,5.0,Senior Sales Operations Analyst,"I was hired at Slack as a full-time, permanently remote worker, so my onboarding experience has been completely ""virtual"". Slack put a lot of effort in ensuring my remote onboarding was as seamless as possible (it was), and that I had multiple avenues to seek support if needed. The heads of my department made a concerted effort to make me feel welcome and set me up for success. 

In my short time here, I've seen the immense amount of work and care Slack employee's put into their jobs. It's motivating and has assured me that I picked the right company when switching jobs. The culture is such that - while working hard and working efficiently - is encouraged, so is prioritizing your health and sanity. Slack gives employees a Friday off every month since the pandemic hit to recharge. I'm very excited to be a part of this company and contribute to its success.

The culture is very open - I especially appreciated the focus on giving and receiving constant feedback (up and down the ladder), without fear of reprisal. Everyone wants to do their best work and help Slack be best in class because of how great the culture is here.","Being relatively new, it's a bit hard to ascertain what cons exist company-wide, but perhaps a better (or required) course for new hires that dives into the best ways to use Slack as a communication tool (it's a bit of an adjustment if you're completely new to the tool and coming off of a heavily email-dependent company in a prior job)."
206,Slack,I've been here for 3 years and still loving every minute of it,2020-10-15,5.0,Assistant Customer Experience Manager,"- Opportunity to move around the company if you put in the work.

Due to covid, working from the office is not a possibility at the moment. Miss the team lunches, and events :("
209,Slack,Best People I've Ever Worked With,2020-10-15,5.0,Manager,"-The strongest sense of team and collaboration I've experienced anywhere I've worked. Slack culture is built on helping others and it makes the work easier and more enjoyable.
-The company is growing so quickly there are always new problems to solve, new opportunities to take, new ways to stretch yourself and learn new things.
-Slack has a customer-centric culture and that is a wonderful thing, especially for those of us on the Customer Experience team. We are seen as a value-add, not a cost center.","-The strong culture of collaboration can make it hard to unplug. There is always more to do and more colleagues you could help.

We truly are customer-centric, and decisions are made to support our customers and our teams.",You have to be comfortable with ambiguity and change. If you aren't then at least be open to learning.
216,Slack,Best place I've worked at,2020-10-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The culture at Slack is very inclusive. I've had imposter syndrome everywhere else I've worked. This is the first place that gives me a sense of belonging

218,Slack,Poor leadership holding back decent product,2020-10-14,1.0,Engineering Manager,"Overall, Slack has a good set of co-workers within Engineering. The product is decent, and contributes to helping people get work done as opposed to just making money off of ads.","There is no company direction. The product is stagnant, and the focus is primarily on getting more users as opposed to making a better product. No one, either in engineering or product management, can make a long term roadmap. We move from the crisis of today to the crisis of tomorrow. We constantly spread ourselves too thin."
219,Slack,Unquestionably the the best job I've ever had,2020-10-14,5.0,Customer Experience Manager,"This company cares so deeply about their people, and the way they've navigated COVID-19 and the shift to WFH is a shining example of that.

222,Slack,Best Company I've Ever Worked For,2020-10-13,5.0,Engineering Manager,"Overall, Slack is a wonderful place to work, to be an engineer, or to be an engineering manager. I've been lucky enough to be both an IC and an EM at Slack, and over the past two years I've worked with incredible colleagues. We're shipping a well loved product that's fun to use, and we're able to ship it without working crazy hours. Work life balance is great, and so are benefits. During the pandemic they've been giving everyone in the company 1 extra day off a month and it's just been wonderful.","If you don't have a manager invested in helping you grow your career, it's going to be a challenge to do it. The engineering promotion process is very manager driven, including packets written by the manager. If you don't have the proper support, it's tough to get promotions or switch from IC to EM. If you do, it's a great place to grow your career.

On a day to day basis, there are still a number of things that cause engineers on my team pain in the codebase. Flaky tests are probably culprit number one. Code health has improved a lot in the past year, but there's still a ways to go."

All teams across all departments work well together, and are oriented towards the same goals. The credit for this goes to clear and thoughtful communication from leadership, and a complete lack of dysfunction or toxicity (as far as I can tell, anyway).

Pre-shutdown, we had fantastic office culture and perks, but after going fully remote, the company figured out how to adjust and retain that culture, which is remarkable.

The work we're doing feels valuable and meaningful.",I don't have any cons. I love working here.

- The Slack platform is used to allow anyone to communicate with and express opinions to our most senior leaders - transparency

- Comp is great (for me and my peers anyway)
- Very limited drama and ""team politics"". People just want to see the problems solved as a team.","- There's an adage that ""the easiest way to get Staff/Senior Staff is to get hired into it"" - Promotions are very difficult to come by, and getting harder with time

I appreciate that our execs aren't afraid to make unconventional decisions and think about things differently to achieve our goals.","We are still in the middle stage between being a startup and a large public company.

252,Slack,Truly a once-in-a-lifetime kind of company to work for,2020-10-13,5.0,Senior Customer Experience Agent,"Hard work, humility, integrity, kindness, respect, and transparency are so effectively and holistically enforced from the top down - working here makes you want to be the very best version of yourself (both professionally, and personally) that you can be. I have never felt so fulfilled by the work that I do! 

This is also a company that truly cares about its employees. You will never feel like just a cog in the wheel, which is really rare for large companies.","Things at Slack move FAST, so it can be easy to fall behind if you're not actively making it part of your daily workflow to keep up."
253,Slack,"Performance First, People Always",2020-10-13,5.0,Applications Engineer,"Slack accommodates personal, family, physical and mental health needs during the COVID pandemic through emergency time off, mental health programs and work schedule flexibility. Through this time where offices are closed and everyone is remote, team leads also make extra effort to keep their organizations connected socially, whether it is through Halloween luncheons or weekly banter message threads to find out how everyone is doing.

Performance is measured based on Objective-Key Results which are thoroughly fleshed out quarterly or semi-annually through manager feedback and support, providing employees clarity and concise feedback needed to do their jobs well and advance their careers.

Career development options are also top notch, with a generous allowance for employees to embark on professional development courses and opportunities to bungie into other departments temporarily to allow us to discover their passions.","Too much transparency when it comes to executive ask-me-anythings. Such a culture may distract employees from their primary roles and overall company goals/objectives. This provides room for dissent and surface-level policy criticisms that do not fall in line with the overall company's direction.

On the other hand there is a relative lack of transparency in the remote work application process compared to how industry peers have made available information on the revised pay scales per remote location. Such information is furnished only when an intent is indicated through a remote work application, and for the specific city an employee intends to move. Paybands are set based on overall state (except the Bay Area), so for example the payband for Bakersfield CA or Redding CA is the same as for Los Angeles. However overall Slack is bias-to-yes for most remote work applications, and provides said information on a timely basis.

More funds could be disbursed to support compulsory and voluntary work from home arrangements and setups given the COVID pandemic is set to last a long time. The current amount of $1000 could be revised upwards to account for more permanent ergonomic arrangements and office-quality equipment. Nonetheless $1000 is a significant amount that indicates the company's support for its remote working employees to have a good home office setup."
254,Slack,Best career decision I have made,2020-10-13,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Leadership, work-life balance, culture, community","Everything you would expect working for a hyper-growth, recently-public company. Lots changing at all times both internally and externally but I have total trust in our team to bring us through any/ everything, which says a lot."
255,Slack,Considerate corporate culture with good work-life balance,2020-10-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Slack is the most considerate place I've ever worked. That come through both in small ways (colleagues are really thoughtful about each other's time, people are welcoming) and big ones (company-wide, there's an expectation that management will preserve and model good work-life balance).
- People care about making something that's helpful and pleasant to use, as well as successful. It's such a great outlook that makes it fun to be part of building Slack.
- Benefits and comp are competitive with similar companies.
- Slack is a big enough company that there's a lot going on, but not so big that it's hard to feel at home or see where your work fits into the bigger picture.","- The downside of Slack being so considerate is that sometimes the company culture isn't direct enough: It can be tough to know who owns a decision, and often people are so gentle with their feedback that it's not actually useful.
- Prioritization isn't as good here as at other tech companies I've worked at. We often have more ""priorities"" than the teams we have can feasibly work on.
- Leadership isn't as transparent as they seem to think they are (and, to their credit, as I think they genuinely want to be). Internal comms are not a strong suit."
256,Slack,Great Culture with growing pains+competion,2020-10-13,4.0,Staff Engineer,"- Great Work Life Balance. This company walks the talk and it comes right from the top.
- Great teamwork and collaboration
- Ability to work on an enterprise product that isn't boring and that you can easily explain to friends and family
- Good benefits and compensation(almost on par with Facebook & Google)","- Not all teams are equal. Some teams are doing top notch front-facing work while others are just maintaining/adding incremental features. But you at least have the flexibility to change teams every 6 months.
- Management is a little reluctant to make more bolder/wide bets and likes sticking to safe plays. A little out of the box thinking could go a long way especially given the competition.
- Microsoft Teams continues to be the biggest threat to the future but the company is still winning on it's own with recent big deals with Amazon, Verizon, etc
- Obviously the company is still trying to get in the good books of Wall Street with the stock not really benefiting from the pandemic uncertainty unlike it's peers like Zoom, DocuSign, etc in spite of having in line revenues."
257,Slack,Great People and Supportive Organization,2020-10-13,5.0,Biz Analyst,Slack has shifted to remote work well and has really supported its employees (financially and emotionally) during these trying times. The high caliber and character of everyone you work with is apparent in almost all interactions.,Org structures create duplicative work and make roles and responsibilities unclear and create more difficult handoffs across projects.

259,Slack,Great Place to Work,2020-10-13,5.0,Software Engineer,"People! The team at Slack is amazing to work with! People are not only extremely smart and competent bu are also very welcoming and empathetic to one another.

Fun product to develop! The product has a huge impact on people's working life and it is cool to develop. Every idea counts, even if you are a junior developer!

Great work/life balance! Everyone is very aware of each other time and are concerned about people having time relax and take care of themselves. Work hours are very flexible.","Most employees are in the US, so sometimes, in the all hands and town halls the information shared applies more the them than to the rest of the company, which can cause a bit of confusion."
260,Slack,Highly Rated Employer!,2020-10-13,5.0,Operations Specialist,"Very generous compensation and benefits. Staff are valued and trusted, our wellbeing is always a top priority. This means flexible working hours, time off when needed, access to resources and benefits to take care of physical and mental health, lots of internal opportunities for further development and learning.",I'm trying to be super critical but honestly for me I couldn't ask for any more. We are constantly in a state of hyper-growth which means it can be fast paced and pretty demanding work. If we did not have such investment in our wellbeing it could be easy to burn out. It's important to disconnect and thankfully we are encouraged to do so.

262,Slack,The best company I've worked for in my career... by far.,2020-10-13,5.0,Account Executive,"There's so much that I can write about how much I've enjoyed my time at Slack, but if I had to sum it up, it comes down to the power of the platform that we sell, and the brilliance of the people that I get to work with on a day-to-day basis.

Culturally, you can't beat the employee experience. Our office is so close, regardless of the department you work in.

From a career perspective, there's tons of opportunity. In my experience, our leadership team has always prioritized career growth, and I couldn't be more appreciative.",I really can't think of any. I only have the most incredible things to say.
263,Slack,"Extremely hardworking, creative, kind group of people",2020-10-13,5.0,Anonymous,"I feel like a lot of people on the outside have this idea of what Slack is like internally and they’re generally pretty spot on. It’s a group full of creative, smart, inclusive people trying to make the world a better place. I feel genuinely supported by Stewart and our executive team down to manager level and my teammates. Slack has handled remote work incredibly and has bent over backwards to make sure their employees are okay. I feel lucky to work at a place like this and am so excited about the future of work with Slack.","Like any company, Slack has disconnected systems within sales and marketing which makes projects difficult to run end to end. But we now have dedicated resources that are helping bridge the gap."
264,Slack,Friendly company with,2020-10-13,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"I joined Slack after COVID-19 quarantine had already started, so my entire interview process, onboarding, and beyond has taken place remotely. While every company faces challenges due to this situation, I think Slack has handled it exceptionally well. I have felt very supported by the company and my peers in getting set up remotely, and I'm impressed by how quickly the entire company has adapted to working from home and continues to iterate on ways to make this work even better. As someone who used to have a long commute to the office every day, I appreciate that Slack is now allowing employees to work fully remotely in the future.

In terms of the work, I feel that I've quickly ramped up on my team's work and have started making impactful contributions soon after joining. It feels like there's a lot of opportunity to take on responsibility and make meaningful contributions, while also being supported in prioritizing your own personal life and health.","I've struggled a lot with legacy code and learning PHP/Hack, which I didn't know prior to joining and have found difficult to work with. This can be frustrating for engineers who are used to working in more common languages which have more available resources online. The codebase also has some poorly documented / poorly tested areas which are difficult to understand and make changes to (these is mostly legacy code, as standards seem to have increased over time)."

•Team selling approach enables reps to do their best work, and provide the best customer experience. Execs get involved in deal cycles to uplevel conversations and enable reps to multi-thread into key accounts
• They have been incredibly thoughtful and curious about how employees are doing, well before the pandemic but definitely during covid. 
• Expansive benefits package, including premium medical/dental/vision, parent, fertility, etc.
• Great sales culture: no sharkiness, managers work to ensure equity in sales territories. Encouraging of onsite customer visits and travel (in normal times). Fantastic leadership from top companies (Salesforce, Dropbox, 
• Commitment to diversity & inclusion
• Open to feedback and iterate on the existing processes regularly to ensure employees can do their best work
• Promotion opportunities for those who work hard, put in the work
• Amazing Global Sales Offsite annually, led by Bob Frati","• Slack was definitely a butts-in-seats culture, but I think as we think to return to work strategy will offer more flexibility to work remote a few times a week
• Needs a more aggressive acquisition or product development strategy so reps can sell additional skus to install base
• BDR/SDR program is newer, Enterprise/Large Enterprise Reps are definitely expected to prospect their own opportunities.
• Challenging onboarding experience. Slack is an amazing tool, and you certainly can search and find **if you know what to look for.** There is a sales & customer success dedicated onboarding sessions but they really should give more practical , hands-on sessions so reps are better prepared to hit the ground running
• No President's/Chairman's Club for top performers"

Couldn't be more proud to have spent the last 4+ years working for this organization.","It's tech. We move fast and we don't always have the answers.

• Pre-covid, incredible facilities and ample opportunity for socialization. 
• Not an overtime culture. It is abnormal to stay late working at the office.","• Very heavy on the warm fuzzies. In the balancing act of ""support your people"" and ""run a business,"" we can tend to err too far on the ""support your people"" side that it can put a wrench in operations."

Nothing that's insurmountable though and if you have an inclination for working through problems and assuming the best in others (which is quite easy to do here given the kind and thoughtful folks around you), then it's just part of the reality of working at a high growth SaaS company."

The energy is positive and inclusive.

If you are not keen to be part of organizing yourself and teams into a way that scales up, and instead you want things to be already well established (read: orderly, one tidy package) even before you arrive, then it might not be the place for you.

- With the pandemic, Slack has shown that we truly support our employees, not just with words, but with actions.
- Slack is seen as a model for the future of remote working
- Other companies look to Slack for our partnership with under served communities
- I love that we are partnering with organizations like Last Mile, Next Chapter, Raheem. We have strong ERG programs and DEB bleeds through most people and business conversations

I’ve never worked at a company where senior leadership is so willing to help. Work life balance is very important to the company and I feel very fulfilled selling for slack.",Competition is heating up which isn’t necessarily a con - it’s justifying our market.

There are so many resources to help you get your work done - e.g. multiple #help channels to get your questions answered by the right team, an extremely generous WFH budget to aid in the switch to remote working, regular check-ins with managers and team mates, great self-learning budget etc.

The health and wellbeing of each employee is also really important to Slack, which is why resources such as 8 days of Emergency Time Off (in addition to Paid Time Off and Volunteer Time Off) and the health and wellbeing budget are so welcomed.",Literally none - this is the best place I have ever worked!

Slack the product is an amazing product! While I used Slack at my previous employer, it wasn't near to the extent I'm now getting to use it. It's a product that truly makes work life simpler, while also adding in fun with all the emoji uses!

Slack benefits are phenomenal! They have 3 health options in CA and that are 100% paid for by Slack for the employee AND the employee's dependents. This is a HUGE annual savings. They offer 20 paid vacation days, 10 paid sick days, 2 paid volunteer days, paid Company Shut Down days between Christmas and New Years and paid Holidays. They offer a cell phone and wellness stipend which are automatically added into your paychecks. Plus up to $1000 reimbursement to set up a home office and up to $2000 reimbursement for professional growth!

Slack's pay is generous! They offer generous base salaries, annual bonuses and stock! A portion of your stock starts vesting at 12 months!

Career opportunities also seem to be abundant at Slack.

While Slack has over 2300+ remote employees (currently due to COVID), they have really mastered the ""remote"" workforce culture by having employees feel engaged without micro-management.

Slack has a very unique blend of the following components which make it (in my opinion) such a great place to work:

1) Thoughtful and humble internal culture
2) Incredible leadership that puts the wellbeing of the employees first
3) Very intelligent, talented people all throughout the company
4) Slack's platform is driving huge transformation in the market, not to mention fun to use for all that we do","Working in a hyper growth environment can be challenging as certain processes may not be mature (or even in place for that matter). One can also find themselves wearing many hats, which can be challenging if one does not brutally prioritize and manage their time and personal well being"
325,Slack,"Love the culture and the people, growing pains evident",2020-08-25,5.0,Senior Frontend Engineer,"People genuinely care, are kind, hard-working, incredibly smart. We use our product in a unique way. Stewart and the exec team provide great leadership, especially through this trying time of a global pandemic. The company takes care of their employees, allowing for unlimited emergency time off and other flexibility. Benefits in general are excellent, family forming, work from home office stipend, professional development, etc. The response to the Black Lives Matter movement has been stellar, and I'm very proud of the Last Mile program and to work with Next Chapter employees.","There is so much going on, it's hard to feel like there is clear direction on prioritization across teams when conflicts arise."

I haven't met a colleague who I haven't been enchanted by.","With all honesty, I have only had positive experiences. This is the best place I've worked in my 20 year professional career."
329,Slack,Slack is a human-first organization with a great product,2020-08-25,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"The leadership team demonstrates integrity and leads by example. I'm proud to work at Slack and think that Stewart, Ali, Robby, and others have blown it own of the water in taking care of their workforce during COVID times. It's a human-first organization that isn't afraid to show up authentically and take care of each other. The work is engaging and we're navigating our growth well.

Other things that are great: The benefits package is amazing, and compensation is competitive. Leadership encourages employees to take vacation to avoid burnout, and recruiting is very selective about hiring people that care about having lives outside of work. It makes for an interesting and well-rounded peer group.","If I had to think of something, there's an opportunity to improve clarity around career growth and promotions - but that will come as we mature as an organization."

331,Slack,Slack is a truly people-first company,2020-08-24,5.0,Human Resources,"Having been in human resources roles in various industries and companies, I have seen first-hand what each company and leadership truly values and prioritizes. Especially being at Slack in the midst of the pandemic, I truly feel that the company cares deeply about the well-being of employees, rather than just about business performance. Management sees that taking care of its people and those around them makes the organization perform at its best as a result.

People I work with are also very creative and intelligent, and tend to embrace change and learning opportunities. Every day I feel grateful to be working with such a diverse group of colleagues, and I feel that people embody our core values and attributes such as being humble, collaborative, hardworking, and empathetic.

There's also great excitement in watching us define and develop our own market. I feel that I can take part in leading the way to define a new way of working, as we help customers work through these challenging times.","Since we are still a young company, some internal processes and reporting could be further simplified. Using Slack internally makes things much quicker in general, but we can look into how we can minimize unnecessary steps and further utilize integrations or automated bots.

The other point would be around navigating through regional timezone and cultural differences, but that comes with working for a multi-national company."

334,Slack,Never felt so lucky to work at a company like Slack,2020-08-24,5.0,People & Culture,"With everything happening in the world, Slack has made it clear that its people come first. I have never worked at a company that is so transparent. Our leadership team has been nothing but incredible and human throughout all these shifts and changes and really care how we as team members feel and actively make changes based on our feedback. Feel nothing but lucky to work for Slack. 10/10!",I have no cons to lists
335,Slack,Virtual Onboarding at a Place Built for Virtual Onboarding,2020-08-24,5.0,Recruiter,"I interviewed at Slack at the very beginning of press about Covid-19 here in the states -- my plans for in-person interviews quickly shifted to virtual and from an external candidate POV, it was shockingly smooth. The team was just as inviting as I imagine they would have been in person, and I feel I got to know my interviewers well throughout the thoughtful, in-depth interview process. 

I got the job (yay!) and then was, of course, onboarded virtually. The dedicated team of program coordinators and enablement specialists embodied everything I had heard about Slack: they were all inclusive, flexible, warm, welcoming, empathetic, etc.! It seemed that everyone truly cared about my development here (not just my core team, but also hiring teams I supported, folks I onboarded with, and stakeholders across the org).

Slack is, as most know, amazing as a platform: being new and having this wealth of searchable information, with bots, reminders, everything you need to ramp up quickly. So, I won't ramble on about that. But I will say, I am genuinely so thrilled to be here at Slack. 

I believe in the power of our platform, believe we have amazing growth ahead, and feel really fortunate to get to work with this lean team of smart, humble, hardworking recruiters and business partners day in and day out. Even though I've never met my coworkers in real life, I've found my niche here and have appreciated how quickly the team welcomed me into the fold.","Virtual onboarding, wherever you go, is hard. While the meetings were necessary for me to get to know everyone, the first few weeks were overwhelming and meeting-heavy. There was a lot to learn, and while it's amazing to have this bank of searchable information, it takes some getting used to -- there's a little learning curve to use Slack to its full potential."
336,Slack,Slack has your back,2020-08-24,5.0,"Account Executive, Mid-Market","The overarching theme that comes to mind when people ask me how I feel about working for Slack is that the company is crazy employee-centric and I legitimately feel like they ""have my back"". They've demonstrated this in some of the following ways:

-Generous comp plan
-Most extensive and generous benefits of any tech company I've ever worked for. All healthcare premiums paid for, $1500 contribution to HSA, 401(k) with Vanguard funds and a match (although a higher match wouldn't hurt ;) ), 12 weeks of paternity leave paid on your OTE, cell phone and internet reimbursement, $100/mont wellness reimbursement etc.) Legitimately world-class
-As the times shift, Slack shifts to make sure it's employees are happy and healthy. Example: with everyone working remote, company leadership decided to give the entire company an extra Friday off every single month for the rest of the year. They announced this in April, so not only was this an additional ~9 days of PTO, but it's a designated day for the whole company to take the day off, essentially incentivizing us all to actually take the day off- pretty remarkable
-CEO is not afraid to show his human side and it's amazing to see his candor and passion 
-Team is full of fantastic Sales professionals with little to no ego (especially for a Sales team)
-You get to sell a product that fundamentally changes how teams work and collaborate, with customers across the entire business using the product daily for multiple hours. That's pretty unheard of in SaaS
-SE and CS support are fantastic. I've had mixed results at prior SaaS companies, but Slack hires people from Consulting and highly technical backgrounds to fill their SE and CS roles, and it pays off.
-Not a cut-throat environment at all- truly collaborative and very much a team selling environment. Every company I've worked at preaches this, but Slack is a shining example of it
-In general, a very low pressure environment where Leadership treats you like an adult and trusts you to run your book of business the way you see best. Love the autonomy and trust.","-Sales team is relatively new to the business- has only been around ~2 years, so doesn't have a lot of processes or tools in place that you might expect a company as well-known as Slack to have (for example, AEs aren't provided with any sort of VOIP or calling software- have to dial from your cell).
-Competition against MS is real- long-term, I think Slack will take-off like a rocketship, but there are definitely competitive headwinds, especially with the economy down and MS giving Teams away for free
-Because Slack can truly be used for 1000s of use cases and by any line of business at a company, finding one ubiquitous value prop can be a struggle when people ask, what does it do? It's a blessing and a curse
-The culture is solid, but it does seem like sometimes it's hard to be completely honest when things suck or a process isn't working, as optimism is heavily rewarded at Slack. In general, I love an optimistic outlook, but you also want to create a safe space for employees to be brutally honest about the problems they see in their team, the product, strategic approach etc. This isn't a Slack-exclusive problem, but it does seem like if leadership led the way showing that voicing concerns and being real about when there are problems and that people should be rewarded for this kind of feedback rather than seen as ""not being a team player"" would go a long way.
-401 (k) match is capped at $4k right now- would be awesome to see some sort of % match and this limit increased- but the rest of the benefits are top-notch :)"
337,Slack,Great place to work!,2020-08-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Supportive co-workers, leadership listens to feedback, team-culture","too fast work paced, Things are more ""urgent"" than it needs to be because of Slack's message"

342,Slack,"Best place I've worked, by a mile",2020-08-24,5.0,Customer Success,"- Work-life balance is exceptional
- Company culture is a great balance of being collegial and team-oriented, but without the groupthink and bureaucracy that slows down many other companies with ""nice"" cultures. 
- Very deliberate attention has been paid to the employee experience, starting from the CEO. This goes beyond the standard perks and freebies. Throughout the pandemic, the company has consistently shown a commitment to taking care of their employees and putting their money where their mouth is.","- Competitive pressure means that the company's long-term prosperity is far from guaranteed.
- Advancement opportunities are more similar to a large, established company than you might expect for a young post-IPO company. This isn't a career rocket ship where high-performers can expect promotions every year or two."

You're looked after, set up for success, and encouraged to create goals and exceed them. No unrealistic expectations as well; they understand everyone's human. Time off to take care of yourself is just as important as working hard. Because of that, everyone is in the right headspace to do their best work - and WANT to do it!","Onboarded remotely (due to COVID) which has made it a bit tough to get to know the team. Because HQ is in the US, the focus is there, even though there are offices globally and protocols that suit the US may not be necessary for other countries (COVID restrictions).

In addition to that, our CE team has to work on Canadian holidays because we're a US company. Although they give a day in lieu or holiday pay to follow employment requirements, it's one downfall of the team!"

• Strong commitment to diversity and belonging, since the earliest days of the company - This is something that everyone cares about, from the CEO on down. There will always be work to do here, but we're doing it with a deep-seeded cultural commitment
• Hard problems to solve - In Engineering, there is so much work to be done. We're reaching levels of scale that require novel solutions; off-the-shelf approaches won't work. Add to that adoption by the largest companies in the world, distributed across the globe, and it makes for some meaty projects","• If you aren't aligned with the culture, you will probably have a tough time here. Read the @SlackHQ Twitter account or slack.engineering blog to see some examples of the culture. If that's not for you, then it will be an uphill fight to find happiness here
• It's a crucial service for most of our customers, so if something happens to impact that, it's priority number one to fix it. If you don't like being on pager rotation occasionally, steer clear
• You can probably get higher base salaries elsewhere. If you don't think the stock has a lot of upside, then the numbers probably won't look that good to you."

You'll find that you are welcomed to the company with open arms and any team you join makes sure that your transition to the company is as smooth and enjoyable a possible. The problems that you work on are both challenging and fascinating, and the product itself is just such a pleasure. What I find most admirable about Slack, however, is their ongoing and renewed commitment to helping those less fortunate and fostering diversity within the company. Slack is one of the few companies in which I have seen a  Black and Latino women make up a good portion of the engineering managers. It's inspiring and necessary.

371,Slack,Very Rewarding and Comprehensive BDR Program,2020-07-12,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Being a BDR at Slack is a not like many other BDR positions. You truly partner with your Account team, which includes Account Executives, Customer Success and Solutions Engineers, to bring the best experience to your customers and prospects. 

The processes here are thorough and feedback is very valued. The leadership team cares about your growth both personally and career wise and will help you to get to your desired future, whether it is internally or outside Slack’s wall, whatever that may look like.

It is rewarding being a BDR here at Slack because you are working with diverse organizations where your product can do many different things for them. You cater to many different personas and verticals. This exposes you to different industries and roles, where at other companies, you may only be exposed to a few.

Overall, the amount of learning that has happened here is too much to document. The leadership team also puts an emphasis on skill development and sharing best practices. It is a great place to be a Business Development Rep.","I think the only challenge at the moment is finding the time to work with your manager personally. We are a FAST growing company and are hiring BDR’s rapidly to meet the needs of our customers. This isn’t a big downside, as your managers usually make themselves available and make sure you are always helped out."

- Great benefits during WFH","- Most of management in Sales is from Salesforce, Dropbox, Box, where they have worked with each other in the past
- You can be promoted here to an entirely new pay grade with zero merit increase which is shocking"
392,Slack,Amazing place to work with great culture,2020-06-29,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Slack really cares about the people that work here. They do every effort to make sure that you are valued and comfortable in performing your job. The company has an amazing culture and collaborative way of working.

393,Slack,Strong company values and culture,2020-06-26,5.0,Engineering Manager,"The company has a very strong sense of values and culture that is felt thought out every interaction. Especially felt during the times of the pandemic, these values and the company's flexibility have made the transition to working from home one of the best experiences. The company really cares about their employees health and wellbeing as well as career advancement","Decisions are sometimes slow to be made, as it we tend to look for buy-in from all stake holders. Some of the time they are made on gut feel, rather than hard data which can be frustrating."
394,Slack,World Class Culture and Team,2020-06-25,5.0,Software Engineer,"Transparent leadership whose bottom line is _not_ to make a profit. I attribute a lot of the culture to Stewart. He is clearly very invested in social good initiatives (way before the pandemic started). For example, bringing in speakers to talk about racial justice initiatives, the last mile program, partnering with code2040, etc. 

The great part is that this culture attracts the best people! Folks that are incredibly kind and exemplify all of our values. Not only that, most if not all of the engineers are amazing technically. Technical leaders are very knowledgable and really level up their teams if not the entire org. There are also lots of opportunities to work on technical challenges.","The legacy codebase can be hard to work in sometimes, but it's getting better.
The concentration of people of color and LGBTQ folks is not equal. Some teams are very diverse while others are not as much.
The stock price is quite volatile, but trending upwards.
We use Hack which no one really uses besides Facebook.
Hard to find something as good for next job."
395,Slack,Crushed my high expectations and then some...,2020-06-25,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"People and culture has to be at the forefront. Slack has hired amazing people with abundance of different experiences and expertise. On top of that, we've hired some amazing people in general who are selfless and HYPER collaborative. It's amazing to see such a big team in CS all working in unity when it can be hard enough working with just one other person.

Leadership has been one of the most impressive things to witness since joining Slack. Leaders at Slack do not just say thing to say things, in every instance, I've seen leadership lead by example. Very empathetic and compassionate leaders that sincerely care about your well being and go out of their way to assist you when you're down rather than tell you about it.","Personally, I haven't been able to see anything that I can label as a con.
If you're used to being in a startup and want things to move fast within a small team? Then perhaps this isn't necessarily that anymore.
But at the same time if you're coming from a huge organization with 10s of thousands of employees? Things aren't structured to that point either.

For me, it's a happy medium, but this could differ on what your expectations are."
396,Slack,Best Place I've Ever Worked,2020-06-25,5.0,Senior Solutions Engineer,"Slack has a great emphasis on career and skill development, work life balance, and diversity. As an employee, you genuinely feel cared for and listened to, whether it's through Town Halls, executive channels, or the multiple surveys sent out throughout the year. The core values - empathy, craftsmanship, and humility (to just name a few!) are the basis for everything at Slack, from the way the product is built, to the way every team operates. Outside of the amazing culture, the benefits are excellent, and I can only see Slack continuing to move up and to the right in the upcoming years!","Managers can change quite frequently, as people are often being promoted up within the organization."

- Slack on Slack can be overwhelming at first

- Some days you feel the burden of being a comparatively young enterprise sales team with things yet to figure out

- Typical post-IPO growth/scale pains around loosely defined career progression and enablement

- Solving for the largest organizational challenges in collaboration with our customers means you actually have to solve hard problems. Coasting isn't an option here.

I really don't see myself leaving anytime soon within the next 5 years which is amazing given I'm part of Gen Z.

Now that I've started, I'm super impressed! Thoughtful, caring, engaged and happy employees. The onboarding process is dialed in and everyone is here to help.

They are very transparent and listen to their employees. They hire sound people as well who are there to support you in the long run.",It can feel like you're forgotten about once onboarding has completed and there are times where I find myself drowning for support because Slack moves at such a fast pace.

This growth without corporate maturation has resulted in a massive communication and expectation rift, both between ICs and management as well as cross-functionally, and it fuels everything from the constructive feedback problem (everyone's afraid to give it for fear of seeming “not nice"") to the product direction problem (roadmaps are slapped together and then changed if the OKRs they support start looking bad) to the reliability problem (tests are flaky and QA is understaffed) to the management problem (lots of middle managers are ineffective but aren’t supported or held accountable - until last year upwards 360 feedback cycles for management had been removed completely for over a year) to the leveling problem (many employees are brought in under-leveled, leading to a burst of work to be promoted and creating resentment and demoralization) to the hiring problem (C-suite, almost all recently and externally sourced to soothe stockholders, won’t concede outright that they want shiny FAANG resumes and not culture fit i.e. “Slackiness” anymore)."

If it wasnt for my stocks I would have left by now.","HR is political. They have no idea what they are doing and not helping employees at all. IT department is political. They each bring people from their previous companies, and leaving tenured employees out to dry. Young, unexperienced, 2 years in IT kids are getting promoted to managers simply because they are good at sucking up and throwing people under the bus. You can work day in and night, if you didnt know your manager from another company, or if you are really giving them honest feedback you will get bad performance ratings and they will not promote you on purpose. People that were previously interns are now managing a team of 5 with less than 2 years on the jobs when Master degree, 15 years of experience professionals are just analyst. This is a joke.

425,Slack,Slack Data Engineering: The most appalling engineering culture I’ve ever seen,2020-02-12,1.0,Data Engineer,"Great benefits, swanky office, cool baristas","This review pertains only to the Data Engineering team within Slack.

I am a former member of the DE team who recently quit. I highly advise any prospective candidates to rethink if they want to apply here.

The engineering culture and technical caliber here is appalling. Weekly, sometimes daily, outages are the norm. Dev and prod don't match at all, and testing on production data is routine and encouraged by management. On-call is dreaded for the poor engineering soul each week. And firefighting isn't limited to the on-call engineer either, as multiple team members are almost always pulled into incidents. Postmortem meetings are held at a regular cadence (usually at least two per week). The only reason Slack's customers don't experience any of this is because when DE outages happen, they only affect the other internal teams.

Almost every aspect of engineers' tools work against them, but management doesn't seem to care. The code base is likewise a mess to behold. An experienced engineer knows that poor tools and poor code means that mistakes are very easy to make, which leads to further problems that compound. As an engineer here, you will be blamed for decreased productivity by leadership, despite the tools and infrastructure being the things that slow you down.

On the topic of leadership, DE leadership is visionless and doesn't prioritize permanent fixes or true debt cleanup, but instead encourages technical mediocrity and cowboy coding by rewarding short-term ""wins"" over long-term stability. Promotions also follow this rule. (Hey, immediate results can be attributed to single people; long-term fallout is distributed across the team and is ""blameless."")

Several other engineers have quit over the past few months, and I'm sure more will in the future.

Join Slack Data Engineering if you want to experience how a mosaic of engineering anti-patterns looks like in practice.

P.S. Check out some of the other reviews for Slack DE on Glassdoor, and you'll see a similar sentiment repeated by others."

Some teams have seen change of leadership which has lead to a ruckus internally. The new leadership chose to completely disregard the previous leadership's decisions. People questioning each other's work, escalating things in bad spirit, bringing each other down has unfortunately become very common. It's very hard for an employee to focus on actual work."

431,Slack,Bad Traditional Management,2020-01-14,2.0,Front End Engineer,"Slack has a beautiful office in SF which is one of the most wonderful offices I have worked at Aesthetically.
Good Co-workers who are nice and work together collaboratively","Everything else especially Management. The Management is very traditional, and has low diversity although Slack stresses on being a very diverse culture and tries to portray this via Social Media or Articles however internally that's not very true.
There are no Managers who I can relate to who, like other Unicorn startups are less traditional, new generation, energetic and diverse. 
I also wish we had a more Front End specific Managers because most Managers here are not very good at Front End Engineering which causes discussion gaps between Engineers and Managers."
432,Slack,Horrible data organization,2019-12-11,2.0,,"Perks are great. Building is beautiful. Slack, as a product, is useful.","Data org has no strategy or vision. Most engineering managers don't care about their team members. The very few who do aren't supported by the senior leadership. No focus on engineering quality and the happiness of the engineers. VPs and directors overpromise to the execs. They get upset when their unreasonable demands aren't met. Horrendous amount of cross department politics. Constant on-call issues and pages. Small teams supporting large number of projects and constantly struggling to keep up. No appreciation or recognition of th good work. CTO belittles the data org when things go wrong. He seems unhappy with the team, but does nothing to understand and correct any issues.

I can keep going but hopefully you got the idea!"
433,Slack,Inconsistent Management -> Unhappy Engineers,2019-12-11,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Slack has a beautiful office in San Francisco. Almost everyone there is very nice and wants to see you succeed. The perks are nice, especially the weekly massages.","I had 3 managers (4 if you count the time I had no manager) over ~6 months. The whiplash was disorienting and I couldn't focus or get my work done. My original manager was amazing, his replacement was bad (overcommitted, late to everything, bad listener) to the point that I quit. I miss my teammates but I don't miss him.

Additionally, when I was leaving, I found that multiple coworkers had tried to transfer out to other teams at Slack and had been denied by the director of our department. IMO, that's unacceptable.

The pay isn't great - relatively low base pay for a company their size plus a yearly bonus that the finance department threatens to take away at every all hands."

This is the first place I've worked at where people want to work together to solve problems and not just try to put their own stamp on something. 

More broadly, Slack as a whole has a strong sense of empathy when it comes to working with each other. We celebrate each others wins and encourage each other to do our best work in a very constructive way. 

I also value the energy this company puts into designing learning and development programs so I not only feel I can continue to learn in my own role, but also learn in areas that I don't have experience with and explore various career paths.","I would say these things are more of a ""work-in-progress"" than a ""Con.""

The other thing we need to do better as a company is enable our customers better.  I used Slack before joining Slack, but had no idea I was only using 5% of it's capabilities.

459,Slack,Pivotal Year for Slack,2019-10-04,4.0,People Team,"Slack has an incredible product and brand recognition, and I truly feel fortunate to be here. Even at 2000+ employees globally, I feel like we have been able to retain the personality and light-heartedness  of our culture at scale. When I was job searching, I was extremely intentional about landing at a company where I truly felt like a value-add and more than just a number & cog in the wheel. I can stay that, a year later, this is still very true. The ocmpany is a unique spot where we're learning how to navigate the public market and having a huge spotlight on us, but there are still a lot of processes,  procedures, and positions that are ""first of their kind"" that are direct results of growth.
As fluffy as it sounds, I think our core value truly are upheld -- people are so naturally driven do to the best work of their lives and make Slack the best company and product possible. It's  very rewarding to hire for this culture and the teams I support.
Our Field team has landed some huge and exciting accounts, and I'm so excited to hear about all the future wins as we continue to close new deals expand sales into other markets.","Slack is no stranger to the growing pains that come with scaling quickly. The theme of ""running before you can walk"" definitely rings through -- in multiple organizations throughout the business, teams have grown and workflows have been instilled in manners that were purely reactive, and now we're a public company that is still trying to find its sea legs -- this shouldn't be the case. Leadership has recognized this and we've embarked on the ""year of execution"", but I feel like I'm still waiting for tangible actions to occur and changes to be made. There's lots of talk about buckling up and getting to work, but the action + execution behind that is STILL lacking months later. We can only here the same message so many times before losing faith the having the ""year of execution"" actually happen."

Never before have I worked at a company that said they valued this type of work, and meant it. This comes through in the compensation offered, but also in the type of feedback one gets from senior design management, and the rigor (but still constructive and collaborative!) of the content team in reviews. 

- A career ladder that allows one to advance even if one has no desire to ever manage a team. 

- Amazing culture. It sounds like kool-aid until you get here and realize it's actually all true. Remarkably little politicking and brown-nosing 

- Transparency from leadership 

- Possibly not a pro to many others, but I think it's nice that the company doesn't offer free meals all week to its employees. It feels like a very conscious decision to encourage employees to spend in the local community (or bring food from home).","- Ramp up isn't easy. There's a lot going on, and very little source of truth documentation. The recommendation is that you search the history of Slack's Slack for any information you need, and it usually works, but does require extra time/effort than someone pointing you to an updated style guide.

* They got rid of some of the prepackaged snacks in the microkitchen for bulk goods. 
* Overall this is a great company to work for, not much to complain about."
482,Slack,Best job I've had,2019-09-11,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"- I've worked at companies with very smart people and I've worked at companies with very kind people. Slack is the first I've worked at where my peers are very much both. 
- Culture","- The growth of company has resulted in lots of restructuring and constant change, which in itself is not a bad thing, but is a source of stress."
483,Slack,Great place to work in a highly collaborative environment,2019-09-11,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Everyone here is very friendly and easy to work with
- Avocados, Fresh Fruits, Fully stock frig and snacks available
- Work life balance is something they care about here.  You come to work and get your work done and then you can focus on your life.",- Getting bigger and with that you have some growing pains.  Some needed change and process needs to change to adapt to how big Slack is getting.   There's a bit of tension between a few folks and things can be more aligned across the company in terms of certain process and decisions.  The good thing is I know there are people are working on it so hopefully it's keeps getting better.
484,Slack,Great culture and people,2019-09-10,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"-Culture, company values and mission are all tightly tied together
-Leadership is communicative and open
-People are kind and always willing to help each other out",-there is sometimes ambiguity due to high growth
485,Slack,Making Working Lives More Chaotic and Stressful,2019-09-10,3.0,Sales,"Overall company culture great, Care about you as an individual
Product is great and easy to use
Good perks and benefits","Sales organization is very messy and broken in terms of process and procedure
No clear selling methodology on how to best position Slack
Managers are early slack employees who are not best equipped to manage teams
Work life balance is not very good
Compensation on sales 5% acv is pretty poor for industry standards
Very unclear how you are compensated
No formal training or coaching in sales
No ramp quota for new hires"
486,Slack,Best job I've ever had. Hoping to grow here,2019-09-10,5.0,Senior Account Executive,Management really cares about you. You'll work with the smartest people you have in your career and you will work in a fast-paced space with an incredible opportunity.,"The only real knock I have on Slack is being an employee in a non-SF office. The world seems to revolve around SF and it can feel like if you're not in that bubble you are lost in terms of recognition and more importantly career opportunity. 

I think this is something being addressed and feedback that is heard but as of right now this is still a sore spot for me."
487,Slack,"Great culture, great people, solid mission",2019-09-10,4.0,Senior Account Executive,"Great team dynamic and strong company culture
Leadership has extensive experience and everyone seems to be aligned to the company mission","Less visibility with leadership
No line of sight for plans with regional offices"
488,Slack,Amazing Opportunity to Build and Grow,2019-09-10,5.0,Attorney,Beloved brand and product. Smart and professional colleagues. Positive culture. A chance to build something in a nascent product vertical. Personal development opportunities galore.,A bit too high on our own supply. Need to be hungrier.
489,Slack,Great place to work,2019-09-09,5.0,Senior Front End Engineer,Supportive engineering culture. Good perks but not over the top and professional. Good work-life balance.,"Rapid employee growth means a lot of people are new and few people seem to have in-depth knowledge. Development pace can feel a bit slow coming from a smaller company. Overly-cautious about unit tests and logging, while lacking in integration and system tests to prevent incidents."
490,Slack,One of the best cultures!,2019-09-09,5.0,Legal Team,"Truly value diversity, good work life balance, low egos, very good but not fantastic benefits, everyone tries to abide by the values: smart, humble, hardworking and collaborative. 

I've been at 5+ tech companies and Slack has one of the best cultures I've seen. I genuinely like everyone on my team and everyone I've met at Slack outside of my team. Everyone is willing to pitch in and help with things.",Since they only use Slack to work it can be difficult to find information you're looking for sometimes.
491,Slack,Growing into our next phase,2019-09-09,4.0,Technical Program Manager,"The work environment is great: offices are incredibly thoughtfully designed spaces, coworkers are smart and caring, benefits are well above average, and the work is meaningful (ok, that last one is subjective, but almost everyone here believes in collaboration, openness, and a future where nearly every company uses a tool like Slack).","The primary (and only major) con is that the company is still trying to figure out how to operate at its current scale: there is friction between teams as goals and priorities are not always clear, the work planning process changes every quarter, and there is some expected thrash as projects are not always smoothly initiated or completed."
492,Slack,Great sales culture!,2019-09-09,5.0,Outside Sales Representative,"Sales reps at Slack are collaborative, helpful, and want you as well as your team to succeed! Quotas are fair, comp is in line, and management cares about you outside of your quota! They want you to be the best version of yourself in and out of the workplace.","Fast growing so be ready to give feedback, be flexible and move quickly. Structure is changing as most fast growing companies."
493,Slack,Strategic focus on Customer Success,2019-09-09,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Over the last few years I have seen Slack's senior leadership continue to make significant investments in the Customer Success Org. These investments have allowed us hire strong leaders and ICs away from some of the best SaaS companies and consulting firms in the world -- Salesforce, IBM, Google, Accenture, Deloitte.. the list goes on.

One of the most gratifying things about working in CS at Slack is that our team has a material, measurable impact on revenue growth. We are recognized not just by our own department heads, but by our CEO and executive team for the work that we do and the impact that we have on driving mature usage of our product. 

Beyond that, the people here are truly great - smart and driven, but also human. This isn't just in CS, but x-functional teams that we work with as well. There is a genuine camaraderie that exists across the whole org, and it makes coming into work fun.","The team has grown a ton, so the usual growing pains. Nothing that isn't expected when you're in hyper growth mode."
494,Slack,Feel very fortunate to work here,2019-09-09,5.0,Account Executive,"-I've never sold a product (let alone an enterprise software) that had so much customer love. When I tell people I work at Slack or meet people at conferences, I'm met with so much enthusiasm about the product. We really have the power to transform people's working lives.
-Company has had an amazing trajectory and still has so much untapped opportunity. 
-Lots of smart people work here. 
-Great work life balance.
-Great benefits and perks.","-Tendency to hire people from other tech companies which leads to lack of diversity in experience/backgrounds
-Company grew extremely quickly so now there's a fair share of growing pains (decisions made too quickly without sufficient data, managers get promoted internally and may not have relevant experience, etc)"
495,Slack,Homogeneous place. Don't let all the diversity talk fool you,2019-09-09,1.0,Technical Sourcer,"Good product roadmap, positive future as a product. Slack is for sure the way of the future. Goodbye email.","Very homogeneous and minorities do not thrive in this environment.  The HR team has no support nothing really set up to help underrepresented minorities be successful in this environment. No education around cultural or communication styles and no resources on biases or true bias trainings except for the usual ""unconscious bias"" jargon. POCs will very quickly become isolated and it's up to them to make others around them feel comfortable or else they will be sacrificed. I have watched this happen to POCs. Especially Black Women."
496,Slack,The Best Place I've Ever Worked,2019-09-08,5.0,Customer Experience Agent,"Slack cares about their employees as much as their customers. Extremely pleasant work environment, amazing colleagues and benefits, as well as an overall feeling that you're really valued. So much effort is put into making sure you have the tools to do the best work of your life, which, in turn, leads to a genuine feeling of fulfillment.",Career advancement has appeared to be drawn out at times.
497,Slack,"Great culture, smart people, lots to learn!",2019-09-06,5.0,Technical Program Manager,"I've been at Slack for 9 months and I'm really enjoying my job.   They hire top quality people and they try to live the values - smart, humble, hardworking and collaborative.   People are appreciated for the work they do and it's possible to have a large impact on the company.","Lots of change - I've had 3 bosses in 9 months.   Hasn't had much of an impact on my day to day life, but it's a bit thrash-y.       The way we use Slack can be overwhelming - I must be in 100 channels.  I look forward to the day when are priorities are to make the product easier to use for Slack-centric companies.    Sometimes the best way to get more work done is to turn off Slack."
498,Slack,"Really great company culture, don't recommend the marketing team",2019-09-04,3.0,Anonymous,"- Mature, professional, smart and genuinely friendly people
- No tech company BS - we get our own lunches like adults, and we enjoy the company Gather Hour and 1/week lunch and breakfast as a time to connect with people across the company. If you are looking for free food (other than the awesome snacks), this isn't for you
- No pets - again, aligns with the ""work hard and go home"" motto. 
- Amazing baristas on multiple floors - this one can spoil you rotten
- The company has experienced, smart leaders in product, sales, comms, engineering etc who are very down-to-earth and approachable","- As I've seen other reviews mention, a lot of systems and data are really difficult to access or use. If you joined in the last 1-2 years (as so many have), you probably don't know where to find it. 
- Growing pains with processes, such as OKR processes that are rolled out without much direction on how to measure results consistently across teams!
- If you are considering any role on the marketing team, think 10 times. That team has been rudderless and with many conflicting visions for too long. Even with a brand new CMO, things are going to take a *long* time to come around.  There is a lot of politics, as people who were hired in leadership positions were hired when the company wanted SMB/consumer backgrounds. Most are less qualified for the company's current vision and enterprise focus. I think that team has had 2-3 re-orgs and  team changes in the last 1 year. They just announced a big re-org and some good people are gone. The team and functions are so fragmented it's difficult to get any projects done smoothly if marketing is involved. Marketing leaders quite aware of these problems but it's clear they are more focused on what their roles are going to be in the new org rather than solving them. The relationship with sales has improved but marketing is still far from being a great (much less equal) partner to sales, product management, and other teams."
499,Slack,What an amazing hiring /on-boarding and start to working at Slack,2019-08-30,5.0,Account Executive,"From the moment that I started the recruitment/interview process Alan and the team were clear, open, honest and professional. It is hands down the best hiring experience that I have ever had in my career. The on-boarding was thorough, really well structured and organized and  because we are using Slack day to day to communicate and work i feel really clear to what I should be learning without the distraction of 100's of emails , i feel that i am getting up to speed quicker than any other company i've worked for and not felt overwhelmed.  Lastly the team and the environment are fabulous, people seem to join and stay and i love that,  makes me excited to be a part of the Slack journey :)",At the moment I cannot honestly think of anything

501,Slack,I freakin' love working here,2019-08-23,5.0,Sales,"Great culture of knowledge sharing. People are smart, helpful, curious and overall everyone I've met works hard and means well. Feeling that we're set out to build something great and deeply care about the customer. Oh and you get to properly use Slack!","Because there's so much growth, sometimes hard to know what to prioritize."
502,Slack,"fantastic culture, heady growth prospects, difficult challenges",2019-08-18,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"Wonderful culture: humility, empathy and just plain good natured personalities abound.   Having worked at many large, high profile internet companies the hardest thing to get used to is .. Yes, these people are also very very smart and talented","Slack is essentially selling *reliability* as it's main feature, and when it comes to scalability problems, reliability is the least fun (compared to fast, big and kinda reliable i've had at other places) ."

505,Slack,Couldn't be happier,2019-08-10,5.0,Senior Business Development Representative,"Amazing company! So happy I ended up working for Slack. Such a nice culture and environment to work in, were people genuinely live the values and they are truly embedded in the company- empathy, craftsmanship,  courtesy,  solidarity thriving and playfulness. Management is superb, super talented and a very transparent organization. Got the chance to meet many of upper management including co-founders during my training at HQ in San Francisco and they are very nice, approachable and extremely talented.  I can't imagine working under a better CEO than Stewart. Such an interesting time to be at Slack; growing quickly, great product and interesting market. Highly recommend Slack! 

Great benefits including professional and personal development, also additional benefits covering phone, commuting and fitness expenses.",I've not experienced any so far (I've only been at Slack a few months)
506,Slack,Amazing product! Wonderful work environment!,2019-08-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"So many pros... a product that is truly innovative and making peoples working lives simpler, happier and more productive, fabulous office space, amazing food, massages... But, I am probably most impressed by how amazing the people are. Respect, courtesy, humbleness, collaboration, and great work ethic abound. I genuinely love coming in to work every day!","The timezone difference between Dublin and SF HQ (and other offices) can make connecting with our international colleagues quite challenging. But, generally there is a lot of understanding and flexibility surrounding this."
507,Slack,good,2019-08-05,4.0,Intern,good to work and share lot of knowledge.,lot of work to do and hard timeline.
508,Slack,"Some of the smartest, humblest, kindest, and most collaborative humans I've ever worked with!",2019-08-02,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"The humans of Slack make it special. From day one you feel there's an energy about this place that isn't really easy to describe. You know that you're working on technology - but it's way more than that. I see this piece of technology making a positive, lasting impact on so many people's working lives. It's incredible to make that kind of impact on a macro scale, and we're just getting started!

Additionally, I find work to be way more collaborative here. I don't dread checking my Slack the same way I used to dread checking emails. It's amazing how people really do work hard and go home as well! I love this place!","I think, like any new organization, there are a lot of process things that we're still working to iron out. The organization is totally open to hearing feedback on how to improve, though, so it makes implementing new solutions to issues easy!"
509,Slack,Amazing people. constant change and lots of opportunities,2019-08-02,5.0,Manager,"Working alongside of the most grounded and supportive team members you'll find in the tech industry. Great benefits - free healthcare, generous mat/pat leave, personal development and professional development funds. Culture is friendly and the offices are beautiful",Constant change can sometimes be hard to keep up with. Teams shift around a lot and sometimes there is a lot of ambiguity. PTO is only 20 days instead of unlimited
510,Slack,"Good place to work overall, take bonus with a grain of salt",2019-08-02,4.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"Overall this has been a good place to work. The company is growing, the product and teams are growing, so there's opportunity to take on challenging work of increasing scope and complexity. The senior leadership of the company is experienced and better than other places I've worked, and the new senior leadership hires all seem to be people with good backgrounds who I respect and think will level up the company. Work-life balance is extremely reasonable.","They tell you ""here's the target bonus percentage,"" what they don't tell you is that there's also a company multiplier, which historically has never been 1. It seems based on rather optimistic stretch goals. Don't expect to get your full bonus amount."
511,Slack,Slack - Account Executive,2019-08-02,5.0,Account Executive,A brilliant working environment full of highly talented people.,"None really. It's a very high growth company so there's constant change as we evolve, but I like that."
512,Slack,"Great company, some growing pains",2019-08-01,5.0,BDR,Tremendous company to work for. Leadership truly cares about the employee base. Hard work is recognized and rewarded.,Growing pains. The company has 3-4X in size over the last 2 years. Systems break when any group scales this quickly - but entrepreneurial spirit is encouraged
513,Slack,Learn from some of the best engineering leaders in bay area,2019-07-31,4.0,Engineering Manager,"Amazing culture, great engineers and awesome leadership team. 
Investment in the right areas. 
Best onboarding
Value culture","Challenge of growing super fast. 
Some of the old timers are struggling with scale."
514,Slack,A Growing Company with lots of Opportunity,2019-07-31,4.0,Marketing,"There are so many pros. 
The Work -- There's a lot of amazing activity that's happening at Slack. I've been inspired by the creative projects that are being undertaken. I feel like the organization values my contribution. It is as close to a true meritocracy as I've had in my career. 
The Product -- it's a fabulous product with depth of capability that many people don't see yet. The product value is the reason I joined.  
The People and Culture -- The value that is shared over and over again is empathy. There's a rigorous hiring process and I can see why. Everyone I've met across Slack has a huge amount of compassion for each other and understanding. Team meetings are honest but kind. I'm continually amazed by the level of connection between people. 
Work Life Balance - You may think that being inside Slack, you're available 24-7. It's quit the opposite. They truly live the mantra ""Work Hard and Go Home"". Everyone contributes and then respects that people's evenings and weekends are their own time. Snoozing notifications on Slack is the norm and I've never felt pressure to work unreasonable hours. 
The Perks -- Where else can you get a weekly massage, all-day snacks, and kombucha on tap? :)","Infrastructure Debt - Slack's one of those places that both amazes and astounds. I'm sometimes surprised by the lack of infrastructure inside the company. The leadership team are aware of it, and the systems are in the process of being built... it just sometimes doesn't keep up with the speed of the growth. 
Product-centric - It's a fairly typical company whose origins are centered in product. We're in the phase of moving beyond feature release/adoption, and need to understand true customer value. This is something that most product companies will go through as they grow, and Slack is no exception. Sometimes the product won't ""sell itself"" as some people believe."
515,Slack,Recruiting Coordinator,2019-07-31,5.0,Recruiting Coordinator,"1. Slack has such a fun and collaborative work environment. Using Slack as a primary communication tool, we have great transparency and can share information highly effectively. With application integration, things are very convenient at slack!
2. I am very happy with the benefits !",Growth pain as usual in fast-growing start-up.
516,Slack,We live our values,2019-07-30,5.0,Account Executive,"Truly agile and collaborative environment 
Best in Class Product, Support and Leadership
Extremely positive work environment 
Competitor aware and customer obsessed 
A vital SaaS solution for your customers - not a commodity and easily differentiated 
Internal support is Grade A","Classic pains of a scaling SaaS company competing against legacy, well known incumbents 
Slack is difficult to explain - which is challenging but not impossible"
517,Slack,A great place to work! But negotiate hard.,2019-07-30,5.0,Product Manager,"An excellent product to work on, with a company that doesn't just value diversity but actually hires for it, and tons of opportunities to explore different areas of problem-solving at a rapidly growing company.","- The ""nice"" effect - some people shy away from giving honest, hard feedback, instead focusing on being perceived as 'nice' we're getting better, though. 
- The hiring process is a bit of a mess: from leveling to compensation (""we don't negotiate offers"" - HA! Negotiate EVERYTHING, people), you'll have to negotiate the hiring waters carefully if you're lucky enough to be a part of this team."
518,Slack,"Fantastic product, even better organization",2019-07-30,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Strong alignment across leadership, transparency, open communication and supportive culture. Slack creates a culture that enables collaboration, feedback and supports employees in any way that it can. I feel so lucky to work here alongside amazing coworkers and leaders.",None I can think of!
519,Slack,"Great Place To Work, Would Recommend To Friends",2019-07-30,5.0,Senior Frontend Engineer,"1. My coworkers are very supportive
2. So much greenfield in lots of areas of the product
3. A ton of work to be done
4. You work on a product many people love
5. Company benefits are the best I've ever had
6. I've been consistently busy/working hard since I joined
7. Lots of career growth opportunities
8. Lots of grass-roots efforts to improve overall code quality
9. We work hard, and then go home. You can hear crickets (not literally) in our Slack workspace overnight. Work-life balance really exists here.","1. Lots of engineers, not enough product managers or designers to unblock engineering's work so they are sometimes a bottle neck
2. The process of assigning work to engineers is not a well-oiled machine
3. Not a lot of process in general, which leads to inefficiencies"
520,Slack,"Word Hard, Play Hard, Go Home",2019-07-30,5.0,Recruiter,"Team cares about you as a person and your growth. Huge focus on empathy,
making a difference, and work/life balance.","Could have better options for lunch and snacks at the office. More structure and consistency with processes would also be helpful, but this is expected of a growing company."
521,Slack,Awesome employee and customer-centric company!,2019-07-30,5.0,Solutions Engineer,"Great office culture and teams that really believe in the Slack values! Kindness, collaboration, and craftsmanship are visible in almost every interaction you see on a daily basis. 

Awesome perks and a huge emphasis on a work life balance makes it a pleasure to work hard and go home at the end of the day.","Career and promotion paths are still in the process of being formalized, but good news is that this in being worked on a lot by management."
522,Slack,The Nicest People Work Here,2019-07-30,5.0,Manager,"1. We use Slack rather than email for internal comms. No intranet either! Amazing.

2. The culture here is unlike anywhere else I've been to (in my 12 years at tech companies). Lots of ""important"" things that are campaigned heavily at other companies such as Diversity & Inclusion can make corporate employees feel numb or apathetic but at Slack, D&I is a real deal. It's not just talked about or inflated - there are real practical plans, processes, and engaging events that show D&I is part of our daily work lives. For example, very rarely will we ever have an all-hands meeting with just white male speakers - we believe in diverse, collaborative views (whether it's skin color, levels, or experiences) that define and shape our projects and goals. The fact that most of us do it with the utmost respect and thoughtfulness with one another is contagious and empowering.

3. On a superficial but important level, I do enjoy the benefits here too. Being able to spend up to $150/month on anything athletic-related (pick-up b-ball game gym usage? Krav Maga classes? Marathon registration? It's all good!) is awesome.","1. There is a minority of vocal people that can be considered entitled and whiny. Our company culture attracts the nicest people I've ever met but I think we're too nice sometimes. Clarity is kind, so calling these people out for such pointless/wasteful behavior is a good thing. Okay, that's probably more on me to do that. I guess i'm too nice too haha

2. This is very superficial - but our HQ elevators seem to be too slow (or one is always broken). My health thanks you for prompting me to walk up  several flights of stairs everyday because I lack the patience to wait."
523,Slack,Great place to work!,2019-07-30,5.0,Sales Operations,The people and benefits here are amazing!  Brand new office in Denver is something else.  Growing company and many growing teams.  Lots of opportunity ahead!,"Typical growing pains that come with most start ups. Start in one direction, quickly pivot in another.  Not really a con just something to be cognizant of."
524,Slack,"Great momentum, fantastic culture",2019-07-29,5.0,Software Engineer,"• Strong executive leadership pointing the company in the right direction

• Building a product that I use on a daily basis is exciting","• Frequent reorganizations and process changes, not surprising for a fast-growing company but could be annoying

545,Slack,"Comfortable Place, Nice People. Not Great for Career Advancement",2018-11-27,3.0,Data Scientist,"* Good work/life balance. Management seems to career about employees' wellness. Lots of fringe benefits including good Mat/Pat leave.
* Company  has a good name and is on a good trajectory.
* Coworkers are pretty nice and mature.","* At least within Analytics, ICs are rarely promoted. Mid-managers come up with rubrics for judging advancement, but use vague definitions to make assessment fit their view. In two years, among fifteen colleagues, I've observed perhaps three IC promotions (manager class seems to promote itself)
* In same vein, mid-management is reluctant to promote ICs to management, tend to hire from outside so nearly impossible to move up from IC to mgr
* Fast growth issues: getting things out the door is focused on, so quick wins are praised and rewarded, while building scalable solutions is often overlooked. Result is a lot of tech debt and even basic data questions still take a long time to get answered. On an org level, code base is a behemoth and we've now finally been forced into clean-up mode because it's struggling to scale."
546,Slack,Customer Experience,2018-11-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"• Slack does Customer Experience right! We have a lot of freedom to do what is best for our users. This is a gem in the world of Customer Experience.
• Great team and atmosphere, I work with a  great lot of people, everyone's giving it 100%. 
• High-profile company, the product is amazing, and the benefits are very competitive.","• Don't be fooled by the no-blame, no-ego, we're-all-in-this-together approach. There is politics, like everywhere else.
• The people at the very top of Customer Experience are control freaks.  Their baby is growing up and they're having a hard time letting to. They are not receptive to disagreement, they get involved at a level they should not be and consistently undermine our managers. They don't know how to manage more structured organisation (or people it seems) and it can get messy and confusing."
547,Slack,External Perception Outpacing Reality,2018-11-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"• Extremely strong, once-in-a-lifetime business. From a market perspective, there's no reason Slack can't be the next MSFT/Salesforce. MSFT presents some competition in the space, but it's Slack's market to lose. You definitely have job security here.
• Compensation and perks are great. Fitness reimbursement, education, phone data, etc. You'll save a lot of money by working here. Office spaces are luxurious and thoughtfully designed.
• You get to work on a product (many!) people actually use and care about
• There are some truly extraordinary people working here that are a pleasure to work with and learn from.
• Stewart is as ""unique"" and inspiring as he seems from the outside. Some other executives are the same way.
• Slack is no longer a startup so it's less likely you'll need to work startup hours (e.g. 9a - 5p will swing it for most roles)
• The bar for tech companies is lower than sea level, but Slack is still above it. From a total package perspective, there are few opportunities as good as this in Silicon Valley, even despite its many flaws.","• Despite Slack's diversity PR, some women and minorities still experience horrible things/sexism/lesser treatment there just like any other tech company. There's more than one case of a perpetrator not only not being punished because of incidents but being promoted. Internal surveys continually reflect the dissatisfaction from URMs and virtually nothing is done. It feels awful when the company is telling a story externally that is divorced from the realities many employees experience internally.
• Senior leadership is extremely hit or miss. You're as likely to find inspiring leaders as you are to find people solely focused on building their personal brand/driving readership to their blog instead of doing any real work.
• There are management chains completely devoid of accountability, where a bad manager reports to and is close with a bad manager who reports to and is close with a bad manager… This is as demoralizing for direct reports/peer managers as it sounds. 
• Your Slack experience is highly dependent on which department/team you're a part of e.g. someone in CE or Design is much more likely to report having a far better experience than someone in Marketing or Product, but it also varies highly from team to team within each department. Do your due diligence on the team you're joining.
• The monolith of a codebase has finally caught up to product/engineering. Everyone's heard about the recent weeks' long code freeze but development velocity has indeed slowed to a snail's pace. With more and more large enterprise customers coming in, a rumored IPO, etc,  it's unlikely this will turn around in any substantial way. This is extremely tough if you work in Product/Design/Engineering.
• Slack's culture is ""too nice"" — people tend to be passive-aggressive and avoid difficult conversations/feedback. Poor performers who make it past 3-6 months are almost never managed out. The foundational values of the company like Empathy/Courtesy were well-intentioned but not fully thought out and the consequences can be felt now.
• The reward for doing well is typically being driven to burnout — many high performing employees are barely making it to their 2 or 3 year marks, let alone 4 years or beyond."

Most people genuinely care about the product and what they are working on.  Many projects are bottom up instead of top down, it's a great place to learn and grow.",Being too nice could cause indirect communication and lacking of constructive feedback.
549,Slack,A company succeeding despite itself,2018-11-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are some smart and friendly people in supporting roles at Slack,"Slack is all hype but guaranteed to make some people wildly rich, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
550,Slack,Values-Based Growth,2018-10-30,5.0,Sales,"I have never seen a company so dedicated to its values.  I know, I know, every company has a list of values and principles and claims to live by them blah, blah.  But at Slack, it isn’t really any list of values, so much as it is an implied way of being.  If you are collaborative, respectful, put team first, find creative solutions, the. You will be more successful here.  

In some cultures, that simply isn’t true - over time you get sucked into the grimy, political necessities.  I have seen it, fallen victim to it, and I am never going back. Working at Slack, I feel liberated to to my best work.

Stuart is amazing.  The hype is real.

Finally, I work in Sales, which is often the most competitive dog-eat-dog side of a company.  Not here.  We win together or we don’t win at all.  I know it sounds crazy, but come see for yourself.","Typical growth challenges.

Folks draw a circle around their responsibilities to minimize liability. The company smokes their own product, meaning that they are great because they believe they are great. Management is green and has no clue how to deal with friction within the team or how to motivate people. The product has serious issues, but if you bring them up along with possible solutions, you manager will not be happy and tell you  that these issues are not our concern because a different team is responsible for the feature in question. There is no sense of urgency. The company is very successful, but resting on your laurels is an invitation to competitors to eat your lunch. The product does not scale well on the server-side. The word ""proactive"" is not in anybody's dictionary. We're all waiting for fires to fight. Teams are poorly organized.  Instead of forming small two or three person teams to implement a feature, some people are assigned massive tasks while others are given small  tasks that have to be stretched out to make an appearance of effort. Some teams can have three or four managers in the span of a single year."

Everyone goes out for lunch - the office is dead between 12 and 1. Everyone goes to the weekly happy hour and it's super fun. There is an emphasis on the long-term goals of the company. And the company is willing to work on the hard problems and deliver higher quality product experiences - even if it will take more time and effort.  The company is diverse and values diverse opinions. People are encouraged to be vulnerable, take & give feedback, and constantly improve. The company values individual growth as much as company growth and sees the two as interdependent.",It's an early-ish stage company so some processes and resources are still being developed - I think this is actually a pro disguised as a con bc you get to be a part of those decisions.
566,Slack,Great Team & Transparent Management,2018-07-16,5.0,CE Agent,"- Everyone is happy to help you, but that is also tempered by the ""teach a person to fish,"" philosophy where you look for an answer, first, and then turn to your team if you don't have any luck

- The onboarding process (at least for Customer Experience) is 9 weeks in length so you have lots of time to learn before are fully trained.

- Management at all levels is very supportive and open with communication..giving the ""why"" behind the ""what"" helps to focus everyone on the task(s) at hand.

- The knee-jerk reaction isn't to ""ask the engineers.""  However, the engineering team here is great at assisting with questions or difficulties.

- I have found that most folks will be candid and straight-forward with you rather than giving non-descriptive and indecisive answers.

- When you are at work, you focus on work, but when you are home you can be completely home...you don't feel like you still need to be accessible for work","- The 9 week onboarding process can seem a bit tedious at times

- Pay is a little lower than expected, but the benefits are absolutely fantastic, so that is sort of a wash.

567,Slack,Enterprise Account Executive,2018-07-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's hard to imagine a company with a bigger opportunity in enterprise software than Slack. We’ve paved the way within the workstream collaboration space and the market opportunity has been validated as Microsoft, Google and Cisco build competing products. I feel lucky to sell a product that is genuinely loved by our users. It’s inspiring to see how our customers embrace Slack to transform how they work. We’re fortunate to partner with some of the largest companies in the world. 

  One of the reasons I joined Slack is to help build a unique team and culture, which has been remarkable to be a part of over the past two years as we continue to scale our NYC office. I’m surrounded by driven coworkers who are smart, passionate, and make it fun to come to work.  

As a member of the sales team, it’s reassuring that Slack is aligned across the board to optimize the product-market fit within large organizations – our company strategy and our investment in support roles prove that we’re doing everything we can to accelerate growth.","It can be challenging to go head to head with other tech titans and sell the value of our product when our competition is often free.

570,Slack,Hypergrowth adventure ride,2018-06-26,5.0,Sales,"Slack for me is the best of two worlds: the excitement of a true startup, but with the financial stability of a large company that comes from having hundreds of millions of investment in the bank. This provides an environment of ceaseless forward momentum and opportunity to stretch yourself.
There is not only an opportunity to put your stamp on things, but a necessity, as small teams try to achieve what is normally done by groups ten times their size at other companies. 
In general, your leadership will give you wide latitude and trust to get the job done as you see fit. 
If you are ambitious about your career, Slack is an open road.","Many people feed off the energy of a startup environment. If you don't, however, and instead seek stability and predictability, Slack will probably not be the dream employer for you. As a company that has achieved more in four years than other top tier tech companies have in ten years, change is constant here. 

If you have come from a large company like Google or FB, learning and development will feel different than what you are used to. You will find very little structured, classroom-style learning here, but you will learn on the job through being afforded opportunities to do things you otherwise wouldn't. Some may find this a little daunting."
571,Slack,Fantastic opportunity to build an incredible business,2018-06-06,5.0,Marketing,"Truly incredible opportunity - there are few companies that are growing so quickly, with roles expanding so rapidly along with hefty scope and responsibility for almost anyone who wants to claim it.  Many people now at Slack, and still being hired into Slack, are the first ones to do their particular roles so there is an opportunity to shape and build from the ground up. 

This is not a place for people who want to ""rinse and repeat"". It's a place to solve hard challenges, do things for the first time, and set a precedent going forward.  Slack is a career making opportunity and people on the team know that - it's full of smart people who are energized and motivated to do great work, together.

As a marketer it's also refreshing to work at a tech company that truly values marketing and provides the budget, headcount, and resources to do the job.","We're still figuring things out and that can be painful. Processes can be clunky and difficult, our systems and tools and data haven't kept up with our growth which can impeded the ability to get work done. There are competing priorities and while everyone generally has good intentions, projects can get bogged down in bottlenecks throughout the org.  We don't have a history of ""the way we do things"" which makes work more exciting but also more chaotic - we are not yet the efficient machine we'd like to be."

- the larger more interesting opportunities require a very strange and unpredictable amount of pleasing the right people and not rocking the boat
- do not disagree even cordially with people have been there long enough, you will be punished
- routinely underpay juniors, feel bad for em

Overt favoritism, earned by being a yes man or woman and doing what you're told. The favorites can do ANYTHING they want, while others can do nothing right. 
Zero support from leadership.
Inept, threatened, aggressive leadership with major imposter syndrome. There's nothing to learn from those in charge. In fact, be prepared to teach and then be punished for being ""outspoken.""
Short-term thinking and planning resulting in missed opportunities.
Hiring too many too fast, with overlapping responsibilities. Roles aren't defined well so it's hard to know who does what. Excited new hires are allowed to run with projects without including the right people. Before you know it, you've become redundant.

Great compensation and benefits. 
Interesting problems to solve. 
Stills feel like a startup but that will probably change soon as there are signs that big company culture is on the way.","Slack has a serious culture problem especially in the marketing organization that just grinds people down to a pulp and discards them. 

Marketing leadership has been allowed to drive the morale down of the marketing team. The marketing organization is a hot bed of opaque transparency, silencing tactics, favoritism,  unannounced informal demotions, bullying tactics including just deciding to stop inviting key people to meetings, silent treatment and coverups, poor operational procedure, lack of vision, lack of insight into decision making with with no oversight from our CEO. The culture amp survey scores for the entire org are in material decline, and there is a consistent show of sloppy vision from the top that keeps marketing operations in a state of confusion with constantly blown scopes and massively off track projects, thrashing and things changing every other week. Attrition is bad people who don't get bullied out of the organization are starting to leave on their own accord.

The People Org has watched all of this go on and it continues to happen with seemingly very few alarm bells being rung . The morale of the marketing organization is in serious decline and many key figures have gone missing with very little explanation. Leadership has been allowed to run amuck and people are too paralyzed by unchecked power and are too fearful to disagree  because they know the consequences—their careers. There is no recourse for you if you are a victim of leaderships quick disposal of you. Everyone in the organization sees this pattern and it is an open secret. 

The marketing organization has been tasked with a lot of meaningful company goals and the insecure, inhumane, bullying tactics are going to be the make or break in the entire team’s success. There are very talented people on the team and talented people have been forced out if they pose a threat or challenge leadership. Making a mistake can ruin your career.  At the top of the organization  is leadership is only  about itself and its career aspirations and it does not care about who it has to step on, ruin or use to get there as long it keeps favor in our CEO's eyes."

Yes, it's true... if you close a $1M deal, you will only get paid about $30K before taxes.  

It's unclear whether this is a CEO driven philosophical shift in not rewarding the revenue generators of the company or whether it's because Slack sales mgmt has come from non-enterprise sales roles at companies or channels where they have historically underpaid sales people (ie. DropBox, SFDC Commercial/SMB, LinkedIn etc)... but it's become a shock that has rippled through our sales org at the cost productivity. It's demoralizing, distracting, and disappointing, especially for the newer sales hires who were misled to believe they'd be able to make real money."

The people at Slack are very emphatic and help you when you need it. Oh yeah, free  weekly massages are pretty awesome.",Tough deadlines can be stressful at times. Slack doesn't have catered food all days of the week (Maybe in the future :thinkingFace:). Some teams definitely have more work to do than others.

- There is constant discussion among all employees about how we 'do that right thing'. That looks different for everyone, but I appreciate that there is always an open dialogue around the decisions we make across the whole company
- Experience managers/leadership. This isn't their first rodeo.
- Diversity matters here and is openly discussed
- I am able to focus on my work and I know that Slack will do right by me (comp, benefits, culture, work/life balance, etc.)

-Feels like I'm working with experienced adults which is refreshing for a tech company
-Incredible focus on diversity and inclusion in our work environments, teams, and hiring efforts 
-Lots of room to build and scale various projects, initiatives, and and processes","-Not necessarily a con, but we're noticeably more budget conscious than your average tech company which can feel surprising if you come from a company with free meals, onsite gym, and enough free company shirts to outfit your wardrobe. As a shareholder I'm happy this money goes into other parts of the business and all the pros and other benefits of working at Slack outweigh these more minor perks."
592,Slack,Favorite job of my career so far,2017-10-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Smart, empathetic coworkers who share values and motivation, feeling that you're making or growing something special that's really changing the way people work together, great perks that aren't too ostentatious, friendly to working parents, older average age so you're working with grownups, tolerance and/or support for creative experimentation, big equity potential.","Fast growth that makes consistency across departments hard to maintain, need to fill positions has led to some hasty hiring of people who turn out not to work out, leadership has genuinely great intentions that in some cases seem to be a challenge to follow through on."

597,Slack,Slack Is the Best Place I've Ever Worked,2017-10-19,5.0,Program Manager,"My coworkers are some of the smartest, most driven folks I've ever worked with. Working with them means I'm on my toes to do the best work I've ever done, while also looking for ways to help them be at the top of their game. I've been incredibly impressed by everyone from individual contributors all the way up to our exec team.

The story we tell externally is true -- I've never worked in a job where the things I learned about during the application process (both directly from employees and in reading articles, blog posts, etc) were an accurate representation of what working for the company is like. People treat each other well, we are invested in our mission, and working here is intellectually rewarding.

Best of all, everyone who works at Slack truly has the opportunity to impact the trajectory of the company. I see how my work directly impacts what we do and I see it in the work of my colleagues.","Nothing in life is perfect, but there's not much I'd change about Slack. While I could say that we work hard, I see that as a positive and hard means intellectually challenging, not mindlessly difficult. I'm genuinely impressed with how this place works together!"
598,Slack,Slack,2017-10-19,2.0,,"- You'll meet some amazing people here 
- Free meals, snacks, drinks, beer on tap, and onsite baristas
- Great CEO who truly cares about the people working at Slack","- You will meet some very entitled people who complain that all the free food and drinks aren't good enough.  Constant demands for catering to their allergies or sensitivities rather than just bringing their own food. Everything needs to be catered to them.
- Constant temperature war. One person is too cold and demands the heat to turn on, one person is too hot, demands the AC on. Bring layers to this office. 
- Some employees are disrespectful to security guards, cleaners, and anyone else they see as beneath them. 
- Racism 
- Managers who do not fit the slack culture (screaming at their team members, insulting them, promoting toxic culture, etc.)  but were hired because they have more experience than anyone on the team. 
- If you want to WFH, you'll be guilted/shamed into coming into the office 
- Does not pay as well as other companies 
- Have heard from others of their negative reviews on glassdoor disappearing 

Your experience at Slack really depends on your manager and team. You can have an amazing supportive team that truly believes and promotes Slack's message, or you have an awful demeaning manager that promotes a toxic culture."

The company culture promotes hard work, integrity, and performance. The employee base is made up of all stars, so it's a good environment for those who want to  learn and grow","The down side of such fast growth is that there is a lack of process in a lot of areas, including formal professional development programs. I suspect this will change over time."
607,Slack,Account Executive,2017-10-18,5.0,Account Executive,"-Amazing culture (fun, challenging, interesting, great learning environment)

-Incredible product (we use it 24/7 and become experts on it. Everyone wants to learn about it!)

-Great perks (generous gym/travel reimbursement, catered lunches, etc.)

-High degree of interaction with senior decision makers (both internally and at customer accounts)","-Still working out some kinks with sales processes and tools- sales is still a relatively new role at Slack

- Intelligent, but more importantly, empathetic people

- Company is pretty open and transparent
- Management is supportive and easy to approach
- Hyper growth
- Office facilities is nice","The standard is high for everything, so expect long hours sometimes. I wish they serve lunch and dinner. Since everyone is working so hard, it'd be nice to not have to think about what to eat. People tend to skip meals when too focused on work."
610,Slack,Slack is the best,2017-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Slack is full of smart, genuine, and dedicated people who are driven to provide value to the customer, and make the best product. Our values are the best that I've ever seen in my ~15 year career, and I am proud to be a part of this company.",I don't have any cons to date.
611,Slack,Best place I have ever worked,2017-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Managed from the top-down with thoughtfulness and compassion. High emphasis on doing our best work and then doing something personally fulfilling with our downtime. The benefits are unbelievably excellent; I've never felt so cared for by a workplace.,Its rapid growth means that personal adaptability is greatly required – the development staffing needs change regularly and it seems we can lose good people in the shuffling.
612,Slack,Customer Success,2017-10-18,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"I've been at Slack for a year and I have to say, it's been one of the best! It's incredible working for a Company who values their employees as much as Slack. Plus, Customers love the product and are wonderful to work with! It's a very fast paced environment full of change, so the opportunities to have impact and to grow are huge.","Nothing really stands out except the usual growing pains of a hyper growth company.

613,Slack,Fantastic vision and place to work,2017-10-18,5.0,Customer Success Manager,Shared  excitement and vision for the future of work. Really transparent organization!,Lots of transition and kinks to work out as we've gotten larger very quickly. However leadership is aware of it and focused on what matters - employees and the bottom line (in that order).
614,Slack,"The best company I've worked for, but not without flaws",2017-10-17,5.0,Staff Engineer,"- The people are not only talented, but among the most thoughtful, inquisitive, and kind I've had the privilege of working with
- There's True Belief in the product and its ability to change the way people work, backed up by customer testimonials
- A support-focused culture that takes joy in delighting people in small ways: responding to tweets with a bug fix ready, a topical gif, etc.
- Clever, pragmatic executives that are engaged and understand the product deeply
- One of the most racially diverse tech companies in San Francisco; very liberal, with a social justice bent
- Very little churn at the employee and executive levels","- In its race to become a Serious Enterprise Business, it's starting to lose some of the whimsy and quirkiness that got it to where it is.
- Those acclimated to a data-driven, CS Fundamentals Engineering culture will find things a little lax here; pragmatism is the law of the land and some shortcuts have been taken.
- Ratio of junior to senior engineers is higher here than elsewhere, resulting in ample stress for the senior engineers as they try to manage technical debt. For the juniors, the result is fewer opportunities for mentorship and a feeling of floundering without a life vest.
- The ""no whiteboards"" interview policy is great, but sometimes translates to a ""no technical challenges"" interview depending on the panel, and that can (and has) lowered the bar."
615,Slack,Amazing Company,2017-10-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I love Slack's focus on people. This manifests both in the focus we place on our customers - taking customer service really seriously, responding to every tweet, focusing on building delightful experiences - but also in how we treat each other as employees and coworkers. There is a level of respect and courtesy that is really special and leads to a really inclusive and supportive working environment. 

I also appreciate the balance that Slack provides. It's an enterprise software company that has a deep focus on building a human experience. It's a start up that values work life balance. We're passionate about what we're doing, but also realistic and levelheaded.","There are downsides to working at startups, but with that comes the opportunity to build something from the start."

-Nice sense of team camaraderie - plenty of team bonding events, CEO is very accessible, upper management takes time to get to know everyone (not just by name). 
- Despite being a younger company without the benefits of ""structured"" development plans, it is apparent that managers care about the career trajectory of employees, and how to bring out the best in each person. 
-The general climate is not loud, and people are truly empathetic and respectful of the shared space. Strong, CEO supported effort to ensure that everyone is valued, regardless of function (none of the engineers vs sales or contractors vs FTE   etc etc politics that can occur).","- Company is growing very fast. It's an exciting time, but that also means that the future state could be very different than the environment today. It is definitely a challenge to maintain the quality as the company scales.
- Not the place to be if you need a lot of direction or cannot handle ambiguity. Also not the place to be if you are easily frustrated, as the pace of work and of the ""asks"" changes often. The project you are working on needed to be done yesterday, and when you do finish it today, there is a chance that people are already moved on to the next thing or want done differently. 
- Might be challenging at lower levels if you are not young/ flexible with work hours. People love what they do, and will work to get ""it"" done, which can mean longer than typical ""tech"" days. The average age of employees is also low, but that is almost de riguer at younger tech companies today."

This is especially prevalent at the senior/mid-manager level (along with a few notable executive hires as well). As a result, several departments have developed toxic cultures, leading to a host of employee departures.  Attrition in the past few months has been particularly abysmal, with many key employees leaving or on their way out the door.  While some of the turnover and change is normal for a fast-growing company, Slack's cultural issues go past anything most of us have seen in our careers."

+ Very customer- and employee-centric
+ Smartest people I've ever worked with and some of the most humble as well
+ Exceptional learning & development opportunities
+ Great pay","- Whatever Stewart says goes. He has genius ideas and high standards (a good thing), but it leaves management with little autonomy and can cause slow downs/sudden changes in priorities. This may have gotten better as the company has grown.
- A lot of people were really sad to see Bill Macaitis go. Very different values and POV came in with the new marketing lead. A lot of people have left since that transition. 
- Started out with the noble intent to hire authentic, empathic people who wanted to be part of a movement vs climb in their career. Those people are leaving or getting pushed out and more traditional enterprise B2B folk are taking their place. 
- Not accepting of politically conservative people. Even centrist left-wingers can feel uncomfortable there."

As I'm returning to management after a long hiatus doing IC work, I've taken advantage of the chance to refresh my skills. My direct supervisor is a fantastic mentor, Slack is a truly transparent workplace, and the Learning & Development team offers a terrific and evolving curriculum to support leaders at every skill level.

You can really feel how big of an opportunity there is here and for those who like building something great, there will be a ton of room for growth.","This is a high growth environment so employees needs to be ok with being flexible and creating the play book as we create a fairly new market.

660,Slack,An ego free zone,2017-04-18,5.0,Manager,"There are so many! Yes there are the cool things like great offices, treats like massages and great food. The real pros for me is that the quality of my working life has fundamentally changed. Gone are the days of battling through hundreds of emails before even starting the day. Communicating using Slack is, dare I say it, fun!! I feel truly valued here, it is such a high support environment. My team are amazing and we constantly help each other be better. 
One of the main things I noticed when I started at Slack was a complete lack of ego. People with big egos, or a 'look at me, I'm great' approach to working, aren't successful at Slack. We thrive on collaboration.","The only con for me is timezone, I would love to be able to have more real time with my North America and APAC colleagues, but everyone is very mindful of those challenges"
661,Slack,"Love it here, don't see myself leaving.",2017-04-17,5.0,Senior Software Developer,"I joined Slack as a Senior Software Engineer working on mobile in late 2014 when there were about 70 employees. Now, 2.5 years later, there are over 700 (maybe even 800?). Scaling a company that rapidly is chaotic and challenging, but having worked at other places who came out of that process with a bad culture and poor management, I continue to be impressed with the thoughtful way Slack management has scaled the company. Not every decision that's been made has been correct, but my experience has been that management is very open to feedback and willing to iterate on processes or change them completely when we can see that they aren't working.
One thing we are known for outside the company is diversity & inclusion, and my personal experience has been very positive in that regard, though as a white woman my perspective is limited.
We do compensation audits and adjustments every 6 months, both market rate adjustments as well as performance based raises, and I've been very happy with that process. Hard to be mad about getting a raise every 6 months without having to ask for it.
The work life balance has been in my experience excellent. On the walls it says ""work hard and go home"" and throughout the 4 managers I've had in my time here I have never felt pressured to work late or work weekends to meet a deadline. We've responded to missed deadlines with retrospectives about our planning and estimation process, rather than blaming engineers or anyone else. 
There's a lot more I could talk about, but I hope this is a helpful glimpse into what it's like working here. My experience isn't universal, and as an earlier employee I probably have some measure of privilege that I can't see clearly at the moment, but I see myself here for years to come and can't imagine leaving unless there are dramatic changes in management (like if Stewart and Cal left).","Because of how fast we have been growing, it can get a little chaotic sometimes. There have been projects that have been 95% complete and then changed by management at the last moment, causing frustration and extra work for engineers. We are still learning how to most effectively communicate at this scale.
There can sometimes be a tendency to be self-congratulatory for how, compared to other tech companies, we are more diverse etc. This is called out pretty rapidly when it happens, as it should be because we have a lot of work to do still. 
As management has said before internally, Slack Is A Distracting Menace. Working at a company full of Slack power users means that it can be hard to get work done without developing excellent focus skills."

The exec team is in this for the long-haul and they're fully values driven. Things are not political.","As the fastest growing B2B software company ever, growth expectations are incredibly high. As a company we're still figuring out goal-setting, because we're still relatively new and growing so fast. This can make it challenging to benchmark performance."

-Cool CEO","-Fakeness in culture is starting to show. There is no explicit rule that you have to use emoji in messages or smile all the time, but your colleagues will judge you negatively if you don't. If you're having a bad day, be sure to add those emoji in your messages and fake a smile so no one knows you're human.
-I've seen a lot of code. The code here is by far the worst
-Opportunity to learn weird non industry standard practices
-Weakest middle management
-For a place that creates a product that allows working remotely easier, it's surprisingly frowned upon. They won't say anything, but they will judge you.
-You tell your manager something that bothers you/something on your mind and there will be no action. You'll be lucky to hear back.
-Compensation is on the lower side. Slack knows that it's Slack and people want to work here because of the hot product. They don't negotiate much because they know you want them more badly than they want you. (guilty)"
672,Slack,The best job I've ever had. Hands down.,2017-02-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- True, meaningful benefits
- Opportunity, not just as an individual contributor, but as an organization. We're solving interesting problems and are redefining the way people work and communicate every single day. It's nuts.
- Leadership is incredible. These are people who have storied careers and know what it takes for a company to be successful in the long term. Decisions make sense. There really is transparency, which is a word a lot of Silicon Valley companies throw around but don't actually honor, and accessibility. You can DM or approach any of our C-level executives with anything and actually get a thoughtful response. Again, it's nuts. 
- People care about each other so much. SO much. I've never had so many people invested in seeing me grow and succeed, people who aren't even on my team or even members of my organization. Like... what? How do they even know who I am?
- There's actual work life balance. It's another thing that a lot of companies tout, but Slack means it when they say they want you to work hard and go home. People have families and hobbies and gym memberships and friends and none of that has to go by the wayside or be sacrificed in favor of putting in 12 hours at their desks. 
- My coworkers humble and inspire me every day. These are multitalented, accomplished, brilliant folks, some of whom are truly thought leaders, and I feel so fortunate to have the opportunity to work alongside them. I can't stress enough how much I've learned.
- I'm happy. Like, for real happy. Obviously people have bad days and there's no such thing as paradise on earth, but for the first time in my career I'm okay with getting out of bed in the morning.","- We've outgrown HQ and are spread across a few properties in San Francisco. It's a bummer not having everyone under one roof, but this is something folks are aware of and are working to remedy."

-Some of the leadership is a little under-qualified, and it shows.

678,Slack,The Ride of Your Life,2016-05-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,This has been a a review I've been debating to write for a very long time. Slack is great for so many reasons. There are wonderful people here and people that really challenge you to be the best you can be. It is a place where you can be scrappy and explore your role. It is a place where you could feel very valued. It is a place that is very appealing b/c of how well the business overall is doing.,"Now for the bad. 

I can't even keep track of the number of bad days I've had at Slack. This review is not for the company at a whole, but for a specific department. You are extremely over worked and under appreciated. You get threatened that you'll get fired or put on a pip, you never know when you need to tip toe around something or if you should be assertive and make decisions. You get blamed for every mistake, and are criticized for not being the most cheerful and positive person on the planet. You get yelled at and you will cry. You will share your feelings with your colleagues, and they will stab you in the back. You will try to open up, and see that those messages have been shared with someone else. All in all, this is a stressful, emotional and political place to be. A lot of changes have been made recently, and maybe there is hope at the end of the tunnel."
679,Slack,Amazing product but starting to get a little political,2015-11-17,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Slack is a high-velocity, awesomely creative, friendly place to work, and one of the best jobs I've had. Truly inspired by the dedication to the product and proud to say I'm an employee. I really enjoy: great engineering talent, well-reasoned decisions, a multitude of perks and good balance of right brained thinkers. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us and we're still in the building phase of the company so there is a lot to do and learn professionally and personally.","Scaling fast is exciting, but experiencing some growing pains along the way. A key leader is being irresponsible with use of power and introducing Yahoo-like politics. I believe some teams suffer from this more than others."
