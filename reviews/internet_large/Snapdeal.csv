15,Snapdeal,Honest and not a forced positive review,2022-02-24,3.0,,"Flexible timings are the best thing and when on site, no one records the number of hours spent in office.","1. Employees especially in the data science department are over worked and reach their saturation point real quick.

2. Micro management (they tell you to make an excel where you write what you are doing and update it constantly everyday)

3. An analyst is forced to handle 3-4 tasks going on simultaneously and expected to deliver at 1-2 hours of notice.

4. Work can come at 8pm after you have shut your laptop and they expect you to deliver during the same day itself. (You somehow deliver the huge analysis and the next day ur manager tells you he has not done anything with the data and told you to add more stuff to it, so he can send it later on the next day)

5. Only sql and excel is used 99% of the time. (No
python,tableau,power Bl,etc if someone wants to learn)

6. No respect and dignity shown to the employees, they are treated as objects.

 7. The best thing is that an analyst does everything but actual analysis."

Upper management lacks spine and follow his stupid plans. He lacks rationality and business knowledge hence lots of pilot projects will be run which will bring no results. Post covid situation and working environment has gone down the hill.  They have this CRM tool which is basically journal like thing where you are supposed to enter what work you have done on daily basis. What ppl you have called, what discussion you had on call, what email you have done, what products you have added to assortment, etc etc and this thing goes on and on. You have know idea what micro management is unless you work in business team at Snapdeal.

No clear direction from upper management and lack of vision creates more confusion. Many good people have voluntarily resigned since Vikas Bhasin has been appointed. It's not too far when Snapdeal will go bankrupt because of their foolish decisions.

They created a culture of snoopers, making it impossible to productively work with my subordinates. 

- Director & above do not take accountability of non - performance and retain their high paying jobs, by only building paper models/targets. They themselves have no field experience to prove their credibility to lead, as they never had market solutions to recover from falling numbers. 

- Company had no understanding of the market and the future. Build unrealistic expectations from the team setting up talented members for failure and finally exiting them from their jobs, without giving enough time to find another job.

The work-environment for tech team is also good.","NO LONGER A STARTUP CULTURE: I have been in SD for around 2 years and has seen how Snapdeal is loosing its appeal as a startup company and becoming for a company that is run via Twitter, emails, media etc.

MASSIVE AND POOR HIRING:The management is completely directionless here. They hired ~400 campus recruits for this year without proper estimation. This ultimately lead to huge inflow of people in teams beyond their requirements.  The result is that everybody is frustrated. In most of the teams, hardly 1-2 out of 10 actually work. Moreover their hiring standards have become questionable.

NO VISION: No new major feature or product is in pipeline. Although everybody is busy reporting bugs to show their presence, no-body is taking initiative to improve the UI experience as whole. For. e.g although everybody is reporting bug in price change , no body is asking to have a message on screen for better UX. 

I have not heard even a single word from CPO and CTO about their vision for SD and how they plan to take things forward.

BLAME-GAME AND POLITICS: Teams are busy in passing the buck rather than taking the ownership. The current system is still in messy shape. There are redundant systems all around but no body is coming forward to clean it. They rather prefer to stay idle.

NO PLANNING: PM just keeps on adding releases and features which ultimately never go live. Loyalty points is one that I can remember.

UNEVEN APPRAISAL:  Some teams have gotten huge appraisal even though their system remains in pathetic state. And some teams even though

Even though it is 5 days working don't be surprised if you are called on Saturdays to work.
They even ask you to work on a festive holiday. Majority of the Team leaders in the on boarding team don't do anything except prepare report and buy stuff online the whole day. No words of motivation from them but yes you might get a threatening for taking a leave even if you are ill. PIP is like abundant here.. Team Leaders threaten you with PIP all the time. You will be forced to sit in the office for long hours if you have not completed the daily target.

2. Not a place to work for experienced professionals looking to make a world-class product, please dont come, youll regret it and degrade 3. your excellence on the side.
4. No respect for tech employees ( No wondered Amitab Mishra, the former Technology Head left, or was made to leave, who knows )
5. Callous attitude of HR towards employees
6. Same policies ( read appraisal process & appraisal percentage & other benefits ) from a Call Centre employee to a Principle Engineer.
7. Office politics at senior level ( ego clashes between Engineering Managers ) leading to redundant projects. Hence you cant be sure if your project / module will see daylight or not.
8. Stress on feature development and not on taking a project to maturity.
9. Firefighting post project release is a norm and is deemed normal ( No wonder this site doesnt function properly under load)
10. Blame-game is a norm
11. Company can change cities without taking opinion of their 4000 strong employee strength. Today its Delhi, tomorrow its Gurgaon, who knows what can come after.
12. Disparity in salary within the same ranks.
13. Official statement from HR when confronted over higher salaries in Bangalore is : ""Delhi employees dont have any place to switch to hence we pay them lesser"". Talk about taking unfair advantage.
14. Sub-standard salary if compared to worthy competitors ( read Flipkart, Amazon )
15. No belongingness in employees towards the company.
16. Only managers and their faviurites get an Apple Mac or a monitor, hence disparity within tech team as well.
17. Stress on long deep disucssions. If you are a senior ( Senior Software Engineer or above ) most of your time will go into discussions, where you will discuss if weather you should write 3 extra lines of code ( literally micro-discussion for 3 lines of code ) or let go of a feature altogether.
18. Unprofessional HR.
19. Rumors travel faster than official communication.


Advice to someone considering Snapdeal :
If you are new to technology or dont have an awsome experience , go ahead and join. Learn enjoy have fun, coz really nobody bothers if you dnt make an awsome product. If it works your good to go.
If you are experienced and good in your field, I would advice you to instead take a month or two off and get find some other opportunity. Atleast youll study a bit and improve, rather than decay here."

3.  Hr strictly given commands to write nice review in glassdoor.
4 Some of your peers would be given huge amount of salary as compared to you with you doing bulk of the work.
4 No training/process.
5. Attrition rate is amazingly high with actaully day you are replying to ""Last Day"" mails .
6 Advice to New Joinees : Don't Join you would be ruining your careers.","1.Staying in the company for longer run would actually degrade your skill levels and you would find your self at the same scale technologically and sometimes lower then what you started with . 
2.There is nothing new,innovative or even average . Whole Technology team is below average and this is due to culture foster upon by senior management
3.Age old technolgies like tomcat,spring,hibernate . I mean peers laugh when you discuss Technology stack of snapdeal with them .
4.Leadership is utterly ill competitive to handle day to day tasks and have created a culture of ""trying to stay in good books "". You do that and don't do any work . You would be promoted to Lead.
5 Hell Bent favouritism on front end teams(Front end java developers) with highest appraisal given to them which is killing innovation .This shows logical comprehension of Leaadership.
6 People think that they are doing out of this world work but in reality nothing but a simple mundane product development tasks.
7 98 % of team is new and no people remain here for more than 6 months . People who also generally remains have other plans and they treat this as stop gap arrangements.
8  Out of turm promotions for below average people who just have links with senior technology management.

Not so many pros..","They always do and this time too they have delayed the distribution of appraisal letters by couple of months.  HR department here is too irresponsible to take care of the most important process of the year. Due to this, lot of good talented people have left and will be leaving. HR doesn’t even care about the attrition rate. I believe in the saying ""Justice delayed is justice denied"". 
Apart from the delay in appraisal process, they are unable to maintain the salary parity within a team. People with same or less workex/knowledge who joins later are getting more salaries than people already working in that team.  This shows company doesn't pay to loyal employees. Staying here for longer period will make you lag behind from market standards in terms of compensation.
There are no additional benefits/perks provided to the employees other than salary. Infrastructure is also less than the average. Don’t even have a decent cafeteria.  People density on the floor is too much and it’s so noisy out here.   You won’t get to work and concentrate in a peaceful environment.

I am in this organization from last around one year and have been informed from old folks that this is an usual affair in the organization from at-least past two years and last year this was delayed by three long months. HR introduced a very slow software which is pain in each employee's head. However, the system is still not complete, but HR got appraised 2Q before.
It seems that management / HR have their hidden vested interests for delaying the appraisal cycle.

Would like to ask some questions:

- Why HR is so helpless in such a so called India's fastest moving organization?
- Why founder duo not so aggressive in achieving this easy goal, as they are for other over ambitious business goals and do everything to achieve those goals?
- Why founders cannot raise a concern to the responsible for this delay and get this done on time as they chase other business goal? Or they are even helpless or this delay is their will?

Is this is a least important goal for founders and higher management in the organization?  Well yeah its true, there will be arrears given, but what about timeliness? Will that be agreeable to meet the sales target after a Q?
The other false reason that not all have completed their review process should not be a reason for the delay for those who spent their time and completed the process on time respecting the given timeline.

Now the question to the founders is  if you cannot have this internally managed goal get done on time for your employees how you'll get the organization's goal completed with their help.

Forget about other lacking employee benefits in so called over hyped India's leading mobile e-com organization, but at-least appraisal should be on time for which employees work hard for the whole year and as a collective efforts of all those,  organization's growth reached to 500% from last year.

You may want to hold your pace for a while and give a thought to this valid concern."

1267,Snapdeal,Fast paced culture with good career growth,2014-01-25,5.0,Senior Manager,"I joined Snapdeal last year, honestly not expecting what I was getting into given I came from a top tier consulting firm. But I was pretty tired with making powerpoints and wanted a ""real"" job. So, here is my assessment over the last year:

Irrespective of how smart you are, you will find people who are really smart and committed to what they do. But good thing is that no one makes a big deal of that, so the environment is pretty genial.

For a 1000+ strong company, the company does a pretty good job of keeping everyone at all levels on the same page in terms of the company's near term goals. So, as an employee, you don't feel left out or lost or have existential questions about why you are doing what you are doing.

Finally, from my perspective, and this is something many of my colleagues who come from a similar top tier engineering + MBA background also feel, there is a feeling of challenge that I didn't feel when I would come to work at my prior consulting job. Before joining here I didn't think I would be in a situation reasonably often when I really had to rack my brain for answers.","Given the company is very aggressive about the pace it wants to move at, there is still a scrappy start-up feel to the company, which means there may not be the same structured approach to HR and the perks that one has at the top tier consulting type firms may be missing such as lots of free team dinners and drinks, offsites, abroad travel at least once a year, etc. But then again, that is a choice you have to make. I am pretty content with giving up the mega perks in return for high intensity learning."
1268,Snapdeal,A company on a Mission!,2014-01-22,5.0,Category Manager,"1. Have a clear vision and are willing to bet everything on it (like moving to a marketplace before anyone else thought that was a good idea)

2. Fearlessness. It doesn't seem to matter to the senior team as to how much money who has. They focus on a strategy that plays to their strengths and then execute like mad.

3. The senior team sets a great example for everyone else. They work as hard/harder than others at any level in the company.

4. Open, receptive culture. You can walk up to your manager or drop an email to the founders and they will make time.

5. I feel proud telling my family and friends that I work at Snapdeal","Need more space. Given the rapid growth, some of the planning of office infrastructure was not top notch, but it seems to be getting better now in some of the new office that the company has taken up."

S --- Sensible, Co-operative and very decent Senior Managers.
N --- New Technologies to Learn
A --- Ample to talented managers and senior staff (who never shout and harasses their junior staff)
P --- Plenty of things to do
D --- Decent Atmosphere to work

L --- Level of high thinking","There are cons in every company but people should also look the positive side of the company. There are always 2 side of the coin but people always look at the worst side this is the mental problem of the employees who thinks like this. People expect so much from the company and when they did not get they feel bad.

Senior management are educated, talented and very co-operative in this company. Never seen shouting and harassing any junior employees. Pressure is there in every company we are there to work and suppose to work."
1273,Snapdeal,Yay as a job! Nay as a career!,2013-09-21,3.0,Engineer,"Decent money, Good quality work if you want to work.","There have been so many reviews of Snapdeal's technical team, some really bad, some really good. I guess both do not give the true picture and both are biased in their own ways.

1. The work load of technical team here is quite unbalanced, where some people are slogging themselves and some are sitting pretty and frankly they can not be blamed because that is the expectations of the upper management. 

2. Mostly Knowing the right people is the key to succeed here, not doing the right thing.

3. In the technical team, if you want to get hired, here is a tip for you. ""I dont code"", ""Coding is against my religion"", ""I am more of an architecture guy"" are the kind of phrases actually get you hired here. 

4. That is the reason that some people are sitting pretty while junior employees are doing most of the work. and thus the dissatisfaction by them and high satisfaction by seniors.

5. I think Snapdeal's tech team lost touch with reality a long back, that for technically sound product good people need to write good code. But no, here mediocre code is written by freshers who do not know any better and all the seniors are assuming more ""responsible"" roles i.e. fighting with product teams, procrastinating on issues till death, doing the almost always inconclusive, no concrete action plan, I am the best sort of ""brain-storming"" sessions etc.

6. Due to these problems, a could've been a technical power horse, a team of 150 able youngsters has turned into a mediocre bureaucracy where it is too much to keep the site up and running to do any innovation unlike any great company like Amazon etc.

7. And yes, as for the girls here: The gender ratio is pretty decent. I think it is a good thing for guys and girls. Girls, you will not be singled out here. But yes, you will have to put up with some rude behavior and pan shop like abuses. These elements are fringe, but yes there will be no action against them. 

Final advice: It is a good company if you want to have a job for a year or two. come here, learn, get good money, do some good work and leave. Come here with the spirit of ""Na sammaan ki chaah, na apmaan ka bhay!"""

Few unprofessional practices which I have seen in such a short time includes internal parties of tech team which are conducted by freshers money and management or HR is not involved at all. The internal group of employees who conduct this party ask for a huge amount from your salary and if you refuse then you are pressurized by many senior people that you cannot socialize with the senior people and other peers."

Recently many people in the company contracted dengue .6(and count is increasing.) 
This is what the HR(Technology) fathoms for it.

1.
They gave allout(hence OMG in title) machines (1 machine/team )to VIP per team i.e for every team having in order of 15-20 people spread across equal number of desks, all out Machine was given to be put behind cpu cabinet of those VIPS(1 per team) according to some weird logic that fumes originating would encompass whole team.(Even i am ashamed to write such thiings here but this is fact) 

2. Get your own spray bottle and use odomos and evry other silliest thing( This is with-in premise of the company->floor->sitting bay.)

3. HR(Technology) people have turned into MR(Mosquito resource) :)lol

4. HR(Technology) get yourself some worthiness in the company .seriosiously

5. Late appraisal by 3 months with each day you being told that it would happen today.



Ground Realities -: 
1 .People are leaving this company ,Even new people who have just joined are leaving within week of joining. 
2. No Place/chair to sit (Your are sitting in desk for 3-4 months) and one fine morning somebody else is sitting in your seat then you came to know that some lousy one has changed sitting plan without even having indemnity of informing teams in advance.
3.People have to pay for themselves in team lunch.
4.Super Seniors who are from starting don't fo any work just blaberring around .I am pretty much sure they wouldn't have written a single line of code in their lifetime.
5. So by chance if they do write code its such BAKWASS that after reading you would have to give your self some time to laugh about that in your heart or it would stop beating.
6. Attrition rate in the company is amazingly High (Technology 3 every week average.)

Celebration time-:
Nothing is celebrated in the company but for for some stupid fakily achieved milestones and even in that you are just invited so that you may clap yourself around .



Some senior positon people in (various team the decison maker) are so sheepish for their job that they dont know why they exist in the company or what their job should be . They are just for licking management soles and making life tough for creative people in their team . They would even agree for them to be not human if management told them to believe so ."

from personal experience.

4. Overly brimming with confidence and self esteem and pride (next big thing).

5. Every work of them is failure which is utterly hidden from everyone and whatever they take credit for is most probably done by someone else basically who lacks contacs and networking skills.

6. Attitude of get in line and give respect instead of commanding it through work .

7 Some of the management people from tech and product have given different name to respecting one's work v/s fulfilling friendship vows .

8. Senior management people are afraid to take stand against such people for approvalship from them coz they know some big wig in the company atleast that what it seems.

9. First rejecting ideas then stealing them and presenting them as their braniac inventions .

10 Every meeting how they are this and that ,tons of code and what they have done. But you tell them to show their code and thats when meeting ends:).

11 OMG their so called observations of market trends and what would happen in future . I invite everyone to be part of it and decide yourself.
