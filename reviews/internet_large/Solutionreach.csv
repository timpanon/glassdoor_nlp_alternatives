I did everything that they asked of me and they fired me for following their directions to a T. it was a sales competition for a job that was described as a CSR position. in the interview they said there were no sales requirement for the job and that I would not be doing sales and yet they made me do sales anyways.

-Haven't received a raise in 1.5 years, was promised a year ago that would change. My co-workers and I have continually pressed on this issue and received excuses while others receive promotions.
-lack of organization and leadership oversight. Sales gets a customer by overpromising on features, then everyone scrambles until that client goes live with the product. Lots of stress.
-we've lost so many of our devs, and our product and turn- around time on bugs shows it and our customers notice.
-problems with toxic co-workers creating a hostile work environment."

8,Solutionreach,Solutions just out of reach,2021-08-31,1.0,Engineer,Nice people with good senses of humor about how terrible the company is to work for.,"Many moons ago I started at Solutionreach. I was excited, and for a time I was happy... then the purge happened. Our fearless leaders were cast aside in favor of new blood, with new fangled ideas to revitalize a still moderately successful company. Ironically, it was these investments and decisions that destroyed what was once cherished. Solutionreach hadn't even fully reached its first solution before trying for a second. If you can imagine a person standing precariously on an aluminum ladder, reaching out in two directions trying to get an apple from two different tree branches, you would have an accurate depiction of what happened and is continuing to happen at Solutionreach.

Perks were slashed. Culture was poisoned by fear of impending layoffs (or re-orgs, if you subscribe to business speak) that tended to happen around Christmas time. Each worker's potential was stifled by an overarching sense that it was only by Solutionreach's benevolent grace that we were even employed in the first place. People were passed over for well-deserved promotions and raises and promised ""maybe in six months,"" ""maybe next round of promotions"", ""maybe when this other employee is promoted you can fill their spot.""

Essentially working for SR is like being in a toxic relationship. There are a few good times here and there, mostly provided by the comradery with your coworkers, followed by long droughts where you just hope against hope that things will get better. Eventually pretty much everyone I enjoyed working with and respected got frustrated enough to leave, and we're all happier for it. I dare say that one of the happiest days of my life was the day that I walked out of that building knowing I would never go back."

That did not last.","Half way through it went down extremely fast. From unnecessary strict changes of workspaces to closed off management. It felt like we were in some sort of Gulag; always under extreme scrutiny, closely micromanaged, constant feeling of being watched, and people losing their jobs with no notice because new outside management decided their team/department was unnecessary without even knowing anything about it. They even held a meeting to show us we were intentionally being paid below industry standard because we ""got perks that make up for it like free soda and donuts on Tuesday mornings"". Also implemented an unreasonable attendance policy stating if you were 1 minute late 3 times in a 6 month period you would be fired."

Some say that's the world of sales, but when managers aren't trying to be good leaders how can they direct their organization to success?

They say they promote from within, but I rarely saw any internal promotion. They primarily fired and hired new people to higher positions, or left long time employees to stagnate.

Pay isn't very competitive, especially with the poor commission and bonus schedule for SDR's

29,Solutionreach,Terribly managed company,2021-01-18,1.0,Territory Sales Representative,"Training, corporate office, potential, that’s about it.",Flew new hires out to Utah to train us. Promptly eliminated the entire outside sales staff.
30,Solutionreach,Excellent place to work,2021-01-14,5.0,Program Manager,"The management sincerely cares about all employees and makes sure everyone's voice is heard. If I ever have a question or concern about something, I don't hesitate to reach out to someone on the executive team, CEO/President included. It is nice to be able to have that kind of relationship with C level personnel. 

SR spends a lot of time focusing on and celebrating accomplishments and contributions of their employees. 

Working from home is a huge bonus!","Communication between departments isn't great. It has gotten much better over the 7+ years I have worked here, but there is still room for improvement."
31,Solutionreach,Missing the Mark,2021-01-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Direct teammates were great to work with and had great talent. Had a great director who truly cared about their team and went to bat for them. Built great relationships with people in different departments. Having the gym at the office was a nice perk also.,"In all honesty, the word that describes how I feel about SR is disappointed. The company really has the potential to make a big impact and help change healthcare in a positive way but it won't happen until some big changes are made at the top. When I first started there it was great. The company really seemed to be heading in the right direction and was making some big things happen in terms of partnerships, products, promotion of the company in general. Sales seemed to be selling good, marketing seemed to be in a good groove, customer service seemed to be going well (until someone had the bright idea to turn the support phones off, that was fun. Never really did hear the executives take accountability for that one). But as time went on, it just seemed like it was on a continuous slow decline.

Products being put out just always seemed to be behind the 8 ball and weren't ever anything that set us apart from the competition. And they never really seemed finished when they were launched. It always seemed like it was more important just to get something out there so we could say we had it rather than produce a quality product that would actually work for the customer (I'm looking at you SR Spotlight and SR Intake). Made it really hard to go against the competition knowing it wasn't necessarily better.

If you were to talk to the executives today, they would say that the company has this great credo that they live by and talk about all the time. One of those principles being team members first. And honestly, when they first introduced the credo (mainly because SR had a major morale problem and needed to fix it) I was hopeful that things would change for the better...and for a little bit there it did. But then the excitement of it wore off and the repeating of it at every meeting just seemed to turn into something to ""check off"" the list for people. It's hard to believe in team members first when, in the time I was there, I saw people treated more as numbers and assets, rather than teammates...and it caused SR to lose quality employees. I also can't say I believed in team members first because I really don't think the executives cared/care about their employee's advancement. There was never any emphasis in helping team members advance in their positions. I know my director pushed and fought for me, but was always met with un-interest from higher up. For the almost 3 years I was there, I was in the same position as when I started but with increasing work loads piled on (Since SR was great at letting people go and just making the others take on more instead of backfilling). And we can't forget when, after the company went through big layoffs just before Christmas one year, the CEO was at a roundtable for business leaders and asked what he was most proud of with what his company was doing and his response was along the lines of how they were able to let go of a bunch of people and still be hitting the numbers they wanted. Sounds like team members first. 

I think one of the biggest causes for the decline in SR was the start of SR Health. I'm not saying it was bad to start it, but if I'm being honest, ever since they announced that SRH was happening, it felt as if the executives turned their back on the original SR products and were all focused and all in on SRH. And honestly, it shows. The SR products declined, syncs continued to decline. It just seemed harder and harder to compete with these other companies because they had better tech. Don't get me wrong, I can see why the higher ups want to go in the direction of enterprise medical and hospitals/universities - there is a lot of opportunity and room for growth. It just was poorly executed and it hurt SR. And millions were dumped into this new sister company and it's product (that still isn't where it should be) and the other side was neglected. I know that's easy for me to say as I stood in the bleachers watching, but I also know that was the opinion of many people there.

There were aspects of working at SR I truly loved, and mainly it was the relationships I built. But man, it's just really disappointing to see the company going backwards when it has so much potential to really interrupt the healthcare industry. While working there I sometimes would hear people say ""we have to change things up"" or ""we have to mix things up a bit"" to stand out or win over prospects. To be brutally honest, if SR is going to get back to where it was even 2 or 3 years ago and continue to grow moving forward, what needs to be changed up is who's at the helm and in charge."

• Solutionreach has outsourced support to the Philippines. This has caused issues and unease with the clients. The support has taken a hard turn for the worse this year.
• Product: Solutionreach has had many sync issues over the years, however, 2020  had some of the biggest sync issues to date. Also the product and features rarely worked correctly. The company chooses to create and push a lackluster feature in hopes of generating extra revenue, versus fixing the laundry list of problems with our current products. 
• Competition: Solutionreach seems to be losing ground to other companies in the industry and their product could not  keep up.
• MGMT: Many of the people in management did not listen to their employees, rather made excuses and chose to look the other way. The best ideas come from the folks on the frontlines and to disregard their input seems to be a mistake."

Against those external headwinds and a CEO transition at the beginning of the year, SR has successfully managed to increase communication, trust and transparency across the organization. The SR Credo has become a foundation and an aspiration to our culture and decisions. These changes have paved the way for us to adapt and evolve to a new environment, dramatically different than what we were up against 3 months ago. While we've been stretched thin at times, we've successfully reached new heights in bringing new solutions to customers and prospective customers.

Additionally, many conservative and prudent financial decisions over Solutionreach's history have been validated as SR has been able to weather the toll of the pandemic so far, protecting team member jobs and livelihoods.

I know I speak for others (because others have said the same thing) when I say that we're grateful to those who've gone before us and ensured we weren't caught skinny-dipping during this economic low tide Buffet warned about. Thanks Josh, Jim and others who've led us on this journey!","I and many team members have been stretched very thin.

- Outsourcing, they have recently announced the outsourcing of all Inbound Support teams to the Philippines. During their prime, Solutionreach would win over customers by talking about how amazing, detailed and organized their Support/Success teams were and now they are sending them overseas.

- The company owns their 5-floor building, and at their height had 4 levels to themselves. They are now on 2 levels only and are renting out the other floors to other companies.

- Executive and Director management teams don't know their own product, their own teams, and the morale on the floor. And if they do then they just don't care enough to fix it. 

- Management will say they do not have the properly trained individuals in specific roles, but don't do anything to fix it with continuing education or skills training. They would rather high outside people to fix these gaps. No loyalty to long-tenured employees. 

- Cliques amongst Managers-Directors-Executives. 

- Disorganized cross-department communications even after making it one of their goals to improve upon. Engineering will make a change to the core product, release it without consulting Sales or CS for their opinions.

- Engineering releases new products but with little to no beta-testing before being released, and usually with bugs that make the product increasingly difficult to roll-out to customers. 

- The core product is unreliable and out-dated created back in the 1990s/2000s, and still looks and functions the same exact way. They are making a new core product/platform but it is very overdue.

- When you add everything up it starts to paint a bad picture."
61,Solutionreach,Hurry up and do it wrong.,2020-02-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Unlimited PTO. And you get to write lots of code in Go.,Software is very poorly conceived. You might say it still isn’t. Few engineers have any faith in what has been built. Management is always pushing for the next feature with no regard to proper engineering.

-When reps get let go they expect the remaining reps to take on all the work load and get mad when we aren't able to keep on top of inbound calls. (Hold times for the company are 45 minutes to a few hours for clients)
-This is a company that does not show any loyalty across any department. They have let so many great reps from Sales, Engineers, Customer service and more go without blinking an eye.
-Over worked and under paid

- C-Suite. They genuinely DO NOT care about the people that work for them. Honestly, I don't think half of them care about SR anymore. They want to sell so they can move on.

- Layoffs. They happen often without warning. They'll then call you back three months later to offer you your job back...They have no idea what they're doing.

- Culture. Because they are doing whatever it takes to sell their culture has taken a dive and no one cares to fix it. 

- Contractors. They are contracting engineers to build their product rapidly. That I understand. BUT they are now contracting call center reps...get ready for outsourcing."

Free candy, fruit and bagels (still doesn't hold a candle to the fully stocked kitchens most tech companies have now though)
Free lunch once a month (most tech companies do free lunch weekly or multiple times a week though.)","Executives and management are completely disconnected from employee's and customer's needs.
Pays far below market for most positions.
The product doesn't work most of the time.
Most incoming customer support calls are angry customers. Onboarding department is absolutely terrible at their job so you have unhappy clients from the very beginning. 
Crumbling infastructure.
Severely understaffed.
Terrible benefits. (And no executive team, candy and soda does not make up for awful health benefits) 
Employee turnover is VERY high so most of support does not know how to use the product.
They recently raised their prices even after having a ""price for life"" guarantee in their contracts saying that would not happen. Obviously that makes even more angry customers. 
""Integrity"" was removed from company values and replaced with ""Impact"" (They literally removed integrity from the company)

Employees of Solutionreach can be treated so much better else where. Solutionreach has a way of making you think that you couldn't do better elsewhere. You can. You can do the same work somewhere else for more money and better benefits. Abandon ship!

Solutionreach is focused on improving the customer experience and on long-term sustainable growth. 

At the same time, they understand the importance of recognizing and celebrating success. I've also seen (in my short time here) a lot of opportunity for upward growth and mobility. People here trust you with a lot of responsibility very quickly.

Pivoting is good and necessary but there's the inevitable growing pains that come from shifting our focus and setting aggressive goals. 

Also, I know a large percentage of employees are part of sales teams or customer support teams.

95,Solutionreach,Sinking Ship,2019-04-07,1.0,,Decent amount of paid time off and holiday pay.,"Solutionreach was once an amazing company to work for. The culture was great, management cared about their employees and the employees understood the company’s vision. 
The last year has been a complete 180. 
2 years ago Solutionreach built a huge building, the company was growing and the future was very bright. 
In the last year Solutionreach has laid off and fired about 50% of its staff. We once occupied all 5 floors of the new building and now we have rented out all of the space, aside from 2 floors. Current employees are left to do three times the amount of work as before and they have drastically cut employees commissions. This has led to poor support for the client, and more work for less pay for the employees.
Upper management refuses to be transparent and share their vision for the company. An employee recently asked about the future of the company at an all staff event. Upper management was asked about all of the layoffs and security for the remaining employees. Upper management stated that this job would not last forever and to just think of it as a stepping stone in their career path.
It is fine if they want to downsize and go another direction, However, they have not communicated their plans and this has created a terrible work environment for the remaining employees. Again, the remaining employees are tasked with three times the amount of work and a significant cut in compensation."

Current software has so many nuances and intricacies that is impossible to be taught all in training that you will have to face almost immediately once hitting the floor. Results in higher resolution times resulting in frustration between the reps and the clients
Less than ideal communication between management to representatives, and between departments.
Clients not always fully notified of outages and system failures, causing spikes in queue times on phone support and chat support leading to frequent frustration among clients.
Since there are so many nuances in regards to the software that is only learned through experience, clients are occasionally unknowingly givien misleading information regarding what they will be able to accomplish, and what is not an option in regards to the integration with their system and ours, and our own independent system limitations."

Also, if you are slacking in performance in just the slightest way, management will not coach you or even inform you of it, they will just fire you and if you ask for details on how your performance was ""slacking"", they refuse to tell you. And then if you do get fired, don't plan on the reason being confidential. Certain employees that are aware of the details will talk about it to other employees.

The support department no longer deserves the title and has instead been deputized as a pseudo sales force. The company itself is doomed in the long run, as many dental CRMs are now providing their own fully integrated reminder solutions, and SR has failed to differentiate itself by providing a quality experience to the customer.

Features to the software that customers were able to use for years are taken away and they are told that they now have to be more to be able to use them again, customers are not provided any notice or warning of the changes, when they will be in effect, and how much they will need to pay.

Attrition is through the roof but not by people leaving of their own choice, daily or weekly anywhere from 1-5 people would be fired without warning, and queues are poorly managed by taking more and more people out from being available to take calls, and put more into chats to the point that there are so many people in chat than there are in phones causing severe delays, with customers becoming aggravated due to lengthy hold times where no matter what day they call I no support they are waiting anywhere from 20-60+ minutes, and there are so many people in chats that techs have nothing to do as customers have voiced this concern through reviews."

Solutionreach is the type of company  that truly cares about the development of their employees. I have never seen so many people make career advancements internally before.  On top of that the VP I report to is on-board with providing me with as much professional development as possible. I am signed up to take multiple classes to help me develop skills that will be forever valuable. Just recently Solutionreach has made major changes/additions to the benefits. For example PTO has been increased and now the whole company as the week between Christmas and New Years off. Compensation is fair and the company is doing well financially. I really do feel like Solutionreach is a ""hidden gem"". These are  just some of  many reasons why I choose Solutionreach everyday!",To be honest I don't have any cons..

If I really need to say more, I will: As an artist on the marketing team, I feel like I'm able to contribute to a great cause, that my work is valued, and that I have a great deal of creative freedom. Honestly I feel more fulfilled working here than I did working for a major animation studio, which has been a big surprise. The culture here is great--lots of good, hard-working people that care about one another. The management is increasingly investing in the people, and we are making healthcare better for people across the country, which feels like something that matters.
Sure, it's not a perfect company, but it's easily the best one I've ever worked for. Plenty of perks too-- free lunch monthly, along with Lunch & Learn classes every few weeks, bagel Tuesday, fruit/candy/soda, beautiful building, and a gorgeous park right outside.","The company has gone through a lot of growing pains the last few years for sure.

In general, the work environment is pleasant, and my colleagues are trustworthy and nice. In my time here, I have experienced expected, if not desired, advancement, for the most part. Of course, it would be nice if I could received a 6-figure salary for doing my current job, but that's not realistic.","Let me list some bullet points that I think just need to be considered, given that I am not privy to the discussions in the upper echelons.
--micromanagement of call center reps. I get why this is necessary in general, but it doesn't add to the generally overall pleasant environment. It creates unnecessary anxiety
--The attendance policy, specifically the policy regarding tardiness, is ridiculous. When I first started here, they would allow an occasional 5-10 minute tardiness without consequence. If that happened more frequently, the TL would speak to the offender, and if it continued, then the rep would face what consequences there were for his actions. Now, it's like someone is always watching us to make sure all the children are in their seats when the bell rings. 
--I think that, despite not receiving a 6-figure salary, the wages could be a little higher, more in line with industry standards. 
--Skill levels seem to be largely honorary. No difference between a Level 3 tech and a Level 1, as far as being a representative on the phones is apparent. What's the point of having L3s if they are just another voice on the phone for our clients."
135,Solutionreach,This company is a joke.,2018-06-22,1.0,Client Success Representative,Some cool people. Free meals on occasion.,"I left this job for another job opportunity but This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. The micro-managing is an absolute joke. Their workforce management department is literally watching everything you do. They are basically glorified babysitters. 

I worked here for 11 months and had 7 different team leads  in that time! 7!! The client success manager was impossible to work with and drove people out of the company. 

The companies communication skills were terrible. I can’t tell you how many times things had changed and nobody was told about it. 

Every time something went bad in the company they would have a meeting or send out an email saying “ sorry, we are learning and growing”.  However, nothing ever changed. 

They do not value the opinion of the employee. Employees would bring up concerns or possible problems that may occur but those concerns were always ignored, and more often than not the employees were right. A lot of problems could have been solved if they would have listened. Instead they allow the problem to occur for weeks until management swallows their pride. 

They are dishonest in how the deal with their employees. If they say things are going to change, they are most likely lying."

Management does not care anymore about employees. If you don't like their way they'll get rid of you. They make changes to processes without keeping customers in mind and when customers cancel they shrug and say ""they we're going to cancel anyway"". Atmosphere has gone way downhill the last year especially"
138,Solutionreach,The Best Days Are Behind Them,2018-06-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company was once a flexible, fun place to work that both cared about the forward progress of its employees and the success of its clients. I have been with the company long enough to see process after process change and at one point, felt like I had provided valuable input for the future success of the company.  

There was potential to move up fast if you were able to show your work and your dedication to doing the right thing while you are at work. 

This is what one would consider a local company that has grown fast from grassroots to a nationally recognized corporation.  

They still do birthday lunches, Bagel/Donut Tuesdays and have free drinks, fruit, and candy.  

With the new building we moved into, we have a pretty active gym with classes as well.  Really nice to have that option along with the park grounds at Thanksgiving Point.

Recognition is consistent interdepartmentally and usually completed in meetings.

There is an annual Solutionrun for The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society where the employees compete for donations.  Really good cause.  They also do charity matching.

Discounted UTA pass if you want to commute by train or bus

I have made good friends that will likely outlast my relationship with the company","Probably be let go for writing this if it was not anonymous.

Although I felt in the past I was able to contribute insightful feedback and steer conversation and direction, that is no longer the case.  I have heard through the grapevine that SR hired a consulting firm to figure out why it is hemorrhaging profits.  Makes sense, right? If I was a business owner, I would want to know why P&L was not stacking up to expectations.  This seems to have come at the cost of it’s support employees and how those employees support the most important part of the company, the medical professionals relying on the service. I am sure if you had the opportunity to speak with an office using Solutionreach they would tell you all about the 1+ hours of hold time for support through chat or that time (about 4-6 months) with no phone support at all. What has ensued since around the middle of 2017 are massive structural changes from sales to support, layoffs, demotions and oddly enough some newly created erroneous positions that just seem to create a buffer in management having to actually address and speak to the dissent they have created. Please, feel free to look at reviews of the company prior to July 2017 and you will see a stark contrast from positive to negative, then come back to finish this review. 

Most employees working at the company don’t know if they are going to have a job from one day to the next.  This is extremely important to note if you are exploring a job opportunity here.  The company sends out an annual feedback form to gauge how employees feel they perform at their job along with how management is doing, etc. which is followed up by a town hall.  I can tell you this year was one that all employees were looking for answers and got none.  It was a meeting of deflection and a look at the menial successes.  Everyone is so afraid to lose their job for speaking up that nothing was addressed from the actual survey responses.  There have been noted employees, some very successful in their positions, that have been let go because they challenged certain directives that were given, not because they did not want to do what’s right, simply because ethically they weren’t willing to.  Senior employees are being let go or demoted (I am assuming because they perceive them as making too much) telling them their position has been eliminated and within a single business day, the job requisition opens up for their position.

Do you remember the cliques in high school.  Well, remember, this is still a local company.  Instead of cliques, we use the corporately recognized term “nepotism.”  It is displayed here for all to see.  There are literally entire families working here that seem to be protected from these layoffs/demotions.  Not sure why their namesake gives them those privileges but it seems to.  Whether that’s truth or not, perception is what matters.

Discrimination has become a highlight of the company as well.  The sales team seems to be experiencing this  the most and it’s primarily against women. If you notice, in the past there has been nothing in their own social media that they have any interest in promoting women in the workforce.  Well, something must have recently happened because they are trying to make it overly apparent that’s not true. 

Should you be looking to join Solutionreach as support, understand that you will be agreeing to a lower wage and you will be micromanaged from the time you step through the doors until you leave the parking lot. I used to see smiles and happy-to-be-here attitudes from those employees; it’s changed immensely.  I see downtrodden, stressed, exhausted and overall unhappy employees leaving for the day.  A year ago, people were excited to show up, get their work done, play a little ping-pong with their work friends on their breaks and leave for the day feeling enriched.

Benefits go up every year.  It’s almost impossible at this point to work for anything other than health benefits.  When asked why they go up every year, the answer is “because they are being used more last year than the year prior.” I would hope so! Nothing I like more than to pay a lot of money into something and not be able to use it.  The company has grown substantially which means we should also qualify for a larger group discount or at least someone to be a little more aggressive in negotiating a better discount.  The benefits offered are not all that great either.  Probably best to have a spouse with a better option or if you are under 26 to continue to live with your parents and use their benefits

The company seems to half bake ideas into creation and provide that level of training for it’s support team.  Before resolving major bugs, they move on to the next product release, compounding the frustration of the client and the people that have to support it.

Solutionreach says they integrate with xxxx amount of Practice Management Software or EHR, but the reality is, there is usually no formal agreement from those EHRs and those “integrations” are actually just a back-door connection that can be closed without notice, rendering all connections useless, therefore the service as well.  This also leaves the client and support team frustrated as it’s not an honest or ethical way to conduct business."

Solution reach has a reputation amongst medical practices as being a joke. 
You will hate it. You will be taken advantage of. You won’t make any money. Look at the facts and all the bad reviews. You won’t find anything here that will benefit you in any way."
142,Solutionreach,Actually embarrassed to have them on my resume,2018-05-29,1.0,Product Manager,Great place to brush up on your office politics in a highly dysfunctional atmosphere,"Due to the toxic environment there is an extremely high employee churn rate. When asked about it in a company meeting, the CEO shrugged and said he expects people to leave so he doesn't get worked up about it. This ""don't care"" attitude is abundant in the company culture. Each quarter the CEO needs a scapegoat to blame for his failures so some department takes the hit. Good employees are let go or demoted, others are shuffled around, all so the CEO can tell the board he's addressing the problem. Get this: in just over a year they had 100 percent turnover at the VP level. HR, Sales, Marketing, Customer Service, Product, Engineering, IT -- every single VP left the company. Most of them were pushed out by the CEO. This is far from a stable environment, much less an optimal one.

The company claims ""Openness"" as one of its values so imagine my surprise when I was abruptly let go for ""performance reasons"" with not a single written or verbal warning in my entire two years with the company. My supervisor even admitted in front of the HR rep that he had not had a single conversation with me about my performance. Not once. All my projects were on track for on-time delivery. Oh, and funny thing, they're moving forward with the next phase of the project I proposed and defined, so they admittedly like my work. But they're too cowardly to even have an honest conversation about it. Don't expect to be treated fairly here, much less treated in a professional manner. Not only will you not be given a valid reason when you're let go, they won't even bother to discuss your performance with you. I sat through fifteen hours of mandatory Crucial Conversations training. Number of actual conversations? Zero.

Before taking a job here carefully consider the negative feedback from employees who know what the company is really like. And realize the positive reviews here are from employees who simply haven't been stabbed in the back by the company -- yet. But hey, maybe I'm being too negative. If you're the type of person who enjoys office politics, a toxic work environment, dishonesty, hidden agendas, and dysfunctional management at every level -- this may just be your dream job."

In a 2 month stint, and after 2.5 years of long hours, hard work for this company, I lost my mother, my wife had a serious accident, and in the middle of trying to figure out how to afford surgery after an unplanned trip home for a funeral, my employer fires me for ""performance reasons"", putting my healthcare access in jeopardy.  I use quotes because management nor HR could point to any thing I had done or not done.  I had no history of disciplinary action at this or any other company over the last decade.   In fact, the more I prodded for more info, the story eventually changed to ""Utah is an at-will state.  We don't need a reason to fire you"".  Essentially, the one time I needed my employer to have my back, they instead put a knife there.  They fired me 3 days after I pulled a 60 hour week.  One manager who clearly disagreed with the decision explained to me that the decision was made while I was off burying my mother.  Of course, he didn't say that explicitly, he just gave a timeline that matched up to the day.  If that doesn't say everything about this company, I don't know what does.

148,Solutionreach,"Used to Be Great, Terrible Now",2018-05-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Coworkers are good people, free soda, company 5k for charity","Solutionreach was a company with a vision, but that vision is dead.

At one point, all of us were united behind a goal of improving communication between doctor and patient, each of us feeling we were truly making a difference in the lives of patients while also helping small business owners (i.e., doctors) run a better clinic. Solutionreach makes it clear that's no longer the case. The almighty dollar now means more than customer satisfaction, quality of service, or a quality product and the happiness of the the employees who make everything work has become not just a low priority, but antithesis to success.

Strict, brutal policies; low opportunities for growth; dismissal of concerns to management; and more are the standard. Those few managers who used to value their employees and tried to create a good environment were laid-off, replaced by uncaring bosses who simply enforce the cold demands of a board who's squeezing to make the most profitable possible company. Even the CEO, Jim Higgins, who used to make decisions based on the needs of those he lead, has become indifferent and bitter when concerns are voiced. At town hall meetings, concerns about the death of a once-positive culture are met with mockery and a simple, ""If you don't like it, leave,"" attitude.

Those of us who started early on thought the growth of the company would lead to raises, stock options, and career growth but were largely met with disappointment as department leaders hired almost exclusively outside the company and gave only token promotions with next to no raises to those of us who had built the foundations. By the time I left, my stock options were worth so little, I didn't even bother to buy them out, letting them disappear and lapse.

The medical benefits are the worst and most expensive of any job at which I've ever worked. At the last open enrollment meeting I attended before leaving, concerns about the cost were met with a quick dismissal by the CFO.

Be wary of positive reviews on here as the company manages online reputations for small businesses and understands that a negative review is best handled by trying to bury it under some positive reviews. The overall score trend here clearly shows dissatisfaction growing over time.

Steer clear of this company, as you'll find better pay, better benefits, and more satisfaction elsewhere."

152,Solutionreach,I love the smell of re-orgs in the morning,2018-04-25,1.0,Voice of Reason,"Donuts and bagels once a week, lunch once a month, free M&Ms and soda","VERY expensive health benefits. Surprisingly, this isn't the worst part of the company. Upper management has no strategy. They can't decide if they want to be in emerging markets, serve their enterprise customers, or double down on their core. So they make half-hearted steps in different directions, then change their mind, do a re-org, and lay people off. The company is getting passed by competitors in every single aspect of the product. The CEO had a good idea 18 years ago, but since then can't figure out what to do other than copy (poorly) the competition.

The antiquated legacy code base means it takes engineers 2-3X as long to develop new features or even do minor maintenance. Weekly hot fixes to patch engineering mistakes have become routine. The new texting technology goes down about every other week on average. Due to the rusty bucket of bolts that is the platform, the company can't hire stellar engineering talent and instead hires a ton of junior engineers. Fine if you're a junior engineer looking to start your career but not so great when management is screaming about how long it takes to develop new stuff. They've built an amazingly dysfunctional system and can't figure out why it won't produce better results.

Customer churn is extremely high. Customers are frustrated by the Frankenstein mishmash of features that were haphazardly bolted on because upper management won't invest the resources to release solid features that are actually usable. Good ideas are stripped down to a weak sauce version in order to rush something to market, customers complain about the mediocrity, but instead of fixing the feature, teams are reshuffled and rushed to build the next half-baked big idea.

All upper mgmt knows how to do is have yet another reorg where they lay off a bunch of people, promote employees of questionable experience, then do it all again 4 months later. Think I exaggerate? My department has had 3 supervisors in 4 months. This churn creates a negative environment where you can't trust your coworkers because they are positioning themselves to take your spot in the next turnover. The company has a thin veneer of pleasantry, but underneath it is a toxic culture rife with internal politics, currying favor, and turf wars.

I've given up hope they'll find a path to success. Their fatal flaws are hard-wired into the company culture (read: upper management) and will not be resolved any time soon."

The product they offer is actually awesome.","Even though their product is one of the best on the market, most of their sales reps couldn’t give it away. They have a bad reputation in the industry for terrible customer service (which effects the success and oaycheck of sales reps) and for shady sales practices. We got coached on how to trick the potential customer into signing up on the same day as presentation. They expect you to be pushy and aggressive, but when a customer complains about that, it’s the sales reps fault. They require you to text your sales manager and update them in every detail during your presentation when the doctor usually has only a few minutes. It’s very awkward. I also felt very pressured to get an office signed up even if they were going to cancel the next day. It’s all about the numbers being looked at by higher ups and owner. I hear they are trying to go public with their stocks and the sales numbers need to be high so that the investors will think the company is doing well. You also have to compete with an entire inside sales team at corporate who also received preferential treatment."

Forced to compete with your own sales reps which always ended in their favor. Under extremely high pressure to sign clients even suggesting having staff sign contracts and/or utilize personal credit cards, changing pricing and terms on the last day of the month, encouraging reps to be creative in order to get around so called guidelines. “Ask for forgiveness, not approval” was a common phrase used by managers. Inconsistent expectations. Some employees would be on warning for months with no consequences and some would be fired with no warning. Commission structure was constantly changing and favoritism was shown to the many family/Church members working at the corporate office. Customer support was so poor that many clients end up cancelling before their trial period was over which then affects sales reps commission checks. There were a lot of “gray areas” that seemed to be decided on an individual basis and even when obvious injustices took place, it came down to whether management liked you or not. It did not reflect a reps performance."

Customers were often given unrealistic expectations regarding customization of features and attention they would receive from customer support rep given the number of accounts and calls received.

173,Solutionreach,Constant changes all part of running a business,2018-01-12,5.0,Territory Sales Representative,"Selling the best product on the market. It's not perfect but no system is. Insurance benefits are decent for what we pay for out of pocket. Two trainings for reps are held twice a year and they go all out to make them informational and have fun with friends we don't get to see much. You have a lot of control over your schedule and when the weather is bad, you can work from home. Plenty of opportunities to work local shows to help add to your sales. Fantastic trip offered for the best of the best, no expense spared and you can bring a guest.  Seeing the positive results  and growth the system brings to an office is worth most of the pain you go through as a Sales Rep. It's great knowing you  are making a difference.","Our job gets harder every year. Offices aren't so quick to make a necessary change because they have been burned by other companies in the past. It also gets hard when the company makes necessary changes and our reputation takes a hit. 
Most recently a lot of reps were let go which was sad. Truth be told, they were not doing  the work, making sales,  hitting quota. Quota is very fair even though it's a very hard job. You have to be tough to deal with cold calling and the nature of the beast along with offices who can be unreasonable. 
We often feel we are pitted against the inside reps when in reality, it's our fault for not staying on top of our leads and keeping a tight pipeline. Competitors lie and go after our reputation because they can't compete with all our system offers so you can lose sales to that which sucks but feels great months later when you win them back because the competitor did not meet their needs or charges the same as us for less features. Salary is lower then where it should be. If you have a bad month and hardly any commissions, it's easy to fall behind on bills. Commissions get better each year though so that's good. We get money towards expenses yet get taxed on it so it's counted as income and doesn't help with our own expenses of gas, tolls, etc. Everyone is treated the same whether you started a week ago or years ago and I don't agree with that."

175,Solutionreach,Run away!! Do not look back!!,2018-01-09,1.0,TSR,Made an incredible income when I first started. Amazing product and life time friends😊,"This company has seriously gone downhill since new upper management took over in 2017. They changed the pay structure too many times within the year. You constantly felt that you were fighting for your sells with inside hovering like vultures over your head everyday. Inside reps were always given better techniques and pricing to use when presenting their demos where us outside reps weren't given the same tools or if we were to ask for lower pricing the chances of you getting the same courtesy was very unlikely. They changed the slide decks for our presentations and if you were caught using anything but the new slide deck you would be written up. 

The job is very high pressure. If the client is not interested or not ready to move forward at that time, upper management would make you feel  that you were an idiot and you did something wrong or they would make you go right back in the office and wait in the lobby to speak to the doctor which ended up in a lot of cases of irritating the offices.

I've personally lost sales because of the lack of support the client success team provided my clients or the system wasn't up and going correctly and clients try to contact client success and are put on hold for a long time or they don't respond.

Recently close to half of the outside sales team had to be laid off. It's a shame!! Do I need to say more??!!"

181,Solutionreach,Good underpaid job. Bad place for a career,2018-01-04,3.0,Tier II Tech Support,"Fight for your career: If you time when you join the company right and push yourself to exceed expectations with a friendly disposition, you can make the most of the situation. They value work ethic and agreeable personality above qualifications and knowledge, so you get the chance to be exposed to new things.

Employee friendships: The friends you make will be your fellow co-workers. There is something to be said about going through a tough experience together.

Good HR: The company has a reasonable HR who is willing to address issues.

Make a fuss to the right people: Enough employees complained about the health insurance that the CFO addressed it in a meeting and offered another plan as an option.","Unqualified: Careful observation has convinced me of nepotism and favoritism among some in upper management. It is speculation so take it for what it is worth. Some of the unqualified “engineers” in Client Success better recognized they are imposters if they don’t skill up and become qualified. Some of my friends are engineers. I recognize it when they take the time to learn instead of acting arrogant. (CEO recommends being an ""entrepreneur"" in your position.)

Bad workflow: Management tends to make poor assumptions without paying attention to what happens in between. Decisions are good when profits are increased and efficiency is gained. The in-between experience is bad for employees and the clients.

Internal communication: The in-between communication is poor among different teams. It only reflects the upper management between different groups. It's just the bureaucracy.

Work the system/unclear expectations: Sometimes people get an easier workload or they work the system so they can pass the buck. People sometimes do the minimum or cherry pick. It is unclear what is considered the minimum for due diligence. Also, they restructure every 3 (or 6) months so you end up having to adapt and wait until expectations can be determined. Clients end up calling again and learn to deal with that. I would call that inefficient.

Welcome to the call center."

Management doesn't listen to employees and all they care about is getting you off the phone. They don't let you call a customer back without team lead permission. They have families that think they can get away with anything, and they do. They used to be afraid to fire employees that didn't work.

Unfortunately in the last year maybe two, they have forgotten what it’s like to care for their current employees. They are cutting complete teams from the company and letting people go. They have forgotten that they aren’t just effecting themselves but hurting families when they decide to do this. I was not let go from this company and they would be surprised to hear this review. I would strongly discourage anyone that cares about their career to pursue opportunities at this company. It has completely changed from the reputation it used to have. They like to brag to current candidates applying for SR that they are being so successful  yet they are dismantling and firing because of budget...seems to be contradictory. You can find any sales rep in the company and find out for yourself. The customer experience side has completely changed as well. They force you to go back to “rapid” if you are part of a team they feel is inferior, If you don’t then they let you go. Then this “rapid” is what they call there inbound call team, and they make it well known how low you are to them in the company. They have no clue how to treat employees anymore. You are replaceable to them at anytime. Don’t forget raises once a year...you might get a quarter if you are lucky. This whole review sounds like someone who just got fired, but that is not the case, I used to love Solutionreach and it was hard for me to leave, but now with everything that’s gone on, I was lucky. I am in no way mad at this company, just giving my honest opinion to help any professional looking to make the right career choice.

They pay decent. If you keep your head down, don't interact with anyone, including your boss (who is most likely a 20 something who acts like their only job is to be on pinterest and bad mouth upper management) then you'll do fine in customer service. There is very little company unity between each department. Between sales, implementation, and customer service, each acts like they are running their own company and they constantly bad mouth each other. The growth this company has gone under in the last 5 years is shown by the amount of benefits they've dropped. The culture is fine so long as you are LDS and republican/conservative.

Leads are dead, and none more coming in, there are only so many dental and vision offices, it only takes a few minutes to realize that we have completely saturated and called through every office 20-50 times begging anyone to look at a demo, which they have already had done a few months ago and gotten a hard ""no"" from. They raise quotas and expectations almost every other week in order to look better to prospective companies that the executives are trying so desperately to sell, while bashing competitors (demandforce) for being sold out, seems a bit hypocritical if you ask me. They lie to every employees face and say the company is on the up and up, they have realistically only netted a few thousand clients in the 2 years i worked there. Some managers are terrible and have no background in their position and simply got promoted because of office place ""politics"". They also lie to clients stating they have a certain period where they can cancel the service without penalty, in reality it is much shorter and by the time a client wants to cancel they are already stuck in a contract. Management also will look for any way to get rid of any small bonus you may already have. They will erase your overtime hours you may have worked if you dont hit ridiculous metrics, which seems illegal to me, but i have seen it happen to a few coworkers personally where they have several hours of overtime, and when they get paid out their timecard mysteriously got deducted those overtime hours because they werent at the lofty requirements they set, which out of the entire floor only 1 person may qualify for, if that. As soon as you give them your 2 weeks notice they kick you out of the door and refuse to pay for the time you gave them notice, putting you out of valuable money you were depending on. Certain managers will belittle you in front of the entire team in meetings."

If you get a good team lead, they help you excell quickly at your job. New building soon means everyone will almost be in one place except for those working at home (building will already be full). Bonus is more than your whole months pay if you work hard and prove it in your stats.","Insurance is almost $800 a month for a family and has the same coverage, and in some cases less coverage, than Wal-Mart employees insurance. They say they are open to suggestions but won't listen to out spoken employees who point out the obvious things like poor work flow, lack of support for ""lower level"" positions and extreme favoritism. I've worked there almost 2 years and am making less then the new hires who have less work experience than me. Looking at other companies with the same positions , it's not competitive pay unless you have friends higher up or are new because they are desperate due to growth. Because of the growth their new hires aren't the best and they are struggling to find ways to manage inconing calls and heavier work loads. Rapid growth also means higher positions are given to their friends or family not necessarily someone who can actually do the job. Other reviews talk about team lunches, incentives and recognition but that all depends on the team/department. Only certain teams and departments get those things and the departments that keep the company alive (techs, call center and chat reps, etc) hardly get recognition or incentives. All in all, growth appears to have been good for upper management's pockets and not so great for dedicated employees."

This means that if you don't think there is a problem you'll get a sudden meeting to go over the 'months' you've had 'behavior issues'.
3. Even with a degree and experience using the systems they will refuse you an internship or any 'promotional' opportunity they talk to you about when you first get hired.

The leads we get from the ADR's are terrible.  Not their fault.  Just poor company training.  Sounds like they do a great job getting appointments but the company doesn't pay them to close.  They get paid to just hold.

Again the job isn't terrible but with a lot of SAE's quitting and other jobs out there with more pay and a better system I'm starting too wonder if my ship is sinking and I should go jump on the ship that's still moving strong."

Free candy, fruit and bagels every week

Plenty of PTO and paid holidays

All that is wonderful, but to me the greatest pro is the management. My managers are very open to feedback and they take your ideas and suggestions and actually apply them. That alone puts Solutionreach above all of my prior employers because it creates a very progressive and dynamic environment. The key is that you need to speak up and take initiatives.

It's exciting to be apart of a fast-growing company and to see things change in a positive way. 

They reward hard work and give suggestions when things need to improve. The yearly ""Finisher's club"" and ""Presidents club"" outings to reward hard work are great! (ex: all expenses paid 3 day vacation to Disneyland)

I am constantly learning new skills and gaining more experience. This job has really helped my career and I love coming to work everyday.","My health insurance deductions have doubled since my last job for the same benefits. Part of that is due to the new healthcare regulations but it's still something that takes a nice chunk out of your pay.

Not an ideal place to start a family because of the lack of paid maternity leave, you have to use your PTO.

The office is right by the Frontrunner/ Lehi Station, but there's no commuter benefit plan while many other companies in the area have one (they are looking into one). Parking can be pretty tight and the company is spread out between 3 buildings. All of that will be solved when the new building is complete though. 

While I've worked here there have been 2 huge hiring gaps(taking 3 months to fill a position) and  it puts more work on everyone which adds stress and overtime. As a side note: the people that they do hire in my department are high quality. They don't just hire anyone. So maybe its worth the extended time searching for new employees.

There are also constant growing pains meaning that it's hard to manage the workload. You have to be very autonomous and find creative solutions to increase efficiency. I've grown a lot with finding ways to process things faster but it can be stressful."

289,Solutionreach,Great opportunities of growth within Solutionreach.,2015-08-01,5.0,Client Success Representative,"This company really cares for it's employee's! The first day I started working for Solutionreach, I was treated so good, too good... the employee's were all way to nice. The only thing about a place with super positive people is you think that the mask has got to come off sometime, but I was wrong. The people are happy because of the product and the great management. Best working environment of all my jobs! It really feels like we're a team. 

Of course you get out of it what you put into to it. Speaking of which, there is so much opportunity for one to move around! I previously mentioned that Solutionreach cares for there employee's and I meant it. I started in a simple position, and through hard work I was able to move into another position that I was eye balling within 5 months. Of course it helps to have such awesome co-workers to help explain, teach, and recommend you for a position!! 

As I do with my friends, I highly recommend this place for employment and for it's product! Some of the best customer service I've seen!!","Honestly, looking for cons here is like looking for a flaw in the Mexican dessert ""Tres Leche""... You just can't unless you look hard. The criticism is all constructive. If there's correction that needs happen, it will, but it's done with the perspective of improvement and respect. Again you get of it what you put into it."

We have a good time here. Good benefits/salary for Utah (and many other states). We've been growing like crazy and it's fun that we're still on that rocket ship. I love that the company isn't just sitting still and getting stale. There are always new things happening.","I don't know everyone anymore. We keep growing and I can't keep up with all of the new people joining. Not a terrible problem but it's nice when you knew everyone. A previous review mentioned candy. Yes, I've had to develop some self-control but they've also added some fruit to counter balance that. :-)"

293,Solutionreach,Solid Company with a Great Atmosphere,2015-07-16,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Competitive base salary, uncapped commissions, market leader, strongest ROI, great atmosphere and great people.  

Solutionreach is one of most innovative companies I have ever worked for.  I have been in the healthcare industry for over 10 years and had never seen anything quite like Solutionreach.  I've now been with Solutionreach now for over 2 years and have helped hundreds of dentists, optometrists and medical offices improve office efficiency, increase practice revenue, enhance patient satisfaction and maximize Online reputation/presence.  The senior sales team is equipped with lead development reps that help qualify prospects and keep a full schedule so there is not a shortage in leads.  The sales process is a short sales cycle with warm introductions.  Team environment.  

The Solutionreach software is current and cutting edge.  And product/development are always innovating and adding new enhancements/features.  With over 550 employees, there are many resources for clients and internal team members.  

Also, the company strives to create a great working atmosphere for all employees.  Whether it is weekly sales spiffs or company wide movie days, 5K fun runs, birthday lunches or bagel/coffee Tuesdays, the atmosphere is always fun and professional.  Not to mention, MacBooks, iPhones and other perks are given to employees.  Great healthcare plans, 401K, full size gym facility and much more...",All in all a solid company with little to no cons.  None worth mentioning.
294,Solutionreach,I have never worked for a better company.,2015-07-16,5.0,Client Success Representative,"The service Solutionreach provides to its clients is revolutionary. I believe that all medical offices of all kinds should use the program.
I haven't met someone here who I haven't liked working with.
The atmosphere is very open and friendly, and no one will look down on you or turn you away if you ask questions.
They are a very fast growing company and are always looking for ways to improve, therefore, they are always open for suggestions to make the company and the service better.
No uniforms or business dress is required. I've even seen the CEO walking around in Jeans during normal business operations. Although, if you prefer to wear slacks and a tie, that's okay, too.
The company treats the employees very well. Even the lower paid positions at the company provide very competitive wages with numerous opportunities for bonuses and perks. Bagels, doughnuts, juice, and coffee provided every Tuesday morning, and all day every day, you can have as much soda, fruit, and chocolate as you can ever want.
While the environment is fairly casual, they are a great business and have standards and requirements. Even with that, you're not always having a supervisor watch you and micromanaging you.
Many more great things.","It's hard to think of any cons. The hours are usually great, and you can decide whether you want to work 6-3, 7-4, 9-5. Certain positions have very specific hours that may not be changed, so if you were accustomed to your time for one position and want to apply for a promotion, you may need to adjust your time to match the new position, but most positions are flexible."
295,Solutionreach,I love working for Solutionreach!!,2015-07-15,5.0,Sales Administrator,"We have PTO!! The company does a good job of spoiling their employees. We get bagel / donut Tuesdays, EVERY TUESDAY!! We have healthy treats such as bananas, apples and oranges available ALL THE TIME. We also have some yummy treats like candy bars and peanut butter M&M's, which are my favorite!! The people I work with are happy to be here, so we have a positive vibe in the work environment as well. Another great thing here at Solutionreach is that we are growing so fast that there is plenty of room for you to grow in the company!",The only bummer to Solutionreach is that they feed us so well it's hard to keep the weight off!

Very collaborative environment. Always encouraged to ""do the right thing"".  You have the freedom and the empowerment to just fix what you see needs fixing and iterate on your solution with no pressure that it has to be perfect with your first try. I love working here.",There can be a disconnect between the product team ( the ones who think up what we should build) and the engineering team when it comes to how long these products and features take to build and when to take extra time to fix an underlying problem before building something on top of it.  Non-engineers have a hard time understanding the process and the time it takes to get something done RIGHT.

300,Solutionreach,Extended sales rep,2015-05-15,2.0,Extended Sales Representative,The software platform is the best in the Patient Engagement Space,"The lack of compassion for the employees as the company grew
The fact that inside sales, outside sales and the extended sales teams sell against each other instead of helping each other
Inside Sales reps blatantly steal deals from the ESRs
The training for managers was little or non existent on the ESR team
45 days is not enough time to circle back on an account and it can be taken from the ISR on day 46
The ISRs have Appointment setters when they sit at their desk all day while the ESRs run around in their territory bringing in new leads.  They should be the ones having appointments set for them
No recurring revenue so the burn out is very high after a year or two
No pay raise in the base salary even after 3 years with the company"

Trying to do too many things and be too much to too many.  This can equal disaster for an outside sales representative because their time becomes consumed with putting out fires and trying to calm angry customers.

Customer support reps are inexperienced and give inconsistent /inaccurate information frustrating customers and making the sales team and Solutionreach look bad. 
Sales reps income based on the activation team and support team not losing the customer in the first 60 days.

Everyone knows how to have fun while being productive.,I honestly do not have many complaints. The communication among departments could be improved. It is important to ensure that all stakeholders are involved in product development.
307,Solutionreach,The best co-workers and company culture I have ever experienced!,2014-08-15,5.0,Anonymous,"The thing that I really love about Solutionreach is that the goals that we market having (we do xyz for our customers and help them be successful) are goals that we ACTUALLY have--it makes it a lot easier to sell our product, market our product, support our product, and be proud of who we are working for. 

I love having my input and contributions valued and recognized. Rather than being micromanaged, I am encouraged to think outside the box and propose my ideas. Because the company is so focused on innovation, they really support trying new things and giving me the room I need to execute my ideas--even when the results aren't guaranteed. 

They are supportive of my life outside of Solutionreach; I don't ever feel like I have to choose work over my personal responsibilities, and it has made it very easy to function as a successful employee and also a normal person that maintains a satisfying home life. 

I feel like I work with my best friends, every day--including my boss(es.) I've never laughed so much during the day, or had as much fun doing the very same thing that pays my bills.","The pay isn't excellent, but I feel the trade-off of loving what I do is worth it."

They want to see you succeed and will do whatever it takes to help you along the way as long as your proactive when you need help in asking for it.",Little to none pretty steep learning curve training could have been longer but that was only due to that fact they needed to get us on the phones asap.

Almost everything is self-paced as well.","Very poor engineering department which consistently releases unfinished programs, favoritism plays a major role between departments. Lately there has been a large emphasis on quantity more than quality, expecting people to compare in calls and cases purely number-wise instead of taking into consideration the quality or difficulty of the work. Literally NO testing department, opting instead to make our customers our testers. Started with a family and their close friends and ward members with a like-minded clique.

But don't you dare question them!"
317,Solutionreach,"Okay job, not a career",2013-11-21,1.0,Client Success,"Laid back environment. Regular office hours (usually). Free soda and candy. Nice office. Most of the employee are friendly, and hard working. They seem to care a lot about making society better by doing a lot of charity things. A fun environment with several company activities and awesome parties! 

Unlike many places, the sales people actually seem to be very honest and don't intentionally mislead the customers or throw customer service under the bus. 

Some team leads/supervisors who really care A LOT about their employees and will fight for them. 

Having a gym on site is really nice! I use it a lot! And there are many other perks, such as: bagel Tuesdays (also the only time the coffee isn't terrible), unlimited free soda, constantly stocked candy jar, gym/health reimbursement, 401k matching. And also, good benefits such as insurance (medical, dental, vision, and supplemental).","Directors who pretend to care but really don't. One was threatened with their job and instead of trying to improve morale, he/she tells the entire department that if he/she goes down, he/she will take the entire team with them! And when you go to him/her with a legitimate complaint or concern about your supervisor, rather than fix the problem, he/she tells you to either stop complaining or give your resignation.

Support department who used to be awesome but is now a regular call center with horrible supervisors. Some are great, but most of them have since left or been dismissed due to not agreeing with the director on methodologies or decisions. Others who aren't so great abuse company time, take advantage of their salary, and have inappropriate conversations about how often they practice trying to get pregnant. And they destroy anyone who gets in their way. And unfortunately, both HR and management enable this to happen by not doing anything and by causing fear for anyone who disagrees or complains.

HR department who has no idea what they are doing and rarely (if ever) investigates complaints of harassment, inappropriate conversations, etc. Many employees know more about HR things than the so-called ""HR department."" And you aren't allowed to question them. They will lie to you and expect you to not find out."

Abuse of laid back policy i.e. no consequences for poor professionalism, punctuality, behavior. 

no vertical movement for motivated employees. 

Growth is causing low quality employees to be hired simply because bodies are needed, leading to massive problems and issues, including major HIPAA violations. 

Upper management is very disconnected from the goings on of the typical employee. They literally have no clue what the day to day is like on the floor. 

Several mid management employees abuse their salaried positions and take a lot of time off and dont take their role/career seriously. this sets terrible examples for new and tenured employees.

You can fly under the radar for awhile and all is good and well in your department, enjoying your job and the people you work with, but be careful not to say the wrong things to the wrong person. (Just one or two people. You'll figure it out if you've been there awhile). I've seen them let 5 people go within a few months. Some of the firing seems reasonable enough but after awhile you might also see a trend of small random reasons for letting people go. Also, don't expect much in terms of raises."
