0,Spotify,Great learning opps in a cut throat environment,2022-04-07,2.0,Marketing Manager,Lots to learn their processes are slick and so is the internal technology and it’s fast paced so things are always evolving and changing as is expected for a Tech company. Lots of freebies.,"There is something off about the energy here which was in stark contrast to what I expected. The hours are inhumanely long and the people ridiculously self-serving and overtly competitive. There’s a sense of getting the job done no matter what the circumstances with little consideration given to workload and volume of work a single person has to do. And often, with the number of squads you can go round and round in circles trying to find the right contact as nobody really takes ownership of anything. Some managers are inexperienced and it shows  in their lack of people and management style and skills and with everyone being increasingly remote there’s a real lack of team togetherness."

- Daniel(the CEO) and his direct managed team is super cool, super awesome, very open to share. Probably the most frank leader I ever seen in my 9-10 years of industry experience.","Note : this is based on the team I joined and the people around it, other teams might have completely other atmosphere.

I joined during covid, everything happened remotely. I resisted myself a lot to not think negatively because I thought it might be because of covid and things will improve over the time but frankly people are rude, people are insensitive, people are not welcoming to new people joining the team. 

They are very happy within themselves, not trying to include new people in discussions and don't even listen when I try to say something, so forget about understanding me or making me understand. There is no sense of belonging. 

Sometimes I feel very depressed oftenly. I know on one and no one know me. No one entertain to new joiners in my team, I never interacted with my product manager or the engineers in other guild in my team. In meetings they mostly talk in some code words and when I try to ask they simply ignore and move on. The groups of oldies hijacks every single meeting, they dont bother asking, listening in retros, groomings, plannings etc. I used to receive feedback form initially where I tried to share my feedback but now those forms also stopped coming after the manager left.
 
Social actives are physical (not remote friendly) people meet, enjoy (it was fine till here bcz their life) and shamelessly say in group chats (slack) for people working remotely, we don't care, which hurts sometimes, I feel so useless and meaningless. There is definitely discrimination.

This is remote first company but people, teams here are not at all remote friendly, not even friendly in general. People will definitely butter up / people pleasing of the higher position people and just ignore if you are junior to them or at the same level."

I got placed into the Financial Engineering org, which operates separately from the rest of the engineering organization. It's much closer to working at a bank than a traditional software engineering organization. Deadlines are very much done in the ""waterfall"" model you see in banks, rather than a normal agile sprint organization. Engineering is seen mostly as a cost center function to support financial analysts, and there's very little room for product feedback or creative input from the engineering function.

As for the overall direction of the company I didn't really get it. I love the music product, but the podcast product is really terrible and is dragging down the rest of the product.

243,Spotify,"Good, but could be much better",2021-03-07,3.0,Software Engineer,"- You get to work at a ""cool"" company
- Good opportunities for learning
- Good tech stack for the most part
- Nice office
- Low stress work environment","- Promotions don't reflect the value you bring to the company. They seem to align with the number of years at your company. Put in enough years and you will eventually get promoted. There are a fair number of senior engineers with poor technical skills and don't contribute much to the team. On the other hand, there are juniors who contribute a lot and don't get promoted. This encourages poor performers to stay and encourages good performers to leave.
- There is a lot of overlap amongst the teams. As a result, there is a lot of duplicate work.
- Slow pace work environment. Feels like things never get done. It would be nice if coworkers have more drive and ambition. (But this could be rephrased as a positive, ""work-life-balance"")
- Lack of vision, although this depends on which group you are in."

-Salary is not as high as they could pay you compared to competitors, but at least they tell you that to your face, ha!

Also many Directors got to where they are merely by being on the team for a long time, not by being super strong managers.

345,Spotify,Worst Manager I've Ever Had,2020-08-06,1.0,Software Engineer,Some of the internal tooling was fun to play around with if you're a music nerd.,"Working at Spotify was easily the nadir of my career.

My manager basically ignored all input from everyone on the team, and didn't do much of anything in terms of providing technical leadership, or helping me with my career growth. He clearly didn't care about how long projects took to complete. Ultimately, he retaliated against myself and two other members of my team after we submitted negative feedback about him during a performance review.

Spotify does just about everything possible to allow managers to retaliate against their direct reports. Feedback is not anonymized or obfuscated at all, and managers are able to read their feedback from their direct reports before writing evaluations for their direct reports.

Overall Spotify seems like it has a broad spectrum of experiences. Some teams and some managers are presumably great, and you would never have a problem with them. However, the bad managers are very bad, and they're not going anywhere. My advice for anyone thinking of accepting a position here is to make sure you know who you would be reporting to, and how they run their team. If you can, try to get some input from the ICs on that team as well."

- Beautiful office spaces
- Transparent upper management

If you're interested in working at the intersection of music and tech--where you can really have a hand in making the audio experience better--there is no better company out there. If your primary concern is money then you're better off working at FAANG.","- Difficult to work split between Stockholm and NY -- cultural divide/differing mentalities of doing things can cause tension

Compensation is good (but not as good as other big tech companies). The NYC office is beautiful and the food program has gotten so much better over time.

Spotify is overall a great place to work if you have or are starting a family. The parental leave program is second to none and they're extremely supportive as you reintegrate back into the office.","If you care solely about maximizing compensation then Spotify might not be for you. You'll make more at any of the big tech companies, but likely the work life balance will be poor.

375,Spotify,Great company to work for,2020-02-20,5.0,Marketing Manager,"I've been working at Spotify since more than 3 years in the Premium team - a team that focuses on driving Premium subscriptions. 
It's been three amazing years even if things have been changing a lot: Spotify knows some growing pains, there is a lot of politics (the leads are trying to address that but it's not gonna be easy) and it's now become a pretty  big organization where things tend to move pretty slow.

Overall, working at Spotify has been a great experience: it's super flexible, I can work from home whenever I want, I even work sometimes from Europe (where I'm from), there is no micro management and I feel I have room to grow in my position and my work-life balance is great (and I'm encouraged to keep it healthy).

Also, there are loads of opportunities to move internally, but most of the  time inside the same orgs. 

I like the vision of the company and the leads: it's progressive and even if sometimes it takes time (sorry: ages!), they tend to take into account their employees feedbacks: less plastic in the offices, better food, reduce our carbon footprint (a great way to save money as well..), promoter gender and race equality etc.","- The reward process is not transparent.
- Over performing / working more than the average doesn't mean you'll get a reward, you'll most probably have to really fight to get it -  and that doesn't mean you'll get it.
- The reward packages are not super interesting.
- There is not a lot of horizontal career moves from an org to another (from Premium to Content for example)."

I don't think we are comparable to Google or Facebook in terms of engineering competency but we are one of the best employers in every other way.

- Great benefits
- Incredibly diverse (in many ways - terms of gender, ethnicity, languages, etc)
- Passionate about audio
- Incentivizes learning (via conferences, internal trainings, embeds)
- Easy to move around, either team or role
- Plenty of colleagues with personality
- A handful of world class engineers that are easy to talk to
- Daniel and C-level management are refreshingly transparency. Huge fan of Daniel, Gustav, Barry's personality and approach to business. Honoured to work under them.
- Positive work environment
- Never afraid of change
- Truly autonomous, each team mostly operates as its own ""business""
- We make decisions primarily based on our own insight/views, secondly what our customers are saying, and thirdly what our competitors are doing. Priorities are right
- We are 100% working on the right thing. Everything proves towards it
- Incredible afterworks and summer/winter parties
- Huge emphasis on team over individual
- Great investments in technical infrastructure, ie Kubernetes/Kotlin/Swift
- Real work-life balance, in true Swedish fashion","- It can be slow to make decisions or ship (but being here for a while, I'm not entirely convinced if this is just due to a sprint vs marathon mindset. But yes it's very intentional from management)
- Astoundingly poor manager retention (I am seeing managers leave left right and center, unclear why this is the case, and this will affect your personal growth)
- Constant state of change in terms of restructuring (although you do get used to it, but it will affect your individual goals potentially significantly)
- Promotion culture is weak. It has good intentions, but fails to work time and time again. Two examples: first is one person didn't get promoted because ""they didn't ask for it"" (and others don't because ""they ask too much rather than doing"") and the second example is I saw someone not get promoted because they did not show enough loyalty in their tribe. Has nothing to do with our newly introduced promotion framework and plays a part in why we struggle to maintain senior talent.
- To my surprise, the longer you've been at Spotify the lower your salary has proven to be (and the new hires get offered significantly higher base salaries). I am not even sure if it is a good idea to just leave and come back 6 months later. Intentions are good, but in reality performs astoundingly with varying results. I am also unclear how this compares with other companies.
- Increasingly political and process-driven, which doesn't suit individuals who want to stay as individuals. This makes us increasingly slower to execute
- HR seems to rule the business. No exceptions exists in Spotify. This seems to stem from Swedish business culture where there are no exceptions. Don't work harder, it is not valued. Work hard during your paid hours and you'll be fine. You have to be a role higher than HR, such as a senior business leader, to be remotely considered as an exception."

Countless reorganizations that lead to endless meetings on redefining strategy, manager chains etc.
Very rare to find a manager that cares about your personal career growth. It's 100% on you to manage it, which is fine so long as there is proper training, opportunities, and guidance as to how to do that. How do you drive your own development here when managers are hesitant to let you embed and your team's work/culture is slow, unexciting and lacking any real technical challenge?"

- benefits are quite good, including vacation and parental leave
- nice product that people outside the company know and respect 
- other perks, like lunch in the US office, are very welcome
- compensation is comparable to other mid-tier tech or media companies, although it falls well short of the top tier","- This is probably one of the worst-managed companies in the world, making the experience of working here miserable unless you somehow land on the right team
- bizarre organization design (missions? Tribes?) that seems like it was deliberately intended to create a host of dysfunctional fiefdoms, silos, and sleepy backwaters 
- deeply insecure and insular culture that can be hostile to new ideas, outside influence, and critical thinking- it might look like a fun Californian tech company on the surface but it is anything but open and transparent underneath it
- cross team communication and collaboration is spectacularly broken: it’s gotten to be almost impossible to get anything done unless you can do it by yourself
- the tech stack is badly fragmented and riddled with system-level architecture debt, making things like decent data infrastructure and common developer tooling impossible
- senior management is left over from the startup phase and hasn’t yet been replaced by a professional management team - and other than the excellent ex-Netflix CFO, boy does it show
- no one is actually accountable for anything because virtually all decisions must take place though a bewildering process of group consensus, where people who are ignorant of the topic at hand somehow have just as much of a say as the experts 
- middle managers, including engineering managers, are, by and large, very junior, tend to lack any qualifications for their positions (favoritism again), and might put in 25 hours a week on average, including fikas and 1:1s with direct reports to talk about their feelings
- functions like HR and administration can be disturbingly unprofessional and more than a bit lax about following things like, well, local laws
- the company does a poor job of investing in its staff - for example, there are few training or development opportunities. You’re expected to ”wing it” in any job without any instruction or the expectation of having any professional skills
- an alarmingly large percentage of employees seem to be either openly disrespectful of one another or permanently angry, or both"

Never have I worked somewhere where there is such a focus on staff well being and staff engagement. The office environment is second to none - We moved in last year and it’s absolutely wonderful. It’s been designed with staff in mind so there are loads amazing areas to work from, you have the Hideaway which is for quiet working with cool sofas and a smoothie bar, Fitness Studio, collaborative squad areas for teams, the ‘pitstop’ for grab and go items with fridges stocked to the brim with free food and drinks and we are all eagerly awaiting new new ground floor to open which will include a stage area, cafeteria for free hot meals, coffee shop, games rooms etc.
 Spotify is unique in that it is headquartered out of Stockholm. New York and London are its 2nd and 3rd biggest hubs. You get to travel pretty frequently if you so wish which one of my favourite things about the company - It’s truly global. All meeting rooms are decked out with Google Hangouts too so it’s super easy to have video calls with anyone no matter their location . All staff get new Apple Macs upon joining and the choice of  an Android or iPhone - We are very lucky to be given the very latest in technology whereas lots of my previous companies would give staff pretty old stuff to work with. The benefits are insane such as stock options upon joining, Bupa Dental, Bupa Healthcare, 6 months full pay maternity and paternity benefit with a 7th month gradual back to work, 12% pension (4% you 8% Spotify), 6 free counselling sessions a year, flu vaccinations, weekly massages, agile working so you can work from home pretty frequently thanks to Google Hangouts, crazy amount of free food and snacks daily and great Summer and Holiday parties too. 

Everyone is super friendly which make it an incredibly enjoyable environment to work in.",We hire 120 every month globally so there needs to be a focus on ensuring that the culture remains there. That’s like the size of a company every month.

Parts of the company are working hard on improving diversity, inclusion, belonging and physical and mental health","The tech, especially in Consumer BU, is full of custom-built locally optimized legacy decisions. Spotify can't get ahead of its legacy tech because decisions made today are still short-sighted, immature and unscalable. This is a result of 2 historical facets that haven't changed enough as the company grew:

1. Cross-functional autonomous teams: These teams are supposed to be self-sufficient units and are bound to become silos that make technology decisions that only suit themselves. Spotify's products reflect the org structure. The inconsistencies in the consumer experience across the various apps is unparalleled in consumer tech - you even get different search results for the same query on different apps. Each of these apps might as well have been made by different companies. This has historically prevented platform-thinking. Every app is an unnecessarily different clone of the same functionality, even if it could have been built using the same reusable technologies. This is unfortunately not improving either.

2. Chapter Leads: To promote cross-team collaboration and alignment, Spotify had Chapter Leads - people managers with reports from different teams. In reality, this created a gaping hole in technical leadership that could have prevented the misguided decision-making. The focus on leadership at Spotify is disproportionately on people management and woolly leadership qualities versus technical expertise, systems thinking and delivery management. This hasn't changed even as the company has moved toward replacing Chapter Leads with Engineering Managers.

While you will hear a lot of harp about diversity, inclusion and belonging, a lot of the leadership actually enforces conformism to vague ideals and behaviours while acting like a cool boys club. Many business decisions are taken over after-hours private conversations between old-timer white often Swedish males and then dictated top-down. Every so often, a mail forwarded from leadership is in Swedish. While these can be easily translated, this is symptomatic of a bigger problem.

The conformism wipes out any diversity of thought or ideas. It has often been witnessed that radical ideas (like building reusable scalable platforms) are suppressed until the cool boys club sees merit in them and then they are dictated top-down without any credit to the people who had been harping about it for so long. Most of the constructive or critical feedback you'll get is about how to conform, not about your technical solutions, productivity or impact. Unless you're at the beginning of your career, you'll learn very little from your manager and peers. For the years I've been here, I've never been able to shake off the feeling of being an outsider.

Because things aren't built to plug into a larger system and be reusable across products, reinvention of the wheel has become an internal joke."

If you care about producing work, this is not the place for you. Do NOT put your trust in managers. Here, they are just as destructive to your personal goals as they are ineffectual in helping you realize any professional development. 

Additionally, if you’re a person of color don’t expect Leadership to create a safe work environment for you.

Pay is mid-tier. Still great if you're comfortable knowing most SWE's at other tech companies make more than you.
Great insurance, vacation policy, and parental leave.","With great wlb and autonomy comes some seriously unmotivated employees who take forever to get anything done. Maybe it's because the hiring bar has seriously lowered or maybe it's because there's no bonus structure combined with the fact that Spotify will probably not fire you as long as you push some code and are a fun/nice person. 

Regardless, at some point, you're going to realize you spend 40 hours a week at work and would like to spend most of it NOT trying to motivate underperforming teammates to actually code and NOT deal with process heavy and debilitating consensus-driven product decisions that get trashed in 6 months because you're re-orged to some other part of the company.

Spotify is honestly great if you're a parent or just want to coast because they expect so little from you. That said, if you're ambitious and find satisfaction from actually building great products with hardworking and innovative teammates I'd refrain from coming here."

- getting a promotion is not easy, the whole system is a bit weird for me. The people who decide if you are worthy are people you are not working with. In order to move forward you need to increase your visibility, which means that everyone gets a lot of company-wide emails from people trying to do exactly that about topics that are not important.

 - Smart and friendly co-workers
 - Several learning/training opportunities
 - CV Booster: Everyone is excited to hear you worked at Spotify
 - Good work-life balance, although that is more a Sweden thing than a Spotify thing.","All said here is true as well:

 - Salary: It is average for the Swedish market, which means you will find similar offers elsewhere
 - Career advancement: A lot of buzzwords, process and manuals designed to obfuscate performance evaluation. The bottom line is this: If you want to advance your career at Spotify, be sure to do lots of self-promotion, and don't disagree with your managers. Even then, though, Spotify will rather hire someone from the outside, rather than promote you.
 - Management: As a consequence from the above, lots of managers aren't the best or the smartest, but the loudest and flashiest. As such, lots of the decisions they make are aimed at looking good, at the expense of product quality and engineering teams.  This is particularly true for Product managers at Spotify, who in practice act as ruling party.
 - Passive-agressive politics: Teams do not coordinate, and try to avoid each other in the race for getting their own thing done. This leads to chaos, aimless re-orgs and routine passive-aggressive communication.
 - Dogmatism: For a company that preaches openness and selfless behavior, there is a lot of cult of personality towards key figures, and lots of empty self-pride in lots of the processes and models created by the company, which leads to them being thought of as unquestionable truths.
 - Fear of failure: Failure is swept under the rug, and cannot be discussed openly, otherwise you will become an outcast, while middle managers get promoted for posturing while the company flounders.

However, the biggest con is Tech:
Tech at Spotify is trailing miserably, at least in Mobile, strangled by a bunch of internal ""wheel-reinvented"" tools that impair innovation and adopting the most recent industry standards for technology. If you like doing new stuff with antique tools, and filled with lots of cumbersome, Spotify-only systems, look no further."

458,Spotify,The scariest and most manipulative owner I’ve encountered,2019-03-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Salaries are very high.  Roughly 15% to 35% above average across the board.,"Don’t work here.  Don’t even consider it.  Send a linked in message to any former employee and see what they have to say.  Don’t be blinded by the money.  Trust me.

The culture is terrifying.  The owner hires and fires people constantly.  He fires people without reason and cites the state’s “at will employment” status as his only justification. To my knowledge, only 1 of the 19 people fired over my 14 months with the company was related to performance issues. 

The owner has a particular penchant for firing women.  Of the women who worked at SS Industries the day I started, all but 2 were fired or quit by the time I was eventually fired.  He even fired his personal assistant (also a woman).  When I was fired, I was simply told it wasn’t working out and then HR told me the company would love to be a glowing reference for me as I applied elsewhere.  It was a nightmare.

Because no one ever feels secure in the job, the culture at SS Industries has a foundation of fear and paranoia.  It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen in my life.  Every day you dread 5pm.  Every day it feels like you’re going to conclude work with a game of Russian roulette.  “Will I get fired today? Let’s spin the chamber and find out.”  Waking up every morning is a death march.  

Speaking for myself, I was fired via the blindside (the owner’s favorite tactic).  I was showered with compliments the day before.  I was told I was the kind of employee good businesses build around.  I was told I was essential.  The next day I went to a meeting in the conference room at 3pm and I was fired.  I then sat there as my colleagues all walked past and saw me crying hysterically.  I was the 5th blindside That occurred over the course of 14 months.

The worst part ends up being the salary.  Because you’re making way more money than you should based on position and experience, you get locked into your job at SS Indistries and can’t leave without taking a pay cut.  Additionally, the owner famously scours job boards and LinkedIn to see if anyone on his staff might be looking for another job.  So everyone is terrified to look elsewhere because you know your resume will be found by the owner of SS Indistries.  I was advised to never update my LinkedIn while I worked at SS Indistries because the owner, Sam, would interpret that as me entertaining other job opportunities.

SS Indistries is the worst company I’ve ever encountered."
459,Spotify,Sounds sexier than it is,2019-02-18,3.0,Senior Engineer,"Spotify has a solid engineering culture. With roughly 1,000 engineers around the globe (though mostly in Stockholm and NYC) there is a lot of internal tooling, which is sometimes hard to debug: the documentation is not always great and there is no help outside of the company. However, the overwhelming majority of the engineers are extremely helpful and spend their time generously helping you debug issues with the internal infrastructure, although the situation has improved as the tooling has matured.

There are several standardized guides for different disciplines: mobile development, back-end engineering, data engineering, data science, and a few others. These are especially good for newcomers as these allow you to get up and running within a few hours.

Hack days (2 per month) and an R&D-wide hack week (5 day per annum) are great. These days allow you work on whatever project you wish, so it's great for learning new programming languages, reading up on research, trying out a new framework, or even work on crazy ideas. Annual hack weeks are a major event where all of R&D spends a whole week working on non-work things. There are daily breakfasts, fikas (Swedish cake time), and various events in the office, including a party on Friday to conclude and celebrate hack week.

Conference week is another annual event, where different ""chapters"" (disciplines) hold their internal (un-)conferences. This means most of R&D flies across the globe for a week of showing off what's new in the infrastructure and what tools are available or being developed. There are also annual off-sites, where an entire ""tribe"" (department) comes together at a non-office location. Most of these off-sites tend to be about socializing as there are often about 100 people or so. Most employees seem to enjoy networking with beers at a fancy location, while a few see it for what it is: a colossal waste of time, especially personal time: you have to travel several hours back and forth to spend 24 hours a day with your peers for no other reason than to listen to a few strategy talks, unconference sessions (i.e. discussions that do not need to have any clear outcomes), and eating/drinking. After about two days, the event is over. If you like trips, these are all great. If you prefer to stick to business and keep travel to a minimum because of other commitments or interests, not so much.

It's great that every employee can choose the laptop they want and you get a fancy desk that can be moved up and down for standing up or sitting down. Any gear you need to be productive or comfortable is usually a simple request from your boss and a click away. It's a no-fuss attitude to whatever people need for their work. Please note that the office areas are not exactly quiet or private, especially in the larger offices. The idea is that an open office plan fosters collaboration, but it's really because it's cheaper and the company is growing like mad.

Intro days are a three-day event where hundreds of newcomers flock to Stockholm to listen to talks from the CXOs and VPs about the company. It is a great way to introduce people to the company. The same goes for town halls, where the entire company is invited to listen on the latest updates from the executives.

Most offices are fairly easy when it comes to working from home. In most cases you inform your team about it and that's it. As long as the work gets done and you don't work from home every day of the week, it's all right. You're free to come and go as you please as you don't have to clock in/out.

In many offices there is sometimes music playing in all areas, not just the reception or central bits. While this is great in theory, it's not always conducive to quality work, especially when people play ""Pink Fluffy Unicorns Dancing on Rainbows"" or a sequence of 8-bit versions of 80s power ballads. Headphones are definitely a must on those days. Again, when you join you get a pair of headphones, so you're at least covered there.","If you are not in the main offices (Stockholm or New York) many benefits are not available to you or only after extensive begging. It took several years for Swedish to be offered to foreign employees in the Gothenburg office and even then it was only through a conference call, not on site. Many discounts or special deals (e.g. with banks) are also only available in shops around the major offices, which means employees in the other offices are often left out. 

The time between the official announcement of a promotion and the time when it's registered in the HR system can take up to four months, during which of course the question of a potential salary bump is neatly avoided. I have yet to receive a good explanation why it takes so long or why the company is loath to discuss salary increases for people it deems worthy of promotions. 

The stock options are laughable. Permanent employees do not get many when they join and stock options are granted for exceptional performance, not RSUs, which means you first have to pay for the privilege of getting at the shares. In Sweden you can even pay taxes of up to 90% (e.g. cashless exercise or same-day sale), which means the options are mostly a gift for the government.

There is somewhat of a frat house culture, which is considered ""playful"", one of the company's values. This translates into pinball machines, nerf guns, hoverboards, free snacks and drinks, many office parties, ping-pong and billiards tables, Fridays where people walk around in bunny/unicorn/squirrel costumes and drink beer or wine in the afternoon, board games coming out of your ears, Mario Kart competitions, and the likes. The relaxed environment is definitely nice and a big plus. The ""playfulness"" is for some people a major bonus, while for others it feels silly or yet another way to keep people in the office longer. For those who don't participate, it's an easy way to be excluded and being labelled ""not fun"".

Office parties encourage employees to bring along their friends and families. The same goes for sports events. While some love to socialize with colleagues outside of work, that's definitely not for everyone. Again, while it can promote togetherness, it also causes cliques to be formed. The lack of clear boundaries can also be a fast track to burn-out, although most employees are too young to have experienced (or care about it), or they do not mind melding work and their private lives.

Diversity and inclusion are major threads running through the company. A good initiative that's hampered by the idea that inclusion and equality stop at gender and sexuality, but mostly gender. People with a different personality who differ from the norm are often treated as outcasts, especially if these people do not participate in the many social events (outside of work hours). I doubt that happens on purpose, but it definitely happens. While that's to be expected, there have been occasions in which a manager called out a person (an engineer) for not smiling enough. The reason was that others thought the person was perceived to be intimidating by not having a friendly face. There are also not too many people over the age of 35-40 within the company, especially in engineering roles.

Email threads with several dozen or even a hundred people who all hit ""Reply All"" are very common, especially when congratulating people on promotions or when people join the company. Fortunately, you can mute those conversations when they arrive but they are still annoying as they clog up your inbox. The same is true of mutual appreciation email threads. While it could be said such emails are to keep people informed and ""celebrate wins"", they usually only show that the group of included people was too large or that the bar for ""celebrations"" was really low. Hardly a thread goes by without a GIF or meme.

""Lunch and Learn"" sessions are terrible. Yes, the company pays for the lunch, which for some people is the sole reason to show up. But it's also a way to keep on working when you should really be resting your mind. In a sense, it's also insulting to the speaker who cannot eat during the usual lunch hour but has to talk to a group of people who are masticating and listening with half an ear.

Let's not beat about the bush: middle management is incompetent. Apart from sitting in meetings most of the day, there is not a lot they achieve, if anything. Most employees have half an hour every other week when they talk to their superior in a one-on-one. Those times tend to be eaten up with inane questions about projects the managers have no real idea about but heard mentioned in a meeting by someone else. Furthermore, it's not uncommon these sessions are cancelled on short notice due to managers being too busy or away at another office. I have had three different managers in my time at Spotify and not one of my superiors had a notebook (or laptop) with them for jotting down notes during such a 1:1. If a piece of paper was needed, the room's post-its and Sharpies were used for that. There is hardly ever any follow-up because, well, I guess, they forget where they stuck the post-its after the meeting.

The same goes for agile coaches. The company has dozens of them in most larger offices. What they do I don't know. They sometimes facilitate a retrospective for a team, but other than that they seem to be evangelists of productivity fads, such as the pomodoro technique.

Every six months employees need to ask feedback from their coworkers, which as far as I have been able to determine is only because otherwise the managers have no idea of their underlings' achievements or performance. They are not involved in the ""squad"" (i.e. team) work and there is typically a product manager per team who does the day-to-day prioritization and stakeholder management, although the latter tends to be outsourced to employees too. The feedback is (as is to be expected when asking peers) fuzzy at best. People obviously don't take notes about their coworkers, so it's often a five-minute rehash of what they can remember from the past week or so, watered down by the fact that no one wants to go on record saying their colleague is a complete jerk.

The feedback is not used as a means to cause changes in behaviour as that's left to the employee to decide whether they want to. While that's good as it leaves the employee in question in charge of their own (professional) development, it's also very loose, leading to no real change whatsoever. It mostly feels like an exercise in futility. You are required to fill in a sheet with accomplishments ahead of time, so that your manager can see what you did. It's also hard to accept the advice of a manager when that same manager hasn't the slightest idea what you did and whether you did it well - nor the means necessary to make such an assessment. Employees who do the work without making a big fuss about it often get short-changed: self-promotion is the way to make sure you're seen as a high performer, whether you actually did the work or not.

Every year there is a reorganization within R&D, not because there is a specific need that needs to be addressed, but because it's reorg season. In most cases, these reorgs amount to nothing more than relabelling departments and shuffling a handful of people around. In the years I've been at the company I've seen a reorg every single year without having seen any tangible benefits. I understand there is no single organizational structure that solves all problems, but the rationale for reorgs is often lacking or at the very least not entirely clear. Even after several years it's opaque how decisions are made. Data-driven decision-making is a lie.

One of the key insight is that although Spotify started off as a music streaming company, the actual work has very little to do with music for the overwhelming majority of engineers. Don't be fooled into thinking the company has a flat hierarchy either. From a regular engineer up to the C-suite are 5-6 people in some departments. That's not to say the company is overly focused on processes, although that's starting to increase as it grows (up)."

My managers are always looking out for us and want to see us grow and progress in our careers. Things are always changing at Spotify, which is great because you are never bored.

Promotions are a crap-shoot. I couldn't tell you how they get decided and management probably can't either.

If you work as a data scientist, prepare to deal with a painful data infrastructure, no central oversight of data quality, an absence of analytics data engineers, and a lot of repetitive a/b test analysis because of how broken that system is.

And then they experiment with processes and reorgs which have no proven track record of working.

Employees are rewarded for talking and face time vs impact. So if you want to succeed here regardless of your title, come with a marketing background. Engineers suffer pretty bad amongst all this because their managers are inexperienced and not able to help them grow. A bad engineer gets worse, and a good engineer never gets rewarded because he/she is busy working so much that they don't have time to craft a story for their promotion.

There's a great amount of autonomy for the engineers with a potential for growth and startup-like sense of ownership, if you land on the team that fits (needless to say that changing teams is allowed). 
On-call policy makes sense. Engineering ecosystem is quite mature and standardized (both data and backend).","It's amazing how Spotify grew during the last 2 years. There are still a lot of fun and passionate people around, but some are leaving. 
At some point there was a deficit of senior engineers, and a lot of teams were in need of (but lacked) some guidance and a sense of direction from the management. The problem seems to be fixing itself slowly, yet some services that were ""hacked together"" still exist and do need maintenance.
Engineering used to be more innovative and less leaning on out-of-the-box solutions, such as GCP stack. It makes sense from the operational point of view, but I feel like Spotify's own R&D has the capacity to generate more value by building amazing things in-house."

It provides a  good package for people who are building their families (paternity and maternity leaves are excellent for American standards).

Engineers are not expected to work too much in general, therefore the company offers a good work-life balance.","Spotify leaves a lot to be desired in a few areas:

* HR is highly inefficient, and despite its supposedly progressive policies, it rarely aligns with the interest of allowing people to do the best of their work, and mostly serves the purpose of protecting the management of the organization. On the other hand, as far as you never have to deal with HR, they won't get in your way. 

* Interviewing with the company is a true nightmare, both for interviewees and interviewers. Nobody seems to believe the way we interview and handle candidates is efficient at all, but we keep doing the same, while losing good people in the process.

* The company is surprisingly vertical and hierarchical. Too much power is given to leads and middle managers, to the point that entire structures depend on single managers to exist, and when they leave the company (which happens quite often), their organizations fall apart leaving dozens of people in the limbo.

* Managers are usually not experienced (being managers for the first or second time in their careers). The incentive for them to be managers is related to the pay grade and visibility, as opposed to what they are actually looking for to grow professionally.

* Most product owners are failed technical people who want to grow their careers by going vertical, incentivized by the low pay in the engineering side. They frequently believe that they are managers of some sort, and don't really understand what it takes to implement products.

* It doesn't pay well, scoring in the 70-80% of the market average. This is a major hurdle and stops experienced people to either come, or to stay in the organization. Engineers only afford to be underpaid for a couple years before leaving, and the ones who stay only do so because they are not competitive in the market, or because they are locked in due to stock options or visa constraints. Pay reviews can only happen once a year, through a process that is arbitrary and disconnected from actual performance and workers' market value, as pay raises are capped by HR.

* From the moment you enter the organization until the day you leave it, you are going to be dragged into an seemingly infinite amount of pointless meetings that will consume at least 50% of your time. That seems to be a fundamental part of the culture in the organization, in which everything has to be agreed and communicated on; except that this is rarely the case as managers keep to themselves what's truly important, and collective decisions are just a way to rubber-stamp decisions that have been already made. Engineers keep pointing out that this is a major issue productivity-wise, but management does nothing to stop it.

* Engineers are incentivized to prioritize work outside of their teams instead of delivering for their teams due to the way levels and promotions work. This contributes to more meetings, documents, politics and perception-based work as opposed to technical innovation.

* Do not expect to grow your career at Spotify. You'll stick to your role, level and salary during your stay there. The company truly prefers to hire new people to fill positions (even though most of the time those people have no better experience than existing employees) as opposed to promote their own people. You only have a chance to get somewhere in the organization if you start doing politics from the day you start."

- in the NY office, get used to very early meetings, being excluded from decisions, or being jetlagged and using personal time to fly over

- very slow moving company, very hard to get teams to cooperate with each other, and management doesn't realize this is a problem

- senior leadership isn't experienced or won't bring alignment between teams/departments, and the ceo is young and ""fratty""

- many of their titles aren't standard, which hurts people's resumes. I don't see the purpose of calling teams ""squads"" and departments ""tribes"" except to create an unnecessary insider clique. 

- overstaffed on ""leadership"" roles like agile coach, honcho, product manager, and chapter lead relative to number of engineers, which contributes to the lack of speed and difficulty creating alignment

- some roles like ""agile coach"" and ""honcho"" don't seem to contribute anything to the department"

Every week we receive automated surveys about our jobs and how do we feel about it - top management then follows up on these surveys to try improve what's going bad.
The company is politically engaged and support values that I do support as well (recruiting people from all backgrounds, countries, sex and sexual orientations, having 0 tolerance for sexual harassment etc). 
Sometimes this politics goes a bit too far in my opinion but better that way than the other way around.
Spotify is a very Swedish company in the way it works, with great perks, motivated employees and this feeling that we are all part of a same project (maybe the stock option scheme for all employees helps a lot with that).","Not so much to say here.

Innovative. 10% time to work on personal projects in R&D, no questions asked. New ideas are encouraged and rewarded. 

Pretty laid back if you just want to do the tasks required. However, you do need to work extra to move up.

Fun, vibrant office, and great colleagues. 

Nice perks. The free food and alcohol keep flowing. It's easy to get permission to travel to other offices or conferences. Generous PTO, free health insurance, flexible WFH,","The religious adherence to Agile Scrum makes teams lose sight of the big picture or goals longer than 2 weeks.  Too many pointless meetings. Too many Agile coaches and people managers. Standups and Jira give a false sense of accomplishment for incremental tasks. If anything is accomplished by the engineers despite all this, the product manager takes all the credit.

Leadership is white male, and while diversity is always talked about to sound politically correct, the reality is different. Hiring, compensation, and promotion policies are surprisingly sexist and racist. Non-whites (including Asians), women, and some internationals are held to a higher standard than all-American white guys in the US offices, but the useless diversity rhetoric makes people assume the exact opposite."

- Due to the growth of the company, there's a re-education process that's continuous as new teams and responsibilities are developed.

Benefits are good (pay is not great).","There is favouritism in the business and many cliques. Management have their favourites and if you aren't in the clique you won't advance. Managers are very junior and don't offer much guidance. Because subscriptions keep going up, they can ignore the poor leadership. Many of the good leadership has been leaving showing further how good hard working people don't advance unless they are part of the cliques. Get some adults making decisions and start holding people accountable. There are many people abusing the travel and doing whatever they want and no one is paying attention. The C level team needs some training in change management - there have been big changes and how they have been rolled out is a joke. Free food, concerts and crowded offices, aren't cutting it. I loved my job, but my future was going to be limited in this circus."

Some of the things we do are cutting edge and touch the product directly, but it can be hard to get a chance to work on such projects. There are lots of external speakers who come in and meet-ups hosted, for employees to get further education and professional development. Many of the lead team, including the CEO, are inspiring and make you feel happy to work here. Benefits are great. Salary is reasonable. Options package not so good, but what do you expect for a company at this stage.","Certain parts of the company have gotten to be extremely hierarchical; the legendary 'flat' organization is becoming a thing of the past. Even worse, as a technical person you could easily find yourself managed by people who have no expertise in that area. This is not true everywhere, but I have seen it in Content and Data organisations. There are a growing number of people whose jobs are to manage, organize, be 'thought leaders', or executives. Depending on which part of the company, the ratio between these people and those doing actual work can be higher than 2:1. There are also very frequent reorgs, but I suppose this is standard everywhere these days. In general, it's just becoming a little corporate...it's gotten too big. The CEO is clearly very passionate, inspiring, and has gotten us this far, but a few of his goals seem naive or idealistic. The product-centered focus that made the company great is not strong enough everywhere."

Beyond that Spotify offers great benefits in the US and I feel fairly compensated for my role and my manager and team are both amazing.,"Growing pains. Starting at Spotify was a little bit of a cold shower, having heard so many great things about the culture and how we work. Turns out it's not all roses and daisies, shouldn't be that surprising, we are all humans after all? What troubles me is the recent re-orgs and the communication around those. So many things are in such a stark contrast from the Spotify values and from what we say we represent outwards. 

Spotify's leadership also needs to do better when it comes to diversity. Despite what is being said I feel that it is not a top priority from our leaders and it is painful to see how it is affecting the minority groups in the company. Good thing: The grass roots are strong and gets support. So it's a mixed bucket and very mixed signals."

Fridges full of food/drinks/ice creams and lots of free snacks/pastries/cupcakes/cereals/porridges and everything you can think of ordering form tesco - free of course. Then you get free restaurant deliveries were you can order endless foods depending what is setup for deliveries that week.

Their SWAT team organise events like paint balling and go karting as well as free cinema nights out to see new movies. They are also open to suggestions if you have something in mind you want to do.

FREE trips around the world to other spotify offices such as america/sweden/philippines. We even met Daniel Ek in SWEDEN.

breaks any time you want them with a 1 hour lunch - no asking a manager if you can go on break.

decent pay

you get a free macbook pro when you start with your own locker. 13"" only though

really helpful people who are always willing to help with emails

you do not have to deal with customer on the phone very often as it is all email based 

full kitchen with microwave and blender as well as table tennis with a ps4/xbox to play with on your breaks

lots of discounts in stores around cambridge for spotify employees","there are cons.

no parking any time you want. there is a parking rota that you have to be on and you are rarely on it. sucks if you live far away like me as you have to find parking on the streets and risk tickets some days

no more hiring of perm employees so you work for an agency who can fire you within a second notice. this will never change.

perm employees get free premium and temps will never get it

night shifts - this is support for the outsourcing team who need help with cases and have much less access to change things for customers - they SUCK

the office is not that great - everything is always broken and never fixed"

633,Spotify,Could be so much better - shift work sucks.,2017-02-07,5.0,Customer Service Advisor,"Great benefits. Free food every day. Sometimes the shift work can benefit you if you need a particular day off. Some progression is available but normally after a long time in the same position - 3 years normally - some advisors have been stuck in the same job since they started. 

Lots of support from management - you have a lot of tools to work with and there's a lot of education. 

The office is very relaxed.","Awful shift patterns - overnight shifts are required which means you miss out on a lot which is happening during the day. You feel very left behind when on any shift that isn't 6-3 or 9-6. 1-10 shifts have a massive impact on your social life. Weekend shifts suck, too. 

We're not permanent employees and are actually employees of an agency meaning we can be dismissed at any time - not great job security. Some people who do the same work as us are permanent and have other benefits - bonuses based on performance, less weekend shifts and stock options. 

Nepotism runs wild, many jobs are given to people with less experience/skills if they're a friend of someone higher up or in a relationship with them."

And yet, it doesn't take long for you to realize that despite the fact that people seem to be constantly socializing and just hanging out, a TON of work actually gets done. 

Career development is carefully maintained, and as the company grows, it regularly evaluates whether the paradigms that are in place are still valid.

I have also long had a good view of the general business decisions made by Spotify, especially in the recent years, but any doubts I ever had about the decisions that they made were blown away when I was exposed to some of the stuff they are working on.

667,Spotify,Fun place to work!,2016-10-07,5.0,,"Great culture, the tech team is top notch and very knowledgeable. The always stocked beer fridge, live shows don't hurt either.",Honestly I can't think of any downsides to working there.
668,Spotify,Developer at Spotify Stockholm,2016-09-24,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"A developer position at Spotify may be good for you or not, depending on what's important to you, and at what point you are in your career. There a lot of good things about Spotify, and there's plenty of bad things too. I try to be honest and objective in my review. A note of warning: what I write are not absolute truths; all these depend on the team you work on, or the manager you have, or the recruiter you meet. Those can make a huge difference in your day-to-day work experience.


The good:

* Relaxed Work Environment: Spotify has a very relaxed work environment. Failure is tolerated and even embraced. You will not be penalized for mistakes; you'll be encouraged to learn from them, to become better and avoid them in the future.

* Great Product: Spotifiers take a lot of pride in creating value for the customer, improving people's lives, and making the world better through music. Most people live this mentality and it is encouraged throught the company by the leadership. Each person works hard to create a product with high quality and attention to detail.

* Great Colleagues: Generally, the bar is quite high at Spotify. Spotify strives to hire people that are excellent in their field, and above the bar for their level. They also try to hire good people, not just great developers. 

* Social Life: You will probably attend a lot of great parties at Spotify and many events with visiting artists. There are great Summer and Christmas parties every year, and after-works every two weeks. The Social Team organizes trips and activities all year round, so there is always something to do, and it's easy to get a social life if you're new in Sweden.

* Brand Name: If you have work experience at Spotify, it's a huge asset in your CV, especially in Sweden. Recruiters go nuts for Spotify people on LinkedIn. (This might not be so great some times.)

* Diversity: Spotify pays a lot of attention to diversity, and they try to hire and promote women in tech. Everybody gets diversity training when they start. Spotify isn't perfect, but they're trying really hard to be on par or better that the tech industry in that.

* Learning: Spotify is a challenging environment where the bar is set quite high. When I first joined I realized that I was playing at completely different level of competence and had to up my game. I learned a lot through that, and with a lot of help from my colleagues.

* Work/Life Balance: Nobody will ask you to work overtime, without any significant reason. The company wants you to have a balance between your work and private life, and your manager will help you keep it.","* Accountability: You will probably not be held accountable for anything you do as a dev (in most teams), unless it's terribly catastrophic. This is good if you're a junior developer and you're just starting in your field. You should not be afraid to ask questions, or fail. But it's a double-edge sword. You'll also not be rewarded for extra effort or achievement.

* Salary: Generally, other companies pay better. Spotify tends to pay engineers less than the national average and they often pride themselves for that. (The recruiters often say this openly to journalists and conferences. But it's a different story if you work in a US office.) If you're not from Sweden, some Spotify recruiters will try to sign you up with as little as they can get away with, but you should be able to negotiate a higher salary. Note that rents in Sweden are high; you should set aside 12-14k SEK for rent each month if you're moving to a furnished second-hand apartment.

* Salary Parity: Developers and QA are generally not paid according to skill or achievements, but negotiation skills. There are huge differences between developers of the same experience and achievement. Also, due to the fact that salary ranges are not published, it's impossible to negotiate properly. In addition to that, there are huge differences depending on the teams that are politically better e.g. a mobile dev will get less than an analytics dev, irrespective of their achievements or experience. QAs tend to get less than developers, and design and product tend to get way more.

* Stock Options: The stock options program at Spotify is quite limited and you get an insignificant fraction of the available options. You also get taxed quite heavily; the Swedish state will get at least 52% on the price difference, before you even sell them (profit is calculated on converting the options to shares). Taxes are much lower if you work for a small company (with fewer than 300 employees).

* Personal Growth: If you're looking to grow your skills beyond development, Spotify can be tricky. The opportunities you get depend on the people you work under, and the tech org structure side you're on. There is no definite programme or structure setup to allow for growth; you will probably need to push and prod (and sometimes fight) with some of your superiors in order to get more training.

* Lack of Training and Development: Spotify does internal training only, and it's limited to some soft skills. If you want to attend an external course, even if it will help you do your job better, Spotify will not support you in any way with that.

* Management: Despite the company's efforts, management is a mixed bag. There are good and bad managers, and they don't really get evaluated so much. There is no structured feedback for your immediate manager; if you have a bad one, you might be stuck with her/him for a while.

* Attitudes Towards Developers: There is an underlying attitude by the leaders of the company that developers are replaceable, and that seniority or experience doesn't really matter. The company's recruitment efforts can be summed up as ""we need more warm bodies fast to write the code"". HR makes zero effort to make Spotify attractive to senior developers, and often people don't stay longer that 3-4 years.

* No Way Up for Senior Developers: There is no way up for developers. If you want to grow upwards as a developer, and not become a manager somehow, you're out of luck. There is only one level for developers, and maybe you can call yourself ""Senior"" in your LinkedIn profile, if you've stayed with the company for several years.

* Slow Pace of Change: The tech work environment doesn't change very much. Despite the fact that there are several well-known problems in how we work, inc. those mentioned above, the tech leadership is loath to make real changes and when they do, it takes them forever to implement them.

* Scrum Micromanagement: If taken to extremes, Scrum can be as heavy as waterfall. There are teams at Spotify that micromanage every little task and the bureaucracy around little things can be frustrating. There is also an open question, if such teams are reaping any benefits from Scrum."

670,Spotify,Revenue / Sales Org,2016-09-16,2.0,,Great company culture.  Everyone that works there has a positive outlook and are loyal to the company and the company's vision. There is a cool factor for working at Spotify and everyone (externally) thinks your job is so amazing and loves the company. This is important because you want to work for a company that has a positive reputation.,"If you work in a satellite office, there is zero (0) room for growth or promotion or title changes. They do not have ""career paths"". Basically if you do not work in Stockholm, New York or London,  you career growth will stay stagnant.  If you are mid-level in your experience, there is little or no growth. The most growth I have seen is for entry level roles. 

Other departments also are less accountable and the work load across teams is not equal. Also other departments have the most flexibility to work remote or move to different offices. If you are in the Ad Sales/ Revenue org, you will work the most, have the most expectations, and be recognized the least. The Ad Sales/Revenue org is also the most corporately structured, so the organizational culture is not positive or motivating. Also if you are in the Ad Sales/ Revenue org, the chances of moving or exploring other departments or teams is zero (0).  This org is like a sweatshop.

They do not give annual raises, if they do they are minimal. They do not reward with bonuses, there is NO bonus structure outside of the Sales/Revenue org which is why some people do not carry their weight. Other departments, outside of sales, are not incentivized.  Other departments are also underpaid, like Marketing, Analytics, Biz Dev, Design, Communications (so I have heard from colleagues). They do give you more options as a part of compensation but they are so overvalued it would be a huge investment to purchase. Its not even worth it. Salary and Bonuses motivate and keep talent. As they are growing, instead of looking within, they are primarily looking at external candidates. 

Some of the heads of departments / orgs have tunnel vision and are not open to advancement. They constantly look externally for head count, instead of fostering talent from within. At times they are so far removed from their team's day to day, they are not in touch with the team's pain points, morale, and sometimes stand in the way of getting things done.

If you work here, you should stay the maximum 2 years or you will not have career growth ."

The company is growing fast but is still nimble enough for talented people to do amazing things. Spotify clearly takes its employees' welfare seriously - pay and benefits are great, culture takes influence from a great Swedish work-life balance mindset, nice amount of travel because of widely diverse teams, and overall a respectful work environment where everyone is motivated, excited and working towards the same goal. It is easy to see how Spotify is much coveted by many candidates as an employer.","Starting to show signs of growing pains, though that is normal for a company at this stage.

Training processes are improving - I was part of an initial wave of new hires with a more staggered training approach. It seems as though the company is making a real effort to formalise CS to a greater degree in line with other companies I've worked at.

Quality-led rather than raw numbers-led in CS.

High level of expertise when I ask for advice with particular issues, especially technical issues.","The majority of CS jobs are not permanent and there's no reliable process for moving to a permanent position. This leaves you somewhat at the mercy of the employer. For those with dependents or who can't easily move for new work in the event of job cuts, this is something to consider. 

The office is somewhat rudderless and there's not always a clear person to go to. This is partially ameliorated by the friendly atmosphere and the willingness of many to help.

Lower pay than for comparable CS jobs in the area."

While growing, it's becoming slow to innovate and come up with new features.

The company is very focused on products and often forgets about the technical side of the things.

The structure of the organization in small teams is both a blessing and a curse. There is a lot of duplicated work going on simultaneously, product of the lack of communication between teams working in similar tasks across the company.

716,Spotify,"Talented people, fast moving company",2015-07-21,4.0,Software Engineer,"Some of the smartest and most capable engineers were people I met while at the company. The passion and talent here is among the best in the business, which makes for a great environment for personal growth, since there's so many people to learn from. The office vibe is also very nice, encouraging creativity with a laid-back touch (however, the ""Friday music"" tradition practiced in some offices is a notorious annoyance). The company culture, especially in the two big offices (Stockholm & NYC) is a bit like a university, with social events, interesting and intelligent people walking around, and a creative/inspired vibe.

Spotify is building product on a huge scale, and does a very good job of trying to build this product based on data analysis. The company claims that numbers and analytics are the best arguments, and for the most part, this is true.

The company culture is extremely self-critical (sometimes to a fault), and discussions about faults within the product, workflow, office culture, etc. are openly and bluntly discussed with a constructive tone. People talk about problems because they want in earnest to find solutions to them, not to just cynically complain.","As the company grows, it is having a difficult time reconciling its traditional Swedish roots with the challenges of managing a large multi-cultural, multi-office. The result is that employee input is solicited frequently, but then seemingly ignored.

Similarly, product design is a very top-down process with little room for individual freedom of work. If you have a great idea for the product, be prepared to work on it after hours and weekends to make it happen. The company has annual ""hack weeks"" to encourage innovation, but in practice, it's difficult to get these hacks released without buy-in from product owners. The number of amazing hacks that I saw created and then never released to the outside world are too many to count.

There's a strong agile culture at Spotify, which unfortunately falls in the ""cons"" category. A large number of agile coaches roam around the company, but their actual responsibilities are extremely unclear and getting them to do actual work is nigh impossible (even meta-work, such as organizing a squad dashboard or the bug tracker). In the worst case, the agile staff impose ridiculous time-wasting activities and frequent meetings with large invite lists. Some teams manage to take matters in their own hands, and these tend to be the highly productive ones in the company.

Company priorities shift rapidly and widely. This is partly due to the very fast-paced and competitive world of streaming, and Spotify has done well to shift company resources rapidly enough to beat off all competitors. But from the inside, this sometimes feels like ""the next big thing"" dominates the entire office just long enough for something new to come along and displace it. Many of the older and ill-maintained efforts pile up into a slow and steady burden of external support and tech debt (though to be fair, the company is very good at managing and eliminating tech debt).

There is also some troubles with career advancement at the company. To the credit of upper management, this was identified as a problem and they introduced a program to address this. However, the end result of this is a vague series of ""steps"" in which most engineers agree that advancement means being shifted towards management and out of engineering. I'm not sure how non-tech sees these issues, but regardless, attempting to shoehorn all company roles into a single generic career advancement model reflects the lack of understanding at the heart of the matter."

720,Spotify,Campus Influencer,2015-05-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Really fun company to work for and included a lot of perks. Management was very nice and easy to talk to.,Was one of the first student classes to do the program so organization was a little messy.
721,Spotify,I LOVE Spotify,2015-05-15,5.0,Director,"They care.  
They work hard and they want to win.
They listen.
They have an amazing culture.
They have an amazing product.  
Fantastic executive leadership.",A bit siloed but its getting better
722,Spotify,Developer,2015-05-07,5.0,Developer,"The people around you are both smart and humble. Management are technical as well which is really good. There are nice  benfits are in forms of good salaries, free snacks and drinks, many health benfits like free squash, yoga, runday etc.. Lastly, you are allowed to put quite a lot of time for self development. This has allowed me to improve myself that I think I would never have been able to at Google/Facebook/anywhere else. Even with all this, work life balance is really good. While companies like Facebook also has organized hackdays, they are far inferior since they are after work hours and only one day. Spotify have whole hackweeks once or twice a year. You can participate even if you don't want to stay at the office after work hours.

I like the product myself and I feel that I'm fighting with the good guys (I wouldn't want to work with iTunes!).","Spotify is pretty bad at open source. It has a few successful projects though. But it could be much better imho.

You don't always feel that non-tech people have caught the cultural vibe. I've been promised extra pension money and some small stock option at some point. Oddly I never got any of these benefits although applying for them. I also would like to have free food etc.. But these benefits are very rare in Stockholm.

Not Spotify's fault, but housing is hard to find in Stockholm. Spotify's helps out a *lot* with this to be fair though."

724,Spotify,Great learning experience. Great culture... most of the time.,2015-04-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"* Possibility to develop your career. An engineer can become a manger if s/he chooses to.
* Flexibility to switch teams.
* Really nice culture. There is a noticeable amount of trust bestowed to everyone.
* Your team is given freedom to take its own decisions on how do you want to work.
* Flat hierarchy, your opinon is taken into account (most of the time)
* Great colleagues, lots of brilliant minds. Lots to learn. It can be overwhelming at first.
* Lots of *good* social activities and events to help newcomers.
* You don't need to ask for permission or make up excuses to take a day off or work from home for a day or two. Everyone is very understanding of work/life balance issues and time off is encouraged. No schedules enforced. Come and leave as you will (or you agree with your team). Paternity and maternity leaves are taken seriously.","* Culture and company values are not always upheld. That is, some of the pros mentioned above are not always true. For instance, even though there's a flat hierarchy, office politics do exist. Also, you (or your team) won't always have room to take your own decisions. Freedom to decide how you work is sometimes just an illusion maintained by management. For example, don't ever dare to doubt the agile coaches' methods. Note that this does not happen most of the time, but when it does it's really frustrating.
* Not all engineers-turned-managers become good managers. Also, usually the most senior enginneers are the ones who become managers. Then they end up engulfed in a world of meetings and stop doing any engineering work at all, which is what they are best at and the company loses a great technician.
* Company has multiple offices around the world, but culture remains heavily face-to-face focused and the miscommunication between offices and teams is apparent. If you get assigned to one of the smaller offices, you will be in hell.
* Really poor internal technical documentation practices and onboarding. There is very little investment on it.. Most software is custom build so previous work experience does not help much. Knowledge is spread by either personal experience (you own the service and maintain it, therefore get to learn it) and mouth-to-ear (by collaborating with other teams). Those who have been in the company the longest and have had the change to work in many teams are who hoard most of the knowledge of how everything actually works, while newcomers struggle to keep up.
* The company's take on knowledge sharing is ""put people together and wait for the magic to happen"". That does not always work and is a very slow and expensive method.
* Salaries are a bit on the low side, specially compared to other tech companies."
725,Spotify,Business Ops,2015-04-23,3.0,,"perks a plenty (free concerts, free food, flexible work from home)","Euro-centric culture (read: work on their timezones, accommodate their vacation schedules). Somewhat arrogant culture."

727,Spotify,Spotify Cares,2015-03-30,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Spotify genuinely cares about is employees and it shows.  They invest in employees with a week long ""intro days"" trip to Stockholm hq.  The organization is relatively flat with opportunities to move laterally and try new things as well as grow your career and responsibilities.  There is very little resistance from the org if you want to invest time and energy.  Hack time is great and well respected by the company from the top down, including a hack day usually every 2 weeks and a full organized hack week every so often.

There is a strong ethic of questioning things, even well established things and making sure that ideas still pass the test.  There is some really top notch engineering talent and few people who are not at least very good engineers.

Food is really good.  Plenty of good options for breakfast and lunch and often there is food to be had for dinner as well and plenty of beverages, including iced coffee, espresso and a good selection of beers.","The technology infrastructure and client are pretty well established and a lot technology decisions are all already made.  There is some pretty strong resistance to introducing new technology for fairly legitimate reasons.  Spotify is really becoming a data driven company and there some excellent opportunities for data engineering.  There are too many internal quirky libraries and systems that could be better served by using something open source or more standard.  This seems to have been recognized and this is gradually being phased out.

Benefits could be a little stronger like paid transportation and gym memberships for instance would really be nice."
728,Spotify,"Ok, great product, nice and smart people to work with. Very slow organization",2015-03-30,3.0,Analyst,The product is great! Most colleagues are very nice and talented.,"Senior management is not very experienced. The organization is a bit chaotic and unless you are in the ""right"" place it is very difficult to get things done."
729,Spotify,"Very, very nice place. Probably, one of the best you can find.",2015-03-16,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"*Extremely* skilled colleagues, perfectly healthy work/life balance, calm Swedish environment (it's totally fine when people come late or leave early for a proper reason), no insane deadlines, very knowledgable management and Product Owners. Cool and colorful office, free snacks and drinks, occasional music events with live bands performing. Tons of learning opportunities and technological challenges - you can switch a team and learn something new that you've always wanted. Free Spotify Premium on top of everything else :)","Open-sourcing tools built isn't in DNA of a company. Consequently, very few teams do so, it's just of low priority for everyone so people never really get to this.

Visiting conferences may require some bureaucracy and talking about why you go, why is that important for a company, and who you go with. And there's a limit of 3 conferences a year which may be discouraging to some.

High volume of written communication, be prepared for your Slack client and Gmail inbox to practically explode of incoming messages from your colleagues and other departments. Catching up on emails is essential to stay in loop but I never liked doing it as generally I consider ""email time"" a waste.

Company doesn't encourage remote work and doesn't allow it for long periods (even occasional WFH may be a problem). Too much relies on face-to-face communication so being out of the office makes one disconnected from a team.

Low pay, at least in Stockholm. Senior Engineer salary is only enough to keep one's family afloat so the expectation is both parents are employed. Rent prices are very high in Stockholm (10-15K SEK a month) and lot's of single people rent tiny 30-40m apartments. Relocation package exists but it is lower compared to other well-established companies of a similar fame."
730,Spotify,Cool company,2015-03-13,3.0,,"Amazing office. Free food, and lots of it. 9 to 5 kinda environment, great if you're a family man but still want to work for a cool company.

735,Spotify,Fantastic company!,2014-11-23,5.0,Team Lead,A very nice culture where everyone can fit in. Talented co-workers that are very helpful and never looks down on junior developers. A very Swedish company (even in other offices) in that all information is shared to all employees resulting in a very transparent leadership. All in all the best company I've ever worked for.,Still a bit rough around the edges and startuppy in software solutions. Things often ends up taking a bit more time than expected because of technical debt.

738,Spotify,Gliding into a tailspin,2014-11-07,2.0,Software Engineer,"- An international melting pot for some of greatest engineers in Europe.
 - Diverse pool of talents, where everyone is either 10X or T-shaped.
 - Fascinating problems to work on, right on the intersection of Arts and Technology.
 - You get to attend one conference of choice a year, anywhere in the world.
 - Swedish benefits (parental, health, etc) and the work-life balance are really great.","- Completely inadequate compensation, with huge disparity between STO and NYC.
- Bug-ridden tech stack full of tech debt.
 - Stock option program benefits only the upper management, with even the oldest employees left with minimal benefits.
 - No growth opportunities.
 - Irresponsible HR, mostly interested in scoring another international travel.
 - Cliques rule the company.
 - People are hired based on where they worked before, with existing talent passed over.
 - Hiring from big corporations affects the culture negatively.
 - Management responsible for the largest engineering mishaps of the past year - the Black Redesign and My Music - ends up getting promoted."

- The work done can be super interesting. Music + tech, who doesn't love that.
- It's fun to work here. There are never days that you dread coming in.","- Politics. So many people here don't get along. Departments don't talk to one another. A huge us vs. them attitude prevails.
- Lack of professional development. There's little room to move up here. Employees who have contributed greatly over 3-4 years are passed over and instead new ""experienced"" managers are often hired from outside.
- Stock option program. It's bad. For a company that's valued in the billions the amount that is offered to employees is laughable. Re-grants are essentially non-existent for long-term employees."

We get to work with music every day, which is pretty awesome in itself. Some cool perks, like artist visits and gaming rooms. Fast growing (also a con, see below) company with a lot of potential.","Some serious growth pains in terms of frustrating politics, inexperienced managers, really poor compensation as well as clashing cultures (and even more politics) between different regions and managers. Stock option program is a bit of a joke to be honest. Management do a lot of talking, saying that they care and want to fairly compensate employees, but don't follow through. Some long-term employees have been treated ridiculously badly."

We were given swag quite frequently and it was definitely a fun job to work for if you love Spotify.",Some of the cons working here are that they hired so many people for the campus influencer position that it almost felt phony.

I consider my coworkers my friends, and there's a great work life balance. There's opportunity for technical growth and leadership if you're assertive. In my experience hack weeks and days are actually real and not too hard to schedule in.","Mediocre benefits compared to competitors. Mediocre technical stack with a lot of technical debt, although we are improving in this area. Highly autonomous teams can lead to poor design. Performance and compensation review process is poorly defined and hard to fathom. A lot of the less experienced technical staff drink the company koolaid and do not see its shortcomings."
745,Spotify,Awesome!!,2014-10-03,5.0,,"Great atmosphere, incredible energy and team work. Hip, young and focused. Growth is exponential",There was nothing that jumps out to me for why this company has any cons. The only thing I can point to is the direction of resources applied.

Revenue growth is tied to expanding to new markets, and it's not clear what will happen when they run out, or when Apple's marketing muscle gets behind Beats, or Amazon finally goes all-in.  US teams are also not given the attention or transparency into goings on in HQ, and seem to be held to a double standard because of the higher wage structure.  Feature work is often scattered where the approach seems more ""shotgun"" than tied to an overarching vision.  Technology solutions are often overcomplicated with no sense of standards/governance either; the common answer as to why is often that ""Spotify is different"", which, while accurate, is no excuse for management to avoid the challenges of coming up with a more well defined organization that scales."

You're free to take time off work to sit in on lunch and learns and other such knowledge sharing extracurricular activities/meetings but you still get to have a major influence over the product even as a new hire. Because of the Swedish culture influence you will not be ground down to ash by being overworked - it is not expected at all for one to be working at the office for greater than 8-9 hours a day - but excellence is still encouraged so going the extra mile if the individual can fit it in is met with high appreciation.",We don't have the resources of a larger company but we move slower than a startup so it can be frustrating when you see corners being cut due to time constraints or new and/or open source technologies being ignored just for the sake of building a lesser alternative in-house.
