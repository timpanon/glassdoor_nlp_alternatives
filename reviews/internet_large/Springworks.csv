Not a con exactly but I felt a bit fast paced, where new joiners who does not come from a similarly paced environment or culture might take up some time to get acquainted with stuff, ways of working, especially due to remote work, it makes it even more challenging.

1. First, let's talk about FOOD: Company provides FREE lunch, Snacks, Fruits, and surprise goodies.

2. The second best thing that WE all LOVE- Breaks: There is a relaxing space where employees can have a short break and play games. As now we are working remotely, we virtually have tea/coffee breaks and play games. We are so addicted to games and quizzes that company but their own Virtual quiz app Trivia. Sound cool :)

3. Now Let's talk about Company Environment: Springworks has a positive working environment. The company takes care of employees' work-life balance and they also help you in our personal growth.

4. Next Important thing is Communication: Company valued our feedback. We can give our feedback or wishlist to the company. There is two-way communication between employee and employer in the company. We can voice out our thoughts and is being respected.

5. You don't have to worry about your home office setup : The company helps you to set up your home office. offer amazing perks to our employees to buy amazing furniture, standing desks, headphones, and the Internet.

6. Remote employee engagement: Springworks takes care of remote employees' mental well-being. regularly conduct mental well-being sessions where we ask experts to come and talk to our employees.

7. Next favorite thing Rewards (We all love this): Company encourages peer-to-peer recognition and bonuses. It is about transferring points to employees or colleagues as an appreciation of their hard work. If you ask for help from your colleagues, you can also transfer point to him/her as an appreciation. This helps in enhancing our company teamwork and motivation.
