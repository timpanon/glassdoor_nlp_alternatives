All in all, if you value great colleagues and benefits over the amount on your paycheck, this may be the company for you."
24,Squarespace,A good place to grow and propel your career,2021-10-23,5.0,Software Engineer,"Just over a year in, I’ve really enjoyed my experience at Squarespace. My team is chill and my manager is always supportive. There is no shortage of interesting problems to work on.
I feel that I’ve grown leaps and bounds since joining; more so than any of my previous companies. Professional development is consistently encouraged, and there are ample opportunities and resources to learn and grow. The company invests a lot in its employees.
I also feel that the vast majority of the people I’ve met are smart and more than happy to help.
Lastly, the Squarespace brand is getting stronger by the day and while I don’t plan to leave any time soon, I expect that the name recognition will be an asset when moving on to the next opportunity.","Changing roles and moving to different teams doesn’t seem to be as common here as in other companies. 
I’ve also notice that there is less emphasis on “fun” here compared to my past companies. A lot of people outside of my team that I’ve met are typically very serious and rarely laugh (although they are usually still nice). I’m still not sure if this is just my personal experience or it is a broad cultural thing."
25,Squarespace,Alright,2021-10-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great work/life balance
Good benefits & perks
Nice people",Organizational planning and coordination needs work - too much of a bottom-up engineering culture means centralized projects / platforms don't get proper prioritization and execution.
26,Squarespace,Great support teams but unnecessary stress,2021-10-19,3.0,Senior Customer Advisor,"The people on the support team & team leads are brilliant and always happy to lend a hand to help each other. 
Free food in the office. 
Good health insurance cover.

Note: the only reason I gave this review 3 stars is because I loved my coworkers and team leads. They're the core of Squarespace excellence.","Squarespace has a heavy corporate atmosphere where you're reminded that you do everything for the company and they don't really have time to be there for you, unless you need to go to the doctor or want a free lunch. 

For example, I asked for a flexible schedule one morning a week to volunteer at a children's charity and was told there was no way this could be accommodated, but it was a nice idea. 

If you don't quickly learn to manage your day, you won't get your break. Support channels are tracked and measured down to the second. So if you mess up your schedule a little, you'll hear about it. 

They have ERGs, but when times are busy (read half the year), there's no time allotted to your schedule to attend meetings. Uptime or time off the queue is used as a carrot/stick to make you work harder.

The free meals are only available if you work in the office, so not applicable during a pandemic. 

The number one problem with the support teams is that if you come up with a suggestion or a solution, if you're told it can't be done (practically always), you can ask why. But you'll be told that they ran a study that says this isn't correct/possible. When you ask to see the data, you're told that it's not available or that you wouldn't understand it anyway. 

Trying to solve problems in customer support is an exercise in futility. So many experienced advisers get the skills to do advanced support, then go elsewhere to move up. 

Finally, the office culture is very heavily geared to the main office in NYC, so if you're in one of the ""branch offices"" you have to get creative to be heard on anything."

34,Squarespace,Bigger and More Corporate Than Ever,2021-10-08,2.0,Customer Service Associate,"Talented, kind coworkers with a wide array of passions outside of work, robust ERGs, and excellent benefits (if you can get them.)","They're getting bigger and that means they're turning to more old school, traditional models of crafting a support team. They're hiring more part time employees who don't get benefits, support is siloed from the rest of the company, and CS is focusing so much on specialization that customers get passed between multiple support teams on a single ticket. Long time customers who aren't even having negative experiences with support are commenting on the decrease in quality and change in tone.

There's few opportunities for advancement in CS, managers don't seem engaged with their teams and seem to be focused on their own projects."

41,Squarespace,Company in Growth-mode,2021-08-10,5.0,Director,"So much room to make things better and establish long term process. If you are smart and solutions oriented with a positive attitude and a lack of ego, Squarespace is an ideal place to work. For me, it's a place I plan to stay for many years to come.","With being in growth mode and transforming into a mature company, a lot of things are being built, improved upon, or solved. That is par for the course but building and problem solving isn't for everyone. Some people seem to be stuck in identifying problems or gaps only without offering suggestions or solutions which isn't helpful."
42,Squarespace,Great Place to work,2021-08-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Very employee focused. take a long view towards growth and getting ahead of the market,overly meeting heavy; can be slow to bring about change.
43,Squarespace,"Kind teammates, Varied Managers",2021-08-05,3.0,Software Engineer,"Squarespace has a fundamental engineering culture of helping each other. Questions are never an imposition and folks are really dedicated to helping each other learn. Also Squarespace is one of the few bigger tech companies where our work doesn't feel actively evil? We don't track people all over the internet or suck them down misinformation rabbit holes.

Work-Life Balance is actually encouraged. Even from upper management. People use their Unlimited PTO and if you don't your manager might reach out and encourage you to take a vacation. There's little to no crunch here. Everyone signs in around 10 and dips around 6 but you can shift your hours based on your personal prefs, child care needs, what have you. I haven't heard of anyone getting micromanaged in their work. As long as you get your work done and show up to meetings you can shape your time however you need to.","There are a few managers that have known reputations for undervaluing the accomplishments of their reports, low-balling their raises and refusing to promote folks even when their senior teammates believe the promotion is deserved. I've been fortunate enough not to have such a manager myself, but the employees of those managers are constantly trying to switch teams or quit. Despite that pattern, all of those managers have been at the company for several years.

If you're considering joining SQSP, make sure you talk to the folks you'll be reporting to, both the Team Lead _and_ the Engineering Manager. There isn't much team switching here and folks tend to stay here longer than the usual 1.5 - 2 years, so if you like your manager they'll probably stick around. You could have a great work environment. But I wouldn't walk in with my eyes closed.

Also Squarespace is a bit slower to update COVID guidance than other tech companies. We tend to follow what the FAANG companies are doing, but management will announce the changes several weeks afterwards. I've honestly started just making plans based on whatever policy a FAANG company announces in the news. Oh except anything that requires doling out funds to employees. Squarespace is _stingy_ in comparison to other companies when it comes to things like paying for a WFH setup or compensating for the expenses we didn't have before, like increased utilities and groceries. You can get things like a monitor or a desk chair, but they tend to be pretty low quality. Many of the folks I know ended up just shelling out for their own."

61,Squarespace,"What you expect out of a cushy unicorn, but with probably less pay",2021-05-02,3.0,Software Engineer,"They treat engineers humanely with PTO, benefits, work culture.","The pay was underwhelming, the broader vision of the company was too risk-averse. For example, they'd release a feature they've been building for 3 years only to roll it back from bad feedback. The literal opposite of ""move fast and break things."" Slow release cycles, no deadlines (which was good for the employee but bad for the growth of the company), and most projects were superfluous, pointless optimizations whose value / engineering time and effort ratio were not high enough to be justified, though that's what I genuinely believe about most software being developed. I worked in the Commerce group, and it inevitably felt like fighting a losing, understaffed war against a massive, matured super-enemy known as Shopify. 

Another thing is, and I've read at least one other reviewer on here that had a similar experience, I felt incredibly lonely. I didn't connect with anyone in my team on a personal level, or at all in the company. There were groups of younger people who appeared to be friends, but I never felt an ounce of effort to be included. I spent 16 months essentially working by myself on siloed projects that affected no one externally, and nobody cared about in the company. It was really sisyphean. But maybe it's like this for most tech jobs, I wouldn't know, it was my first fulltime one."

- Culture where the most junior people are encouraged to speak up, and people do 

- Great work/life balance and excellent benefits (the Chief People Officer is the best and most communicative I've seen out of the companies I've worked at - she is a clear outlier on the executive team)

- The company has been incredibly thoughtful about COVID and return-to-work - very grateful for that","- Inexperienced people have been elevated to positions where they have large teams; this results in poor management and lack of communication when things change (and they change often), and more. If you look at your potential manager's background and they've risen up ranks quickly or have only worked at Squarespace their entire career, I'd reverse interview them and ask them specific questions about their management style/experience before you accept the job

- Political and cliquey, but everyone is really nice about it (there's definitely an inner circle and if you're not part of it, you'll know since you won't know what's going on but you'll hear things secondhand)

- The company strategy is all over the place. Product, Engineering, and Design can't get on the same page despite hiring new product leadership and bringing in heavy-hitter consultants in the industry who took us through multiple workshops and then told us everything we're doing from a process perspective is wrong

- Culturally, if you're on the ground as an IC, it's great; every so often you'll have to interact with senior leaders who are aloof and patronizing (with the exception of a few, e.g. the Chief People Officer). It's very difficult to find a genuine, humble, and kind senior leader here"

- Teams are really damn talented at hiring people from even better companies","- Across the company teams are working in their own worlds and often the workflow is disorganized as a result of this poor communication 
- Senior management is prickly, not transparent, and difficult to receive clear vision or directive from. It’s impossible to get promoted until you’ve been at the company for three years unless you are exceptionally good at positioning yourself with the right relationships to senior management
- There is limited focus on training and developing employees 
- Many peers have left due to pay discrepancies from people growing within the org earning less compared to people hired later at a more junior level
- I don’t believe in the CEO"

Little to no micromanagement.,They make no effort at career development. They use old systems for customer operations that conflict with the mental health and efficiency of advisors. There is no upward mobility outside of the customer service role. Other departments have no clue what Cust Ops does and look at the dept as a whole that they are beneath them.

96,Squarespace,Spark with a Disappointing Fizzle,2020-08-10,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Squarespace is a highly sought after place of employment and I was there to watch the employee count double. The company itself is profitable and self-sustaining. They are proud of the product they create and the customer support they offer and knowing you're working for a company whose product can help improve folks' lives, businesses, livelihoods, etc. can be really motivating. The benefits were tremendously helpful and the office spaces are very chic and impressive. I learned a lot in my time there and felt honored to work alongside some of the best people I've ever worked with. So many intelligent, caring and creative people work for this company and it was a gift to know and work alongside them.","In my years at this company I watched the integrity and product slip into something that became more elite and highbrow, less accessible to a broader crowd and less personal. I felt disconnected from the company when I left in a way that I never felt in my first few years there, though I suppose that growth has a way of changing a company like this. They also have some trouble hiring and keeping people of color in leadership and management roles and while they tout diversity and inclusion, the equity peace was always missing from my experience."
97,Squarespace,Really poor management,2020-07-21,2.0,Product Design,"good people to work with, talented individuals.","Feels like nothing ever gets done right. Everything takes much longer than it should and decisions are never made with any care.

98,Squarespace,Burning out employees in a global pandemic - reducing overall compensation with increased expectations,2020-07-13,2.0,Customer Operations Advisor,"- Peers are some of the most pleasant people
- some (middle) managers genuinely care
- culture on a peer level is very positive
- it is encouraged to share feedback (but feedback is hardly ever acted upon)","Extremely high expectations in stressful and less stressful times:
During the initial development of Covid there was an insane increase in demand for the product (and advice through customer support). Therefore one of the support channels (chat) was restricted in its opening hours. 

This and a sporadic email rotation day was the only action taken by management that benefitted Advisors, and was only done to clear out a backlog created by high volumes in the first place. 

Since demand has now decreased again we have just been informed that we will return to essentially normal (pre-covid) operations. We were given 24 hours notice for this.

Throughout all of this (working remotely full-time) performance metrics were applied with the same pressure. Since demand has gone down, management has actually increased pressure. Several colleagues have been put on improvement plans for not reaching their output over a few weeks in the recent low volume times (!) I personally know several colleagues who are starting to take sick days in fear of burning out, from trying to reach their pace expectations with what little work is around.

There is 0 consideration to our life situations (not having the same equipment as in the office, not possible to learn from more senior colleagues directly anymore).

It must also be added that several benefits tied to the office have been cut, such as lunches or snacks. Other companies have replaced these with vouchers. 

Squarespace has essentially cut the overall compensation of its workers in record times for the company and terrifying times for its employees, while at the same time increasing the pressure on it’s weakest, most at risk (financially) employees."

Squarespace changed policy to 'flexible PTO' without properly notifying employees, and without clarity on what the shift meant for existing employees

- Employees must agree with their ideals created when the company was much smaller, not open to new ideas/change
 
- Opportunities for growth and career advancement seem somewhat subjective – with some people working at levels well above their title or promoted for positions in which they had close to no experience (especially positions in management).

- There is little growth opportunity for smart, creative and dedicated people unless you fit a specific mold 
 
- Certain Executive leadership members seem more worried about their image than the growth and development of their teams

- Your typical start-up benefits: Catered lunch, good snacks, cold brew and beer on tap, beautiful office, Apple products. Other cool perks such as tickets to events at MSG, monthly team events and weekly happy hours. Note: the lunch is part of your total compensation and they factor it into your salary. 

- Lots of employee engagement activities and opportunities to get involved with the community. 

- An overall really cool brand and mission with so many inspiring customers.","If you’re on a good team with a supportive manager led by a supportive exec leader, then Squarespace could be an awesome place to work at. If not, it can be incredibly toxic and mentally draining. 

- Bait and switch practices with candidates. The position I interviewed for and ultimately got was changed right before I officially accepted. The recruiter informed me that the Marketing department recently underwent a title restructure and although my title changed, level, pay, etc. did not. Come to find out this is not true. I’ve brought this to HR’s attention and unfortunately I’ve seen them continue to do this to candidates. 

- Equal work, unequal pay. I was paid $20K less than my coworker and we did the same work. I brought this to my new manager’s attention and HR and nothing was done about it. Instead, my new manager kept telling me she was going to do something about it and never did. I’ve heard similar stories from others on Marketing.

- Marketing exec leadership and HR care about the company more than you. There was a very toxic team in Marketing last year. 3 people quit in 6 months because of 1 person. This was brought to the attention of Marketing exec leadership and 2 HR Business Partners and was very well documented. Exec leadership claimed the company didn’t want to get sued and couldn’t fire the toxic person. This isn’t true -- other teams at Squarespace have fired people. Rather, leadership and HR allowed this person to eventually quit on her own terms, while her teammates continued to endure her toxicity. 

- Lack of transparency with hiring decisions. I had 3 managers in 6 mons and they were interviewing for my 4th manager at the time I left the company. There was no support from HR or marketing exec leadership during the management transitions. Direct reports didn’t get the opportunity to interview the 3rd manager and didn’t know much about her prior to her start date. 

- Not a lot of opportunity for professional growth and development. I asked about switching teams and was told by HR that's not an option."

Catered lunch is a pro but also factored into your salary so that your base salary remains under the market value.,"BIG TIME compression salary. Because employees are underpaid, unempowered and exposed to arbitrary compensation philosophies, they don't go above and beyond to work 40+ hours, hence the great work-life balance. Best advice is to negotiate your incoming salary based on where you'll be content after 2 years because it's  basically impossible to grow that figure once you're in and there's zero negotiation even if you're distinguished and make notable contributions.

The company is 100% principled on managing up; directors and leadership do not go to bat for their team and enable exploitation. The official language of Squarespace is intentional ambiguity because, you guessed it, ambiguity keeps employees stagnated and hinders growth."

It's innovative and exciting and challenging!","Customer Advisor- you are chained to your desk and asked to meet some hard metrics in live chat. You are placed on a 'team' and in most cases your direct manager will be someone who is poorly versed in the platform and has not actually interacted with a customer in years, making it frustrating to take advice from them. Good luck getting any holidays off! In this position the company really wants you to put your head dow, work you shifts, have no personal conflicts and never want to move up in the company.

As an advisor, growth is very hard to come across and will be strongly dependent on your direct manager. It also depends on how you want to grow during your time there, if growth is just learning more facets of the company and how you can help customers in different channels as opposed to just email and live chat, that is perfect. There are many opportunities to participate in projects from other teams within the department (as they are vacated; new positions are not produced as quickly as they originally were).

However, if you want to move up the ladder in the department, that is where it gets tricky and heavily dependent on who your manager is. They have this ""career advancement"" spreadsheet, but it was only brought up in my meetings, not really delved into to help facilitate my growth.

For new advisors, be aware that PTO and shift times will be available after all the other advisors in the office have already selected their desired dates - you have the last pick in available dates. It's weighed on performance and tenure of the advisor."

127,Squarespace,One of the best startups in NYC with poor immigration support,2019-08-18,4.0,Software Engineer,"Great business, sustainable customers and revenues 
* Great office location and view, with rooftop and beers
* Modern tech stacks with a lot of interesting technical projects going on in both Infrastructure org and Product engineering org
* Flexible working policy (WFH, leave early or come in late)
* Unlimited vacations (4 weeks are considered normal)
* Newly established career ladder (it's not perfect but better than nothing)
* Growing business with new products lines
* Likely-minded co-workers","Disclaimer: all the cons mentioned below can only speak to my own experience and server only as subjective information for potential candidates interested in Squarespace.

* Poor immigration service with limited bandwith and slow and progress: as a none-US foreign worker here, I feel extremely frustrated working with the immigration team at Squarespace. To be clear,  Squarespace has a pretty good/standard immigration policy: immediate visa sponsorship and green card sponsorship after 1y.  I want to share my experience with potential candidates who might have similar immigration needs. Think twice before you join even if the HR promises you that your case will be handled professionally! I am seeing people leaving/ thanking about leaving the company due to the current poor immigration service here.

* Not competitive salary in engineering, the company is not trying to pay in the top band of the current market, thus sending away many great candidates to companies who are willing to pay more

* Shift from Options to RSU, which is fine but it's a private company! It means you are now granted book money and you have to pay tax for that

* Lack of incentive for top performers. In some well-run companies in the tech industry, top performers are rewarded heavily for their hard work and great potential in the future.  Squarespace doesn't appreciate that in terms of financial rewards.

* Not really startup culture.  On the other side of the impact of flexible working policy, you will find the whole engineering culture quite a layback and things move quite slowly. 

* Career conversations are rare to happen and you have to constantly ask for feedbacks and guide on how to advance to next level if you are ambitious on your career. Otherwise, be prepared for staying at your current level for years

* Executives want to exercise the OKR process but are still struggling themselves in terms of how to write OKR effectively, how to map teams' OKR with department and company's OKR and more importantly, how to rate the ORK for every quarter. For now, they just write it down and forget it next quarter, no ratings, no retrospection on how things went and no incentives for good results

* The market is great but also competitive, and Squarespace is not among the leaders in the market. The business strategy of the company is either not smart enough or not executed well IMO."

133,Squarespace,Great company handicapped by poor management,2019-03-24,3.0,Engineer,"The company hires some really amazing people who are a lot of fun to work with and learn together. I made so many friends at the company who I see on a regular basis outside of the workplace. Most people are very open and willing to help.

The office is probably the best looking office any engineer will ever work at in the city or in the country. Benefits package is decent and engineers are actually able to utilize the unlimited vacation days.

The company is very design first in terms of the aesthetics and it really shows in the product and everything Squarespace is involved in. It's a big draw for people who have a good eye towards design.

There's a lot of flexibility to work on things outside of a team's ownership. Switching teams in engineering is doable as long as there are openings.

For individuals with less experience, Squarespace has many people who are willing to be mentors and help provide guidance to those early in their careers. Many team leads and managers really make an effort to help new grads and interns.","Where do I even start..

* The CEO keeps a very small circle of trusted employees as leaders. Those in that circle get in by executing ideas as told and wield a lot of decision making power. The management structure is kept at a bare minimum and many executives and managers don't have enough time to devote to important issues outside of their core management areas.
* Change is extremely slow - for a technology company, any ideas that come from individuals need to go through many layers of opaque and ambiguous approvals.
* Many in management and executive team are not equipped or have desire to manage people. Some managers and directors are still doing individual contributor work such as creating user experience flows or code reviews instead of solving issues around resource constraints and hiring more people.
* New product ideas and initiatives usually come from the top down and micro-managed from conception to release. Very few product decisions are validated by user or A/B testing. It feels like doing client work at a creative agency instead of a mature technology company at times. High priority cross functional projects are basically hell.
* Retention rate is not great - People who have been around for a few years have the golden handcuffs and are waiting to cash out. The ones who joined more recently usually leave after a year or two for other companies that offer much better pay. Diversity and inclusion efforts feel disingenuous at times.
* Compensation is not competitive - Squarespace's initial offer is always a step below what other New York companies in terms of total compensation. If cash bonus and stock are taken into account, the companies we compete with for talent usually pay 30-50% more for experienced positions. Annual raises barely keep up with inflation and stock refreshers are abysmal.
* Promotions are hard to come by - Team leads at Squarespace are essentially managers at most other companies but have no power to determine promotions or compensation here. They are also not equipped to have conversations about what it takes for an individual to advance to the next level. Someone much higher up makes promotions and compensation adjustments for employees who they may not know.
* The cultural values we used to have are slowly dying. Instead of doing a good technical job implementing product features and releasing products when ready, there's been a rush to deliver quickly at the expense of cutting corners and creating more tech debt. People are so busy with their own deadlines that they don't have time to help others anymore."

Work-life balance was strong, and the office was super convenient - right near 8 subway lines, a PATH station, and even the Henry Hudson greenway. You gotta live with the endless honking on Friday nights, though.","- Culture of tolerating and ignoring broken things (in product, culture, tools & physical workplace) can discourage initiative-taking. Far too many examples to name here. It’s sad that I can’t think of a single concrete improvement during my time at Squarespace in response to employee feedback.

- Top-down management approach makes ownership harder. Things that should be easy and fast become high-friction and frustrating when ownership is often opaque, and people are often afraid to make even small decisions without feeling the need to consult top leadership. Issues that were trivial to unblock in other companies I’ve worked at - even 20X larger ones - were surprisingly time-consuming and emotionally draining at Squarespace. 

- Weak stock packages and zero bonuses disincentive hard work and going the extra mile. These can contribute to Squarespace having more of a disengaged “renter” culture, instead of an “owner” culture.

- Chronic cultural disposition towards confounding surface-level visual aesthetics (how things look) vs. actual good design (how things work). As an example, look at the design of Squarespace’s physical office space. It may appear sexy in photoshoots, but it’s physically uncomfortable, dark, rigid, inefficient, and often just plain frustrating to work in more ways than I could count. Employees’ perspectives and feelings were not solicited or considered in the design that I know of, nor did management show evidence of seeking to understand or fix the problems after it was built. Consideration for inclusive design needs in the office was also curiously lacking, and in a number of cases, aesthetics appear to have been prioritized over employee health and safety (presumably unintentionally, but the outcome is unchanged)."

As to work itself, if you're lucky and talk to the right people, you may have opportunities to work on side projects and maybe grow after a while.","As a customer support agent your day will be scheduled, including your start/end time and your breaks. Once you're on live chat, you'll have difficulty taking toilet breaks or lunch breaks.

Also, just think how much it's going to affect your life to have specific start/end times, weird shifts (7-4 one day, 11-8 another day...), including random weekends. 

Most people that get to grow in the company manage to do it by being friendly to the right team leaders and managers, not really because their good performers. As one manager said to me once, in squarespace 'it's more important how you're perceived than how you truly are'. 

The company treats employees like kids, meaning you'll get lots of snacks and drinks, but really, would you sell your time and life for free m&ms and balloons? To some extend, this is close to 'The Circle' movie starring Emma Watson and Tom Hanks. Watch it before accepting a role in squarespace.

Also, the benefits package is unreal. If you're young, single, and live close to the office, Squarespace is a great place to work.","In the time I spent there, it's inevitable to see people come and go. But year after year, I'd see our top talent get snatched up by other tech companies, sometimes in entry-level positions. Each time, I thought to myself ""Why would X leave the company,"" or ""Why would Squarespace let Y go?""

Like the cool mom who lets their high school kid have a sip of their chardonnay, the message was drilled into us that we'd learn career development skills, regardless of whether or not we stayed at Squarespace. But why wouldn't there be a focus on keeping great, trained people at a company growing at such a rate like Squarespace? Why wouldn't they want to groom leaders for their own benefit?

Speaking of which, leadership resources are only available to what the company considers as ""leaders,"" though that term was used interchangeably with ""management."" People in the lowest positions are expected to stay there, though they're told to find a niche and grow into it.

Middle managers, including many who have been hired from outside the company, often have little to no experience with the Squarespace products and lean heavily on the teams that they manage for product support questions, which ends up in a mediocre experience for customers who get escalated for ""better support.""

Related, career advancement is practically non-existent. Again, management positions are often filled by outside hires, and the teams within Customer Support are filled with senior employees.

Rules change fast and often here. Don't get used to any policies that are written.

""Team outings"" generally take place once per quarter, outside of normal business hours, and they're often implied mandatory. This means that you're expected to want to go, and if you don't for any reason — like having a family or a long commute home — it's frowned upon."

I constantly have to remind myself that having catered lunches, fridges stocked with various drinks, pantries filled with snacks, and a beautiful office is a routine part of my workplace.
While the perks of the job are nice, the best part of Squarespace is how comfortable working here is. You can bring your whole self to work Squarespace and never feel like it negatively affects you. They truly accept you for who you are and genuinely try to make this the best work experience they can. 
That being said, I think it is important that you investigate the role before you apply to better understand what you are getting yourself into.

I can see how many people would feel uncomfortable with so much ambiguity and if this is something you struggle with I'm not sure I'd recommend applying.
I think an opportunity for Squarespace is improved recognition for the work their employees do. Due to how fast the business (and industry) is changing, I feel like my day to day efforts and accomplishments are not fully recognized."

They get the superficial stuff right. Just look around and you'll see rows of engineers hunched over big desks and huge monitors... but where's the spirit? Where's the passion? Where's the shared learning and teaching? Where's the sense of adventure?

I mean, it's fine as a cushy job. But there are other cushy jobs that aren't so dull.

Catered lunch every day, food is fairly decent. No shortage of snacks and drinks in the kitchens.

There are some beginning efforts for building strong engineering forums.","- Squarespace Engineering is still struggling to figure out some of its key parts, which is a pretty big red flag considering the age of the company. Don’t expect anything said in the interview process to actually hold up once the job starts.

Before taking the job, I was told by multiple people that Squarespace prided itself on having a flat career ladder without official titles. Coming from a similar organization, I knew this worked for me. Less than a month after I started, they introduced a poorly-explained career ladder with an astounding number of tiers. Although the ladder was somehow tied to compensation, this was never explained.

The team I was placed onto did not allow me to apply much of what I had worked on before, nor did it resemble the kinds of questions I had been asked in interviews. This was a surprise for me, as I expressed wanting to continue doing the same kind of work I had been doing to multiple people. It was also a far cry from what I felt had been sold to me by my recruiter.

The benefit for Squarespace was that they could place me on an insultingly low tier on the career ladder that ignored my years of experience because the responsibilities of my team were new to me. The review schedule meant that it would take well over a year for me to possibly move up to a place on the ladder that would start to match where I had been at the job I just left.

When I brought up my concerns with team placement, the best they could do was shrug their shoulders and say that they were new to having teams. That is a very tough pill to swallow for someone who left an entire life behind to move across the country to take a job.

NYC snobbery is at its absolute worst at Squarespace. After living in cities for nearly a decade, I decided to start out in the suburbs when I moved for them. No matter who it was and whether it was their business or not, anyone who found this out reacted as if my choices were awful and that I didn’t belong with the rest of them. Ultimately, the gatekeeping has made me strongly reconsider whether the greater NYC area is the right place for me.

Recruiting sold me on Squarespace having flexible work hours. What this really means is that most of engineering starts to roll in at 11:30 AM. I chose to work something closer than 8:30-5:15 so that I could still have hours left in the day when I got home. 

It was strongly implied by multiple people (again, whether or not it was their business) that I was having trouble adjusting to my team because our hours didn’t match. Nobody thought to address the real problem, which was that it’s impossible to schedule anything before 12pm without protest. The lack of discipline made it feel less like work and more like summer camp.

The entire experience was one I was glad to rid myself by pursuing another opportunity as soon as I could.  Be careful of what they tell you- it probably won’t come true."
170,Squarespace,Great opportunities to up-skill and develop,2018-03-27,4.0,Customer Operations Team Lead,"Amazing product which makes it easy to be an advocate.
The company invests in product development but also on people (benefits & perks). If you want to develop and up-skill there are a ton of resources and benefits that allow for that.
You can work on projects that are relevant to you and play to your strengths.
Work environment personally is fantastic. It was a true wonder the crazy amount of great people I've worked with throughout the years, and the type of supportive atmosphere I experienced.
The usual tech perks are in play (catered everything, beautiful office space, amazing events).
I never felt work was repetitive because the product itself is quite diverse.
There was always room for process innovation and out of the box thinking was encouraged (very specific to my position/experience/ Took a lot of work to actually push changes sometimes related to lack of resources, but it sure was encouraged).","This is not a con per se, but over the years I felt this was a topic of discontent for many people. Because it is still a very flat (and developing) org, it takes quite a lot of commitment and work to move (upwards and sideways).  If you are looking for an easy way up or a quick career change you will be disappointed. For me, this was never an issue as my motivators/rewards are not associated with movement but with development opportunities instead. Younger generations need to understand not everything happens at the speed of light...
There is still a lot to be done, to develop a unique corporate cultural entity - ""Company culture"" is thrown left right and centre but I did not feel it meant the same throughout the org. (also not necessarily a con). While there are a set of company values, every department ended up living by a different set of values and work culture. 
Additionally, the company doesn't take advantage of each office's uniqueness. I.e.: social/experience events and initiatives are pushed top down, and there seems to be little room to do things locally without it being overly scrutinized or shut down because it can't be pushed org . wide (or so was my perception). Things that made sense and were meaningful celebrations (or ways to celebrate) in the main office were pushed to other locations with (what seemed) little regard for relevance, and sometimes initiatives fell flat because of that."

I was there for 3+ years and I probably saw less than 10 move to a different role out of hundreds of employees. Additionally, PTO days are not as flexible as you think. MANY Cust Ops employees get a cut off, and it is extremely hard to get the days off you want. I have a feeling the flexible PTO policy is for everyone BUT Cust Ops."

At first you don't say anything to anyone, but then you realise that this is a behavior applied to many people.
Little by little they lower your self steem, and there many, many hypocrites in management of control positions over the agents, so there is little to do when it comes to ask for help. Because, in order to remain in their positions, they support each other and people are afraid to stand up for their rights, so you can see many people feeling miserable, but until they realise that they can go somewhere else and feel better and sometimes with even a better salary, it takes some time. It's like a toxic relationship. They make you feel as if you want to belong to a group, to the popular group, to the main mafia that has been working there for a long time and go choosing between the newcomers to make the net bigger.

The issue here is that this group of people and their ""management skills"" have resulted in many people leaving the company in the last year. I'm talking about more than 20 people.

And don't think that their hiring enough people to replace them. They just command those who stay to work more, and in worse conditions - the holidays are not as flexible as they say, new shifts until 10pm, which makes extremely difficult to have a good balance between your personal and work life.

Even people who were loved by most of the agents have left the company. And without any real reason from management. Making everyone feel insecure because even the greatest people ended up having crisis due to the company."

Top management, are not putting enough attention to advisors feedback and the issues that clients are facing,  
 
Scheduling  which has a big impact how we serve our customers, holiday and allocation of staff in the different channel, is managed is a Google spreadsheet, extremely manual, the same way that a small company without budget will be run in this area, and it leads to a lot of mistakes, getting a shifts at the wrong hour, getting the holiday removed on the wrong day or removed to the wrong person. 

The internal policy for holidays, hard conflict ( studies) is suppose to be flexible, but the reality is different and it seems that some of the top management is not fully aware"
186,Squarespace,"Lack of professionalism, human attitude, transparency and flexibility",2017-10-20,1.0,Customer Operations Advisor,"Like others mentioned:
- free food and snacks;
- health insurance;
- pension scheme;
- occasional massages or doctor checkups;
- quarterly dinners + summer and X-mas party;
- lots of new technical knowledge within the first 4 -6 months.","I will list my full experience below:

CONTRACT: Lack of transparency. It says 'flexible holiday', but the first week I started working I found out, that they'd prefer me not to take holiday within the first 4-6 months until the training is finished, and you cannot pick the day you want you can only choose from what's left on the list. These means that when you join the company, you get to see the calendar that is pre-booked until the end of the year and you grab what's left. Three times within the last 9 months I tried to get 3 days off, and it was impossible, because a) you're still in training b) you need to become an expert ASAP, and you need to focus on this goal c) there are no slots available. THREE days off in this company is big problem. Sometimes volumes are very low, you have nothing to do, no one allows you to take a project either. I asked twice, I came up with the projects, and both times I was denied, because I 'needed to focus on becoming an expert asap'.  Once I asked my manager for help, saying that I really need him to approve 3 days of holiday, could you please make an exception since the volumes are low? And what I received was a question:'Why do you think you deserve an exception?"" Because I am a human who needs rest, I am not a robot! Holiday policy was never explained prior to signing the contract, it was revealed only a week after I started.

SHIFTS: They still change weekly, and you'd work anything between 7am and 10pm! I cannot combine work and sport activities, the classes I want to take are in the evening so half of them I miss. And you can barely swap the shifts. Before I signed the contract I asked if I could combine work and evening studies, and was told that this shouldn't be a problem, and I could swap shifts if needed. Isn't the case! My manager told me if the classes are not tech related, they are in conflict with my work. So my personal development was not valued at all! I was very disappointed to hear that. Plus, for each shift, lunch and meeting you need to clock in and clock out online, this makes you live by the clock. You cannot be late EVER. I never been late for work more than one minute within the last 9 months! I am not saying it's good to be late, I am saying I developed an internal fear of being late more than a minute.

MANAGEMENT: Mostly very young, with lack of experience people. My manager lives by the management book and it's really easy to put him off by asking a thought provoking question. It often feels if this is not in the book, he cannot answer it and struggles to phrase a constructive answer. Many people who were hired for a specific language, ended up working in English, because for years they are not able to launch support in other languages. And there is a lot of micromanagement. You always feel like you're been controlled and not trusted, I often have to write in the sheet what resources I've been checking for the last hour in order to improve my performance. How many minutes it took and what I learned. I feels like being back to school. 

CAREER: No development plan, no options to grow. Many people who worked here for years always remained just admins, you have nowhere to move really. And important to add, you stop learning after 6 months, you're done with training and there are no new challenges in front of you, you do the same things and deal with the same topics daily. Maximum you can do, run a global meeting or initiate one project that you will never be given enough time for.

LIVE CHAT: Now we work primarily in Live Chat. Parallel to that you're expected to take tickets! Double work and multi-tasking. It's really really exhausting. We have no time to go to the toilet, sometimes you have to run while awaiting for a customer's  answer in the Live Chat. Sometimes you don't have such chance for an hour or two if the customers are really intense! You cannot go to the toilet for an hour! It's ridiculous! It's unhuman. Think of females, please! Even in prison they can go to the toilet whenever they want! This way the company kills more volume using the same amount of people. Smart move, but shows that the admins are treated like robots, not humans."

Projects and teams are constantly switching ownership, making it difficult to get a straight answer. There is a lack of transparency on the hiring process as well as salary levels among employees of different tenure. There can be a general feeling of loyalty to the company above all else, including legitimate deputes. My largest qualm is the lack of advancement opportunities in the Portland office. There are many highly skilled and over qualified workers kept in menial customer service roles. Jobs become available internally very rarely, and are poorly communicated to employees. Often external hires are brought in and not trained adequately on the platform, creating a disconnect between management and their subordinates. There is very poor communication throughout the organization, with products being rolled out constantly without providing any information to advisers. There was often a strong feeling of shoulder tap promotions, particularly internally. Huge lack of racial diversity and acknowledgement of racial issues. Political discourse if often encouraged at work, creating a fraught work environment."

People can be very immature. The company is filled with whiney millennials who complain constantly about snack selection. Doritos are not organic, get over it.

Random promotions that dont make any sense. For example, the executives were all promoted before the July review cycle before everyone else. The rest of the people get 3% adjustments or less and the execs get crazy fancy titles and more money. Great for morale.

This is a place that rewards engineers constantly and the engineers  can do no wrong. In Cust Ops, people have no opportunity for career advancement and the pay is terrible.

Near transit, easy to get to the office. They don’t provide a bus/train pass though. Because other companies don’t provide it… except other companies absolutely do.

Nice computers to work on/Equipment is up to date

Pretty awesome coworkers, extremely talented folks in Customer Ops

Work from home policy was nice (though, it was slowly being scaled back at the office I worked at.)

CMS is easily implemented, easy to design with, though they tend to make changes that don’t make sense to the customer nor designer working within it.","No time to learn new initiatives nor time to really get a good idea of the product if something new is added. Everything is dropped on customer service agents at the last possible moment (like an hour before public deploy, so they don’t have time to understand what exactly will be expected of them.) At times the new initiatives when deployed break the platform or cause other issues. It doesn’t seem like they tested these deployments thoroughly before making them public. As a customer service agent, you’ll need to grow a thick skin due to developers inability to take constructive feedback, answer customer complaints, and constant need to stroke their ego. Be prepared to say “I’m sorry, Squarespace doesn’t do that” frequently. Feature requests up the chain do absolutely no good. They aren’t read nor ever acted upon, they are merely a way to placate the customer. They are also summarily ignored like quickly dissipating smoke.

When we did get trained on new initiatives or updates to the platform, it was conducted by people who never touched the product/platform, nor understood what or how it worked in actuality. Dedicated trainers would even provide unfocused and incorrect information to new hires. In the past, training was conducted by working peers who would pass on their tried and true knowledge before pushing new hires out into the queue. This was a better way to learn, learn from those who are actually doing the job versus those who never touch the product/platform day to day.

No career growth, nor any opportunity to advance your career. Want to be a web designer or software engineer or grow into one of those roles? Better look elsewhere. Especially if you land a job in Dublin or Portland. The odds are only slightly better if you are in NYC, but even still, they don’t grow their employees at all. They rarely look at internal talent when looking to fill managerial, technical, and design roles. It has been said that the job you interview for will be the same one you’ll have 2+ years down the road. Executives absolutely know that the churn and burn rate is also 2 years per customer service agent as well. So don’t expect to be mentored or recommended for promotions, you probably won’t be there long enough to see any. Want to know why there are always “classes” of newly hired people? It’s because the seasoned folks who have reached burnout and have no outlet have left and they need to fill in the empty space. They could absolutely leverage their office locations and provide really fantastic places to work, like in Dublin. In Dublin, they could be the main European hub and provide support in native languages, not just English due to the availability of agents with multilingual backgrounds. In Portland, which is known for being a design and developer hub, they could provide not only template development, but tiered support and possibly even charge for in-house design and development.

High stress without a way to alleviate that stress. The customer service floors are chaotic where team leads and supervisors have nerf dart gunfights over the heads of customer service agents trying to do their 5 chats an hour. It’s loud, distracting, and you’d better take advantage of the good headphones they offer you, you’ll need them to cut out the noise. You are expected to take 2+ chats simultaneously and keep them at around 15 minutes long. Taking on an issue for a customer that lasts longer will affect your closely monitored metric (you can be written up if you deviate and only take say 4 chats per hour. The metric doesn’t care if those chats are difficult to work through or require thought beyond billing questions.) Not only this, but they will micromanage you to death on just about everything. Want to work in the quiet rooms? They’ll ask why you don’t want to sit with your team. Interested in learning more about how JSON-T regioning works? They’ll ask why when developer mode isn’t supported by nor necessary for you to do your (customer service) job. Interested in applying for or wanting to do the summer internship in NYC? Why, aren’t you happy doing customer service, I hope you don’t want to leave *my* team. Want to ask your coworkers playing games around you if they’d quiet down? You’ll be seen as negative and not a team player. At every turn, they will attempt to placate and gaslight you and make you feel like you aren’t deserving of any advancement nor respect.

Workload. Here I’ll talk about the office and role I worked. It probably comes as no surprise, I was a customer service agent. As a customer service agent, you were expected to take consecutive and simultaneous chats during the day. The total came about to 5 per hour. Doesn’t seem like a lot written out, but let’s play a small game. You take your 1st chat immediately after logging into the chat software. (Better make sure you have your coffee right then and there, you won’t be getting up anytime soon.) Then the second one follows immediately after. If you miss it and the one after that, the system automatically logs you as “inactive” which will be marked down. Too many of these and your team lead will talk to you about timeliness in your next biweekly 1 on 1. As you take your chats, they are also expected to be about 10 - 15 minutes in length maximum. Going over this time and you’ll be talked to about time management and cheerfully closing out your chats faster. It takes absolutely no consideration on the type of chat you are in nor if the customer is totally confused. You know what else this scenario doesn’t take into account? The human need to stretch, use the facilities, have lunch, or refresh themselves in between chats with customers. Now multiply all this by 39. Thirty-nine hours per week that you will be taking on chats. They give you maybe one hour a week to learn something new. The one nice thing is that you do have the ability to transition a particularly tough chat to email to follow up, but usually the customer dictates when that happens, not you. The constant go-go-go of the metric and nature of the work is extremely tough to get through day after day after day. Even motivated people with a high work ethic have trouble with this constant after a couple months. I could venture a guess that this is why Squarespace tends to hire ex-Apple employees on the regular. But even they struggle with this workload after a couple months. 

Remember how I mentioned the catered lunches? Good luck making it down to grab a plate while in chats. Lunch was delivered around 11am and just about everyone will scramble to get a plate and get back to their desk in time to grab another chat before their scheduled lunch time. Team Leads and Supervisors would saunter down to grab a plate without a worry in the world. Agents would have to strategize and figure out the best way to get a plate while still scheduled in chats. Some wouldn’t make it down at all and miss out on food, as a result having to make a quick lunch using available snacks and hustle back to their desk. (There was even a menu about how to make things using available ingredients in the snack cupboard if you missed lunch. Seriously.) MANY agents ate their lunch while still working regardless of when their actual lunch was scheduled.

Burnout. <— This is a bad word at Squarespace. If you merely mention that you are starting to feel burnt out due to the workload, quite a few things will begin to happen. Your team lead will begin to be skeptical about your “devotion to the brand and the customers.” A target will be placed on your back. Any and all concerns that you have had up to this point will be seen as negative. Any and all constructive feedback provided by others or by your team lead will come back to bite you. They will try to find ways to undermine your abilities and won’t look to you for understanding or possible causation. You’ll basically be tossed aside, your thoughts, experiences, and concerns placated until you decide to leave or they figure out a legal way to get rid of you. As a company, they will try to downplay the possibility that the workload causes burnout. Ask an executive (like the head of Customer Ops) about how they are handling this problem and they will sidestep the issue like a slick politician.

The moonlighting policy is extremely biased. Say you feel like you’ve learned a lot on the job and you’d love to start creating sites for clients on the side. You know, so you can learn the product and make some side cash, because they aren’t really allowing viable training time to learn new templates or the new initiatives. Not so fast, you will have to submit that to the legal team for approval. What if you’re in school and are learning code or need to gain real world experience for a grade? What if you are in a business that is suddenly doing well? You’ll have to submit all that to legal to ensure there is no conflict of interest. I understand that is an important part of a business to make sure there is discretion and no one is stealing customers, but the rules seem rather draconian in application. 

Do you want a normal 9-5 after the craziness that is shift work (at a retail store?) Better look elsewhere, your schedule is not your own and at the whim of “needs of the business”. Guess what, it’s shift work. It’s seriously not better than your old retail position and the hours are longer and potentially more varied. The Portland office is especially susceptible to a varied schedule. You could be scheduled up to 11pm or midnight in some cases. Want to have a better balance between work and your life? You’re better off at Starbucks or Apple where they at least close by 8pm. Think you got out of working on Saturdays and Sundays? Nope, you’ll do at least one weekend a month. So that splitting up of a weekend midweek is still something you’ll have to contend with.

What about that “unlimited” vacation though, aren’t you able to take a vacation when you need to? Um, no. That wonderful unicorn that is unlimited vacation is pretty limited and monitored. You get about 2 weeks per year, it doesn’t accrue (so they don’t have to pay you out if/when you leave), and is completely dependent upon how many people are already off from your team and office. The average for each office is around 2 people can be off at any specific time period. Fortunately, if you’re sick or need a personal day (just one), you’re ok. If you’re sick, you could work from home. If you do submit time off for a vacation, better do it way far in advance and be sure to bring it up in conversation with your team lead frequently, they may attempt to gaslight you or “forget” about your request and you’ll have to seek refunds for those plane tickets. 

Ineffectual HR. They ask current employees throughout the year to submit reviews on Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and other sites to puff themselves up and make them look awesome from the outside. So while there may be a lot of “Innovative Place to Work” or “Best Job Ever” reviews, the more lengthy and detailed ones saying “Meh” or “You Risk your Mental Health Working Here” are ones to pay attention to and there is definitely truth within those. Granted, HR is there to ensure that the company’s values are adhered to which is normal for any company. But when they attempt to mask the problems, flat out refuse to sign a diversity pledge, or place blame on employees for harassment, how can you seriously feel ok going to them if you have troubles while on the job. Not only that, but going to them with a grievance may put a target on your back due to the perception of your “negativity.”

Overall toxic environment. While I understand a lot of what I experienced as an employee gave me insight in a small and very specific scope, seeing things happen to my fellow coworkers made me feel helpless and stuck in what amounts to a dead-end job. There is so much cronyism and bro-culture at the office I worked, it was difficult to get through the day sometimes. There were a lot of back-patting promotions that occurred during my tenure there, even after it was formalized with interviews for said positions. There were also demotions and firings for nothing more than speaking your mind. If you are outspoken and raise concerns about how you or others are treated, a target will be placed on your back. You’ll be seen as negative and they will be very skeptical of you moving forward, so much so they may make you feel like nothing is going to change and it’s your fault. They will also begin to try to break you down. This is the culture of Squarespace. 

I was hired when there was a fun, startup mentality. We all had each other’s back and there was camaraderie and excitement in what we were doing and the goals we were working towards. Fast forward to now, the culture is toxic and paranoid as I’ve illustrated in the paragraphs above. But it doesn’t even scratch the surface. Some people have had to go into therapy because of the mistreatment they received at the hands of management and executives.

Moving out of retail, Squarespace seemed to be a logical step towards getting into web design, with it’s slick templates/themes, hipster-cool employees, and museum quality downtown offices. Don’t be fooled by their slick presentations and misleading promises to you during hiring. They will wave these in front of your face and hope you won’t follow up if extended a hiring letter. These promises will quickly evaporate and you’ll be stuck in a job that isn’t better than the retail job you left or the call center job you didn’t sign up for. Once the “Kool-Aid” wears off and you see what it’s really like, you will feel like you wasted your time."

207,Squarespace,Past the tipping point,2017-03-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Luxurious office space, fantastic benefits, free food, lots of wonderful and smart people.","Squarespace likes to push the notion that they care. Do not be fooled by the fancy benefits, fancy office spaces, and HR presentations. While these perks are quite nice and worth a good amount of money, they are in place to attract talent and because its where the industry bar has been set. 

Some of what I'm about to say is relevant only to the department in which I worked  and does not necessarily apply to the company as a whole. However, some of it does. 

The spirit of collaboration is dead here. While autonomy can be nice in that there is no micromanaging - you are simply  trusted to just do a good job - the reality is that Its largely every person for themselves. If you want to learn anything and grow ""you gotta steal it."" (as stated repeatedly by upper management.)

Opportunity and advancement seems somewhat arbitrary – with some people working for over a year at levels well above their title or what they were being paid for and others being hired or promoted for positions in which they had close to zero experience (including positions in management.) Obviously this is not across the board, but when it comes to hiring management, one bad decision can (and did) cause significant inertia in critical areas where the company shouldn't have been falling behind. 

Equally as arbitrary is how they choose to deal with sexual harassment. (Not implied, subtle undermining, mind you,  but blatant, public, verifiable acts.)  Over the course of a few years there were a handful of firings for this kind of misconduct, but there were also exceptions that involved a mere slap on the wrist. The distinction was seemingly based on whether the employe had established their value to the company as a worker. 

That is - if you're talented, hard working and generally good at your job, you're more likely to get away with it. And some have. 

Like other prominent tech companies, there seems to be a bit of wiggle room in the so called Zero Tolerance Harassment Policy. If the recent TechCrunch article is any indication, (""Uber is Not the Only Company That Mishandles Sexual Harassment Claims"") Squarespace has proven that it is sadly on par with the tech industry in this respect. 

After one such public allegation, HR did a lengthy presentation addressing issues of diversity and harassment  in which it reiterated its policies and stated that they are a ""safe place"" for any employee to come and speak honestly.  

However, the truth is that they are there to protect the interests of the company first and foremost. This became clear when on each of the two times I brought up my discomfort about an employee who had not been dismissed after publicly harassing a colleague, my concerns were received with something between well maneuvered neutrality and politically necessary indifference. 

That said, Squarespace is not altogether a bad place. When I started, the true spirit of a start up was still intact; It was clear that the people there were driven by the desire to innovate and do their best work – a genuinely exciting and fulfilling environment to be in. It could be said that it has merely encountered the common tipping point in the growth curve where principles take a back seat to politics and integrity rapidly degrades. If you go into it with this in mind, you'll be fine. However, this was not a transition I could abide."

- Management is self-serving and ill-equipped to do their jobs. Upwards feedback is deflected. Managers goof around with nerf fights and other distractions while agents are too busy. If you do provide valid and constructive feedback, be ready to be lectured on how grateful you should be that they provide free lunch and snacks.

- Drink the office Kool-Aid if you want to get anywhere. I get it, every office has its politics, but Squarespace has it dialed up to 11. I've seen quality employees get overlooked in favor of company cheerleaders who spend more time playing ping-pong than working.

- Little to no growth opportunities from entry-level CC positions.

- No innovation in CC. Management doesn't care to hear it from agents.

- For all intents and purposes, CC is separate from the rest of the company. Don't bother hoping to move elsewhere, or at the very least get an opportunity to learn from and to collaborate with members in other departments. Yes, some CC agents have been promoted to the mothership, but that was a long time ago and the org is just too big now.

- Inadequate training, and when you are struggling, leadership throws you shade and makes you feel incompetent. It's a lot of the old guard spouting lines like ""well I didn't have this training when I started and I could do it so why can't you?""

- My role changed to one with added responsibility but without a pay raise.



The thing is, I've had jobs I've liked way less. It's a better than retail as far as the day-to-day is concerned, but the Squarespace culture is just so toxic.

Their presence on Crain's Best Places to Work is compelling, but keep in mind companies have to submit themselves to be eligible and acceptance is based on evaluations submitted by employees. A good chunk of Squarespace doesn't work in CC, so bear that in mind when factoring that into your decision to apply."
209,Squarespace,I thought I was joining an innovator in the tech industry but I ended up in a call center.,2017-02-27,2.0,Customer Care Representative,"Above-average pay for customer service/call center work. This would be a good job right out of college, or possibly as a transition between nametag-customer-service and working in an office environment. The pros are definitely in place to dull the drudgery of menial customer service work. You could do a lot worse.

If you're any further in your career and think working for a tech company may be beneficial to your development, please see below.","I applied for work here when the Portland office was opening, lured by the promise of getting in on the ground floor of a new office for a growing company. However, this office is a complete dead end, as Squarespace's customer care is run like another, separate company within the company. There's no room to move up. New positions within customer care are few and far between, and most management positions are given to outside hires. A title and role change doesn't mean a pay raise, and since customer care is constantly reshuffling and restructuring, what used to be your own separate role will suddenly become something baked into everyone else's job. When I began, for example, the transition from email to live chat came with a pay raise, and only if you elected to pursue it. Now it's been shuffled in as a standard responsibility for everyone in customer care. Sadly, I was moved to live chat during that shuffling, so my job completely changed under me and I saw no compensation. I would not have elected to do live chat if given the choice, but unfortunately I was the last person with any opinion on my career at Squarespace.

Pay raises are nominal, infrequent, and matched by incoming employees' base salaries, leaving tenured, hardworking employees with nothing to show for their efforts and time. It's clear management is ill-equipped to support the needs of their employees; they don't share the workload and are mainly there to babysit you and feed you the company line. When you've spent an hour taking abuse from an irate winery owner who's unable to log into their account because they've had their caps lock on the whole time, it can be quite lousy to have to sit down with your supervisor and be told how you could've possibly ended the interaction sooner, or how you could've been more cheerful in your responses.

The moment you stop drinking the Kool-Aid, things go downhill fast. Advocate for yourself and you'll just put a target on your back. Often the benefits are thrown back in your face; on multiple occasions, mentions of unfair treatment or untenable changes were met with a reminder that we get free lunch or ""unlimited"" PTO. I've heard stories as well as seen firsthand people have their place in the company threatened for asking inconvenient (but valid) questions in ""ask me anything""-style meetings. Many would call this retaliation.

Customer Care is the first point of contact for customers, and the furthest away from any actionable change. You'll tire of hearing the same basic shortcomings of the platform and fielding suggestions that cannot possibly be implemented. You'll soon tire of submitting feature requests or bug fixes, as you know most of them fall on deaf ears.

There's an utter lack of ongoing product training after onboarding, and as the platform and internal policies are eternally shifting, you can ask three people the same question and get three answers that were right at one point or another. Features and integrations are constantly implemented and live tested without warning. Sometimes you'll be informed of a change through a backdated email, or when a customer reaches out with an issue about said change, leaving you scrambling for an answer on the fly. This leads to an aggressive in-house apathy where advisors just try to push emails and chats through as fast as possible without actually *solving* the problems customers present.

Management doesn't keep promises and benefits are slowly being scaled back. Open communication is mainly lip service; management will say ""we're looking into it"" when a valid issue is brought up and then never readdresses the issue. Often you're told to come up with a project to solve an issue that's beyond your authority to address. Other times, you'll be asked for ""actionable feedback,"" which is another way of shrugging off staff concerns and gaslighting you into thinking nothing's going to change, and that it's your own fault things haven't.

Most of the perks are in place a) because that's where the tech-world bar's been set and b) to maintain the company's image. There's a reason the office is smack-dab in the middle of downtown Portland; Squarespace wants to be seen as cool and vital, even though they're just running a call center. The hip, sleek office is actually quite sterile and unfriendly, especially as we were discouraged from hanging anything on walls. There's an eerie paranoia surrounding allowing visitors or the general public to see what it looks like inside. The ""open"" office environment means no privacy or personal space. Team Leads and advisors who aren't yet in chat make distracting levels of noise, leaving you feeling like a curmudgeon for having to focus on your concurrent chats. Personal space isn't respected, and often you'll come in to find your chair readjusted or straight-up missing, and personal items on your desk broken or missing.

Some of this you can turn a blind eye to and possibly abide a lot earlier in your career. However, it'll wear you down sooner rather than later, especially chat, where KPIs are unrealistic, as has been admitted by management (but of course, nothing's been done about it). Based on the direction things had been taking in the two years I'd worked there, it's only bound to get worse."

You'll learn lots about web design, domains, SEO and other Internet stuff.","I worked in Squarespace for three years and I never got the chance to work with my native language, which I was hired for in the first place. 

The company opened in Dublin with the idea of expanding the platform in Europe. They've failed at that, due to lack of planning, zero marketing and of course the fact that the platform and help site isn't translated into other languages.

The service is too expensive for most customers - excepting those in the US, I guess - and taking that into account it's impossible that it will ever grow in LA countries and most European countries at such expensive rates.

If you're a bilingual person and would like to work in your native language, Squarespace isn't the place for you. You'll be working exclusively in English.

Also, no chances to grow internally. Most leadership positions are filled with external professionals - almost all team leaders, HR and the two managers were hired externally. When I left, I had actually been in the company longer than all team leaders and managers. How weird is that.

Also, lots of favouritism, finger pointing and back stabbing. You'll see groups of friends and how some agents grow and take on new projects every now and then, while most of the others - usually with better results and metrics - never get the chance to grow. The more visible and noisy you are, the more you'll grow."

Catered lunch / snacks
Company outings","Upper management sees you as a number. Metrics are almost impossible to meet. A lot of the emphasis is on Live Chat, and if you're not hitting five an hour, then you just put a target on your back. Most of the times this is out of your control as the volume isn't there. In addition to this, there are a lot of customers that require more in depth assistance, yet management doesn't care. They want quantity over quality, in order to meet the needs of the business. We get countless compliments from customers regarding our service, which is true. The customer care department is one of the most dedicated teams I've worked with, but the sheer expectations of management will lead you to be overworked and burnt out very quickly. 

You're put into teams and assigned to a team lead, who just consistently micro manage you. You can't really blame them as this is all in the hands of upper management. If you're more of an independent worker, then this place isn't for you. Be prepared to get reprimanded if you're not meeting or exceeding your metrics.

Everything is a competition. Recognition is great, but to boast about certain people exceeding expectations isn't encouraging at all, and it tends to make people feel worthless, and things like this often leads to favoritism. 

Also note that you will apologize to customers a countless number of times for features that the platform doesn't have because the product is severely lacking. I've learned of so many creative ways to say sorry to customers. 

The customer care team is incredibly huge, over 200 employees, which makes up the majority of the company. With that being said, there is zero room for growth. I've been with the company for three years, and never had the opportunity to show my true talents, even though you have the chance to contribute to other speciality teams, you're left to do the grunt work. I've literally been told that Squarespace may not be the place for me by one of my supervisors, and that I should consider another job because of this. Seriously.

When I first started, this was a true start up and a very close, tight knit community. Forget about that now. No one speaks to each other, and overall the team is very ""clique-ey"" Products and changes will be released with little notice. On top of this, you don't really get to learn the product because you're answering chats and tickets all day. How are you expected to be productive and have a steady workflow when you know nothing about the product, or things are sprung on you last minute. 

Management has a BS open door policy. They urge you to bring up concerns and ideas. However, if those don't match to the opinions of management, then again, you just made yourself a target. I've learned that some of my colleagues have been terminated for speaking up about the rampant favoritism that goes on here. 

While the benefits are amazing, you're left to feel extremely over worked and under paid. 

All in all, if you're a compassionate, empathetic person, who truly wants to help people, and are seeking out growth then this isn't the place for you."

Apparently they didn't get the memo that the company's problems are because the product and technology sucks (To be fair it's ok just stagnant and falling way behind). Also a lot of deadweight here.

There is a missed opportunity for Squarespace to have the most successful customers treated with a higher level of attention from the best support agents.

People get burnt out and feel disenfranchised about the state of their career progression in CustOps, and it's hard to be around sometimes, because in a sense it is true that it is hard to move up in the company, but that's kind of the nature of a large successful company.

However, there are plenty of people who feel entitled to better positions and quicker growth because they believe and champion their intellect over others.

227,Squarespace,A disgrace to the PDX tech community,2016-07-31,2.0,Customer Care,"- Health insurance premium paid 100% by Squarespace
- Employer matches for 401k contributions
- Catered lunch every weekday","Pretty much everything else about the job. It'll seem like a dream come true for the first 6 months with free lunch, but once you see how everything really is behind the fake happy front everyone puts up you'll be pretty miserable.

Overall, the company acts fairly egotistical and doesn't seem to care much about customer feedback. Those bug reports you'll be filing and the feature requests you'll be submitting will most likely be ignored by engineering. You'll spend most of your days in three  Live Chats at a time giving workarounds for features that should be there and making excuses for shortcomings in the product.

In Portland, the company has zero presence in anything related to the local tech community. When some employees spoke up to management about this, they were given many excuses as to why this was the case all while painting Squarespace as still caring about contributing to the local tech community. There was also the topic of diversity brought up multiple times by different employees. Even though management says they care about diversity, I still see tons of caucasian hipster-like new hires in their 20s. Actions speak louder than words.

You're expected to dedicate your entire life to working at Squarespace and if you want to do anything outside of work (including volunteering), you need to sign a form and get approval from legal. If you don't fill out the form and they find out...that's an offense that could get you terminated. 

The main downside to dedicating you entire life to Squarespace is the fact that there are no growth opportunities. Customer Care is so large that it is run as a separate company within the company, so there is little conversation and few ways to bridge into working in other departments. This also applies for individuals that have the skills to work in another department. The training team is out of touch with the product and teaches incorrect things, so you're essentially thrown into the queue unprepared and stressed out. 

All of this is happening while managers still gaslight you that there are opportunities and that you're just not working hard enough to prove that you deserve something more. Unless you have a stroke of luck, they'll most likely end up just shoulder tapping someone who plays the politics game better than you or hiring an external candidate.

They expect people to go above and beyond, yet offer little incentive to do so. Even the salary is not very comparable given the rising rents in Portland. That is another thing that was brought up and ignored by management/HR. I've heard stories about people getting a promotion, yet never got a raise for that promotion until their comp review...which was months later. Overall it seems like a game to see how much more they can get you to do, without compensating you any more.

If you don't like it...don't speak up. Management will put a target on your back and try to come up with any excuse as to why your argument is incorrect in an attempt to silence you by threatening your job. Once upon a time this was a great office environment, but now management/HR rules by making people afraid of losing their jobs. The open door policy is a joke.

Overall, it's great for a first time job and resume builder since the outside community doesn't quite realize how awful this company is yet, but if you still decide to accept a job here don't expect anything more than another bullet of experience on your resume. Oh also free lunch too."
228,Squarespace,A Stain on the Portland Tech Community,2016-07-25,2.0,Customer Care,"The medical benefits are great, and there are catered lunches along with kitchens stocked with junk food. Hiring is also pretty spot-on, advisors a lot of mutual interests that make workplace conversations very entertaining.","Pretty much everything that has to do with the job itself. You're underpaid, held to arbitrary metrics that can change without notice, and despite claims to the contrary, your career won't go anywhere unless you manage to luck out. But don't expect that to happen to you.

Once upon a time it was a pretty fun place to work at, and it even felt like a stereotypical tech company job that you see on TV where it had a fun and loose atmosphere. However the company started growing faster than it could support, in part thanks to the multi-million dollar advertising campaigns, and the area that suffered the most was the customer support end. 

But suddenly the focus shifted from email to live chat because this was allegedly the hot new thing for customer support trends. The smiles began to fade as the environment became more like a depressing computer farm, where many advisors were either struggling with their product knowledge (since you rarely receive any additional product training after you hire in, including updates/changes that you are never informed of because advisors are not important) or making creative apologies for the platform's numerous bugs or missing features.

And when it comes time for your compensation review, don't count on much more than getting bumped up to the current pay that incoming advisors will get due to the cost of living increase. Your seniority and projects will play no part in your comp review despite possibly being mentioned as they go over your year, as the focus will only be on your live chat metrics. Also don't expect a Christmas bonus or any other kind of thank you for your year of hard work.

Don't like it? Don't speak up about it, because all you're doing is putting a target on your back and sooner or later there will be an excuse to get rid of you. This is the work environment we're currently dealing with, and the amount of paranoia the managers currently have means that it's pretty likely that this whole house of cards will come down on itself in an ugly way. 

For a company that spends millions of dollars on advertising themselves as a ""creative"" and easy platform, they sure don't bother sharing any revenue with their employees who work significantly harder. Once you're in it's harder to get out because of the steady paycheck and benefits, so do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Don't degrade yourself, don't apply to Squarespace."

They start with a good spirit (at the beginning) and quickly develop an egotistic approach at the contact of the new management that are imposing them to micro manage (they know everything, they have seen everything in the industry... no need to feed you more on that). 

Retain the keyword: MICRO MANAGEMENT

This is their new crusade, as they are convinced that this is by following every single people's movements they will become more productive and responsive than similar companies on the market. Wrong.

Everything changed between the moment I started. The old office was at Benson Street, with the Grand Canal Dock spirit and atmosphere. It felt like a real startup where changes, development, growth were possible. They quickly arranged themselves (voluntarily or not) to clean what was great to replace it by the worst... When things turned sour and bitter was the transition to the new location in Great Ship Street, Le Pole House where the office is now located. 

Decisions are made and done behind curtains (a lot), one thing is announced and will never see the light of the day. We then saw a massive growth of the team (which should be positive when properly handled... but wasn't). Then some projects were continuing to develop (or not), applied a week as pilot, removed the week after, No structure, proper guidelines leaving the Shift Leads (Supervisors) empty handed, with issues to guide us in the queues. They are testing things like amateurs. Not even Facebook are running pilots this way. . 

Important aspect to underline here, they divided the leads in 2 parts: Team leads and Shift Leads. Those helping us in the queues, answering our questions (any, and they were fantastic at this) were them, leaving the Team Leads doing just 1:1 and doing their shenanigans in the back with a minimum of interactions with us on a daily basis. The sad result of this is obviously having no visibility on what we really do and judging us through metrics that are not even reliable (internal tools breaking reflecting different numbers one week and another). 

We have been initially hired because of our language to support other markets... almost 2 years later... and still going, no support in other languages. They are supposedly working on an international expansion but the support for the english speaking market is still not yet fully secured. This aspect comes back naturally to incompetency. Reminding that the company is already more than 10 years and yet NO international support. Naturally the pressure of the investors might be knocking hard(er) to get results.

- Growth and development ==> Inexistent. As I mentioned, the oldest that arrived first had eventually a chance to get a bone or some left overs, for the new guys, you are hired as Customer Advisors and will stay in that role. If you ever try to step up, lead some projects, present at the local team meeting, or even request to apply for an internal position (when it is posted), regardless of what you do best, you will never have a chance to progress EXCEPT if you are the buddy of a team lead, shift lead or a manager. The number of people who progressed just by being best friends of somebody in the management is countless. The word for this is FAVOURITISM or POLITICS. You will tell me that they exist everywhere but in Squarespace Dublin this is the HQ for such practices. 

- Work/Life Balance ==> Expect to work shifts between 7am and 8pm. Not the same from one day to the other one. Changing without warning when an event comes (advertising campaigns in the US = change of your schedule with just 48h prior warning. Do they know people have lives? Families? Responsibilities outside of this company? No! 2016 and still no improvement. Once you get your shifts for the quarter there are no turnarounds, take it or leave it as I have heard being said once. They will expect to constantly move between channels when their new Channel Leads are sneezing. I have seen people doing full day in chats and forced to keep 2 concurrent chats and being denied to run to the toilets. They had to even make public meetings about the problems. As it has been highlighted in previous reviews, they give you a treat (ice cream) and the minute after they announce you they will change your schedule. Beware of the treats they are made to make you swallow the worst.

- Culture and values ==> Well, we went from a startup that used to praise unicorns and rainbows to a place that looks like to hell. Not sure how the other offices are run in Portland and New York, but after previously outlining what i said above, not sure there is much left of a culture and values. When people are being let go for nothing, when the respect of the people who are contributing to the growth of this company is not recognized (not speaking of a new absurd system to recognize ""stars""... next step, they will give people vouchers or lollipops). Useless local meeting that are constantly changing, not regularities, empty content (oops the monkey, where you are supposed to tell to the whole assembly your oops moment of the week, and if you win, you keep on your desk a non washed monkey). There was a culture before, when all the best people started the things (for CFO, former customer office Manager... well in fact all the people they pushed outside to hire instead people from Google in the top management team to ""clean"" the place as it seems the good couldn't stay. 

It breaks my heart to write this review as I really thought I found with Squarespace the company I would spend a lot of time with, but the venture of Squarespace in Dublin is the perfect example on how great things can turn wrong for any company settling in a different country. There was a real care about the people who joined this ""famunity"" as they called it at the start, and then quickly the things turned to be sour and bad to the point where I saw people preferring to leave and ready to take a cut in salary for other people rather than staying in this place. 

Maybe it wasn't perfect at the start, maybe there wasn't a lot of benefits but there was warmth, people respecting each other, helping each other and having a passion of the products, all you can see now are people stuck with no chance to progress and prove they are do and accomplish things, they turn bitter and angry and end up making no efforts to stay. They end up being burnt out, tired and emptied of energy."
238,Squarespace,Dealing with facts,2016-04-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The platform.  I will be the first person to say I firmly and staunchly support/believe in the product.  It's a product that empowers and enables it's users to focus on their craft and to not sweat the minutia; like building out your online presence.  

The CEO, I'm a little torn on this one.  Ultimately I'm a big fan of Anthony's, I think he has a built an incredibly successful product and has a passion for the business he's created.  However why I default to a neutral opinion on him is this; the culture failure in Customer Operations as a whole and particularly PDX ultimately falls on him as the head of this company.

Catered lunch Monday-Friday? (Just kidding, that's factored into your overall salary and monetized in your offer letter)","Unlimited PTO:
Unlike traditional PTO accrual you have ""unlimited"" or the now phrased ""flexible"" PTO.  Unlimited sounds like a solid deal until you examine the way Squarespace handles this benefit.  Traditional PTO are hours you've earned and by most reasoning exist as your own actual income.  With Unlimited PTO you have no accrual, hence no cash out if you leave the company, cap out on hours; not the biggest of gripes overall.  The big clincher is the clause Squarespace provides with the PTO: *Within the needs of the business.  This phrase is rather benign and does not raise any red flags immediately but be aware that your request for PTO is based off of a 1 person per team (13 or so people) per day, another restriction that takes precedent is an overall cap for the office, and as you may have guessed by now that cap is below 1 person per team.  Finally your now ""flexible"" PTO is actually managed at around 2 weeks of PTO per year, congratulations on being as competitive with time as my first job bagging groceries.  

Summary: Unlimited PTO sounds great, but you won't likely be able to use it much.


Career Opportunities: 
Here I will only be able to speak to Customer Operations in Portland, Oregon.  It's pretty simple.  You will likely never advance into another role aside from the one you're hired for.  If you do, you won't get a raise until your next review cycle (once a year), this may or may not take into account your new role.  That last statement probably sounds weird, well it's because it is.  Squarespace has a ""solely performance"" based compensation structure.  This means you will only ever be up for compensation review once a year, changing roles does not impact this.  Almost forgot, compensation reviews have a possibility of a 0% increase, even for those far below a compensation cap.

Summary: You likely will never advance if you work in the Portland, OR office (strictly Customer Operations), if you are one of the few, you will not be compensated for it; possibly for an entire 6-12  months.


Senior Management:
I'd love to protect my anonymity so I won't say a lot.

Summary: Let's call it an area of opportunity


Work/Life Balance:
This one will likely be met with some immediate, ""But it's great right now!"".  Squarespace has a goal of expanding Live Chat coverage to be 24/7.  As with previous support structures such as email, Customer Operations in Portland will cover the hours of 8am-12pm PST.  Be aware, you will work weekends and you will work late night shifts; maybe not now, but you will.

Summary: This is a support center for a 24/7 support structure, your schedule is dictated by demand, end of story.


Culture and Values:
Apparently Squarespace scores a 4.4 out of 5 at the current juncture.  Senior management will regularly encourage everyone to fill out Glassdoor reviews and surveys around high points of the year and while they enter various workplace popularity contests.  Exit paperwork includes quite the legal talk about why you can't and shouldn't say anything negative about the company; I'm no mathematician but 4.4 makes a lot more sense now.


The Way Things Were:
This one will arguably sound very whine-y; I believe it's worth noting for a company that has grown more fiscally prosperous quarter over quarter.  There are employees who joined this company during a time where annual boat cruises to celebrate with your team happened, holiday gifts were given, standing desks were provided for employees looking to avoid a completely sedentary work life.  I do indeed know these are nice to haves and they were great, they were also monetized in your offer letter and a huge part of the culture and reasons you could feel invested in and valued.  These things will likely continue to dissipate over as time goes on.

Summary: As the company scales, these things will change.  ""Scalability” is the name of the game.  Don't be fooled.  Squarespace Portland is not an innovative startup with a similar culture, it is a corporate support center.  Quantity is #1 as the KPI to rule them all.


Compensation:
Entry level support positions pay roughly the same as some of the more established coffee shops and retail establishments in town.

Summary: If you're a single debt free individual you may just be able to afford a studio in Portland city proper on entry level wage.


Benefits:
There is no public transit stipend, because according to Squarespace, no one offers this benefit;   well other than every other tech company on the west coast, but I digress.  No fitness reimbursement, so expect to run your butt off on your own dime after sitting in the same spot taking live chats for 9 hours a day, according to Squarespace no other tech companies offer this benefit as well, oh wait, except every other tech company on the west coast, but I digress.  Your health, vision and dental is paid by Squarespace; vision is standard VSP, health and dental are the worst plans I have ever had.  Be prepared to pay around $2,000 out of pocket for surgical procedures like tonsillectomies and wisdom tooth extractions with this coverage.  Comparatively at my previous employer, both of these would have been covered at a 100% or an out of pocket expense of less than $200.  Work from home can sometimes be an expectation of your job as well, they offer no partnership or subsidy for internet costs.

Summary: Vision is standard, health coverage sucks, dental coverage sucks, no fitness reimbursement, no internet subsidy/partnership, no public transit subsidy.  Benefits are paid by employer however."

The company provides lots of snacks, drinks, cookies that will motivate you at first. Weekly meetings take place with news, games and jokes to update and help employees learn new stuff while having fun.","Working hours from 7am to 8pm depending on the day. You'll never start/finish at the same time more than two days in a row, makes it hard to handle personal life or other activities. Also, you'll be working some weekends. 

Breaks are controlled and lunch breaks are taken at a different time every day. Sometimes before lunch has arrived or when it's already removed. Lots of employees will rather have snacks or crisps as lunch is usually taken in front of your computer while working. Although this has been brought up, the company won´t make changes. I can't really understand how a good company will prioritize work volumes to your own health. 
Also, no chances to grow or develop a different role. The few employees who managed to evolve seem to get it through favouritism or cigarette-break friendship. Lots of brilliant employees with a great background and experience are left behind doing the same boring task day after day.

Company has been expected to provide support in several languages for the last TWO years and most of the employees (around a hundred) were hired for this purpose. However, there's no transparency as to how this is going to happen and it keeps being delayed and foreign employees, who applied for a linguistic role in their native language, are ignored and have only been working in English since their first day. 
Working hours have increased over the last year, from 32 to 40h/weekly, while salaries didn't.

Still, most of us were impressed by the free snacks, drinks and lunch, but this won't help once you start getting exhausted from the rotating shifts, repetitive tasks and no perspective of improvement.

Company has fired several employees without notice and they're always asked not to mention the reasons, which leaves it to outside office gossip. Some of them had babies or a foreign visa. 

Company doesn't allow for employees to carry second paid jobs even if ocassional. A couple of employees were fired on the spot as soon as company found out they had a side job.

If there's a concern or an issue, they will be ignored, delayed or replied with a reminder that our customers go first. I still remember the day we got free cupcakes first and then we received the news that we'd be working more hours weekly, with the same salary."

251,Squarespace,A Company That Values You!,2015-12-28,5.0,Commerce Specialist,"I have never felt as valued at a job as I do at Squarespace. Upon being hired, you are automatically enrolled in life insurance and health care (eye, dental and medical) that is covered in full by the company. Lunch is catered every day by a local catering company that cooks vegetables that are grown on their own farm (in Portland). There are snacks and drinks (soda water, energy drinks, teas, kombucha, pressed juices, coffees, etc.) that are stocked in the kitchens in the office. The food at Squarespace is just a great example of the generosity of the company. They value their employees and they really show it in the way that they treat you. Beyond the all you can eat buffet that is the office - You are truly listened to here, and are frequently given an opportunity to provide anonymous feedback via company surveys. Communication is kept open between all three offices and teams during the company-wide and department-wide monthly meetings. Management listens to feedback and makes changes quickly when possible. Above all, even though you are a salaried employee, you are scheduled a strict 40 hours (overtime pay if you go over) and when you leave the office, you leave your work behind. There is a great work/life balance here.","In Customer Operations, career development is really unclear. Depending on who your direct supervisor is, you may not have as good as an opportunity as other people. Advancement is largely up to your manager advocating for you, so hopefully you get stuck with a good manager! You really have to push yourself and have a super clear goal when getting hired on if you want to advance at all within Cust. Opps..

277,Squarespace,Went from good to very disappointing,2015-08-26,2.0,Customer Service Representative,"- Unlimited PTOs, you have to love that!
- The possibility to work from home -> But check out the Cons that go with that
- The people -> Most of them are great!","Well that's the issue... We had quite a few Pros, and now they are Cons:

- We were paid 40 hours while only working 36 hours

- They were quite flexible in their schedule, trying to make us work to live and not the contrary

------------------------

These aren't true anymore.

- Now I work 40 or more hours and I'm paid 40 hours.

- They are very stiff in their scheduling and as soon as you demand a change, you are told that they can't do that for everybody

- Live Chat... What to say? I did LC in the past, and I didn't mind it at all, but there they are just looking at the productivity. But the worst and the thing most of my LC colleagues complain about, is the fact that when your shift is done and you're still in chat, you have to wait half an hour before asking to transfer your chat; which can again take 10 / 15 minutes. -> Big, big issue!

- Team Leaders are chosen as Project Managers for project they have no clue how to lead, when people with the experience for these projects are completely ignored because they aren't TL. When I brought this up to their attention I was told it wasn't my place."
278,Squarespace,"Unprofessional leads, no growth, inmature attitude",2015-08-15,2.0,Customer Care Advisor,"- good benefits, 401K, free lunch, snacks and gifts
- chilled environment (too relaxed, so this can also be a con)
- good training
- If you're a recent college grad or just need a job to pay the bills, this is a good place to be.
- you don't need much intelligence, skills or experience to perform ""well""
- feedback is handled pretty easy: ""everything and you are doing awesome"" (can also be considered as an annoying con)
- you don't work much over time and if you do you get paid better","- absolutely no growth for smart, creative and dedicated people
- promotions are handled by and with sympathy, favoritism and just by having a cheerleader attitude (remember to repeat frequently that all is f*** awesome)
- schedule is annoying and doesn't provide a good life-work balance (you are demanded to work weekends, early or late hours, your needs are not being taken into consideration)
- team leads are inefficient and lack of people leading expereince, skills and don't know how to provide useful feedback.
- all kind of feedback is handled by filling in annoying surveys
- customer care department is like the third world country of the company: the ugliest office, the dirtiest facilities (fridge can be considered a zoo for fungus and microorganisms and the restrooms are shabby, leaking, etc.), the snacks are ok but compared to the other offices in CS are the cheapest and not well stocked)
- atmosphere is cold and borderline unfriendly (people don't consider greeting as common sense), with a lot of fake behavior to pretend that all is just oh so awesome
- the biannual review is not even based on your performance, rather than you just get per default a raise after 6 months - it's still nice but if you work hard it's a joke (so just don't work more than you have to, which can be a pro)
- high turnover 
- annoying meetings where it's more cheerleading than productive information"

286,Squarespace,WORKING HERE IS NIGHTMARE!,2015-02-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The benefits are great.  Pay is competitive.,"Outside of customer care, the corporate culture was extremely hostile.  Takedowns seemed to be a favorite past time from top management all the way down the ranks.  Everyone's always trying to prove themselves - not always in the best of ways.  People who had been there for several years were constantly worried about losing their job.  It's a dog eat dog culture and simply not what many expect from a startup.  It felt like people didn't want to see each other succeed.  

The company prides itself on being transparent and ""level"", and in many ways it is.  However, there's a lot of channels and unwritten rules that one quickly discovers.  The CEO is eccentric and difficult.  Reminds me a bit of the character Gavin on Silicon Valley.

They don't promote despite several yrs of service and growth. If you're straight out of college, it's good to have on the resume for a year but then go somewhere that does promote.

I'm sure for other people working here is a great experience, but it wasn't for me."
287,Squarespace,"Incredible workplace with fun and kind people, and a nurturing environment for growth in the organization",2015-01-20,5.0,Customer Care Specialist,"- Consistent contact with your manager that actual is able to vouch for your interests 
- Consistent workload that only gets more challenging in content, not in actual work.  Your knowledge increases, you're able to assist customers with more specific requests, and your title increases.  
- Visible paths to positions with more responsibility.  
- Full health and dental benefits for full-time employees
- Free lunch everyday.  
- One hour of break for lunch in the middle of your shifts, allows you to sit and chat with coworkers, play some FIFA in the game room, go for a walk, etc.  The way the shifts are setup allows for a complete hour break.  Do your work for your shift and it is mandatory to stop for an hour.  There is no pressure from the org or your coworkers to work during break for any reason, like there may be with other companies.  Then you are back on, ready to work again.
- Fully stocked kitchen.","- Newer employees come into a rapidly growing organization can feel overwhelmed by the content of the workload and the style of work.  It is difficult for some to acclimate to an environment like this. 
- Office in New York is decentralized and requires walking outside to go to meetings in other offices.  There is an inevitable, but sometimes weird split between the departments in different buildings with different amenities.  
E.G. One office in New York has private stalls, the other has communal bathrooms.  Small change stuff."

There were not enough desks for the amount of people who worked there. The weekly meetings were pointless. The compensation was awful compared to the amount of the work your were asked to do.

The best part about working here is not the work, but the people you meet - they only hire people with great personalities and it's hard to not feel at home here. You feel cared for and respected as an employee and you know they value you.","The work is not always fulfilling. Management can be unclear about the goals sometimes and also have difficulty communicating to the team so projects can take many directions without designated leaders to spearhead them. A lot of people can be worth separately on the same project without knowing someone is already solving the problem. Decisions aren't explained well and there are a lot of abrupt changes to the roadmap without clear explanation or context. A lot of projects are put on hold indefinitely or shut down without notice. Employees are on the young side so many don't have prior working experience though they do have a lot of energy and great ideas. The work can be repetitive after a while and the company isn't big enough for there to be switches between teams or promotions within. Generally employees come here, have a great experience and network with talented people, then peace out within a year for bigger opportunities elsewhere. Worthwhile nonetheless!"
