First of all, we have three main goals to reach and our manager will send our feedback weekly.Quality, productivity and so called client complaint(or should I say just a follow up email from the client) . Besides that, there is too much micromanagement. They just released a new software and everything is tracked in real time. Both of you and your manager can see the records and if you don't move your mouse in 5 mins then it will automatically goes to unaccounted time. they are expecting only an hour of unaccounted time for eight hours of shift and this includes half an hour of lunch already.Therefore, even if you reach the above three goals, if you have long unaccounted time, you still get called out by your boss which is not fair at all."

32,Sterling,Company With Potential Needs Work,2022-02-04,1.0,Verification Specialist,"* Working Remotely.
* 4 weeks off annually.","* Pay is 14.00 an hour.
* Heavy micromanaging by Team Leads. For example, if you clock out 1 minute early you will get an email from your Team Lead telling you that you clocked out early. 
* Unrealistic Expectations. For example, there are metric's that must be met. After hire by the 4th month you are expected to handle 50 services or accounts a day. By the 5th month 60 services and the 6th month 70 services. However, that is not true. You can be working your 50 or 70 services, whichever it may be and as you take the number down by closing them or working them, they are non stop adding more to your queue. It causes stress and unrealistic expectations. If one service is not touched in some way then there is an email from your Team Lead asking you why one was not done.
* No employee engagement. Sterling does monthly performance reviews and none of them are centered on the employee experience with Sterling and how they are doing, if they have too much work, etc. It's only on what you can do better and how you can get faster so that they can toss more work at you. 
* Unfair audits. Audits are done monthly and if you have a spelling error because you are human, you are told that it does not look good for the company. Eventhough the error can be fixed. Auditors make tons of errors reviewing your work, but when you speak up, you are made to feel like you are being too sensative and made to feel silenced.
* After all the stress Sterling put you through you only have a 30 minute meal break.
* Don't trust the overly positive 5 star reviews. They are not true. When new people come in the door, they ask them to go online and submit a good review during orientation."
33,Sterling,"Dysfunctional, Abusive Culture",2022-02-02,1.0,Sales Leader,Pay is their only redeeming quality,"The company is plagued with terrible narcissistic leaders who think fear and humiliation are the way to hold you accountable. You can succeed at every aspect of your job and still be treated like you failed. They tend to hire leaders with mental issues and inferiority complexes. Which in turn helps the employees who are just as broken thrive. Not even kidding one of my VP’s started a pyramid scheme and stole money from multiple employees. One head of sales started his first speech to the team with the line “So who’s heard of me?” Like he was some kind of celebrity lol. He ended up being fired for disrespecting everyone he came into contact with. Many employees ended up with anxiety issues after dealing with the constant torment from senior leadership. I can’t begin to write all the horror stories of meetings with people literally just yelling at each other and throwing one another under the bus. The worst part about it is that it was intentionally set up to got that way by the leaders. They encourage peers to publicly shame one another. It was crazy! I found it hard to understand coming from a company that was the polar opposite. I led one of the top sales teams and was rewarded with back handed emails. Constant criticism and a complete lack of leadership. There were constant fire drills for data. Everything was broken and only fixed at the expense of long hours put in by employees to give the outward appearance that the company is running well. They fail at acquisitions, ruining the companies they buy. They hire cheap labor overseas and pay them a fraction of what they should, leading to high turnover and terrible customer support. I could write a 100 page report here but to sum it all up. Don’t work here! And don’t sell your company to them!"

Good luck getting your bonuses paid out correctly. That is a constant battle. They treat offshore team members even worse. It's disgusting. HR sells a great culture to new hires, it's a joke. If you want to cry almost every single day, then this is the place for you. Advancement is only if you are the ""favorite"". Diversity, sure they have it. But you are not equal. Not even in pay.

I am still in training but I appreciate how Sterling provides all the equipments you need for this role,  and they have a great training to really prepare you for the job. They have amazing and really great trainers too! I'm so blessed to be one the trainees under them. I always feel excited coming to work (well, I am 100% remote but you know what I mean!)

My role specifically is an entry-level position, so I understand that the salary offer is not over the top, but honestly, this is a great start for me. Being part of a big company such as Sterling is a blessing. The role is also a back-end role, purely admin, and can sometimes feel like a routine. These are the types of work I like though but it might not work for everyone so just a heads up!

I am excited to see what Sterling has to offer for my career. I heard they have great career progression and cross-train those who are interested in learning more so I can't wait! :)","The only con I could think of is the percentage of payment you need to make for their medical coverage. 70% after 3 months is a huge chunk off my salary and it's kind of a big deal :\ And although it'll change once you've reached 1 year, it is still something I hope they will change."

69,Sterling,Weigh your options before taking a job here,2021-11-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The colleagues and team members are the best part of this role. They're supportive and kind, and always have your back.","There are a number of cons to working at this company. 
First and foremost, the salary. The salary is incredibly low, and not competitive in the slightest. The ‘raises’ are minuscule (if provided). If you ask for a raise, you are repeatedly denied. Most ‘promotions’ are lateral and do not include a wage increase. With the amount of work that is expected and stress placed on employees, they should be providing a much more competitive salary. 

This company relies on a revolving door strategy of employees. They put more effort into recruiting than holding onto their current employees. They also expect their current employees to take on tasks without a pay raise. Taking on the extra work becomes expected and you are questioned for denying the responsibilities without appropriate compensation. 

A large portion of management is quite toxic. I was subjected to constant undermining from a manager, even after I left that department. My decisions were questioned and dismissed when they were not presented from my manager. If this other manager was unaware that it was my idea, they would accept it, but blatantly go against precedent when they were aware the decision came from me. Managers often do not hide their favourites, and many of them do not put in the effort of further developing their team members. Managers will make you feel bad for taking a legitimate sick day, and lord it over you months after the fact. I had a manager treat me as a supervisor despite this not being my role, and criticized me for when I did meet their expectations of what ‘a supervisor should do’. 

There is a level of development that you cap out on here. Once you hit a certain level of promotion, there really isn’t anywhere else to further develop unless one of the more senior employees leave. 

The expectations placed on employees are unrealistical. Employees are expected to hit absurd productivity goals and quality goals (even to just ‘graduate’ from training and move into the department) that continually increase throughout your time with sterling. They have been increased every year, and is causing immense stress for employees."

-the office culture is friendly and casual","-extremely high stress levels
-higher and higher expectations put on the employees with no possible way to be met in a regular work-week (over-time, while paid, is almost mandatory)
-too few French-speaking employees so the bilingual employees are overworked and forced to perform tasks outside of their job description/ to manage clients outside of their own portfolios

No promise of large raises or bonuses to offset the two years of nothing even as business is booming from Josh or management. You know we will only get a measly 2% raise next year at best since Josh seemed to forget about the ones who make his company thrive and succeed.

The company offers adequate training, benefits, amenities and a people-oriented culture. They are welcoming to young people seeking entry level employment and even though the industry of background screening is somewhat of a niche, there is potential for career advancement and transferable skills to other industries. If you enjoy predictable, routine work, you will feel at ease. The company is also transparent and adaptive to new challenges, especially with COVID-19 remote work as of recent.","Repetitive, predictable, routine work is a pro, but it's also a con. It depends what type of person you are and what you seek out of your career. As already mentioned, even though a career can be developed, I have this fear that the background screening industry is too niche and ""dead-end"" but I have yet to see.

Are you talent-free and devoid of any vision? Ideal for Sterling’s leadership team. 
Particularly if you don’t really have much experience in the specific discipline. 
Favoritism? Alive and well at Sterling.

If you have ideas, and want to make meaningful contributions and actually drive demand and revenues in a company that has a good reputation and at which you’ll be proud to work? Look elsewhere.

Sterling loves to create processes for processes sake. They don’t care if the process stifles or kills revenue generation. It’s a process and they love ‘em, and live by ‘em. 

Check out Sterling’s reviews on Trustpilot. Awful. 
Tech and service is awful. Every day a new disaster, another fire drill. 

Don’t buy leaderships’ fake empathy either. It’s an act. When the chips are down, they’ll throw you under the bus to save themselves. 

And diversity? Ha. Good luck finding a person of color in senior management. 70% white male, 30% white female. Black or brown? Nope."

Work can be very siloed. Not great communication between teams on processes and outstanding projects. Seems like a lot of people just put their heads down and get their work done. Not the worst thing in the world if that's what you're looking for but not very exciting.

It's in background screening so not a ton of excitement there. Can be an interesting space to work in but not exactly the most energizing field. 

Depends on what department you're in, but career development seems a little lacking. No set trajectory or development plan other than corporatey quarterly reviews.

405,Sterling,Good Company,2019-09-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Its a very good company.,No Cons for this company.
406,Sterling,I must say I regret working here.,2019-08-28,1.0,Verification Specialist,"Compensation and benefits provided to the employees are overwhelming throughout the end. The management never fails to supply a great deal of monetary and non-monetary benefits to motivate the employees, such as shuttle services, monthly HR activities, fixed monthly allowances and night differential, and paid overtimes. in addition, the sanitary staffs ensure to maintain a clean environment. Another positive factor is that even if the process for verifying one's employment is slightly complicated and technical, it is easily done and straightforward once trained. Also, most of the employees are companionable.","I call it a mind-numbing, tedious job. 
Even if the employees encounter several applicants' employment circumstances and write different short verification reports, the tasks are very monotonous overall. You sit in your station and face two huge monitors, yet you do the exact same process every minute, every hour, every day. 

Strict adherence to rules.
Employees are permitted to limited breaks during their 8 working hours; they are only allowed 15-minute break before lunchtime, 30-minute lunch break, and 15-minute break before dismissal. The management, especially the respective leaders per team, are rigorous in following this rule, which is why every break are monitored and recorded. Also, in an employee perspective, these breaks are advisable to use in a very minimal manner to prevent unpaid overtimes. In addition, an employee must alert his or her seniors whenever they will come to work late or take an absence for the day.  However, employees will receive tardiness points for being late regardless whether the team leader is informed or not.

Apathetic about employees' mental and physical health.
The company implements a rule to submit a medical certificate or any document that represents one's valid reason for absence/s with a date of the said leave. However, stern team leaders will only accept medical certificate as a valid document and consider other medical documents, such as doctor’s prescription, as an invalid evidence.  Also, they are inconsiderate and unconcerned of the employees’ health as they will not ask them whether they are already healed from their rest. They will immediately ask for the medical certificate once you return to the office, and employees should not expect their team leaders to ask their health conditions for a polite manner. On the other hand, there are still concerned team leaders in the company that ensures their team members’ mental and physical well-being. In addition, team leaders or managers do not easily authorize their employees for absence/s, whether medical check-up or post-surgery rest. They will permit one’s sick leave on the day itself, but they are tasked to work for a double shift/16-working hours to compensate their sick leave regardless of the employee’s situation.

Team leaders' ignorance to the law
This is not an excuse. I've had an issue before my last day of employment. I passed my resignation notice with a rendering service of more than 30 days. However, I was asked again to submit yet another letter as the former one was kept because I was mentioned to be uncertain of my decision. This was notified in the middle of my service, and I was informed that my resignation will be put on hold due to this. On the other hand, after couple of meetings with my senior, the effective date on the initial notice is followed.  Additionally, it is uncertain whether the team and process leaders are unaware of the labor code or ignore them and chose to abuse the employees' ignorance of their rights. For instance, this team leader threatened his/her employee that his or her last day of employment will be extended if he or she does not cancel the scheduled vacation leave regardless of the days rendered. Also, some of the process and team leaders bully their employees verbally or physically; sometimes their reason for such behavior is for the employees to take their commands and coaching seriously or for their power and authority. The unfortunate part is even if such hideous actions must be reported to the HR personnel in charge of employee relations, sterling employees feel frightened to disclose this situation as they might be intimated by their seniors or be given a hard time in the future. Also, most of the times, the company employees are unaware that such circumstances should be addressed to ensure their rights. As a result, some team and process leaders will continue to bully their employees as a mere act of ignorance to their rights."

Corporate Strategy- At least, I didn't see it during my stint. Recent Verticalization/GM structure is a good move. How it evolves in a longer term remains to be seen. Current top management is known for hiring and firing people. It's not easy for them to get the best talent from outside as the DNA of the company is about technical/functional superiority and not about leadership or vision. So top management generally gets either their friends or acquaintances to join their teams. There is a constant churn in the company all the time. Only some chosen ones are able to operate with impunity owing to their allegiance to top management. Overall culture is toxic and compartmentalized."

- Good start for a professional career
- Great work environment
- Flexible
- Many days of vacation and gym refund","- Low pay as compared to other employers with the same job description.
- Since the acquisition of the company by the US, there are new rules or procedures literally every week. We're treated more like numbers than professionals.
- Because of shortage of employees as compared to work demand, an employee is working like 2-3 people plus doing 2-3 position at the same time. This means that there is little chance you can finish your work in your usual shift. You will need to stay overtime to finish the work, or you'll have accumulated work the next day. By overtime, I mean lots of extra hours. 
- A lot of small things can be changed in the system and internally which can make our work easier but management is very slow to respond or change. I don't know at which management level those problems are stuck but there seems to be a big lack of management somewhere in the chain.
- Supervisors are overwhelmed themselves and even though we should turn to them when we need help, they are either very busy or not here at all. We end up helping each others between colleagues and it makes us finish our work even later. 
- High turnover because of this.
- Some people at the managerial level would fight for you, others would opt to follow procedures rigidly. 
I am giving a 3/5 now but before the acquisition and all those changes I would have given 4.5/5 as it was a comfortable environment to work in. Unfortunate."

5. No professional person like to work here. Only bunch of duffer and 12 pass people stay here because they know they don't get job outside sterling. This is the reason they are able to deliver counts not quality. And Quality do not come with Unrealistic Numbers of target.

505,Sterling,Sterling New York City Office,2018-02-26,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The biggest pro any current or former Sterling employee can agree on is the culture. The employees are young, vibrant, full of life and brilliance, kind and caring, many are willing to step out of their way just to make sure you're doing well. That ""pro"" alone is what keeps a majority of their workers there. Even though the work may get stressful at times, for the most part, Sterling is a pretty relaxed environment. As long as you do your job well and stay late after showing up late, management really wont hound you too much. At the C- Level, they're generally down to earth. The CEO is a woman which is great for diversity, but she is also very kind, humble and down to earth... easily approachable. The sales team is fantastic. You would think a company like this would have a high turnover rate within the sales team, they most certainly do not. They have a fantastic team leader that used to be the head of HR... not only is he down to earth, but he cares about the well-being of his team. The recruiting team is amazing","High turnover rate, often times as fast as you see people come in, they're leaving as if they're walking in circles within a revolving door. Often times their pay rate doesn't match the position title, unless you're a chief, svp, avp etc. The directors get paid well, but not as much as you would nearly expect from a company that's a few steps away from the Charging Bull. Also, many of the Account Managers get spanked for things out of their control, whether it is trying to keep a client happy, when the service Sterling is providing specifically to that client is lower than poor, or inheriting a new account when the damage to the client has already been severe. Most times the AM's will get blamed for the client's departure, when Sterling should be blaming themselves. Sterling also needs to do more for their new-hires. The HR leadership needs to do more tackling the occasional hostile work environment. Often times problems will occur with people that work with the highest chiefs in the company, and it seems HR is scared of them as well as the average employee, which defeats the purpose of having HR. Don't get me wrong, the HR team is great, but the way Sterling is set up, HR going against someone powerful could result in their own job loss. Also, their pay raise rate is pretty low. Don't expect a significant annual raise unless you move up in rank, if that's even possible. A/P dept needs to iron out a few wrinkles."

The company  moves fast and thereby you gain many experiences.,Leadership is not about people and professional development.

In my experience, the people are GREAT and the leadership truly care about you and the success of the company.  One caveat I will give is, just like any reputable career, you will get out what you put in.  I have found success at Sterling because I was willing to work hard and seek opportunities.

Care more about M&A than focusing on doing well with the products and services they currently have. 

Success is more based on how well you're liked and little about talent.

Having thought that I would be with the company for years, I was let go completely by surprise only to be told it was ""the best decision for the marketing department strategically"". Not being able to budget/forecast a new hire past a few months is a red flag. I remember applying and saw many reviews not leaving confidence and I wish I had taken a job elsewhere to prevent being in the position of job searching again. This was my first job accepted after graduating college & it was a very disheartening entry into my career. It has robbed me of other reliable jobs offered to me before I started. Giving this negative review is saddening as I loved my job and coworkers but the impact this has had on me is worth sharing to other new marketing professionals looking to grow with a company. The Marketing department is not at a solid state and I would recommend looking for employment at a company where you can have more confidence you are being hired to stay and grow."

A monkey could run their sales team better than the last guy who they just fired  i.e., the Chief Sales Officer which was the first good decision this firm has made in years.  The guy lied to our face and was a classic snake oil salesman.  I was shocked to be in meetings with him as he gleefully bragged about lying to prospects/clients.  As a legacy TalentWise employee it was also shocking at how inefficient Sterling is.  As a sales person it feels like they don't want you to sell.  It took TWO DAYS in many cases to get a quote approved.  Working at Sterling is like working at the largest most inefficient government bureaucracy.  There is no autonomy.  They do not trust their people. The is an amazing amount of micro-managing.  I mean the COO post-merger with TalentWise had no autonomy, it's no wonder he left to run another company.  There is a TON of red tape, bureaucracy and it's very hard to get things done if you don't personally know someone.  Things move at a glacier pace. It is infuriating. There is way too much ""that's not my job"" said by folks at Sterling.    I could go on, but I think you get the point."

It does not matter if you are new or a tenured, if you need assistance with anything you unfortunately, won't get it at this company.  Everyone learns out of survival and often times when you reach out for help, your communication will go unanswered for days and weeks until consistent  reminders go out.

551,Sterling,Amazing Experience,2017-06-14,5.0,Recruiter,The culture has changed drastically. There's a true team environment there and you get a lot of support. You also get a lot of autonomy which is something not to take for granted.,Maybe just increase salaries to make them more competitive but that's about it
552,Sterling,Not Worth the Trouble,2017-06-12,2.0,Verifications Specialist,"Brilliant team, the people in the office are amazing. Mostly. Some people you'll get to know quite well, but others you won't. They have pretty decent monitors and computer equipment too. Shame they don't actually work pretty well.","No future prospects, nowhere to go. If you want a career where you feel like there is somewhere to progress to, Sterling is not the place for you. There's also very little praise in the office, unless you are one of the special few, where you'll get praised every day for every little thing you do."

You can be fired even for farting, and sometimes just like that."

560,Sterling,Uncomfortable Change,2017-04-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Got to keep my territory for the most part,Not a fit culturally - low base salary
561,Sterling,Worst management ever,2017-04-08,2.0,Client Services Executive,"The Company on the whole is good. But there are many departments which take you for a ride.
Client servicing dept. is good. 
Good work culture (employees are very helpful)","Leave policy is worst.
No work life balance, lot of work stress.
Not good paymasters. way too underpaid according to market standards. 
Infact they dig reasons to cut salary based upon stupid/not so critical errors.
The systems are not good, Team leaders are not helpful at all, just learn and run the show, and if you stumble , there's no one to acknowledge, people bully alot. 
Worst management of OHS department because I have been a part of it. Now got myself shifted to CS. OHS has no scope of growth and has many loopholes within it's own sub-processes. 
Management is not interested in the employees performance and growth, lot of politics. OHS is on the verge of extinction. 
Cherry on the cake : water filters are very less, unclean facilities, they don't even have a single coffee machine in  any of their premises, not even canteen (Cost cutting in the true sense )"
562,Sterling,Not the best place for career growth.,2017-04-03,3.0,Team Lead,"-easy work with the salary

563,Sterling,Not paid enough,2017-03-19,3.0,Verification Specialist,6.33 hours of PTO each pay period; Usually gets requested time off.,On Overtime alot. Pay isn't good especially for how much work you do.  No Work/Life Balance
564,Sterling,"JUST ""OKAY""",2017-03-17,2.0,Verification Specialist,"They offer good benefits, incentives, and HMO will be available after 3 months. Fast promotion.","I, as a VERIFICATIONS SPECIALIST, experienced the changes in our process. You know im okay with a ""change"" but it must be properly communicated to everyone. QAs, TLs, as well as the Operations Manager has no proper alignment with the process. We had CAP (Corrective Action Plan) wherein there are certain parameters that when you commit, you'll be in CAP's list. THE WORST THING is that, they error you but the error they tagged on you is not communicated with everyone. It's like when you had this error, later on everyone will know that it is an ""error"". Cool right? Forced overtime every Mass hiring."
565,Sterling,ABSOLUTE WORST-STAY CLEAR,2017-03-14,1.0,Sales Associate,Conversation topic with friends an Family,"Poor Management, Poor Morale, WORST SERVICE"

567,Sterling,Review,2017-02-17,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"youth based environment, most of the employees were 20' somethings, attempts at getting departments to go out as group, CEO had good energy","At that time there was no room for growth, poorly trained managers, senior management lack diversity, whole departments were outsourced to India after training the employees in Mumbai"
568,Sterling,Downward Spiral,2017-01-18,3.0,Customer Service Representative,"Great co-workers, short commute (for me anyway), nature trails to walk (if you ever have time) and free soda (double edge sword though as sedentary work and soda just make you fat)","Post Merger the culture has really taken a nose dive. People don't smile anymore and look exhausted as management piles more on mid level managers' plates. Feels way more corporate and less small business.  Number vs. person.  Most people I know working there are looking for better options now the it's the new year and companies seem to be hiring again. 

The communication is very poor.  There is no real support from management.  There does not appear to be much of a career path or growth opportunity.  There are not any central policies or procedures written down anywhere, just fractured ""tribal knowledge"" and needless gate keeping. If you do not do well with uncertainty and guess work, this might not be a great fit for you."
569,Sterling,Account Executive,2017-01-18,1.0,,No pros....this is a horrible place to work!! It's a huge scam & I felt like it was a cult in the sales department!!,"Training was horrible, back-stabbing management, & they play favorites with people...I would stay late every day & you didn't feel appreciated at all!! When you ask for help from other departments they would blow you off & ignore emails! I had to put read receipts on my internal emails!!"
570,Sterling,Culture,2017-01-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Job security is a plus because the job is so bad that Sterling will do everything they can to keep the people willing to stay.,"Unfortunately, while retention is a perk, the culture is miserable.  Executive leadership often has no idea what is going on in the real end of the business and spends a lot of time celebrating successes that are irrelevant to overall customer happiness and therefore, employee happiness."
571,Sterling,"Growing Organization in Transition, But Really Trying to Get it Right",2017-01-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Personally, the organization has treated me like gold since I was hired. They are open to fresh ideas, new ways of doing things and empowering people to make decisions that lead to successful business results. Our people are our greatest asset. Sorry, that sound corporate, but I really love the people I get to work with. They are smart, collaborative and engaged.","Sterling has been engaged in an aggressive M&A strategy which is not a negative. However, the resulting transition is never pretty and Sterling is no different. The organization is in flux, but it is determined to get things right. I think this transition is harder on legacy employees that have been with the organization for a while as opposed to newcomers like me."
572,Sterling,Sterling Talent Solutions,2017-01-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Team relationships, flexibility, decent benefits.","Management structure, lack of support, no growth opportunities."
573,Sterling,Great opportunities,2016-12-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"As I read through the reviews posted thus far, it strikes me that the reviewers are primarily disgruntled and not providing a balanced view of the company.  I have found Sterling Talent Solutions to be a dynamic, exciting, growing company with a compelling, must-have product/service for businesses around the world.  Sterling has over 40 years of experience to draw from, but it's also self-aware enough to understand the need for evolution and change.  The TalentWise merger was strategic and important for the company and customers are already seeing the benefits.  There were some challenges with the merger, as can be expected.  But again, I've seen Sterling acknowledge and learn from past experiences in order to improve future outcomes - this is key to my support for this company.  The executive team is smart, reasonable, approachable and open to feedback.  I'm also impressed with the fiscal responsibility and approach.  I would much rather work for a company that puts priority on profitability, while at the same time trying to achieve the difficult balance between this and investment for the business to grow.  From a career perspective, because of the changes the company is strategically making for growth, there are numerous opportunities for someone to come in and have immediate, satisfying impact.  In addition, with multiple US domestic offices and geographies and the growing international presence, there's plenty of opportunity for cross-functional working experiences that many companies can't offer.  The company is focused on developing and growing a culture and employment brand that its employees are proud of, and there is significant work and review to ensure that it the practices, benefits offerings, and company behaviors are in line with this vision.  It doesn't get everything right every single time, but I've never experienced a company that does.  The size of the company is such that the typical corporate politics that I've experienced at other companies is at a manageable level that doesn't drown out the ability to get work done.  I've worked at many companies in my career, and I have found Sterling to be one of the most interesting, dynamic and I'm happy to be here.  There is much work to be done, but the key for me is feeling like it's work that can be accomplished.  I have worked places where I do nothing but fight battles and end up in frustrating cycles of mediocre delivery, and that has not been my experience at Sterling.  I'm looking forward to seeing where this company goes in the next 3-5 years and beyond.","I feel very good about working at Sterling and there are not any pressing Cons from my point of view.  As the company grows and considers more acquisitions, it will need to continue to learn from prior experiences (as it has already) done to minimize disruption and optimize the efficiency and outcomes of these transactions."
574,Sterling,New hire after merger and restructure,2016-12-04,4.0,,Extremely thorough interviewing process; I was left with a very strong sense that I was a great fit and the organization and team I spoke with was very excited to work with me.,"Job description and immediate responsibilities not precisely communicated. More of a question mark than a ""con"" but definitely a consideration."
575,Sterling,Great place to work,2016-11-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Lots of opportunity and growth. Very fast pace,Sink or swim environment. Must be an entrepreneur at heart to truly be successful.
576,Sterling,Growth by Acquisition,2016-11-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you're looking to gain experience putting out customer fires, this is the place to do it. Sterling's customer-facing employees are professional apologizers. Be it their faulty tech, lack of regard for accuracy/quality, or balking at the idea of complying with federal regulations, you'll find that Sterling provides limitless opportunity to sharpen your face-saving skills with customers.","Constant system outages, terrible customer experience for all but the largest clients. Leadership routinely reminds employees
that their primary goal is to become a billion dollar company by 2019. Unfortunately, secondary goals like product refinement, tech innovation, and customer service end up falling far behind growth. The company is growing fast, mostly due to acquisition under the guidance of new owners Goldman Sachs. The general consensus among employees is that Goldman is looking to grow rapidly in order to sell or go public."
577,Sterling,Sterling Review,2016-10-13,5.0,,My team is great to work with. Tons of knowledge on the team as most have been there for more than 5 years. The vertical structure and alignment of companies by industry is perfect as everyone in a POD comes from that industry and share that knowledge amongst their team and clients.,No real training plan outlined for new employees.
578,Sterling,Do Not Work Here,2016-10-12,1.0,Account Manager,"I came in via an acquisition. Sterling Backcheck or Talent Solutions or whatever they'll go by in 6 months has no pros to speak of. My colleagues were pretty great, that said.","Pay is not great. Mid-level Leadership is not supportive. Senior leadership does not care. Growth through acquisition. Backend delivery systems are terrible -- my clients suffered a HUGE drop in service level after we were acquired. Basically, everyone on my team (and almost all key players in product, dev, engineering, sales, and account management) left the company within 6 months of the acquisition."
579,Sterling,OK for now,2016-09-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"7.5 hours of work, non-stressful work","HR people are very dismal, not very supportive for tenured employees"

582,Sterling,Happy to be a part,2016-08-27,4.0,OHS Specialist,"people are  welcoming, lenient atmosphere, no work pressure, built for female employees who can manage home and job simultaneously with less difficulty, management is awesome especially OHS.","laid back attitude, potential of growth is minimal, slow salary growth"
583,Sterling,Glass door name change?  What a scam!!!,2016-08-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Never were any but coworkers.  And when coworkers have to commiserate to make it through each day that's a sign of terrible leadership and culture.,"Don't take my short critique to be a quick shot of unbalanced negativity. More robust reviews are under the ""former"" name SterlingBackcheck.""  Who, by the way used to go by sterling info systems. Who used to go by Sterling Testing. Maybe this time it's running from bad GD reviews???  Anyway, read those other pages. Very enlightening. And isn't it interesting that former page says ""now listed as Sterling Talent"" but when you go on the new page it dues br say ""formerly SterlingBackcheck?"""
584,Sterling,Account Executive,2016-08-16,3.0,Account Executive,Great way to build B2B experience with 40 hour work weeks. Very generous on PTO and benefits for first year employees.,Lack of job security due to acquiring and merging with several businesses. No consistent company culture. Training is not very thorough on compliance and regulatory laws.
585,Sterling,Verifications Specialist/Human Resources Interviewer,2016-07-29,4.0,,"Had been with the organization for almost 1.5 year and the Team Leads and Managers in verification department are awesome - very considerate, supportive, rational in making your life in the client-focused work setting satisfying. Great benefits (100% contributions by company on dental/health insurance after 1 yr, 3 week vacation, education reimbursements, lots of free food and some more).","Though it's a great start to your career, the role becomes repetitive couple months after training. Being in front of two screens performing background checks and screening resumes/other forms is not something I would want to do in the long-term. Pay is mediocre."
586,Sterling,Company doomed for failure,2016-07-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Funny to watch chaos, easy to get a director title. Lots of money available to send employees on trips to other offices",No communication between orgs. Executives not on the same page. Projects fall behind and people forget.

587,Sterling,Was ok before the merger,2016-06-26,2.0,Research Specialist,Laid back environment. One hour paid lunch. Job pretty easy. Ceo used to provide occasional perks like ice cream truck visits in the summer.,Beofre the merger there was little romantic for advancement. After the merger with giant multi-national company the small company feel was obliterated and they incurred a massive reduction in force. New parent company seems cold and distant with little regard for quality of the service/product provided. Parent handled merger with misinformation and double talk. Outsourcing operations.
588,Sterling,"TalentWise is no more, it's now the Sterling machine",2016-06-22,2.0,,"Before the merger I would have recommended anyone to come and work for TalentWise.  It was a great company with great, hard working people that were dedicated to making a great product.  Compensation was mediocre but culture and organizational class made up for that.",After the merger TalentWise has been bleeding talent and most of the great teammates and fellow employees that made TalentWise a great place to work are now gone.  There is no more culture and for those of us that were lucky enough to not be let go during the merger the feeling is that we will eventually be replaced by offshore workers in the Sterling regime.
589,Sterling,Love it here and you will too!,2016-06-22,5.0,,"Flexibility, passion, creativity is celebrated and encouraged. 

I had to comment when I read the review about our CHRO. She is wonderful!!!! She has completely turned HR around. She is a smart and dedicated business woman who gets things done. Failed initiatives under the old head of HR are actually happening now! I know for a fact that she cares immensely about us, our careers, and our success.","Very fast paced and in constant change. This place is a game changer for any career. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. You will be challenged in ways you never imagined and you will be stronger and better because of those challenges."
