0,Stripe,Feels Communist,2022-04-08,2.0,Account Executive,"-Great product diversity
-Interesting users working on important challenges
-Lots of things to work on and build when a company is growing this fast
-Good benefits","-Almost everyone is rated equally regardless of performance. Top performers are not rewarded. Under the new AVG equity system, the recruiters say that top performers get more equity during your interview. But the truth is, almost nobody is recognized as a top performer. Even when you go above and beyond to excel at your job and do way more than what is asked in your official role, you get an average rating and are told you can't get an above average rating during your first performance review at Stripe. What?
-The company values are user first, Stripe second, team third. Employees are last and Stripe makes it clear and known that everyone is replaceable and everyone is the same. If you don't like it, leave and we will find someone else to take your spot. Except the hiring bar has lowered given the overhiring going on right now. I worry about how many people are being hired and not given enough training or support. They are being set up to fail.
-Never question the party line. If you dare to have an opinion that differs with leadership, you will be chastised for speaking your mind. There is a culture where you are only allowed to talk about how great Stripe is all the time. Which is ironic given one of our values is ""we haven't won yet"" but our middle managers act like we have won all the time
-When you question why a decision is made, senior leaders will tell you you should be ""grateful you work at Stripe"". But when a third of your team quits in a 3 month period, they don't seem all that grateful do they?
-Sales comp is broken. They lure you in with the high OTE, except they don't tell you about a 2 year ramp curve where it is impossible to meaningfully earn above OTE. By the time you exit ramp, your targets are not achievable by anyone (even top sellers) so you won't even be making your OTE at that point
-We have a lack of leadership in the sales org. Managers are in over their head and it shows by the overwhelmingly negative Stripe Sats every quarter (which are ignored) and the significant talent exodus we have seen over the last 6 months. We could copy and paste our internal reviews every 3 months because problems remain unaddressed for years. At a certain point when you don't listen to your people, top performers will leave rather than wait years for you to fix major issues
-We are ""user first"", but aside from sales, most of the company does not talk to users. When the sales team provides user feedback to cross-functional teams, it is either ignored or dismissed. Even when users provide feedback directly to Stripe, they are tossed between 8 different teams and the issues remain unsolved so users churn"

Employees burning out, a work life balance that is fading away. Work related Slack messages being sent at very late hours. Employees mentioning their fear of burning out to managers, and managers constantly replying by saying to 'toughen up'. There is a clear culture shift happening within the company.

- Process process process. There's a process change every few weeks, with added layers of admin and rules. We need this in some capacity but it feels overwhelming and makes the job feel pretty mundane and transactional."

- A special equity bonus program was rolled out to the whole company except sales people. Why? We just heard it's ""too complicated"" to set this up for sales people who are on variable commissions. 
- You don't get paid on new products you sell. Stripe launches new products all the time. Even though you're expected to learn, promote, and sell these products, you won't get paid until the comp team gets around to figuring this out which could take 6 months or longer.
- Very little support offered to closers. AEs are expected to do a lot of their own prospecting. The outbound org is still very undeveloped. 
- Same goes for post-signed support. No clean breaks. Even if you attach a support package to your deal, you'll find yourself continuing to work with that company well after you close the deal.
- You spend less time selling and more time working in tickets given the complexity of deals at Stripe.
- Really bad sales incentives compared to other high growth sales organizations. Lengthy commission cycles that lack transparency, little to no spiffs (the few I've seen are paltry), although we did just get accelerators! Hell will freeze over before Stripe offers a Prez Club. The equity bonus program mentioned above was the biggest slap in the face."

Senior leaders are always willing to help with deals, the product is fantastic and the culture is top notch.

- Incredible company growth especially in the UK & EMEA
- Some of the brightest people I've worked with as colleagues 
- Great culture- collaborative, fair, very open, everyone is willing to lend a hand to help 
- Great product and view from clients in the market","- Although this has improved greatly over the past 6 months, one challenge we're faced with is sales support resources. For example, we've hired a lot of field reps over the past 12 months but have not kept up with the appropriate legal, deal desk, etc teams. These teams are now growing but this has presented some bandwidth constraints over time. 
- Payments and Fintech is complex, Stripe does a good job with enablement but you only learn so much from training. You have to be willing to ask for help and be okay being uncomfortable for a number of months here. It is not as easy as learning a SaaS product it takes a lot of time to ramp. 
- Decent amount of change this past year, again not a horrible thing and I'd argue a lot of the changes that were made (territory, comp, etc) are for the better it I just a lot to go through in a year."

55,Stripe,"Great product, not a great place to work",2021-11-24,2.0,Program Manager Operations,"Great products, rapid growth, good benefits, good colleagues (depending on department).","Work life balance is atrocious, understaffing is a core operating principle (ruthlessly prioritize, efficiency as leverage) which doesn't jive with the companies intent to put users first.

Strategic objectives and roles & responsibilities in the operations functions are not clearly defined which leads to a significant amount of aggravation across the function, with supporting functions often left to do all the things or be subjected to an escalation and scapegoating.

Internal mobility is non-existent in operations, favouritism rather than who is best qualified for a position is the norm. Diversity across the organization is lacking. People operations are not effective and are also most likely suffering dysfunction from the challenges that arise from being understaffed.

Stripe is probably a good place for a young, smart professional who has little work experience and is eager to make progression in their career and work every hour of the day, that said, avoid working at Stripe if you are an experienced operations professional who has worked in functionally mature operations, this is not the place for you."

-Very smart people at this company.
-If you are lucky to join a team that is not comprised of job hoppers, you will probably be trauma bonded and become great friends after you are either managed out or quit out of misery.","If you are a prospective candidate, I do urge you to look at the tenure of people writing these glowing reviews. I notice that a majority of them are people who have been at Stripe less than 1-2 years. What inspires someone to leave a review in less than a year? Are managers encouraging them? I don’t quite know. 

There are bad reviews warning you of burn out and toxic managers from people— mostly people with longer tenures. You can believe those people. A lot of people that started years ago started when it WAS a great place to work. And then they saw it go downhill. I was there >7 years, and can assure you that it indeed went downhill since I first spun up.

Cons:
-BURN. OUT. You will burn out, be sure of that.
-You will be asked to essentially perform the work of multiple people.
-When a higher stakes project takes precedence and you must focus on it and step back from a smaller project to do so, you will be penalized for not doing enough on the smaller project.
-Goalposts are often moved by management.
-You will probably be told one thing in a meeting and another thing in writing by you manager— they are taking screenshots to refer to at perf review.
-Perf review and ladders and levels are purposefully ambiguous and seem to be designed to prevent people from leveling up or being successful.
-Managing people out seems to be de rigueur.
-Teams are very understaffed; I could not tell you the reason but seeing it echoed across other reviews here I suppose it is indeed by design.
-At this point do I even need to tell you there’s no work life balance? Well, there is none."
62,Stripe,"Choose between burnout, sacrificing morals, or being managed out",2021-11-03,1.0,Software Engineer,"Compensation and equity growth is top tier.
Excellent external brand.","- Don't listen to anything management tells you about values like being a team player. You'll be penalized for delaying your low priority project to help the team hit it's overall goals.
- Don't listen to anything management promises you about the future. Even if you somehow lucked out to have an honest manager, the company reorgs so frequently that your manager is unlikely to have the agency to deliver. I've already had 5+ manager changes in the past year. Absolutely ridiculous.
- Learn to excel at the blame game. If a project is not going to plan (which is almost a given because managers new and unfamiliar with the project are setting arbitrary timelines), learn how to either escape the project or pin the blame on someone else. Refusal to play the blame game out of morals just means that you'll be the one penalized.
- Work smart by finding projects that sound infinitely harder than they actually are and sell sell sell aka promotion driven development. You might feel dirty about it, but one look at the codebase will make it so clear how the rest of the company is playing the same game.
- Technical excellence is not valued at the company. Every project I've ever had has included fixing bugs in code owned by other teams. The only success metric is whether you completed on time so of course corners get cut left and right when push comes to shove. I'm absolutely floored that our users haven't noticed the data inconsistencies rampant in our designs.
- Engineer performance is tied to throughput of one pagers so engineers spend roughly 95% of their time writing in Dropbox Paper and maybe 5% actually coding. A side effect of this one pager throughput incentive is that it's pretty much an open secret at Stripe that quantity is far more important than quality so everybody writes papers that they expect no one to read just to look like a thought leader. I've learned the hard way that documentation left behind by others is mostly useless for this reason.
- Company is ramping up hiring and penalizes you for not doing interviews so get ready to do interviews 3x a week where you dread ""questions for me"" that make you feel like a liar.
- Be ready to pick up unreasonable workload because every team is understaffed. For example, the number of people on my team is so low that two unlucky people had to take multiple OnCall shifts during the winter break because we already went through everybody once.
- Be ready to work an insane amount to meet expectations. I've had to cancel vacations and work while really really sick to hit deadlines.
- Be very good at teaching yourself everything you need on the job because a huge chunk of the tribal knowledge has left the company for all the above reasons and then some. I've never seen a company with such a hot equity trajectory burn out employees this quickly. Almost everyone I work with has been at the company for less than two years and all of the departures I worked with left before their initial equity grants fully vested which is insane because they gave up millions."

-Business is thriving with solid product and reputation

-Awesome transparency and documentation","-You are expected to work until the bone, weekends work and nighttime calls are expected, definitely not a place to work if you want to have a work-life balance and you have a family, especially for Singapore. High tendency to burn out.
-The processes are broken and always changing, since this role is developing, you are expected to wear A LOT of hats and to deliver A LOT of things in a short period of time, without a clear definition of who does what. It is a startup culture in enterprise organisation scale hence expect chaos.
-Underinvested and limited career opportunities/development especially for a non-developer or technical role. 
-The reason people stay is because of RSU. Many people will join here to get the jump in salary and branding in CV for their next opportunity."

- The founders are energetic and friendly. Their aura attracted smart and kind folks at the early stage

- Hopefully a big payout from the IPO

- Food was delicious and healthy at the same time. Hmm those mixed grill Mondays and Taco Tuesdays","Dark triad became prominent as time goes by. 

- In addition to the common narcissism in tech, machiavellianism is a bigger problem in this company IMO. The over-index on ""empathy"" at hiring brought in people who are good at manipulation (for their personal gain, not to encourage productivity), as emotional intelligence required for empathy is correlated to emotional manipulation.

- The accountability culture (or in the worst interpretation the ""blaming"" culture) selects the most self-serving and morally corrupt managers to survive. They do so by cultivating stories that it's all for the benefit of the team or the company, but if you observe what they really do, they operate with the ""me first, second and third"" principle. 

- The long window of pre-IPO hype attracted toxic people in, introduced a backstabbing scene and made the environment cutthroat. Envy at workplace is not an often talked about topic, but it was brought in by the hiring spree and became increasingly toxic."

Management sucks so hard. They're all about packaging to look good than doing good.

The culture isn't bad, there is no culture. It's hard to get jazzed about moving money around. This place is more AMZN than FB/GOOG with lowwww margins. Acquiring is a race to the bottom, and until we find our version of a AWS cash cow, we're far from the hype."

- Colleagues are almost always professional, kind and working very hard;
- The potential to work on very hard / cutting edge problems is there","- Stripe is structurally exploitative to its own employees, by understaffing teams across the board by design. This leads to extreme goals and workload in almost all teams I worked with. It also kills any genuine risk taking or innovation, as folks are regularly stretched way beyond whats somewhat reasonable, in order to keep the lights on or meet basic job expectations. Don't expect to pick up new skills here, but rather do what you already can do at 200%;

- Everything moves so quickly, that it's very hard to get more substantial projects off the ground. Enormous technical and policy debt, as problems that require long term work are often started and almost as quickly dropped, as they don't align with aggressive calibration cycles. There is hence little incentive given to employees to question direction,  creating a sort of echo chamber effect."
100,Stripe,Great for self starters,2021-07-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Stripe is a great place to work if you want to be challenged and give 110% every day.,The flipside of being challenged is that it can be hard to switch off.

104,Stripe,"Overworked, No Team Support or Sense of Belonging",2021-07-01,1.0,Senior Recruiter,"Stripe will probably do very well in their public offering
Onboarding is well organized
Good documentation (but often very overwhelming)","No true sense of culture. Most of the people they're hiring now are likely joining mainly because they want a big pay out in the first year. Yes Stripe pays very well but that's because they're losing really good people who actually care about other people and have a sense of empathy. 
Their new comp structure and AVG (annual value grant) means that you will only get the most of out your comp in the first year BUT also means that it's going to be very competitive when it comes to performance. You have to basically dedicate your entire life to work in order to get a good performance rating. They try to sell this as ""we pay for performance and reward good work."" True, but that means you will have NO work life balance. 

No work life balance means that teammates don't support each other at all and it's very competitive. There's a TON of processes and hoops to jump through and many layers of people to get through in order to get anything done. It was really tough to see how one could make any significant impact, unless you'd already been there for 3+ years. 
Managers are overworked too so you really don't get much support from them either. 
Be prepared to be very isolated and work a ton if you want to join Stripe... For me, no amount of money in the world was worth that. 

Stripe is too much of a big machine now."

Most of the big projects I've been on so far have been fun to work on. There are also a lot of talented, kind, and helpful engineers at Stripe who are really nice to learn from. I really enjoy my manager and the folks on my team. The money + bonuses are ~ok~. Pretty standard for a pre-IPO unicorn, but the goal is that there will be a big pay off later (fingers crossed).","- The work life balance is *bad*. For how many products Stripe has, we are a very lean company. Too lean. There's just a lot of work, and very very tight deadlines, very fast paced, and not enough engineers and product managers to do all of it. If you want WLB as an engineer, join an infrastructure team, not a product team. 

- There is little to no investment in making the engineering org more diverse. This was surprising to me because of a lot of public facing company statements, but don't be fooled like I was. People (at least in the eng org) do not care about diversity. 

- HR sucks. And of course they would, I guess. But I had a really negative experience with HR where I walked away feeling completely devalued and gaslit.

Too many junior managers at Stripe simply given the role of managing a team without having any clue what they are supposed to do on a day to day basis. This results in ALOT of unnecessary attrition of otherwise good talent which I have personally witnessed.

- Office is beautiful and offers modest amenities and benefits","There are two primary problems with this company:
1) It is an engineering-first organization.
2) Leadership lacks the experience to understand what a scaled and mature organization should be modeled after.

There is a significant amount of pretentiousness throughout the organization, primarily driven by the promotion of the engineering-first culture.  If you are an engineer at Stripe, you may as well call it a day and never find another job because you've made it!  Congrats - now everyone can kiss your feet for the rest of your career.

Senior leadership is mostly in their late 20s and early 30s.  Plenty of years of experience to understand how to scale a business from 10-2500 right?  Wrong.  Sad to say that leadership is falling to the same trappings as those at Uber and WeWork.  Perhaps there's something about being in ""control"" of your own business that it blinds founders to their own immaturity and Napoleonic tendencies.

Stripe has a great story, absolutely - but that superficiality permutes the organization.  It's got a great shiny coat on top of everything in the organization, but the underlying character is sadly missing.

They have done a fantastic job of hiring the most intelligent and soulless individuals I've ever met."

206,Stripe,Well intentioned company with great peers and growing pains,2019-10-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been extremely impressed by Stripe since day 1 -- in how it composes itself facing difficult decisions, runs on the day-to-day, and goes above and beyond expectations on a consistent basis.

Leadership is inspirational (listen to a podcast with Patrick) yet very grounded when the going gets tough. Our company values (""operating principles"") are lived by the leaders and it does really trickle down through the reporting chain. I seldom find myself disagreeing with decisions leadership makes, and they are quite transparent about their reasoning why.

Your peers are friendly, sometimes to a fault, and I don't notice much/any unhealthy competition in the engineering org. You can assume your peers are well-intentioned and are willing to hear you out fully, in the end doing what's best for the business (or, customer). A slight downside to this -- knowing the right people to talk to is an invaluable skill that isn't scaling so well as the company grows.

The mission of the company -- grow the GDP of the internet -- is arguably pure and apolitical. There is a sense we are building core infrastructure for the world. It's nice not to feel conflicted about your work.

I've been happy that our planning process is often long-term. You can successfully argue for ideas that might not result in immediate benefits, but will pay dividends in, say, a year. This applies to paying down tech debt to new products or features. Your argument has to be well articulated, though.

Finally, as a medium sized company, there is so much work to be done and opportunity for those who are willing to go out and grab it (even if it's not always obvious). Ambition and foresight are recognized and rewarded, even if you don't necessarily have seniority or tenure.","Work-life balance can suffer depending on your ambition. Working a 9-5 is OK, but in practice a 9-6 is more common. (management generally seems to not care about hours worked, but actual productivity, which is a plus)

Internal tooling, testing, and development speed (especially outside the ""happy path"") has been a drain on productivity as the company has grown. It's invested in, but sometimes can be rough.

Stripe grew as a developers-first company, so some scaffolding and support from others orgs is missing. Engineers often have to take on extra responsibility that may seem tedious or unrelated at another company.

Growth / education / mentorship is well supported, but you sort of have to seek it out yourself."

As company has expanded the quality of some new hires in various teams has gone done significantly. Huge focus on rapid expansion as opposed to proper training or engagement from management.

Company still seems to believe it's a start up, which is used as an excuse by some incapable or inexperienced to do their roles.  As the company has expanded it has become far more of a commercial and corporate environment with a lot of cloak and dagger that is in direct contradiction of Patrick and John's firm believe in transparency. 

Honesty is not always the best policy in this company, this is not a start up anymore, it is a finance and payments company that forces a positive can-do attitude and responds to honest constructive feedback and suggestions as criticisms occasionally necessitating 'check ins' with management. 

Some teams seem more versed in delegating their work out to other teams than actually doing their duties. Little input from management., especially when respective individuals are personal friends of theirs.

Very ambiguous environment at times. It's become increasingly a game of pass the responsibility to a different team with little progress and no ownership or responsibility when things go wrong.

*Very* little work-life balance-
1. You will be expected to socialise with colleagues after work-hours. 
2. Depending on your team you will be expected to travel exhaustively and this can affect personal relationships.
3. Unspoken expectation that regardless of time differences, you will be available after hours, including weekends, to provide support to teams, regardless of your contract stipulations. A slightly punitive approach from management if you attempt to disengage from work during your spare-time, surprisingly unprofessional given the ethos of the workplace.
4. This is in no way an 8-6pm type company. Depending on your role, if want to achieve your targets and work on projects, expect a more 7am-10pm day."

- thoughtful, energetic, rigorously-thinking employee base","Stripe's culture of transparency isn't fully adapted by managers and very experienced IC's hired in to the company (as opposed to promoted from within), so we should work hard to ensure people adopt and support it. Additionally, there's a lack of clarity around internal mobility. Finally, the promotion process needs additional clarification, especially when moving long-time Stripes to management or other roles that include a promotion - this is something we should publicly celebrate.

- as the company grows there's an increasing lack of autonomy, and middle tier management are seemingly making all of the decisions without looping in the people on the ground
- there's two very different sides to the culture; for those that genuinely buy into it, it's a strong culture of sharing and trust. Others use it as a facade and decide it doesn't apply to them other than in extremely general terms. Again, those people are often in management positions, so this is starting to spread and is ending up with people climbing the ladder by slightly more nefarious means, and the 'nice' culture means that this often doesn't get called out.

Different teams tend to have cliques and be exclusive. Managers would show favoritism. So if you're good at office politics you will succeed here. Hard working and honest folks were often overlooked because people who had it ""in"" we're first in line for promotions. 

Work/Life balance really took a toll on people. Granted, Stripe is in the financial industry so there is an underlying expectation that you need to be available 24/7 and that's just the way it is there.  You NEED to put in the hours and work 10+ hour days (esp if you want to get ahead).

To some extent, I enjoyed the competitive nature of working there. However, sometimes it would get in the way of doing the core function of your job as you were expected to juggle multiple projects and be ""nimble"""

- Leadership (at all levels up/down the management chain) actually cares when it comes to diversity. They fundamentally ""get"" it, and are working hard on multiple initiatives in this area. Unconscious bias training is treated as table stakes and a starting point at most, rather than the silver bullet/checklist item that other companies seem to see it as. Recruiting also cares deeply and is closely partnered with leadership. Diversity metrics are fully available internally and regularly updated. 

- Every other person is among the best around and yet very humble. They're all clearly experienced and capable, even as they go out of their way to help you. The hiring process selects for highly capable people who are also actively warm and kind, and it shows in the daily interactions around the office.

- Tech bros clearly don't belong here. Need I say more? Well, actually, I'll say a little more. I have yet to hear ""bro"" or ""bruh"" in all my time here so far. There are no ping-pong tables or a permanent games room (though people sometimes set-up Smash or board games after work). There is alcohol, but people only drink it in the evenings, and it tends to be a classy dinner with wine.","- Ruby used to be more of a pain at this scale, recently alleviated by a lot of internal tooling that's been brought to bear.

264,Stripe,Sales - Accurate version,2017-03-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I felt compelled to write this after reading the other ""sales"" review on here...

1) I was an SDR at other companies. The sales role here is so so far from an SDR job. We have 0 cold calling and no daily/weekly dial metrics. You are never pressured to waste your time just to hit pointless activity quotas. 

2) ""Not true sales"" could be accurate if you consider high pressure and scripted sales tactics to be ""true sales"". Other Valley software companies are pushing reps to dial 100 times a day and close contracts + set up fees etc. Stripe allows for a low pressure, consultative sale because the product is actually incredibly good and clients are happy 99% of the time. You will have a much longer sales cycle here but you can at least be proud that you are helping your clients and not just forcing them into something so that you can get paid.

3) We have a team environment and quota instead of individual numbers. This allows for a much less stressful day to day experience and lets you concentrate on doing your job properly. It also makes it possible to actually feel happy for other people on your team when they make a sale.

4) Food team is incredible.

5) You can work on side projects and contribute to other parts of the company instead of just doing the same thing everyday. ""True Salespeople"" might just want to dial all day and make the biggest check possible, but that is not the environment promoted here.","1) Pay - team quota means no individual goal and no bonuses. Most reps make ~130k and always less than 175. If you are looking for a saas sales job where you will clear 300k this is certainly not the place for you.  This is only a con because its not typical for sales jobs. 130k is still pretty decent wage in SF though.

2) Career Paths - Stripe has not figured out what is going on with levels and ladders and promotions and that causes some resentment and anger. I assume some of the 1 star reviews are from people who have not been promoted after several years.

3) Quiet office. The culture built here does not encourage much excitement or buzz in the office space.  This has led to a dead silent office - Music was banned except in the kitchen and people don't even take calls at their desks. Wish there was a bit more fun going on!"
265,Stripe,Very little you can get out of this company,2017-03-23,1.0,,"Delicious meals, afternoon snacks, some good talent, pretty cool office. Growing...but slowly for a startup. High valuation...that's likely very inflated. Standard equity plan.","Most everyone stays for the equity, but what people generally don't realize is even with a liquidity event ... realistically not for another 4-7 years ... there is so much dilution that even if you're fully vested your equity will NOT be worth much. Don't count on a big payoff as your sole incentive to stay at the company. You WILL be disappointed. Other than that, there's almost nothing you can get out of Stripe if you've already worked at another tech company in the Valley or elsewhere. Sure, you can treat it as an intellectual exercise and learn something about credit card payments processing, but is that what you really want to spent your time doing?? There are so many interesting companies ... startups or otherwise ... working on amazing projects that it doesn't make any sense to stick with this one."

Meaning, if people want to go to another department, their manager does not prepare them for it. They get thrown to the wolves to interview and hope it works out. The leadership team and management hasn't considered appreciating current employees by creating an internal mobility program that ACTUALLY helps prepare people for a  different job. 
Promote from within. Make managers truly develop their employees. Start a shadowing program. 

Also, they are very pretentious with their hiring just like any other young tech company. For example: They want people to jump over the moon to be an account executive. They have a bunch of test and other nonsense, and every department thinks they're super smart, and their job is so challenging when in reality most people can be trained to do these jobs unless it's highly specialized. But forget- because you won't get trained to go into another position. You'd have to quit and come back. But why come back? lol!

- Some pretty great people, though this frankly varies department-by-department. 

- Building and growing a product used by more and more people everyday, even if they don't know.","-The politics people mentioned here are real; you'd likely have a better chance of getting into a management role if you left Stripe for a role at Google and came back on what some employees refer to as the ""Google Gravy Train"" versus developing in-house. 

- In that vein, you have to be willing to put in face time outside of work to advance anywhere, and the review process means a lot of your work might never be noticed, even in performance reviews.

-Management team is busy patting themselves on the back to address key employment concerns, leading to tech debt as technical talent  becomes disenchanted with the company.

-Despite the company's almost-suspect emphasis on transparency, a lot of major changes in the company take place behind closed doors, and often the rank-and-file employees find out far later than  would be sensible from a productivity standpoint. 

- C-level executives either woefully unaware of many of the troubles or playing deaf; sometimes it seems as more time is spent promoting Stripe's image to tech companies than is spent identifying core issues in hiring practices, HR practices, and a much-needed overhaul of the way in-company communication is handled."

274,Stripe,great,2016-06-17,5.0,,awesome place to work here here,there are no cons here in this company
275,Stripe,Humble with exceptional talent,2016-06-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Genuine feeling from everyone in the Dublin office that they are working towards a common goal, and are excited about their jobs. High level of humility and sincerity from the team, which coupled with exceptional talent is pretty rare- this is something Stripe has really got right. 

Leadership globally is impressive, open and always willing to discuss thoughts and ideas. Overall, a really flexible and fantastic place to work where any number of opportunities are possible.","Same cons for most companies with an US HQ - Timezones can be a challenge occasionally, but the level of global exposure more than makes up for this."
276,Stripe,Great career with a company who cares,2016-06-07,5.0,Account Support,"Countless opportunities. Your growth doesn't have to just be to management. You can specialize, learn new skills, etc. They encourage you to grow with various classes. They even encourage you to start your own thing.

Benifits are amazing as well. 

The day to day job itself is great. You are held accountable, but not in a way that makes you feel like you are constantly being watched -- in a way that makes youu strive to be the best that you can be.","Honestly, I can't think of any cons right now. I suppose if you don't like a constantly changing enviornment, then thos isn't the place for you."
277,Stripe,User Ops,2016-04-22,5.0,User Ops,"- Thriving environment
- Humble people, no politics
- Fast growth makes the job exciting 
- Open communication
- Still haven't figured out all the things","- Still haven't figured out all the things  (not really a con)
- Cross-timezone communication can be hard to manage"
278,Stripe,Amazing place,2016-04-21,5.0,User Operations,"- Really engaging place to work - there are countless opportunities and projects that anybody can get involved in 
- Great culture: transparent, open communication, collaborative (not competitive), very fair, flat organization 
- Growing rapidly and everybody is involved in the growth","- Processes not always put in place, which makes us lose some time on defining these processes, but that's the beauty of a startup :-)"
279,Stripe,"A great place to work, I love it!",2016-03-26,5.0,Growth,"Great and passionate team, interesting and varied work, good management team, the company actually cares about their employees.","All of the product stuff happens in San Francisco, some late calls and meetings because of the time difference."
280,Stripe,Passionate co-workers who embody company values,2016-02-09,4.0,Software Engineer,"- The company is very welcoming and willing to accommodate you working odd hours if you need to
 - Unlike at larger companies, they don't just pay lip service to what they believe in. Instead it feels like every person you work with at the company is personally invested in the values.
 - You're given lots of autonomy. Important decisions like company wide goals, are decided by representatives from the entire company, then filter down to smaller tasks to achieve each quarter as decided by teams.","We're still struggling to grow from a baby company into a full-grown one, with everything that entails - HR processes and management structures are still developing in some areas, and we're still learning how to balance feature work with reliability. This means instability, which can sometimes mean intrusions on personal time for incident response."
281,Stripe,Great place to work!,2016-01-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The people are smart and opportunities here are amazing. Company decisions are made based on strong core values (stripe is the most transparent company I've worked for). Limited politics. Incredible perks/benefits. Truly excited and proud to come to work each day.,"As with any fast growing company, there are pains. A certain level of flexibility and adaptability are necessary for success and sanity here. Lack of structure in certain areas, but getting better. We could definitely do a better job at rallying our company around the wins of individual teams and celebrating company success as well as promotions a bit more."
282,Stripe,"Great opportunity, smart employees",2016-01-04,5.0,,"-Your peers are thoughtful, passionate, and smart. The hiring bar at Stripe is high and ensures you'll constantly be impressed and learning from the people around you.
-Interesting technical challenges (lots of them) and opportunity for growth in the market.
-The culture is strong. Even as the company is growing, our culture is embedded into our values and the way we run business. Leadership deeply cares about this and is mindful of our culture/ values when making decisions and scaling the company.
-Great sense of community amongst employees. Lunch is always fun because you never know who you'll sit with and get to know. There are fun (optional) activities organized often- board game nights, karaoke, afternoon small group outings (coffee shop visits, yoga, running, and rock climbing nearby) as a nice break during work hours. 
-Amazing location in the mission. Right by Valencia street and other startups, there is lots to do compared to SOMA. Examples are above, but great food, coffee shops, yoga studios and mission cliffs are less than a 5 min walk away.
-Strong co-founders. I really trust the decisions by our co-founders and COO. Very sharp people who are not only business savvy, but forward-thinking, and extremely approachable. The CEO makes an effort to learn everyone by name and meet with all new hires when they join.","-Growing pretty quickly which means inevitable changes happening that you need to keep up with
-Work/Life balance is a struggle for some people especially if you have time management challenges, but it's a startup so you know what you're getting into. This has been getting better as the company grows, thankfully.
-Culture is really autonomous so if you need a lot of direction and management, this is probably not the place for you."
283,Stripe,Great potential,2015-12-29,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Smart, deeply thoughtful people; great leaders (the exec team is really impressive and closely engaged with the company); lots of autonomy; lots of potential for individuals to make an impact since the company is still small and growing.","Lacks structure (though it's being worked on); people need to be open to adjusting to rapid change; opportunities are plentiful but sometimes hard to properly identify and understand; unclear or confusing structure can mean people get things done by personal influence or who they know rather than clearly-delineated responsibilities. This is all pretty normal for a rapid growth period, though, and we're smart people who will figure it out."
284,Stripe,Thoughtful people and huge growth opportunities at Stripe!,2015-12-21,5.0,New Business Associate,"From the recruiting process, to on-boarding/training, to my daily work, I'm consistently impressed by the people that make up the company. All and more of the standard SF benefits such as amazing food, beautiful workspace, competitive pay, etc. If you're a thoughtful and critical-thinking professional, I couldn't imagine a better environment to work in.","If you need someone to tell you what to do everyday, and how to do it, this is probably not the best place for you to spend your time."
285,Stripe,"High-impact work, passionate coworkers",2015-12-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Tons of interesting work to go around, incredibly friendly and energetic people to work with.","Some growing pains as levels, promotions, and more managers are put into place."
286,Stripe,Have loved my experience here,2015-11-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"People are kind, helpful, nice to be around. There's quite a bit of independence in terms of what you work on and you go about accomplishing it. We're finally getting around to adding some structure within the organization (rolling out levels, we have people in HR and do perf reviews). We've also recently let go of some managers that weren't performing (note: not everyone who has left has done so voluntarily). I have a great manager and get along with her well. I get more feedback from her than any other manger I have to date and it's actually constructive and useful.","We're growing and nothing is perfect. There are systems and processes that aren't quite there yet, but we're aware of them and make efforts to improve weaknesses. There are some areas of the company which have higher hiring bars than others, there are some teams where the output isn't clear to the org."
287,Stripe,Great place to work,2015-11-02,4.0,,"The people who work at Stripe are some of the brightest, friendliest and hardest working people I've ever met. I love that departments aren't completely isolated and I get to talk to people from different teams about what challenges they're tackling. 

As far as leadership goes, John and Patrick have a clear vision for what Stripe will become, and keep employees abreast of decisions and movement. I've been in roles where I've felt left in the dark so this is a welcomed change. 

One thing Stripe is really great about is internal movement. If you decide a role isn't a great fit for you it's pretty easy to transfer to another department. 

Oh, and the perks are pretty cushy.","While leadership is great, there are a select few within the middle management level that could have benefited from some training."
288,Stripe,Growth,2015-10-28,1.0,Growth,"small team, and quite some cross team work with san francisco office","very so so team - former UK MD left after one year. Current one is an ex consultant, not very good leader or communicator."
289,Stripe,needs structure,2015-10-11,1.0,Software Engineer,"very nice people, great food, possible financial success, decent perks, nice office location (for now)","high level of inexperience across the board (most of company were hired from university), no training, no mentoring, inexperienced and unsupported management, highly NIH technical stack of very poor quality, more focus on producing open source projects than features, pervasive overworking, no one in charge of product or technical road maps, politics/social scene was incredibly important, CTO and VPE quit but didn't look for replacements, no performance reviews, no HR, very low salaries due to low average experience of employees (standard SE offer was $110K), few senior hires because of low pay, insular culture with weird jargon (a ""trope"" is a meeting), high emphasis on elite university experience, no career ladder besides management, no project management, an ""old guard"" that actively resists any change, team vacations, little to no communication of expectations, technical criticism usually considered a personal attack, passive-aggressive culture, CEO micromanagement of pet projects, losing experienced staff"
