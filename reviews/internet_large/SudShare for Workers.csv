The good about this job is the pay and how you can do the cleaning all from home which is a huge plus in my book.

83,SudShare for Workers,Sud Worker review,2022-03-09,5.0,Starter,Definitely a way to make extra money especially if you don’t wanna punch a clock.,You never know what you’ve picked up other than laundry until you’ve gotten home and emptied the laundry out.
84,SudShare for Workers,Great complementary job,2022-03-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"As I was looking for a part-time job to supplement my income, i came across this position. That was a best decision. The schedules are very flexible, you make your own schedule, and you work from home. Training is a breeze, short to the point and succinct. it does not take too long for you to start making money.
My last order was #S8178356",Small glitch with the application. But this resolved itself automatically once you restart your phone.
85,SudShare for Workers,Having fun,2022-03-07,5.0,Sudster,"Get to stay at home, get to connect with people on my own level of comfort.",Home bound til job is finished.
86,SudShare for Workers,Not worth it,2022-03-07,2.0,Sudster,You can make a quick few bucks when in need.,"Working for sudshare I have learned a lot. The company is always trying to please the customers and could care less if you are give a false review and they have very inaccurate algorithms.
It costs way too much to go drive around town to pick up/ drop off orders. With only making $15 for one bag of laundry ( 3 loads separating colors). So that’s around 3 hours of washing and drying plus folding. Not to mention having to bag and weigh. A lot of time customers complain of incorrect weigh just so the can get a discount or free…no pay for you or the time you took. 
There is also horrible algorithms that are not correct. If you don’t have a customer that comes back to the app and or uses it and stops you are penalized. I get out of town people who only use the service once or people who use it during time when they don’t have a washer/dryer. Therefor if they don’t come back to the app. You then get your rank reduced causing you to receive less orders and requests.
 The amount of time you have to accept any requests are limited to seconds. If you aren’t constantly looking at your phone you are likely to not catch any orders you try to accept. 
Join the Sudsters Sudshare Facebook page and you will see all the unhappy sudsters. 
Oh and you also have to pay a credit card processing fee everytime you get paid for an order.
Things they have implemented such as selecting bag size have just added fluff because it’s not required for the customers to fill it out. I know. You are like why does that matter….. Many Sudsters only accept as much laundry as they have the time,space, and patience for. If I only have a few hours before work to do one regular garbage bag order and I go to pick it up and it’s 3 large yard trash bags stuffed full I won’t be able to complete it. Customers typically have more then what they put in the app and it’s inconvent. You can’t cancel an order or you are kicked off the platform.
Sudshare constantly blasts about how people are dropping off food, flowers, and all sorts of crazy stuff to customers. Your probably making $10 an hour not including the cost of gas. Do you really think they wanna spend the only 10 they made on the customers to make them like them."

The sudshare app offers a very detailed easy to understand course for those interested in signing up.

The more points and positive customer reviews the more opportunities you have. You will eventually have the option to complete 1 order or multiple orders per day. It's up to you! SudShare has been great for me & several of my friends who also have signed up. We choose our driving radius & which jobs we want and which days we work. Oh by the way you are paid by direct deposit every week. If you want to easily earn a $100 + a week while working another part time job, caring for your children or continuing your education then I honestly do recommend Sudshare.

The washing guidelines and rules are fairly straightforward.","The ranking and point system is incredibly unfair. The app is extremely glitchy and isn't updated often enough. Support personnel are difficult to get in contact with and provide very little real help. The pay is lower than other laundry companies, and they deduct credit card processing fees from THE TIPS WE EARN. Most of the good reviews on this site were bought and paid for by SudShare when they offered Sudsters points in exchange for reviews (so of course, people only wrote good reviews because they didn't think they'd get their points if they were honest). The company is more concerned with going viral on TikTok than they are with making the SudShare experience a great one for both Sudsters and customers, and it's pretty embarrassing."

Let’s start by saying I was able to make fairly quick money just in time for the holidays. We all know how this time can be pretty stressful around of the year. I’ve only taken orders for two days out of the week starting out, and I’m heavily considering trying to achieve full time! Everything is greatly explained to you and their communication is superb. Lastly they truthfully care about their customers and employees, that alone is such a great experience to be apart of! So if you are second guessing trying this company out.. or maybe thinking that this might be too hard, guess no more and just give SudShare a try!!!

Sometimes the customer doesn’t tip or rate you, which makes your effort and efficiency a bust. That is life tho, don’t change who you are or how you handle a job, not everyone will always say thank you or say good job, no matter your extra effort. It sucks yes, especially if you are a detailed person and you know nobody else puts in the same effort. It’s all about you rewarding yourself personally."

356,SudShare for Workers,Think it through first!!!,2021-12-03,2.0,Bronze Sudster,Working from home. That's it.,"Please take into consideration all that you have to put out of your pocket that the company makes money on. 
Bags, labels, ribbon, laundry detergent, thank you cards, advertising, water bill, electric bill, gas, wear on your car, wear on your machines, bed bugs, cockroaches, urine, feces, and enough pet hair to make your own dog. These are the things you have to have and deal with everyday. Now they want you to give your customers things like flowers to keep 'their' customer base- but again, it's out of your pocket. To make $15-20 an hour is impossible. It's more like $7-8 after you've paid everything out. 
They are quick to listen to the customer and take your money back!! Meaning you've lost money! Time, gas water, electric....gone out of your pocket."

You’re an independent contractor so you reap tax benefits for the supplies you next and gas you use! Laundry is personally so relaxing for me so this was a PERFECT side hustle to do with my other full time job. I love also being able to pick up orders when I need extra cash for ie gas, christmas/birthday presents, etc. I also love the Facebook group. The members are so kind and encouraging and helpful! I love it!","The only cons I think would be the support. You can email them through the app but a phone number would be nice to text or call, cause it’s a little hard when they don’t follow up. And being an independent contractor is a blessing and a curse. Cause while you do get reimbursed for items, you do have to pay taxes at the end. I personally wish they took taxes out already but that’s just me! Otherwise, no complaints! I love my job and my clients!"

Have to be very discreet and very vigilant when it comes to high priority customers and that can be difficult.

421,SudShare for Workers,I absolutely love working for SudShare,2021-11-02,5.0,Bronze Sudster,It’s very convenient and I get to work from home. I get to pick and choose which orders I want to take.

Customer support favor the customers more than the workers, some customers laundry is disgusting sometimes covered in feces or dried blood and get told to do our best, the way we are rated is unfair, the app isn't that intuitive."

433,SudShare for Workers,SO WORTH SIGNING UP! Start making money as early as today.,2021-10-30,5.0,Laundry Worker,"My work experience with Sudshare has been AMAZING! The app is really easy to use. Sudshare walks you through each step quickly and efficiently. The professional development videos and articles are super quick reads/presentations. They get straight to the point with advice that will help you earn more money and better ratings. The professional development videos and articles have really been effective in my own personal ratings and tip increase. Sudshare really wants you to get as much money as you can straight into your pocket. So definitely pay attention and follow. 

Also, Sudshare always rewards you for your hard work through incentives. But most importantly, I love the personable emails that acknowledge and praise you for your hard work.

So let’s talk materials needed to get started! At first I was worrisome about finding the specificities of the materials that are required for presenting the laundry. But, Sudshare thinks of everything! and has links that direct you straight to affordable products on Amazon that will get the job done. They also have a shop that has affordable products to purchase that will boost up your presentation and earn more money. And if the shop doesn’t sell it! Sudshare always provides a link to affordable Amazon products. With Amazon’s next day delivery, I was able to start making money the very next day after signing up.

Now let’s talk flexibility! I love love love that I am in control of how much work I do. I pick the orders I want, when I want. I was a special education teacher and became a full time stay at home mom over 2 years ago. I wanted more time with my kids. I wanted to be present in their lives as much as possible, especially since my husband works long hours, and has a long commute. Working as a special education teacher did not give me the flexibility to be there for my kids. Through Sudshare, I never have to choose work over my kids. I choose my kids and then I fit in as much work as I want to earn. 

Finally, I want to share how the money I earn through Sudshare matters and benefits my family. When I left my career as a teacher I knew I was making the best decision for my kids. Not only was I able to get more time with them. I was able to support each of my children’s individual medical and academic needs that required my full involvement in their education. Our school district isn’t the best, so we found a very affordable Christian private school. Our oldest daughter has been thriving at this school. Again, feeling very validated in my decision. This year we have been saving to pay for next years tuition, as we always do. Except now our middle child will begin kindergarten at that very same school next year. So again, we were saving heavily now for 2 kids to get the best education starting next year. But then a curve ball I hit us, this year my youngest (2 years old) son has recently been diagnosed with neuromuscular scoliosis, and hypotonia. He is still undergoing many genetic and muscle dystrophy testing to try and get an estimate of his physical abilities in the future. Through these many test and doctor visits we have acquired some heavy medical bills. So we were no longer able to keep saving for school and had to put our money towards paying for our son’s medical care. I was heart broken thinking my children would not be able to continue at their school. I was desperately trying to find a job that was flexible and still allowed me to continue to support my kids medical and academic needs. But then one day my friend mentioned Sudshare. I signed up and started working the next day. Now I happy to say that their is hope for my kids to continue getting a good quality education and still have Mom right their with them. So every cent I make through Sudshare means everything to me. This is why I am so thankful for Sudshare and the opportunity it has given me. I really want who ever is reading this trying to decide if Sudshare is right for them to know that Sudshare can really help you meet your financial goals. And if you are in a crazy predicament like me that has little time and money to invest in anything that’s not going to work. I am giving my honest review that Sudshare is worth signing up. I’m certain through my own experience that Sudshare will help you meet your financial goals.

Thank you for reading my honest review.

We do SO much work, so much driving and out so much effort into customers laundry and it’s crazy we do it for .75 a pound. Should be minimum of 1.00 a pound. 
-I don’t feel comfortable going into hotels or apartments and we can’t see if it’s a house or otherwise before we accept it. 
-Customers can review and if you did everything as asked they can still cause you to loose points for busting your butt for them. 
-There shouldn’t be points for complaints, compliments, tips.. things that we can’t control
-Tips getting cut by a lot cause “card company” or whatever it is. It sucks 
-Having to replay every time a customer messages even if they said thank you and you say your welcome and they send a smile. It’s awkward and not needed. Replying within 3 hours would be better and only during business hours 8am-8pm
- customers shouldn’t have the “power” to slam us on reviews and hurt our rating. It should be “investigated” pictures need to be sent to SudShare before anything is touched. No bs about smells when you used hypoallergenic detergent.
-There should be a delivery fee of minimum $5 if so many miles away. That is given straight to us without any being taken away. It’s hard to get close orders for some. 
-Needing customers to say okay to extension. Within reason of course
-Customers have no idea (for the most part) that it’s us bringing it home. I’ve had more than HALF my customers ask how this works. I feel we’d get tipped more and also understand needing extensions and everything. It needs to be explained better so people know it’s us with one washer and dryer busting our butts"

The training required allowed me to start my business fully prepared and the system/app is extremely easy to follow and recreate with each order. Laundry has always been a burden task for me but since starting with sudshare, I've taken pride in my work and now enjoy doing my own laundry (which is a miracle alone). This is a great gig for anyone looking for extra money or looking for a way to fill up some free time. I've developed a great customer base that has turned into some friendships that I didn't know I needed. Highly recommend if you're willing to put in the work!",I feel the need to accept every order I come across but I need to learn my limits and share the wealth with my fellow sudsters.

650,SudShare for Workers,SAHM contributing income again,2021-08-15,5.0,Sudster,"FLEXIBILITY. Being able to work orders into my ever changing schedule is amazing. There’s days that I can’t take any orders and I don’t get penalized for that. I only take the orders that I want, that are within the mile radius that works for me and are the size I can handle at the moment. I am able to choose the majority of the circumstances around working as a sudster. I often have my kids in tow for pick up and delivery which allows me to take more orders. I’m able to help others with a daunting task and in turn support my family. 
Many mention the 25% that sudshare takes but I don’t feel they take it at all. They thought of, created, run and constantly update the platform. Folks seriously can’t expect they would do all that for free now would they. It’s a company not a favor or hand out. I almost forgot to mention the most important part, the customers, especially those repeat regular customers. They are always so appreciative. #S2976780","There’s often times a few quirks with the app, much like any other platform. Usually resolved by the tech team rather quickly once they know about it. 
I do wish we could add a “bag size” option for the customer to choose from. As well as if they are in a gated community, apartment, business etc. also knowing if an order has hang dry items “before accepting” this would let us know if we can handle additional orders with that or not."

I can be with my daughter all day and still make money. All I can say is thank you Sudshare I greatly appreciate this company.
(#S3023466)",The only con I have is that I can’t see if it’s an house or apartment before I accept an order. You ever climb three flights of stairs with a 14 pound newborn strap to you to pick up three bags of laundry. I definitely skip the gym that day. And is there a way for you guys to make sure customers review and rate that same day it’s not fair to you that we have to wait until they place a new order to get tip rate and review.

Some service apps like this don’t really provide any training and don’t really care about customer service. SudShare isn’t that way though. I also like that there is the freedom to add your own personal touch, which makes it more fun and also helps with ratings and tips. Also the ranking system keeps me motivated to try to get more orders and work hard. I work full time from home so this job is also perfect to make more money on the side.","I wish you could see the full details before accepting it, such as if they live in an apartment or house. Or if they put their laundry in baskets or bags because that also changes how much laundry they have. Sometimes they say “two bags” but it’s really two laundry hampers which is more like 5 bags. It’s okay because you get paid by weight but sometimes it changes how long it will take you and the expectations you give the customer."

Sometimes customers do not fully understand that the final amount is based off of the weight of their clothes.

701,SudShare for Workers,Love the amount of money I make😁,2021-08-09,5.0,Laundry Worker,"Pick you own hours, work when you want to work. Chose the amount of laundry you can handle. Easy app makes it super easy to accept orders.","When someone request you, you only have literally 3 mins to accept it. Customer service is hard to get ahold of if there is a problem with a order."
702,SudShare for Workers,Sudshare,2021-08-09,5.0,Independent Contractor,"SudShare is a good option for making extra income. I find that their app is very easy to use and understand. They provide training videos for anyone who is new to doing laundry. I would recommend Sudshare to anyone who enjoys doing laundry and is willing to help others in need of help. This is not for everyone, when you join you are rated based on performance. You do have the option to work part-time or full-time.
#S2966773",I haven’t experienced any cons but customer support response time could improve.
703,SudShare for Workers,can do better,2021-08-09,3.0,Sudster,Pros - I like being a Sudster its perfect for my part time- and that i can choose my own jobs at my own pace. - money is good too,"cons - Customer complaints are not always correct - and i think its unfair - Sudshare needs to also check them to see if they re truthful with their rating. 
We work for Sudshare and should also proctect us more."
704,SudShare for Workers,Make great money on your spare time,2021-08-09,5.0,Laundry Attendant,I found myself in between jobs and needed to make some money while I found a stable job. Needless to say SudShare has been a lifesaver while I find a full time job. I have been able to to pay some bills where I wouldn’t of have been able to do so before.,You definitely need to be committed and pay attention to detail as they are very particular with how handle the job at hand. Having all that is required is a must.
705,SudShare for Workers,Rating,2021-08-09,5.0,Laundry Attendant,"Helping people do their laundry, and the money is good, not great but good. Having a purpose, nice customers and tips.","Wear and tear on the car, app doesn't work without Wi-Fi, rude customers sometimes, wish they would let us workers know if it is an apartment or house before we accept job, because it is very hard for me to go up and down stairs, wish sudshare would pay for gas and mileage and us workers shouldn't have to pay for supplies, like detergent, labels, bags and t-shirts and also wear and tear on washer and dryer."
706,SudShare for Workers,Not horrible if you get decent customers but SudShare definitely needs a lot of improvements for it’s Sudster’s!,2021-08-09,3.0,Laundry Worker,I love being able to work from home and having the flexibility to accept orders around my schedule. I’ve always been in customer service jobs. So I love the people pleasing aspect of this job. The point system makes it exciting and addicting to level up as long as you have good and honest customers. I also like the no contact pickup and delivery.,"Currently not well known about in my area because the company doesn’t advertise services only employment. We can make flyers and distribute them ourselves but there is currently no way for someone to request us specifically unless we’ve already had an order from them. Basically you’re spending your time and money advertising for the company as a whole and have no way to specifically receive the benefits of your advertising. If your friends or family want to sign up and want you to do their laundry, there’s no guarantee that you’ll get their order. SudShare strongly believes in “the customer is always right” statement. Even without actual proof, just the word of the customer, Sudsters have been punished for some dishonest customers just looking for a free service. Point system is unfair when it comes to customers negative reviews. Sometimes double or even triple the points that we can receive from a great review is deducted for a bad review. It is very hard to get a quick response from customer service so some of us just get help from the Facebook group for Sudsters."
707,SudShare for Workers,I love Sudshare,2021-08-09,5.0,Sudster,"Sudshare is amazing in my opinion because i can make my own hours and still have time fir my kids and family.

708,SudShare for Workers,It’s worth a try,2021-08-09,4.0,Worker,You can work whenever you want. It can be worked around any job you may have. It worth a try if your looking to make extra money.,Not being able to speak with someone when you call. Sometimes a person isn’t available to text back as well when needed.

I can accept the order that work with my schedule and decline the ones that don’t. The work is easy and I can still interact with my family since it’s done at my home. Just finished my 3rd order and starting the 4th now. I wish I found this sooner, and I can’t wait for my future with Sudshare!! #S2965008","The app just launched in my area, so not as many orders as offer locations. But I know that will soon change!"
713,SudShare for Workers,Easy Money,2021-08-09,4.0,Sudster,I work for SudShare part time for extra income. It is very easy to do. You work when you want and when it’s convenient to pick up orders. They give out bonuses for most of the orders. The pay is weekly. Once you reach a certain level you can pick what day you want to get paid and eventually you can get paid instantly. #S2941934,"The only downside would be whenever a customer has a problem with their laundry and they complain to ShudShare. ShudShare doesn’t even take the time to check and make sure the customer isn’t lying (some people will do that to get their money back) or they don’t check with the Sudster, they just take the money back out of your payout, take stars off your rating, or shut down your account so you can’t work for them anymore. Because of a customers complaint they reduced my ability to even get orders as punishment, which isn’t right. SudShare doesn’t care about losing us and replacing us ASAP. #S2941934"

I get to meet knew people and on top of that help when am needed. Apart of being motivated to get up everyday and work toward our self goals is feeling clean clear and blissful. We're helping our customers feel this way so they can accomplish their on duties when they are not able to do so. I always say that it's the little things that count.,It can sometimes make us feel a way we don't like when we run into individuals that feel we didn't accommodate to their needs. This is going to happen but it best to try to avoid these situations. I personally enjoy making our customers day with being are to pick up and deliver their fresh clothes and linens

The pay is great and the incentives are wonderful as well. I love the clean smell of fresh laundry and the satisfaction it gives my customers! Sudshare is a great company to work for !",Not really to many cons. I wish I had more time to accept a new order as I can be busy doing something and miss new incoming orders. I wish I could communicate to customers who request me if I am not available at a specific request time. Overall no cons to report at this time. Point system is flawed a little .
721,SudShare for Workers,Experience as A Sudster,2021-08-08,5.0,Sudster,I love working as a Sudster! The best part is being able to be flexible. Working your own schedule id definitely a pro.,Some of the downsides would be getting rude customers and bad ratings which couod be untrue.

You should take care of the laundry better than if it was yours. No short cuts.",Sudsters should receive all of their tips. We pay for all our gas and supplies. It is part of being self employed. Maybe a trip charge be added to the service.

728,SudShare for Workers,SudShare Works,2021-08-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I am new to SudShare and I’ve done about 5-10 order since starting in July 2021. I have had success with the app when I started there was already new orders to accept. I love the reviews I get and learning the Sudster way of executing pickups and deliveries for each customer is fun. It is a good way to earn extra income. The app is easy to use and very detailed.,"They don’t pay for mileage and most times I have to travel an hour away to access orders or reimbursements for products. It seems like I spend more on supplies, gas and washing and drying then I make from the orders. It is hard to get orders from time to time sometimes. I wish there were more orders available on a daily basis. There have been times at drop off when certain functions wouldn’t load in the app and it almost made me miss deadlines or left some area incomplete before I could complete the order. I wish there was a direct way to contact someone at SudShare other than email if I need help immediately with anything so that I’d be able to contact them by phone or chat through the app right away instead of waiting a a day or two. #S2893546"

As a personal Laundry Aide I sort, wash, fold and door deliver with care. I ensure my orders are freshly delivered and labeled to impress with the hopes that I am requested for future services. What I love most is that I can accept orders when I choose to work and the pay is weekly. We offer hanging items if the client provides hangers. We also wash bulk items and can provide service for hypoallergentic requests. S2915967",You cannot accept a 2nd order until the one you have active is completed and delivered.

The app is easy to follow along and the training videos walk you through the process step by step.  The videos can be revisited at anytime if needed.
Order #S2903008","No raises flat rate pay .75 cents/ pound of laundry.  Not commensurate with other remote laundry service providers.

I find this job relaxing since there is no pressure to pick up an order or not. Its what works best for you and your schedule. I love being able to work at home. I recently retired and this is the type of job I needed to decompress. In time you build a client base and before you know it they are requesting you.,It may be a little tough to get started.

It's simple and straightforward. The process is fairly seamless.,Often with pretty much all customer rating based employment. It can be tricky in the beginning with an upset customer. Keep working and it will even out.
763,SudShare for Workers,Extra money,2021-08-06,4.0,Sudster,"The Extra money is good, and making your own schedule.",The down time when you just start. It takes weeks to get 1 client.
764,SudShare for Workers,GREAT Side Hustle,2021-08-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"You get to work at home! Its very flexible, so you get to pick which orders you want to take. You get a full 24 hours to return their laundry. If you get regulars they tend to tip well, & always request you. Good pay for stay at home moms. Soothes anxiety if you love doing laundry! If you ever need help the Sudshare community on Facebook responds within MINUTES!","Very strict sometimes a little too strict. If you accept an order there's no way you cancel it, there's a chance that your account might be deleted. Even at times when you do your very best, there's a chance a customer can leave a bad review and you lose A LOT of points. You have to come out of pocket for supplies. If your a mom with little kids sometimes you might pull up to an apartment complex with stairs/elevators and that's hard when you don't want to leave kids in the car,"
765,SudShare for Workers,Insight,2021-08-06,5.0,Silver Service,Work from the comfort of your home. There is a lot of flexibility and pretty easy to pick shifts. Good system of learning.,"Not too many orders around. People tend to pick orders in certain aéreas a lot faster than others so one is left without orders sometimes. Most orders start at only 20$ and by the time bonus starts they are taken. When you're looking for any jobs available using the app it can say 2 bags for example and the pay maybe$ 20 but there is no control of how big the bag actually is. I had one huge bag once and it was more than 6 loads. When customer sends a request you only have 3 min to say yes. I don't look at my phone every 3 min. There should be a better way for customers to pay tip faster (some over 2 weeks have gone by and they haven't tipped). Lastly, improve the ranking and points. Make it more appealing for workers to want to do even more. Example: got to 1000 points got a gift car to only spend on few Merch items from the company, delivery not even included when something a lot better would be things that are mostly useful like stickers bags strings or anything that would help us Sudstares be better for your company."
766,SudShare for Workers,As a Sudster,2021-08-06,5.0,Sudster,The best reason is that your basically on your on time! And being a to satisfy others in helping them with their laundry that may not have time to do it they self brings me pleasure I thank SudShare in this time as well where jobs are not easy to come by and allowing me and others to work!,When customer estimates their laundry to leave it at that not to try and raise it they should just raise they bonus

#S2897547","There are a only a few cons. One, it does take a bit to break into the competitive Sudster market but once you get going, you really find your groove. Two, at first it may seem like you are spending a lot on all the required supplies but after you break into the market you will find a wonderful steady income. Three, if you have an issue while working it can take 24hours or more to get a response. Just be patient and you will see amazing results with working your SudShare business."

It’s great for students, stay at home moms, and for those looking for a financial boost. SudShare workers are able to work from the comfort and safety their home.

#S2896893","It’s extremely difficult to speak to someone for support. For beginners, it can be confusing and frustrating because once an order is accepted it cannot be canceled. However, if a customer cancels an order there is no way of knowing until you’ve arrive at their home, and the customer didn’t leave out their clothes."

I'm sorry but I have tried working with this  company. I spent so much money buying all the supplies  they suggested,making my family bend over backwards (to watch my three yr old) Just to make sure these demanding clients have their laundry delivered by 8pm usually driving 30 min or farther!! 
U don’t get compensation for gas or mileage or any of the products they tell you to buy to make better “tips”- that’s if they even tip you.- which in most cases, they don’t.
These random people we are servicing do not care about us ""sudsters"" and about the money we strive to make to survive.  There is no possible way anyone could make 15 to 20 $ an hour even working full time with sudshare. 
I have invested more on gas, supplies , mileage, money on washers and dryers ,and most of all TIME (something you can't get back)into this side gig . Only for constant ""glitches "" or ""technical problems"" in the app to occur. 
I have to actually notice these issues in the app and text the boss for him to even see them himself. whether if it's good or bad. 
Yet in all the videos their trying to teach us how professional to be and to bend over backwards for these low class type of people that were basically doing ""slave work"" for just in hopes we get a better tip which leads to a better review which leads to a higher ranking and so forth. 
It’s basically a game - competition- has nothing to do with how much work and time and effort you put in to present the laundry smelling so fresh and everything folded perfectly in clear bags with ribbon on top. Unfortunately you end up realizing how much time u just waisted- people all have the opportunity to review, rate, rank and tip you. If you get any kind of negative feedback- and u might have not done ANYTHING WRONG -the customers basically will lie just to not have to pay- not only will you not get paid for the job but your points will drop. I went from a diamond status all the way back down to a starter with one negative review - which was a complete lie.
Maybe in the south it's different Bc people seem to love working for sudshare- Although reading some of the. Reviews on FB about it I believe Their starting to catch on that the owners of this company are taking complete advantage of sudsters.
Up North we can't Work 8-10 hour shifts -pray we get a good review- MAYBE even a tip and receive a pay out of 50 bucks or less. It's just impossible to survive this way and unfair  to expect us too.
Do NOT WASTE YOUR TIME like I did."
