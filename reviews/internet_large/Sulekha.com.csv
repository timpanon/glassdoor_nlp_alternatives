33,Sulekha.com,Elitist NRI management team,2021-06-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Nil nil nil nil nil,"Elitist NRIs are not a bad thing as such as long as they are not running a local services marketplace. They are clueless about the ecosystem from which they have been mooching off for more than 2 decades.

But then how are they alive for so long? By having sales heads who are well connected in the local market and these heads are highly compensated for bringing the cheques using their influence. So, the culture is very toxic in such a setup that is convenient only for those 15-20 who are pocketing very high pay. When the internet started democratising a lot of things and started putting power in the hands of consumers and merchants, the middlemen really needs to really strive hard to deliver value.

Management is never in sync. Top 3 do not listen to each other and worse, do not bother to come to an agreement. Other top heads enjoy the policy paralysis and blame each other. It is so toxic inside those doors with the amount of back-bi*ching that happens in every team.

India's job market ensures you always get employees on the ground to slave for you. And every employee is treated as dispensable. You realise it is more than a thing of mere rumor-mongering when you hear many sexual harassment stories. No real personal growth for any employee. It is only those NRI who has been pocketing the 'blood money' and now they will have the pandemic as an excuse that they went belly up. Pandemic didnt hurt them and it had only accelerated the downward spiral.

If this is not true, how would you explain that withheld 25% of Mar-2020 payment for all employees. It is the first month that India really saw the true colors of covid19 impact. They do not have slightest basic sense of leadership to realise that a cut in payout in the first month of covid story will make the future all gloomy and hopless. Think of the mental health of thse 1000+ employees who is already dealing with the trauma of virus. 

And, they upped the game when they did 80% paycut for April-20. Tthis is paycut, not cut in payout - because they said if things do not improve you will get company shares if you are still employee after Dec-2020. You know what it is if cannot know until for atleast another 9 months that if your money will be paid or not. And if you quit, you wont get it. Period.

On 11-May-2020, they sent almost 80% employees on leave without pay. They are not liable for severance pay since this is them sending people on 'leave'. Forget about basic allowance to sustain monthly expenses, they said you need to prove your work in the first 10 days of May to get even those first 10 days of pay. They had set up a corpus fund of INR 1 million to loan out a maximum of INR 10,000 one-time to deserving employees on first-come basis.

Naturally, when the employees who did not get money even for the food and rent (there were many personal stories shared inside where pawned as much gold as possible to ensure daily meals and make April-May month school fees for their kids, etc.), they took to Twitter in June looking up to Govt. of India for help. When everybody tagged the CEO in those posts, since CEO did not bother to give any response to cries for help in DMs. In less than a week, CEO deleted his twitter account.

Why I took pains to explain this in detail? 
Forget about the management understanding the realities of the market they are trying to serve, they have no clues about even their own employees. I did not see any public announcement of investment in this company since 2016. Still, if they continue to exist and you get a call for interview - look up in LinkedIn for CEO and all other head positions in this company. Stay away for your own if there are no new faces post 2020."
