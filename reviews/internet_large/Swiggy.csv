252,Swiggy,Positive Innovation,2021-09-26,5.0,Catalyst Tech,"This review is explicitly for Swiggy LABS, which is the Innovation-centric (""loonshot"") of the broader organization. I have been at Swiggy Labs for more than 2 years, and it has been a motivating, learning, and positive experience.

At Labs, we envisaged-researched-worked and prototyped on complex, unconventional, and radical ideas. 

With whole free hand given to come with out-of-the-box ideas, for an innovative thinker, there are no significant limits (given the ideas are relevant of course!) 

The culture is very open and motivating and special focus is given to individual growth. We did have regular workshops around mental models, radical candor, and ""Art of Thinking Clearly"" / thinking biases. 

The projects we worked on, also comprised of a wide horizontal range. For example, in tech - Drones, Self-Checkout system, Augmented Reality, Automatic food machines, OpenCV based object recognition and lots which span a wide range of tech. So we have to keep learning and be on toes. 

The leadership and organisation is also strong and simplified. The communication of ideas is clear and objective. Probably credit goes to the workshops as well. 

It has been a great experience. One gets to feel the pace of working in a start-up, though in a more organized manner. 

Recommended for all the techies/non-techies looking to expand their expertise not only in their domain but in overall conduct.

And, Swiggy pays well.","By definition as we work on radical ideas, some or many of them are bound to fail and get rejected. Fail fast (and learn) is one of the key themes through pods. So one shall keep an unbiased (without lot of emotions) approach towards the pitching and execution of an idea, and be ready for the possibility that it may or may not hit the scale, even though there would be great learning in the process."

2. Paid transport and accomodation facilities during project launch. 
3. Free food at office.
4. On time salary.
5. I would say good pay package but its not as the work hours are soul crushing demanding.","1. I was unfortunate to have a bad manager. 
2. There is not time boundation for work. Literally I used to work for 16hrs a day without any extra pay. 
3. Huge work pressure with little or no proper management.
4. Swiggy takes advantage of the employee in every possible way and then laid them off when as an employer it should support its employee. Swiggy did all the necessary project launch setup and configuration during the starting of Covid and after the project is streamlined they laid off all the employees who did the hard work. 
4. I faced Negative work environment at swiggy's Kolkata office. 
5. Zero job security. You might wake up as a area manager of Swiggy in the morning then at afternoon you got to know that you are no longer employed.
6. Zero work life balance. There is no life only work at swiggy."

2. You get to learn a lot of different technologies.
3. You learn to take ownership of a big scale project impacting millions of users.","1. There is no work life balance. Even if you are on leave, the manager will shamelessly point to others that they can call you since you are the only POC of a particular service.
2. No regard for employees mental health. Your manager is not your manager, he is a Swiggy's bouncer assigned to you to make sure you work like a donkey and nothing less.
3. You spend half your day in context switching. If a team has 8 people, they will literally be working on 5-7 projects at a time. Also, because of the overlap of ownership, you will be working on something and will immediately be called upon to look at a production issue, which by nature takes a higher priority than the work you had at hand. This ensures that you can get little to no software development done during office hours and have to burn the midnight oil. 
4. Heavily underemployed. For God's sake, if you don't have enough employees, don't take up so many projects."

2) Please increase the internet allowance as no broadband comes in for 400/-.
3) Was called WFO and due to high body temp, was not allowed and cab was not arranged to go back. Due to riots in my locality, no public transport was available to my location. And I was asked to return home and give back my login hours.It is very obvious that I will not be able to give the login hours as there was a cab delay, time consumption at the entrance and time consumed to return back home with no transport. And now this will impact my scores for the month. Nobody in the organization is bothered about the same and my scores continue to go down since last 3 months as exceptions are not provided for genuine issues. IDK wat to say, this has just been a nightmare for me since I have been moved to Food. Trying to do my best and hoping for some vison in the future."

893,Swiggy,Swiggy Labs - Nothing that would help your Tech career,2020-07-06,1.0,Software Engineer @ Swiggy Labs,"# You get to meet a lot of talented people from various domains
# Less working hours
# Could be a good opportunity only for freshers","My review here is to clarify the kind of work at SwiggyLabs and Labs only. Work at Swiggy is much different - You might have to go through other reviews for that.

Labs might seem lucrative during the hiring process( You're just shown the positive sides of working here ) and in the initial stages of your journey here. Only after 3-4 months after working here you'll understand the reality.

It was tough for me and everyone in Engg. to justify the work we've done here for the past 1+ years in the interviews for the next jobs. Do not want any other engineer to face the same.

And yes, almost every engineer started looking out after completion of their 1 year. The only reason you'd want to wait a year is to save yourself the joining bonus and to vest the esops.

# There isn't any quality work for a software engineer.

# Work is repetitive ( You keep creating similar products throughout your time here). Nothing new to learn on the job.

# All the work is PoCs and MVPs. So, If you are a software engineer with a decent experience and want to take your skills to the next level, This isn't the right place for you.

# There is no leadership in Tech. No one to guide the Tech Team. Hence, nothing new to learn.

# No recognition for your work in software because there is no Tech Lead or anyone who'd understand Tech in depth.

# You are forced to write bad code to role out the products soon. All the code you write here is *supposed to be scrappable* because you don't have to take it to scale.

# Mostly focussed on Hardware products.

# Too much time( more than a year ) wasted on figuring out the kind of work labs engineers are supposed to do. Still have no clarity on it

# Too much free time on your hands (more than 60% of your time during working hours).

TLDR; could be a good opportunity for freshers. Waste of time for anyone with more than 2 years of experience"

Note: Beware of all the short reviews. Most of them are fake posted to keep the rating high on glassdoor.","- Horrible work culture.
- People who have climbed up the ladder (or are at upper management) don't know anything about managing/leading a team which leads to frustration and chaos in the team. Probably the root of every problem in the company is that leaders are incompetent.
- Spineless mid-upper management. Everyone wants to be in the good books of the founder and therefore nobody questions anything.
- No work life balance or empathy. Employees are not looked at as humans but as mere resources from whom maximum value should be extracted at all costs
- Given Swiggy has already reached the size of a fully matured company, early/fast promotions is not an option. Moreover old-timers get undue advantage in promotion/appraisal cycles. So if you are joining new keep your expectations low
- Planning cycles are a mess. We take a month to plan for a quarter and 2 weeks after the planning we come up with a higher priority item and start reprioritising (Smart Swiggsters!). This happens every week until the next quarter prioritisation. Surprisingly leaders of the company come up with a new item every week.
- Because everyone is busy in getting as much credit as possible in the company, there is no semblance of collaboration. Imagine a bunch of people working together towards a common goal who almost never collaborate."

You get to learn things if you have got the zeal.
A few ATLs in the team are helpful.","8 reasons why you shouldn’t join Swiggy:

1. No leaves will be granted to you, although you have them in your bucket. If you're down with fever and ask for a day of rest, you gotta provide a medical certificate.
2. No work from home. Only managers and ATLs can use it. They will check into your social media accounts to figure out your whereabouts and once in the team - You do not have a life.
3. The management is lazy. They keep changing process and policy according to their wishes.
4. No proper appraisal, even if it is promised.
5. Even if you work hard, only people buttering the manager or making the special connection with the ‘managers’ will get  recognised. 
6. You cannot take break even if you want to go to the washroom. You need to take permission.
7. They will try to put you to PIP, just to reduce your salary.
8. They will give you a continuous inconvenient shift so that you suffer and your health deteriorates. Only people who invites managers or ATls for a get together  and share special bond will get good shift timings."

1075,Swiggy,"All is great, except the recruitment team",2019-12-21,4.0,Middle Management,Swiggy really is the best place to be right now if you want to build a career by focusing on the key things that matter in any good organisation - obsessing about delivering flawless customer experience and creating sustainable growth. It has attracted top talent across disciplines and the amount of freedom one gets to get things done is quite unprecedented. Your learning is only restricted by how much you want it to be.,"All said and done, the process of getting into Swiggy might want to make you pull your hair out. It would be an understatement to say that the HR team is sub-par and almost an embarrassment given the high bar of excellence we strive for, be it our operations, customer experience, product, branding, etc. There are endless stories of candidates waiting for upto 3-4 weeks to hear the final result. Mismanagement is seen at every step in the journey of interviewing to getting the final offer. HR is probably the only team which resorts to insipid platitudes about ""better than industry average"" when asked about their incompetence. Probably a result of hiring HR folks from the IT industry where, sadly,  employees are treated no better than sheep. Given the popular belief that HR is the one which defines culture in an organisation, Swiggy's HR is the unarguably the only team which thoroughly fails to uphold the Swiggy culture of getting things done."

1245,Swiggy,Great place to work,2019-06-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Awesome leadership team with good vision and execution skills. The leaders in the engineering and program teams stand out. The culture is bright and vibrant,"Some of the managers do not believe in work life balance and are always keeping meeting late at night, evenings etc. The company culture should encourage respect for all. Few leaders are outrightly rude"
1246,Swiggy,Mess in Devops,2019-06-06,2.0,Part of Devops Team,"Company is doing good and the tech team under the new director of engineering is heading in the right direction. His vision is great and his energy to get things done is enormous. 
The tech team is young and very friendly , at least at the mid senior level.","Unfortunately the Devops team is not under the umbrella of the new director of engineering and still resides under the CTO. The CTO is really really immature both tech wise and maturity wise. The initial Devops team was great and self sustaining but when a new VP joined in it went totally haywire. The CTO did nothing but add fuel to the fire. To understand the impact, imagine a team of 14 devops engineers working for an Unicorn startup in India , have all left and the company is trying desperately to hire new ones. There was a quick succession of top devops managers leaving the company too. 
Its impossible to talk maturely or rollout new ideas under them.

Perk wise the company is very much behind even compared to new startups like CureFit, Instamojo, etc. 
The quality of food is sub optimal and you need to pay for it.
There is a lot lot of politics at the VP and higher management level.  New ideas get stuck there and keeps going round and round as things dont move smoothly at the  higher level. So basically you join with the energy of working for a startup and getting new things done but face the politics of MNC's and feel frustrated. Also it comes to the individual , that at the end of the day they did not deliver."

My advice to people seeking job would be to find a reputed organization to build or to start a career.,"The interview will be conducted outside the office premises on a corridor  and induction will take place in a store room.  Forget about AC. There is not even proper ventilation for the people who attend the induction.  HR doesn't know to speak English and the funny part is they hire the candidates.  

Moreover,  the company doesn't provide cab facilities.  You can avail the cab facility only if login before 7am and logout after 12am(cab will be provided only one side on the above timings). Doesn't make sense. 

Nobody cares on your complaints.  All they need is there job to be done.

This company doesn't provide incentives. You will be forced to work on split shift where 4hrs twice with 3hours break in a day.  Totally you have to spare more than 12 hours. 

Infrastructure is so terrible and no proper or disciplined work culture. 

Voice process are still so awful,  where customer speaking to an agent can be clearly heard by other customer.  Agent are made to sit next to each other with no minimal space. 

Salary is some where close to par but you will be exhausted at end of each day. 

Tidy..  Yes,  the entire office is unclean.
  Most of the people on superior position doesn't have basic communication skills, Analytical skills, Reasoning skills.

- Even if you work hard for a year, if someone else picks up a shiny project, you will be looked down.
- Managers are not technically strong and are scared to ask if they do not know stuff, leading outspoken people take over.
- Always a rush to build things up, which in result is actually slowing things down.
- Somehow playing cs or doing drugs are considered cool and skills of an intelligent engineer :D"

No incentives other than the CTC and only if you manage to get a good hike.

Very bad annual hike in the range of 2-6%.

The HR team is very bad. They do nothing for the employee's benefit post hiring. Will change the rules to suit the company's requirements. It would not be too much saying they don't know the meaning of the ""HR""."

2) Hired excess of people in comparison to actual need of employees. Management can't understand that for moving fast quantity is not the key.

Bangalore and Hyderabad has seen good growth in revenue.","a) Lots of unprofessional behavior  like not paying joining bonus on time, not paying final settlement for employees who left even after followups . Changing the policies subtly to avoid paying variable salaries to the employees.
Making false promises while joining, changing appraisal times etc.
b) Tech management is immature and incapable of leading and even don't how to behave professional with senior employees . They made a lethal combination and royally screwed  the culture , employee moral and the environment. 
Unless you are a yes man to them and not available for their service 24/7 they will be behind you to screw your life and put in PIP in some pretext or the other and throw you out.
One is pulled up and royally screwed from time to time depending on their mood. 
They were instances when top tech guy suddenly calls up senior leads at 10 PM night and demands  explanation about some feature not going to production or some status when he/she has already given explanation before.
Also they don't allow people have breather and whenever they see things are stable for any component they will try to put some more burden and if one oppose you might be in PIP.
Tech is pretty ordinary and nothing great to learn."

1494,Swiggy,Employee Friendly Company,2016-08-07,5.0,Software Development Engineer II,"There has been a lot of reviews on Swiggy and its employee relationship. I am not sure how it is all across the company but from Technology team perspective, it does the right thing.

I love working at Swiggy and some of the best folks in the Industry. If you are passionate about either Technology or  Food Industry, Swiggy is the place to work for.

Company is performing rounds of One-on-One with the CEO and VP HR. Even after all these, some people feel they are not able to share the concern with right folks? If CEO and VP HR are not the right folks then who else could be the right folks in a company?

In August 2015, Swiggy did aggressive hiring and a bunch of folks without any passion and looking only for Money got into the company. When it is identified, the company have put them in PIP (with months of notice) or respective Appraisal bands and they ended up leaving and writing reviews on net. Once all these category people leave the company, Swiggy will turn to be one of the best places to work for.

To the Management - Folks, there are still a few such employees who are either bad in tech or non-passionate. It will be good if we can weed them off soon. It will improve the overall moral of the company.

Apart from all these, there has been a lot of reviews saying bad reviews are deleted on Glassdoor. Does glassdoor allows delete? Think before believing in those reviews.","Not everything is right with every Start-Up. Swiggy turned TWO years old and they have been successful in the struggling food industry. This was possible with reducing cost on every end including the Salary/Hike for employees and especially Tech.

I hope when the company achieves bigger and turns into undisputed leader, they will visit back into the Salaries and Hikes. Until then my passion for Tech and Food Industry will drive me."
1495,Swiggy,Great Learning Journey,2016-07-31,5.0,Human Resources,Extremely intelligent set of people you work with and a business which is moving at a rapid pace;makes you work at your best,Some processes are still evolving like any other start up which has grown large in quick time
1496,Swiggy,Worst Place to be in,2016-07-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The company has no pros quite frankly,"Really Bad Place to Work in. Entire Management hired by the founders are people who have never seen or experienced how things work on the field. CEO/Top Management believes they have full right to question anybody but you never get a reply from them if you question something. The culture that has been built up now is ""Yes Sir"" Culture. Either you agree with them or they sideline and fire you. The company has a system they call as ""PIP - Performance Improvement plan"", where they keep putting employees into that question them or don't agree with them and they end up getting fired due to poor performance. Offer Letters have changed 5-6 months after you start working and you can't do anything about it, Variable component has so many loop holes to ensure no one gets them, the hike that you get either gets completely converted to Variable (which again you won't get) or is promised from October and not April (again a promise that won't be fulfilled). There are hardly any employees left who are not looking for some other opportunity and would simply leave as soon as they get the chance. 3-4 people sitting in an AC office believe they know how everything should work and will blame you if any of their ideas fail. Finance & HR is completely screwed up. Asking for Finance to do a payment on time is considered as a serious offence and you might even be shouted upon if you expect Finance to make payments even after 2-3 weeks have passed from the deadline. To them employees are nothing more than slaves who they are paying for. There are a lot of people who don't do well with too much power and that's what the entire top management of this company has become (including the CEO). Hopeless place to stay in or join."

Has good talented team from premier institutes.,"Management is quite immatured , its like typical  startup founded by young guys in their 30s and run like a indian kirana shop... most of the top level employees are their friends and juniors from college. The entire tech scene is quite chaotic, no transparency and ethics in policies and decision making.
Roadmap is changed frequenly and decisions are made and changed on the fly everyday and if some one raises his/her voice, he/she will be asked to go. 
HR,appraisal and hiring policies are in place on paper only and they are not followed . People are being fired recklessly and asked to go now and then. Its like myway or highway."
1503,Swiggy,Well tuned Start-Up,2016-04-04,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Swiggy is a startup far apart from Other startups. The best thing at Swiggy is about stable business and its not just about customer acquisition (at any cost). 

Strong technical team:
The products and components built are so mature and has gone through a lot of thought process while designing and building them. When i joined this company, I was bit surprised to see such a mature platform in a short span.

Founders to employees, everyone is keen to solve the primary Motto - 'No Customer goes Hungry':
Just like any other startups, Swiggy has seen multiple Outages and its amazing to see folks jumping in to solve the problem. Swiggy has built a strong front-line folks and these guys jump in during all tough situations  and crack through. Not the least, the CTO himself is seen to be part of this front-line multiple times.

Aggressive towards market
Swiggy does not ride on offers but they grow by providing Quality service. 99% of the friends and relatives who had used the service were positive.

A great place to work, enjoy and learn things. If you compare this company with other best startups of 2015, definitely work-life balance is far better and a stable business roadmap.

CEO:
It was not surprising when Economic Times spoke about Swiggy's profitability plans (during Series-C funding). Definitely, the CEO has taken a stance to be more stable and is determined to run the business and not to dwindle like swiggy's competitors","Some pros turn cons at times.

Stable business:
Swiggy is not gonna payout like other startups. Increments and pay compensation are not going to be as aggressive. 

Tech Management:
The senior management (Leads, Manager, Director & CTO) has minimal people management experience and has lot to learn and perform. 

Non-tech teams Culture:
