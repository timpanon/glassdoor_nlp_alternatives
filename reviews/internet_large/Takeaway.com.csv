0,Takeaway.com,"What I've experienced at Takeaway as a rider in Brasov, Romania. Pros & Cons.",2022-02-23,3.0,Courier,"A place to stay/a shelter.
Warmth.
We actually have a tennis table at our hub and a tv which is really really great.
It's nice when you get a free order for that day if it was not possible to deliver it to the client, especially when you haven't eaten that day.
Good equipment. Jackets, waterproof pants, pull-over rubber shoes, hat.
Free coffee, free milk for coffee, free sugar for coffee, and drinks.
Hot & cold water.
Microwave which is really nice to warm up some food.
Bean bags are also really nice.
Shift adjustments.
Free bike wash at the hub. :D
Coordinators and director are doing their best to help push the company and upgrade.
They provide you with bikes and e-scooters and a car.
Free COVID protection masks at the hub, which is a big plus.
Lockers.
The Dispo team is super mega friendly.
We received a new years eve package with goodies which were really really nice :D and the coffee was absolutely wonderful.
Some bike parts can be changed at the hub on the spot.","The app is not very responsive and keeps having bugs. 
Delayed order notifications.
App delivery errors like delivering 1 order and then receiving another one with pickup in just 4 minutes, 4km's away.
Dispo chat keeps crashing/not working.
The employee is a little bit severe.
Lack of spare bike parts.
Bikes in poor conditions become stressful to work on.
Old batteries.
Outdated bikes compared to the same company in other countries or even cities in Romania.
Everybody tells you to rush rush rush, which is not very pleasant.
Bad bad bad health insurance. Overall a very bad health insurance experience.
Poor advertising & advertising investments in Brasov, Romania for Takeaway.
Unclickable links in Dispo chat.
They don't care if you need to go use the bathroom and you have orders to deliver, you must deliver the order, body health is neglected. 
If you have health issues you have this feeling like, why do you have health issues, in an aggressive way, like you shouldn't have, like it's your choice. As I said, health is not important/neglected/misunderstood.
Bikes that are sent to repairs come back with the same damages or only half repaired.
If you need some energy and need a little bit of food and you say that you're gonna grab along the way, the director says that you shouldn't be anywhere else than at your work and at your order, even if it's in your way and you can stop and buy something to eat fast.
Adverts listed inside the hub & from training programs are not as available within the app. The information doesn't correspond with the possibilities.
Poor information about bike functionalities and bike recognition, bike parts, etc.
I had to request the health insurance discounts catalog to have it given to me. Imagine that. I think nobody has it but me at the hub. This is wrong.
I had to make a battery/bike compatibility chart myself because nobody ever did it before so I volunteered, but I shouldn't have been through that process. I was told that I complain a lot and that I want things to be perfect when the bikes clearly had issues and were broken. So that was devastating for me and I consider that was abuse. I didn't get any salary bonus for doing that"
1,Takeaway.com,"Big Nooo, big psychos",2022-02-17,1.0,Product Analyst,"I have worked in the team for nearly a year. For a company of this age the product is absolutely not worthy. It baffles to see me how users are using takeaway app/website at all. The reason that there is not other competition, make them even ignorant of the customers. 

You will be working on stuff that you may have learned early stages of your carrier and you just stay there. The entire team is extremely unproductive and the are not contributing to anything. 

You constantly get OKR's from the management and does not reflect the reality of the problems faced by the squads/teams. There is no freedom of decision making. Any skilled persons will soon be forced to shut their mouth and play along, HR team will ensure that happening with massive support from leadership team. 

I tried to support the entire team (inspired by one skilled PM) despite my personal conditions (tragedy in the family) and I was forced to take up contract position, when I wanted to leave the company completely (due to family condition). They then forced me with new contract signatures. When I had enough and left the company, now they are harassing me in the name of devices & employment contract, coercing to play along. It seems to be the trick that was much discussed on their slack channel to retain the people. You will regularly see the customer support messages where IT team would sell the devices off market and harass the members. 

The HR team it seems targets racially disadvantaged people and they take advantage of skilled persons that are mainly hired from abroad. Dutch laws are extremely disadvantageous to skilled persons from non-EU countries who are dependent on the Sponser (dutch company). 

So be aware especially if you are getting hired from abroad. Make sure to be not sympathetic to them and I learned it hard. I am still to this day fighting their malicious practices months after I left the company and left the country. 

- If you do not want to work and just pass time you can join
- You can be the most knowledgeable person 
- You can spend the entire time learning new things if interested.","- IT teams are thieves and HR team are liars. 
- You can learn the height of harassment and mental torture from the team
- Teams are full of people who over promise and under deliver.
- If you are from non-EU country, be ready to be taken advantage of.
- Uncompetitive market positioning means no innovation needs
- No company culture what so ever. 
- you have teams that are completely isolated and act on their own"

23,Takeaway.com,"Fine, but archaic and uninspiring",2021-02-17,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"There has been investment in product and design, which suggests that there is some desire to move towards building a product that people might actually want to use, rather than simply being forced to do so due to market share.","There's a lack of clear vision and direction, I imagine few employees would be able to articulate exactly what the overarching strategy is rather than 'be big and deliver food'. 

Can feel chaotic and messy, with a mish-mash of lots of different companies being joined together. 

Lots of decisions being forced down from the top, with teams scrambling to understand the why behind these decisions. 

Feels very old fashioned in many ways, to the point that it can feel tone deaf. For instance there's a clear resistance from senior leadership around flexible working and the ability to work from home post-COVID. Given the stance many other companies have taken towards this issue, this attitude feels like a letdown."

International teams
Paid lunch",The company is extremely chaotic. No people managers. Toxic working culture in which everybody is so scared to make mistakes and get in trouble with higher management that there is a lot of micro-management. C-level has no idea what is going on in the teams and they're too busy/ too important to care. It's also not inclusive - mostly arrogant white men in charge.  Nice colleagues but because of the work pressure everybody is only looking at what they're doing and not able to support each other or say 'thank you'. Which is a shame because it would make our teams work more efficient and be happier in general. The salary and secondary benefits are not to compare with competitors in the IT industry and they have announced that working from home won't be possible.

99,Takeaway.com,Takeaway made some great improvements,2017-11-16,4.0,Senior SEA Specialist,"I started working at Takeaway.com 4 years ago. In that time the company grew more rapidly than it could handle and there were a lot of problems. However the work was fun and the colleagues were great, so I decided to stay anyway. 

Now 4 years later the company made some great improvements. The management and HR department have changed a lot and made huge improvements. The new office in Amsterdam is lovely and at a great location. 

The thing I like most about working at Takeaway is the level of independence that I have. The atmosphere is very informal and we have a great group of colleagues that I can laugh with all the time. ""Work hard, Play hard"" is definitely applicable to this company. 

Because the company is growing so fast there are a lot of cool projects that you can work on, which creates a lot of career opportunities as well. Within 4 years I have been promoted twice and the company even paid for my move to Amsterdam.","Innovation is not at the highest level due to lack of IT employees, so sometimes I feel limited in executing new ideas that I have, but I have seen this improving over the past year as well and I believe this will improve even more as soon as the IT department will be extended."

101,Takeaway.com,Could have been good...,2017-11-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Colleagues across all departments that continue to make efforts against all odds and pick up the slack that incompetent managers leave in their wake. It is truly amazing how much talent one comes across and can connect with despite the utter lack of interest in any such thing from top management.,"Where to begin and where to end? Chief culprit of the company's ever-deteriorating standing (yes, that is possible) is clearly top management, who seem to lack even the tiniest shred of empathy, interest, manners and (generally) humanity -  signs of clinical psychopathology are only easy to miss because they rarely descend from their ivory tower, and they are so far on the ""spectrum"" that inanimate objects become more responsive to any form of direct communication than they do. Scripted attempts at mingling with the ""workers"" are cringe-worthy. Sadly, these character traits are repeated in many people they themselves select, so that poor interpersonal skills slowly cascade down the (opaque) reporting structure and act as a poor example for anyone with any ambition to climb the ladder (not that such a thing is in any way fostered within the organization). They pull off the amazing feat of micromanaging while largely being absent; just as absent as a distinctive company culture (vision? mission? strategy? will anyone ever be able to explain these concepts to them?), but they either lack the intellect to wrap their minds around that or they simply can't be bothered because, quite frankly, they have stopped caring a long time ago if they ever did in the first place. Don't expect anything from HR btw, they've progressively come to see any non-managerial employee as a nuisance.  Most tragic of all: anyone who has been in the organization for too long seems to fall prey to the same type of aggressive indifference (another unique cultural phenomenon, one could argue) that senior management exhibits, supposedly because they think this is the type of behavior to emulate if you want to achieve any degree of success within the firm."

Racist and sexist office - often would hear inappropriate language. Always the full time salaried stuff - never the call centre staff, which were treated as second class workers. Ironic.

It felt degrading that they gave you work a monkey could do. All of the employees had great potentials. Everything I learned there came from my own research and use of programs. 

HR was terrible. They created a hateful environment. They would comment on every little detail and make problems out of nothing. We couldn't listen to music or take a coffee break. 

Management was terrible. They created fear. One of the managers would walk around the office as if he owned the place. He would make comments like: Please clean your mess (when  a package just arrived and was sitting next to your desk). Useless comments just to feed his own ego.

129,Takeaway.com,Camera's watch you the entire day!,2015-04-10,1.0,Marketing,The best part of the day is the lunch with some nice co-workers. The feeling that we are all together in this mess helps me going through it every day.,"A regime that HR calls an environment where you can speak up. “The door is always open” is what HR says. But suggestions are never taken serious. If you have gained knowledge or experience though a former job (or degree), leave it at the door. Whatever you bring up, it will be taken hostile. HR won’t renew your contract and that kills any form of atmosphere with all the departments. Nobody says what they think, so everybody is quiet all the time. It feels like working in a library. Departments are scared to share anything from figures to ideas or think outside of the box. Office parties are very, very awkward and are kept to a bare minimum. In the last year a dozen of the  colleagues left that where working in the marketing department alone. Thats a bit more then half of all the coworkers in that department. The desperate majority finds something else and if you have no such luck the company decides not renew your contract.  Either way, it is a relief for everybody to leave the company. 

Besides the the very bad atmosphere and fear there are a few other points you should think of before taking a job with takeaway.com: 

- There are camera's watching you what you!!! the entire day! I kid you not.

- The IT department loves to block sites on computers you need for work. 

- no extra benefits like discount on orders for employees, forget about free vouchers or something.

- There aren’t free drinks (besides tea and coffee) Lots of companies have that but a “hip” company like takeaway.com hasn’t.

- There is a nice gym next door, lots of companies offer their employees discounts for gym to boost health. It comes as no surprise that Takeaway isn’t such a company.

- There is also a very low illness ratio at takeaway. Not that people are that healthy, employees rather come in sick then take a sick day cause it goes on your record. The people with the most sick days are let go.

- If you are not dutch, don’t expect any extra’s to make you feel welcome. They barely speak english as it is and racist (or ignorant) remarks are easily made. Take a look at the “pasta ruud” videos on youtube to discover how ignorant takeaway.com is. Luckily those videos where made for the dutch demographic where something like “blackface” doesn’t exist in the consumers eye."
