300,Tata Communications,Worst Management !!,2021-11-08,3.0,Manager Marketing,The only pros of working here is stability which is then actually a double edged sword,"There is absolutely no vision with the leaders leading the teams here, no wonder people are leaving - in last 1 month, 10+ people have left the marketing team for good. And its not because of the company - its because of the way of working.

There is absolute chaos and no proper team management. People who head a team have no experience in delegating effectively. Delegation is just an email information and you are expected to work on miniscule information. This is not something with 1 functional head but a behaviour which is across every team.
There is no accountability and everything is either outsourced to an agency or a contract employee who comes at a cheaper price !

Salary is peanuts if you compare with other companies and your peers at the same level. There is a budget cut every year ! But Senior Management does get their crores per annum !

You are not recognised for your past experience but are asked to handle an outsourced agency which you know is payed a premium. There is a total waste of budget without any tangible outcomes - only to fake in internal presentations which are countless. Infact the only thing I learnt in this organisation is to how to fake a presentation by using blown up numbers using some fudged up internal practices which all the Team Heads endorse !!

Campus hires please stay away as you will be stuck here if you don't leave in 2 years !"

The policies(especially leave policy) are amended frequently as per their convenience and most of their policies are against the employees.
You have to be pet/puppet of seniors and say yes to each and every decision of theirs even if the decision is not in anyone's favor.
The seniors threaten you with dire consequences if you apply or ask for leave or resign.

The digital team is being managed so badly that all the work is outsoured to this one agency which has access to all our systems so for even sending a marketing email it requires a week ! The other teams like F1 , are just cash guzzlers and have no accountability on the business generated for sales.

Fine place to vegetate for a while but if you wanna make things happen, have fun working at what you love, or growing your career, look elsewhere. Most good people are already gone.

Means at higher levels DGM & above there are lots of workforce only managing not doing any actual work. while ground force has less head count resulting intense pressure on them.
- Wrong practice followed within team (one of the reason I left from organization) - Instead of giving chance to lower level workforce to come forward & take responsibility, they hire senior level workforce from outside at higher pay grades, resulting dis-satisfaction into employees. These are the employees who worked hard for the team, when there was no one left. 
- Also one thing I felt personally, there is racism within the company.

Requires lot of understanding of the business due to the complexity of business.
2254,Tata Communications,Ghost Ship,2015-06-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"One of the pros of working here is that you will learn a keen sense of what it is to run a technology division of a Tier 1 communications company, using the absolutely bare minimum of resources. I've often heard about how painfully under resourced the Russian space program used to be, but I'm rather certain that if we brought a Russian tech worker to this company, they would say things might be bad in Russia, but not this bad :)

Bottom line is this - where the main corporation may or may not be totally healthy (and I have no idea on the status of this) - my position was part of the organization which at this point is kind of like a ghost ship. Nearly all experts have left the company over the past few years, and they're not being replaced by new ones.

Where the lack of leadership is obviously a bad thing, for my case it did bring with it a bunch of flexibility in terms of vacation days, working from home, etc and I was definitely appreciative of that :)","Salaries are 20-30% under market average, in some cases it's even less than that. Where there aren't really many qualified leaders at the upper level, the managers of the various Technology teams try, but can only accomplish so much as they don't really have the backing and full support of the mother ship."

CEO of the company and team under its direct report is working really hard to turn around things.","Although moved to agile still water fall model is followed, lack of driving forces.

Where most of the companies are moving away from Bell Curve, TCL has made more stringent in last two years, all the teams can sense the demotivation and frustration of the all the teams. Only top 10% are happy which are best in class for that particular year, rest all highly unsatisfied only because they never know next year they could in bottom performer, the reason is you are not rated for how/what you worked for, but how much important you are for next year. 
Manager Effectiveness Feedback is not continued.
Team are now less focused on work and more on job security due to which politics has gone to peek level

2262,Tata Communications,Worst Experience,2015-06-06,1.0,Manager Business Excellence,"1.Due to TATA's name, people generally get attracted to this company. (me too) & joined.
2.Work from home is allowed. The attendance and leave system is 100% left to reporting manager. ( It has goods and bads too).
3.The salary deductions is far lesser than other companies.So, your take home salary increased.
4.The Sodexho coupon amount is kept outside of CTC. It is really appreciable.
5.You get salary on time. If you are absent and your reporting mgr & leadership is satisfied with your boot licking, you can have 365 days vacation with your family with no pay cuts. :)","1.Since, Attendance/Leave system is 100% left to manager, he/she can play with your fate/life. He starts treating you like a slave to him. Even if you take it to higher level leadership, he will smile and say, you have to obey your reporting mgr, it is the punishment to you (including abuses and ill treatments).The reporting mgr unfortunately comes from bad mindset, he will screw your personal life too. TATA allows and gives a free hand to them.
2.The Pro VSNL guys/ladies never like TATA mgmt appointed people however, whichever higher qualifications and expertise the guy/girl has.
3.They have IJP (internal job post) only for eye-wash and is to showcase to the world that they are so friendly. Internally, it all happens not based on merits, but with boot licking and personal relationship only it works. You have to be ready to do their personal favours and compromise yourself to max to get POST and POSITIONS (promotions).
4.Every 8 months, new organization restructure happens and the accountable higher rank V.P;s were left with lots of power to bring any changes into the entity without any governance. Low quality and lower rank attitude guys are all brought inside as V.P, with no subject knowledge. Due to this , often re-shuffle to enhance qos, eventually fails, as Pro vsnl guys never engage with them, or allow them to work.
5.When VSNL appointed employees were touched for layoff, your management burned fingers and hands, then, you pulled back with different strategy of accumulating more ppl., leaving all laid off  employees on the street."

Not the best in the business but a challenger"
2437,Tata Communications,"Great CEO, mediocre pay, zero process",2012-05-25,2.0,Director,"Tata Communications has some great strengths - 

1. The CEO, Vinod Kumar is a great leader and someone who instills confidence. The company is still loss making (in May 2012) and had just turned EBITDA positive, but the employees are overall hopeful under his leadership that the company will turn the corner before the shareholders lose patience.

2. The Tata group culture is evident with its high standard of ethics and values, though this is clearly stronger in India than in other countries.

3. The company has a great asset base - its cable infrastructure, its infrastructure base in India, its reputation within the service provider community

4. It has some great people, who are largely non-political and whom you feel good about working with.","The company is struggling with some significant downside risks:

1. The level below the CEO - the top 30 managers of the company (called the G30) are a diverse bunch of people with varying levels of competence, politics and values. There are some solid people who deliver upon what the company was known for and there are some newcomers hired in the last 2 years who have brought in a culture of cutting corners and expediency. This layer is very political, with lots of infighting and good skill in positioning themselves, rather than doing good work. 

2. The lack of process is plain to see for anyone. Where there is some process, it seems to have been put in by some evil bumbling bureaucrat - so onerous and misguided, that people mostly look for ways to avoid it. In recent years several senior people have been hired to bring in process rigour, but the lack of process has prevailed - and it seems to be a graveyard for those senior 'business excellence' executives.

3. The salaries are mediocre and pay scales are pegged to the 50th percentile. This may work in India, where the Tata brand is strong and people buy into that as a compensation to lower salaries, but internationally it means that Tata Communications attracts some rather mediocre talent who cling onto the company for dear life"
