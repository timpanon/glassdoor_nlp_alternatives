Strong client retention and satisfaction which makes renewals easier 
Nice new office 
Merger with BrightTalk yielding results 
Strong benefits, lots of social outings, fun colleagues",Basic package perhaps below industry average.
1,TechTarget,Poor pay and low morale,2022-03-31,2.0,Marketing Manager,"The job and work culture are incredibly laid back. It's not a good environment for learning about marketing or advancing your career, but it's good if you're looking for something relatively pressure and stress-free.","The pay is very low. Raises come annually, but never at a high enough rate to get you close to market value. It's not a very good environment for learning because the company culture is as a whole very laid back. A good portion of upper management has been at the company since its start in the early 2000s, so the company overall lacks the fast-paced feel you might imagine at the tech companies TechTarget serves."
2,TechTarget,"Nice company with good vibes, but not so generous with salary",2022-03-24,5.0,Marketing Associate,"-good benefit
-comprehensive training
-upscale modern office
-perfect for fresh grad
-awesome leadership","-low salary, $50k/ year, healthcare, company will match 50% with your 401k for up to 3k per year. We are talking about 26k per month after tax, If u have mortgage, then this place is not for you."
3,TechTarget,"Overall great experience, low pay forced me out",2022-03-18,4.0,Marketing Associate,"Great company overall, the product is very useful and exciting. Unlimited PTO and so many Holidays it was hard to keep count. The team was very supportive and had a great impact on my professional growth!","The pay is VERY low compared to industry average, I think this is a great company for recent college graduates to get started at. New internal campaign request roll out is a little disorganized which makes things difficult to stay on top of."
4,TechTarget,Good Place to Learn and Be Proactive,2022-03-14,4.0,Senior Data Analyst,"Lots of opportunity to explore different data sources and business areas, especially if you are interested in project management, specifically direct communication with stakeholders and developers; great paid holiday and paid time off benefits; friendly and collaborative atmosphere.",Shared goal setting across teams and departments could use improvement; opportunities for career advancement were limited.

6,TechTarget,An exciting time to be at TechTarget!,2022-02-25,5.0,Senior Sales Enablement Manager,"-TechTarget is seeing a lot of growth right now, which gives the business (and the employees at the business) a lot of opportunities to maximize their potential.
-Supportive culture that invests in the mental health of their employees (recently introduced more company holidays)
-Flexibility and understanding in different people's schedules","-Maybe not the right fit for someone that doesn't like a fast paced environment, but for me fast paced means I get to see immediate gratification for my efforts"
7,TechTarget,Great spot for young marketers,2022-02-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you want to go into marketing or are already in marketing, it's a great company because it sells marketing services/data so almost every department has a marketing element to it. Product marketing, customer success teams that advice clients on digital marketing best practices, sales enablement/field marketing, market research, corporate marketing, audience recruitment, etc. These are all different and sizable departments so if you don't like the first job you're in, there's probably something else you would like and if you perform well, inter-department transfers/promotions are common. Great place to learn the ropes and work with an entire company that feels passionately about online marketing.",The experience can vary depending on the department although most are good.
8,TechTarget,Bad place to work,2022-02-23,1.0,Marketing Ops,"Unlimited PTO, but they guilt you if you take it so you just have to be strong and set boundaries.","Low pay, hard expectations, bad management"

13,TechTarget,"Good flexibility, terrible pay",2022-02-09,2.0,News Writer,"Even before the current work from home environment, TechTarget let its employees work a few days a week in the office and a few days at home. The company doesn't really offer set vacation days, which is a pro and a con. Depending on your manager, this can be a benefit -- your manager might let you take off a couple of weeks of vacation time. But, the opposite is true, also.","The pay is terrible. Writers and editors receive no bonuses and receive a small, maybe about $1,000, raise per year, and that's if you receive a great yearly review. Even with years of writing experience, I made less than $50,000 as a news writer there, and only slightly more as an editor. Keep in mind that CEO Michael Cotoia makes about $6 million a year in pay/stocks. There isn't a lot of room for writers and editors to move up in the company."

18,TechTarget,"Good stepping stone, not a permanent option",2021-12-27,2.0,Editorial,"Good work life balance, that’s about it","Pay was almost unlivable, work was redundant, company was really stingy with compensation. 

During the first year of the pandemic, raises were halted, despite the company bringing in more revenue than the year before which really irked me.

Besides that, company culture was rather disengaging and I’d say it’s the least ambitious company I’ve worked at"
19,TechTarget,Good,2021-12-11,5.0,EMEA ACCOUNT MANAGER,"Good product, fast paced environment",Benefits package not as extensive as competitors
20,TechTarget,Behind the times,2021-12-02,3.0,Engineer,"Flexible work location - home/office/beach
Ok health benefits","- Overworked. Rush rush rush. no time for personal growth. Management not engaged in career opportunities unless it meets business demands.
- No bonuses
- 401k plan is ok/weak for match
- No defined time-off - take as you need but that is a trick and you feel guilty taking any real time off. A day here or there does not cut it.
- No stock options
- Ok dept. moral.
- I can't remember the last time an all department meeting was held to talk about future initiatives / past successes. You feel like you are on a hamster wheel"

-Very high turn over.
-You feel like just another number here, management would rather hire someone with no experience that will do the job for little to no money than pay anyone what they are worth."

29,TechTarget,"Criminally low pay, high turnover",2021-09-23,1.0,Site Editor,"- Most of the people on the ground are kind, thoughtful, and caring.
- The work/life balance is good.
- Management can be good if you have the right person. 
- Its a good, easy, job out of college.","- Low pay. 32-37k/year entry pay. You can make more at Mcdonald's, truly. 
- No annual raises during COVID, you have to beg for raises and fight for a cost of living raise.
- Benefits are not great. Healthcare options are limited and very pricey per month. No other benefits. 
- Out of the city limits, and no transportation reimbursement. 
- The CEO truly can't be bothered by editorial. If you are going into sales, maybe this is a better fit. If you are a writer/editor: stay away.
- Your job/department can change overnight and they won't ask.
- No communication between higher/lower management. Eliminating department, sites, reorganizing the entire team literally overnight. 
- Tout diversity, but do not have a diverse staff. Especially in higher management. 
- Just stay away. It's not worth it."
30,TechTarget,Software Engineering Lead,2021-09-12,5.0,Senior Software Engineering Lead,"Absolutely wonderful company. Very professional and knowledgeable team mates, project managers & architect. No micro management and work from home policy. Great Work/Life Balance.",No Bonus or stock options to employees. Very Less salary as compared with other companies.
31,TechTarget,Recruits kids from college who don't know better. TOXIC PLACE.,2021-09-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Nice people who aren't at the top. You learn a lot about a variety of tech. Publishers deserve more credit. Everyone who supports sales deserves more money for their hard work.,False narrative of promising future in sales. As soon as you think of leaving for a better opportunity you are shunned and harrassed. Most of the top execs here have NEVER worked at another company in their life which translates to a frat mentality as being the only and best place to be. Extremely toxic for women and anyone in a minority. They make you think they invest in you by giving you a $10K bump in salary after a year or two while still being paid WELL below competitive rate. The word toxic was created because of this company.
32,TechTarget,Low pay; can be good work-life balance and a nice place to work,2021-09-03,3.0,Editor,"-A LOT of really nice people, can't underscore this enough.
-If you are in the right group and have the right manager, there can be good work-life balance, but as with most things about the company, it all depends on where you land.
-At the broadest level, leadership has done a really great job handling the pandemic, for example, with compassionate messaging and honoring remote work for anyone who doesn't feel comfortable coming back in.
-It's a great place for newer workers to get a wide range of experience. In most groups, you'll be able to take on as much as you can handle and they are more inclined to promote younger workers.","-The pay is terrible but that seems to be a strategic decision and is not likely to change. (Just look at all the reviews here calling out the pay.)
-Any of the good things are subject to being in the right group and having the right manager (and that's doubly true now with most people working from home). If you're not in a good experience, for whatever reason, there's no real recourse that won't end up making it worse for you.
-Turnover has always been extremely high and is even more so now, which has a lot of repercussions. 
-The experience there can largely be summed up by ""They care a LOT about SOME people (growth, development, promotions, praise) and not much about a lot of people."" And again, if you're not in the former group, you'll be fighting an uphill battle. Sortings of people are made early on and tend to stick and they're really big on trying to lump together people by role, even though there's a lot of variation of previous and even current experience.
-They're trying to be more focused on things like diversity and inclusion and other important issues of today, but it's not inherent to the culture or mission so people looking for that will be disappointed. (On the other hand, there's potentially room to help.)
-People get moved around a lot and/or have their jobs change, often without their input. Again, this can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending. This can be really good (new great role, new great team) or it can be not so good (role you're not interested in the subject or you land with a manager who doesn't value you, or worse, doesn't like you). 
-For most people, this will be a stop rather than a long-term situation for all the cons stated, but your nice, smart coworkers can make that time pleasant."
33,TechTarget,General,2021-08-27,4.0,Operations Associate,"-Small close-knit team despite the company being large. 
- Management is very approachable and work with you to meet your career aspirations.
-",- Ceiling after a few promotions unless someone leaves.
34,TechTarget,Not good,2021-07-27,1.0,Account Executive,All the pros here are because leadership asked employees to bump their reviews up. Free bagels.,Office politics. Low pay (as you can see in every review). Slime immoral sales tactics. No exposure to anyone that has worked elsewhere. Only care about revenue and not customers. Customers have poor past experiences. Zero transparency.
35,TechTarget,An OK place to work,2021-07-25,3.0,Editor,We have been allowed to work from home throughout the pandemic.,It sometimes feels like the higher-ups don't care about us.

38,TechTarget,Tech Target,2021-06-30,4.0,Reporting Specialist,"Great Work / Life balance, great leadership",It can be challenging to make vertical moves
39,TechTarget,"Great work/life balance, poor pay",2021-06-24,4.0,Editor,"Managers, editors, and teammates are collaborative, flexible, willing to help. Great attitudes all around. Fantastic work/life balance -- no clock watchers or micromanagers, and ""unlimited"" time off within reason. Days are flexible. Pre-COVID, opportunity to work from home regularly. No layoffs during COVID. Many roles available within departments to find what fits you best, lots of opportunities to advance and/or transfer throughout the company. 

Many culture groups to join where you can meet and talk with employees from different departments on a variety of topics (i.e. Women in Business, Active Lifestyles, Diversity and Inclusion, TT Gives Back, etc.)","Pay is poor. I negotiated a higher salary during my hiring, only to find out two months later that my salary is now the company standard for entry level new hires. While I have had many promotions and a few raises over the last 4 years, it still does not meet industry standards or even keep up with inflation. 

While management is friendly and flexible, they can be close minded to new ideas unless it's coming from higher up or from the sales/marketing department. 

Sales is King at TechTarget and editorial/content creation is not treated with the same respect or given the same monetary compensation -- in salary but also in parties, celebrations, recognition, etc.

Diversity is lacking, as well. There is a strong female presence, and many female leaders, but CEO and President are male. There are fewer than 10 BIPOC in the main office of about 500 people. It does seem like management knows this, though, and this year has initiated research into their recruiting practices and surveying employees on diversity and inclusion. A D&I group was started and meets monthly, and a Diversity newsletter is sent out regularly that educates and prompts employee engagement."

47,TechTarget,Stay away and be careful,2021-04-23,1.0,Account Executive,Bagel Wednesday and coffee is free,"You get fat from bagel Wednesday. Seriously though if you are thinking about starting a sales job, the SDR leadership is great but you then get promoted to work under immoral use car salesman. They don’t care about their customers, only promote from within, love office politics, and hire young people because they are cheap and try and brain wash them into staying forever. The CRO will try and intimidate you and you can’t trust him. They made a excel spreadsheet of a career path to check the box then never follow it. Rocket science is easier than figuring out how you get paid. Almost every customer you talk to will say they aren’t a fan because they got burned on a past program. Brutal sales cycle. Hard to believe in what you sell because it has to be the perfect fit with a company and rarely is. Stuck in their ways. Only place management has worked is this company. Don’t get sucked into this wormhole of career suicide."

50,TechTarget,"Good Place to Work, But Don't Expect Culture in Remote Setting",2021-04-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company made a smooth and seamless transition to all remote workwise, not impacting any regular functions of most jobs. There are some real product evangelists at the company who are great resources. Lots of career possibilities for lateral moves if you seek them out.","The company cultural has fallen apart in the remote environment. Culture is something that is highly talked up by the company on the website and in the interview process, but it has gone completely out the door. It's a clock-in clock-out type of environment now. 
Training is focused strictly on TechTarget products / selling the product -- no industry type of trainings to help broaden knowledge of marketing or technologies. While this helps for working directly with the main product (Priority Engine), it creates a knowledge bubble and noticeable gap when working with customers.
Company was able to make two big acquisitions in 2020 but an indefinite pause on raises."

Office was recently renovated/updated and is super nice now - open floor concept with lots of common space available if you'd like to get away from your desk for a bit. Good amenities, too - coffee, fruit, snacks, Fooda, etc. It has been a great experience so far and I have learned a lot.",Office is outside of the city. Pay could be better.

75,TechTarget,Positive Experience,2020-10-05,5.0,Product Manager,"My positive experience at TechTarget started with the leadership at the company. Mike Cotoia (the CEO) leads by example and treats every single employee with the utmost respect. TechTarget also gives their employees the opportunity to have numerous experiences that you might not get elsewhere, even if those experiences fall outside of your job title. There are many experiences I was able to have in a short time that prepared me for the next step in my career. Lastly, the environment at TechTarget is one that I enjoyed as well. There are a lot of good people that work at the company, which contributes to the positive working environment.","I think TechTarget could benefit from having more competitive compensation/benefits packages. Whether that is a bonus structure or offering an equity component to packages for not only director-level and up, I think that would help continue to attract high-level talent to the company, as those can be key motivating components."

Over the course of two decades, I helped the business expand internationally, lived in four different countries and now look after an entire region. I stay not only because of the growth opportunities so many of us have been afforded but also because TechTarget is a family. I love working alongside people I respect and who I know care about me.","I'm not sure it's a negative, but the company does set a high bar and expect employees to exceed it. Additionally, we receive a lot of autonomy and not everyone thrives in that type of environment."
78,TechTarget,Great work/life balance,2020-08-24,3.0,Editor,"- Work/life balance is incredible here. Every one of my managers has been flexible and understanding when it comes to taking time off, needing to leave early, etc. They know that your job isn't your entire life and they respect that.
- With many roles, you can choose your own schedule as long as it mostly aligns with your coworkers' work hours
- Lots of trainings where editors are able to develop valuable skills around SEO
- Relatively stable company - no one was laid off during the pandemic
- If you get your job done, you will be rewarded with promotions/raises
- Not much of a benefit now with COVID-19, but when people were in the office, employees get free bagels on Wednesdays, free coffees/sodas. Open office environment where there are multiple areas to get some work done","- Pay is far below the industry average. This is the biggest disadvantage to working at TT, in my opinion
- Lack of diversity, although management claims to be working on it
- Processes change constantly, which creates confusion
- High turnover rate, especially among less senior employees
- Editorial staff isn't valued as much as sales. The sales team has annual company parties that are paid for by the company dime; editorial gets a holiday potluck where we need to bring our own food."

80,TechTarget,"Great Company, Great Culture, Exciting Work",2020-07-13,5.0,Analyst,"I've worked at TechTarget for around 4 years and have had 2 different roles. 
There is a lot of opportunity to learn and grow at TechTarget and I've found that if you're willing to put yourself out there, good things will come.
Senior management are open and forthcoming especially in recent times with COVID-19 and BLM issues.
The work is interesting and you can be a real part of the business contributing towards success and this is recognised in many ways from awards to shout outs to hi-fives (pre-COVID) from the CEO.
TechTarget has made a real effort to support employees by having different initiatives, improving holiday hours and work from home policies.

Having a long-term medical condition, I've found the company to be incredibly supportive of me and have incredible trust in me which, for me, is fundamental.

The people are great. 11/10","The company is pivoting into a more data driven company which means there are a lot of changes and this can be confusing.
Office is a bit cramped."
81,TechTarget,"Toxic environment, low pay",2020-07-08,1.0,Marketing Manager,WFH policy (if your manager agrees),"Worst place I have worked for in my life, I have been looking for another job but didn't manage to find one because of covid (probably like the rest of my colleagues). In the past year and a half at least 20 people left (and the London office has around 90 employees).
The positive reviews that you find on here are completely fake. Don't risk to come here and waste precious time. 
Toxic environment: when you join nobody speaks to you apart from your team or manager. Sales are rude and treat all other teams like trash. CEO visits and speaks to sales only. T
Awful office, non existent socials
Office management are bullying employees. 
Incredibly low pay . No benefits and No health insurance.
No career opportunities."

83,TechTarget,The Honest Truth,2020-06-15,1.0,Field Account Executive,"Building perks; parking, coffee, fruit, gym. The sales development team run by Brian Dowling is a good starting point for a young sales professional... any level above that is a nightmare.","I can't say enough about how poorly run this company is, from the top all the way to the bottom. The management team has stayed exactly the same since the company started. There is zero diversity. There is zero room for growth. There is zero transparency. There is zero honesty. The compensation is severely lower than the industry average. And not only is the compensation low, they will change your compensation plan, without your permission, and notify you months after the fact. If there's one thing TechTarget is good at, it's taking advantage of their younger employees who are eager to land a job out of college. The bizarre politics inside of this company and the scare tactics used by the management team to intimidate and threaten their employees has gone on for far too long. I'm writing this review to warn anybody that is considering a sales job to pause, and honestly ask yourself if this is the kind of company you want to work for."
84,TechTarget,Don't work here if you want to be paid fairly.,2020-06-05,2.0,Editor,The people are incredible and you'll meet people who will become friends. The people are the only reason this review isn't just one star.,"Editors are paid significantly less than the national average and not nearly enough to be able to live. This is all while the CEO's salary has increased over 80% annually and he forgoes giving employees raises amid COVID-19 rather than taking a pay cut himself despite making 500% more than the average employee. Also, I can could on one hand the number of BIPOC employees at this company. That's unacceptable. Do better."
85,TechTarget,AWFUL company for anyone not in Sales,2020-04-10,1.0,Marketing,Free parking & work/life balance,"TechTarget is a joke. A quick scroll-through of 5-star reviews here will reveal they're mostly from the sales organization. The pay and benefits for anyone else – marketers, editorial, etc. – is nothing short of insulting – so much so, that when I was in the final stages of the interview for my current job, HR could not believe how poorly I was being paid. I learned more in the first three weeks of my current job than I did at TechTarget in 4 years. 

They provide employees with no marketable skills whatsoever. In a way, it's pretty clever, because it keeps you comfortable and prevents you from applying for jobs at other companies out of fear that you'll reveal how little real-world marketing knowledge you actually have. My workload here consisted purely of making powerpoint slides, reading articles on our websites, and sending them to clients for review. I had a maximum of 2 meetings per week and far too much free time. I had a manager who used our 1:1s strictly to gossip about other employees. There is zero room for growth. The highest level you can reach is Senior Manager – after that, you have to wait until somebody quits. NOT ONCE did I have a formal performance review. Is that even legal? I don't know.

There's a reason people who stay here for years and years are called ""lifers"" – and you don't want to be one. The hostility employees are met with when they give their two weeks notice is unconscionable and to be honest, downright toxic. If you're already here, get out while you can. And if you're thinking about applying, don't."
86,TechTarget,Great place to work!,2020-03-02,5.0,Sales Development Representative,Fun environment that is perfect for sales. It is a great atmosphere to come to everyday and grow.,A long ride on the T from the City and it's extremely unreliable.
87,TechTarget,Growing company - great to develop B2B marketing skills,2020-02-06,4.0,Marketing Specialist,"- The people: most of the persons who have worked at TT would  praise the friendly environment in the London office
- Flexible work environment 
- Marketing wise - great place to work if you don't like to do the same thing on a daily basis, a lot to explore, test, develop. Management will be quite supporting when it comes to new idea and like the 'think out of the box' attitude.  
- Growing company which offer internal promotion opportunity",- The package is not the most competitive of the market - but they're improving it as the company is growing and it's getting better.

89,TechTarget,Don't do it.,2020-01-29,1.0,Associate,The option to work from home.,"Where do I start. The pay is awful. They don't care about how much experience you have and they just throw out salary numbers based on who knows what. You feel and get treated like an intern the entire time. They try to target recent grads and spruce up the job you are applying for and make it sound like it is something actually interesting and where you are going to learn so much. WRONG. If I didn't leave this company, there would have been no way I was going to be able to even market myself for a new job. You don't learn any new skills that can actually help you in the future, and if you're learning something new, it is only really something you can use to be associated with TechTarget. I learned more in an actual internship than I did at this full time job. You sit there waiting and waiting for work to be given to you and when you actually get work, 2 or 3 hours already into the work day, it is just busy work. This company has such a high turnover rate and I understand why. A very very toxic enviroment where upper management treats you poorly, talks about you behind your back, and even employees with the same title as you talk a lot and cause unneccesary drama like we are in high school. Employees you work with will take advantage of brand new employees and give them their OWN work that they are just too lazy to do. Mind you, it is easy work and they have time to do it themselves. Overall, if you want to work for an actual marketing company, learn things that will be beneficial to you in the long run, and put your degree that you got to use - I suggest not working here."

At the intersection of technology and marketing it's a really fun and interesting environment.  The culture is to promote from within and thus so many of the new hires are folks starting their careers so the energy and culture really benefits from that.  Also while I'm in managment throughout my career here upper management always had an open door listening and acting on ideas and enabling employees problem solve and act on their innovations.",Pace can be really fast.

The leadership team is unmatched and can confidently say the entire executive and leadership team would take the time to get to know you and understand your efforts and challenges.  It would not be uncommon for me to ask my CEO or SVP of Sales to join a call or help out in a sales scenario. We have a strong culture and community which is important to me - I'm surrounded by people who are driven and like-minded and they make working fun. I also have always felt that my hard work doesn't go unnoticed and I am always recognized and rewarded for the work that I  put in. I have had the pleasure of working among a talented and strong sales force which I am always learning from. Our products are also best in class and I feel confident in selling the value and telling the story each day, and we are ALWAYS innovating and improving so I feel good about the future and months ahead.","I work in our HQ in Newton, and I live downtown  but the reverse commute and free parking makes it easy."

They value a positive work environment where people can go to learn and grow, and understand that employees need good work/life balance to be productive employees. The sales organization specifically is one of the most female dominate I have seen, and is competitive in a positive and growth minded way. The company has bee growing over the last few years and is a leader in the purchase intent market, making it a great time to get on board with lots of potential opportunity. It is not uncommon for people to leave TT to just come back a few years later after they have experienced that other work environments don’t stack up.","There is a tight company culture so joining from an outside organization can we difficult if you are not flexible.

Attitude is everything and it shows by the employees in the sales department at TechTarget.","Nothing negative comes to mind since I have been working here. Occasionally you will get an individual that doesn't care and it may bring down the sales teams mentality, but they don't stay at TechTarget for long simply because they don't want to put in the effort for the hard work to pay off."

TechTarget has been a pioneer in helping B2B Tech marketing and sales professionals find and close more deals.  As a seller, my job is so much easier because the product is far superior than many other options in the market.  The continued product innovation is one of the reasons I've been at the company for 12+ years, but the thing that I love most is the people I work with.  My colleagues have become some of my best friends and I consider them to be family.  Lastly, with hard work and dedication, TechTarget has given me the opportunity to progress my career far beyond what I ever imagined it could be.

Very little in the way of training; you are thrown into the deep end and expected to teach yourself, which is typical of entry-level sales roles but still seems counter-intuitive to me especially considering that many sales hires do not come from tech backgrounds. The structure and mechanisms of the company are invisible to lower-level employees (also probably typical of this sort of role) and I often feel as though I'm stumbling around in the dark.

There's some great talent there with serious news reporting chops. TechTarget is a software company, not a media company, and that is hard fact for some folks in editorial to swallow. The readers who view the content help fuel the data product that TechTarget sells. 
I thought the company's software product was innovative and smart, so I'd suggest anyone coming on board get familiar with what it does. The editorial department was overly process-heavy during my time there, although the VP of content was working to address that issue.
As for company culture, the ability to work from home when you need to is a strong draw, especially for people with young families or aging parents.","The pay is above what you'd make in the newspaper industry as a writer or editor, but overall in the content development industry, I'd say TechTarget's salaries are $10,000 to $20,000 below what you could make elsewhere doing similar work."

That tells you a lot about the company and culture.  TechTarget is a company that gives employees a lot of responsibility, and when they handle it well, it gives them even more.   The people who do well here tend to enjoy being given autonomy, are collaborative and not afraid to express their opinions, and have a great work ethic.

TechTarget truly  invests and cares about your professional and personal growth. My managers have turned into supportive mentors and coworkers into great friends. The workplace itself is one that fosters innovation, collaboration, work/life balance and some great perks such as cold brew on tap, daily delivery of fresh fruit, sales incentives and more.","The work is tough &  challenging, it takes a lot of time management skills and prioritization/organization of resources, both internally and externally. This isn't necessarily  a con- nobody ever said work was easy. It keeps me on my toes, is something new and different every single day and there are people to encourage and support you along the way.

Central office. Nearby food vendors so good choice for lunch.,"The job involves posing as a journalist and getting employees to divulge sensitive information about their internal projects which Tech Target then sell and make a handsome profit from. 

Bullying, secret meetings discussing other colleagues in derogatory manner. Our job is actually illegal. 


Aggressive comments and overbearing management style. I would go home in tears regularly and many other members of the team left because they felt bullied. Depressing atmosphere. Living in a perpetual state of fear. Myself and a few friends that worked together have had counselling after our experience there."

TechTarget is the most forward thinking organisation I have ever worked for and is leaps and bounds above any other B2B tech Publisher I have worked for, and I've worked for a few,

I cant even explain in words how much I have learnt at TechTarget about marketing best practices and the way in which B2B Technology is purchased. They really know their stuff and are constantly adapting to an evolving market.

At TechTarget you are surrounded by some of the smartest people in the industry and they are all accessible to ask questions to.

I would highly recommend TechTarget as a place to further you career!",None that come to mind

Within those 13 years, I have held a number of different sales focused roles and have grown both professionally and personally from each.  This company is constantly innovating – both with the products we sell and the perks offered to  employees.  TechTarget prides itself on offering a great work/ life balance.  Especially now that I am a mother, I appreciate this balance even more. The flexibility that I have working for TechTarget is something that simply cannot be found in other companies.","This company is constantly changing and adapting (as I mentioned, even in my tenure at TechTarget I have held 3 different sales roles mentioned above) so if you're someone who doesn't adapt well to change this could be a challenging organization to work in."
140,TechTarget,Great company to be apart of,2018-04-13,5.0,Account Executive,"They do everything possible to ensure the success and happiness of you as an employee. When I wasn't positive sales was the right position for me, they created a new role specific to my specialties so that I could explore a different career path. After a year of trying something different, it became very evident I was meant to be a sales person and again, they welcomed me back sales with open arms! 

From a sales perspective, while the quota was aggressive it was achievable and they made sure we had the right resources to be successful within our respective territories. It's very much a team dynamic internally and no matter what you could easily ask for help from anyone within the organization.

My experience here for 4+ years has been nothing but positive. The company continues to grow in a tremendous way and anyone would be lucky to be a part TechTarget. The executives (including the CEO!) are more than happy to help you whether it's for a sales call or personal career advice. Very unique especially given the size and continual growth of the organization.",Nothing currently - just got an updated kitchen and standing desks making a very productive work environment.

The best part of TechTarget is the people you get to work with. I met a lot of great folks who will have a long-term impact on my career","They are going through some growing pains-- it's inevitable with the rate their Priority Engine product is selling but they haven't quite made the transition to be able to fully support customers post sale. As an AE this means you spend a lot more time with account management rather then selling.

A couple of months back my live in girlfriend got very sick and was admitted to the hospital for over 2 weeks. I was able to work remotely during her time in the hospital and also while she was at home recovering.

151,TechTarget,Overworked and Undervalued Employees,2017-12-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Green-line station is next door.,"Everything:

The open vacation policy & working from home policy is complete bull since you're not actually encouraged to use it outside of being sick, where your forced to work from home on your sick day (i.e. no actual sick days).
   - To even use their open vacation policy, you'll need to provide an intense amount of 
      preparation and cover notes for the duration you wont be in the office. The 
      preparation is extremely time consuming, and if anything is missed while your out, 
      you'll still be responsible for its completion upon your return.


They strategically under pay their workers, while emphasizing the ""Career Advancement Opportunities"" & possibilities for a raise that employees have.
   - Rising through the ranks at techtarget is virtually impossible since the few employees 
      in management positions have worked there for roughly a decade.
   - If your looking to receive a raise for meeting their unrealistic performance goals, you                       
      won't. TechTarget hires recent college grads so they can easily replace their over-worked       
      employees without ever giving them a raise.

It is a company which is consistently successful, continuing to grow when the rest of the IT Media industry is struggling and always finding new ways to innovate.

For their employees it provides a relaxed atmosphere which makes it easy to get your work done.  If you work hard the opportunities for growth are endless.  Many of the benefits are hard to find elsewhere such as open leave and the company is in the process of spending a nice chunk of change to modernize the office space and provide new amenities.

Most importantly the people here are great from the top down.  I enjoyed going to work every day and will definitely miss everyone at the office.","It is a high paced sales environment which can have an impact on all departments.

A great support system allows reps at all stages of their career to be successful and put their best foot forward when working with clients. Easy access to anyone within the company including the Directors, VPs, Head of Products, and even the CEO. There is never hesitation to help a colleague succeed. 

If you work hard, approach things with a positive attitude, and drive results, their is a great opportunity to grow within the company. They are big on promoting from within.

It's an exciting time to be part of TechTarget as there are new renovations taking place along with great perks that include access to a full gym, catered lunch, cold brew coffee machines, etc.","If you aren't goals-driven and fully dedicated to your performance day in and day out, this might not be the right place for you.

160,TechTarget,Decent Starter Job but Don't Get Stuck,2017-10-26,3.0,Marketing Associate,"I was there for 8 months and got the full picture of TechTarget within 3.

- Flexibility/WFH: After about 6 months to a year (depending on your department) assuming you're performing well, you basically can request to WFH one day a week.

- Insurance: You have vision, dental, and healthcare. Pretty good coverage, I had no complaints. Comparatively, my current employer doesn't offer vision.

- Minimal effort, decent experience: Consider this a pro/conYou easily settle into a routine of the tasks they planned for you to fill. I could get through the bulk of my weekly tasks just Mon-Wed, excluding certain processes I was required to execute on Friday.

- Bagel Wednesday and infinite K-cups and soda (vending machine for snacks though...made no sense)

- Managers - your Manager will be your best resource, at least it was for me. Anything I learned, I learned from them. My Group Director was remote and the one before her (yes I had TWO in the span of 8 months) left after TT assisted in paying for her LAW SCHOOL ($5K tuition reimbursement) ... No idea why they would do that when she was a Marketing Director - when I started she was working 11 AM - 3 PM days and had used her kids as the excuse to leave early and essentially already had one foot out the door.","- Lack of Visibility & Culture: No catered lunches, no holiday party (it's in the office - whoopee), teams are isolated, no identification of your executives. I walked past a VP every day and didn't know it nor did anyone bother to explain. Very aloof culture. The Sales people probably have the strongest relationship ... that's just Sales culture in general though. As everyone said - WFH/Remote bosses is very common but you can imagine what that does for 'bonding' or 'relationship-building'

- Low Salary: High turnover as a result obviously. Incredibly low. Apparently quality is not critical to TT.

- No Training: I left because I felt underutilized - like I said minimal effort required - and they didn't offer me anything new or challenging. $5K in tuition reimbursement is also laughable given low salary and you can't apply it to online courses. The least they could've done is helped us better ourselves."
161,TechTarget,TTGT,2017-10-24,1.0,,"- Was able to negotiate a good salary.
- Bagel Wednesday
- Able to work from home on occasions.
- A few smart individuals within the business who were happy to help","- Toxic office culture 
- Hostile attitude from the Sales Team and VPs seem to be able to get away with speaking to individuals rudely (office norm)
- Lack of cohesion between departments
- Staff turn over extremely high (across departments) this was a massive red flag. I attended at least 7 leaving drinks within the first 5 months of joining."

* Telecommuting 
* Located at the end of the green D line.
* Free coffee","*Pay is so low and the typical $2,000 TT raise  is hard to come by. If you've been graced by a raise, you'll be told it was nigh-impossible to attain and that you should be grateful for the extra $25 on each paycheck.  Many managers at TechTarget have part-time jobs to get bills paid. 
* Many trainings and professional development initiatives are touted month after month but never delivered. 
* The miscommunication is so rife it's problematic.  The silos are structured and information doesn't flow, which is ironic given the company now labels itself ""data-driven."" Data is not driving between departments. 
* Literally every employee knows TechTarget is a revolving door.  A small chunk of folks get paid enough to live on only one job, then the rest is people who will come and leave for a much better and higher paying job and it's business as usual. 
* Many employees have part-time jobs because the salary isn't enough to live on. TechTarget keeps costs low by starting folks off insanely low then never coming correct. They know there will always be a steady stream of kids pouring in after graduation.
* The free bagels on Wednesdays aren't very good bagels."

So where are those growth opportunities?! The fact that the majority of employees work from home at least once per week really hinders productivity. Yearly restructuring of departments/teams is messy.

202,TechTarget,Great Place to Work - Even Better People,2016-09-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"TechTarget was an amazing first job coming straight out of college. They are willing to take the time to teach each new employee and help them grow into managers. Working at TechTarget for almost 5 years, I was able and allowed to take on anything I wanted; as long as I had the knowledge to handle it. The company is also very open about moving departments. If the role you started in isn't working out, the opportunity to move and try something new is always an option. They also have a flexible work life which is always a huge plus!",Only downside is the entry level salary can be below market value.
203,TechTarget,Marketing Associate,2016-08-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great job on your resume, especially for a kid right out of college.  Easy to get interviews after this job
......That's about it.","Pay is absolutely terrible!!!! Start out at 35k, sometimes less, in any role (besides sales which gets +commission).  You'd think after a year they would give you a decent raise, something actually sustainable in/around Boston.  But nope, don't expect anything other than 2-3k unless you get promoted to a manager (which is then only 45k).

Its corporate America.  If you leave, they will just get the next kid out of college to replace you.  Makes you feel like what you are doing really doesn't make a difference in the company, and there is really no incentive to working extra hard (as it isn't that easy to move up the chain).  They also show no employee appreciation... they think a lame pizza party at the end of each quarter is something, but most people use it to just leave early.  They would refuse to offer more money to keep somebody there, like i said, they will just hire the next person before throwing just a few more thousand your way.

The turnover rate here is a 1 -- 1 1/2 years.  It's so quick because people quickly realize they plateau, and there is no real room to grow here (unless you are here for years).  

""Unlimited time off"" works completely against you.  THIS IS NOT A BENEFIT.  While it may seem great, the reality is, unless you have been working here for years, you are not going to take even close to 3 weeks vacation.  In fact, you almost feel bad taking vacation.  If you were given a specific number of days, you can guarantee that you will take those days.  But because it is ""unlimited"" everyone tends to take way less vacation time.  I guess that is genius on TTs part.

Office culture is absolutely terrible unless you work in sales. Very quiet in every area around the office (other than sales), hard to meet people, and pretty much as boring as an office as you can imagine.

Don't recommend this company, unless you don't have any other options.  But it is a resume booster for sure."

238,TechTarget,Sweatshop with poor management,2015-11-03,1.0,Marketing Manager,"I've updated my original review to give more context and include some additional thoughts. Glassdoor won't let me edit the original, so here's v2.0.

You work with mostly nice and hardworking people. The one thing TT does pretty well is hiring for entry-level. Unfortunately, all the great people eventually leave because the pay is not competitive. Those who do stay past 2-3 years are generally promoted more quickly because the difference between the performers and the slackers becomes very apparent at that point. 

They are pretty forgiving towards mistakes which is important because A) So many junior people who have no other experience B) Very confusing processes and lots of room for error C) Demand for fast turnaround times and lack of information across the organization makes it very easy to mess up. This also means that consistent quality is not valued so much as ""getting it out the door."" This sometimes got us in trouble with clients, but this was mostly smoothed over with more  discounts and preferential treatment afterwards (the watchlist). 

Now that I've ""graduated"" I find that there is a pretty strong common bond for those of us who have worked at TT before. There is a shared understanding that we've made it out. I'm not even kidding about this one, the connections I've made afterwards always slightly surprise me. There are a decent number of us still in the sales/marketing space hence my advice to management to be more mindful about how they treat employees.

Just a comment about the skewed reviews. Yes, management does push us to vote on the ""Best Places to Work"" list. Yes, there is indeed favoritism and nepotism (lots of siblings and friends working together), and some people are identified as star-performers (rightly or wrongly) early and given more training and opportunities. That may work in your favor.","The pay, benefits, and training are almost nonexistent. Many of the entry-level hires I knew and even some mid-level managers worked 2 jobs, lived at home, or had very long commutes (cheaper housing). You are left to sink or swim with confusing and outdated processes much of the time. Some managers are better than others, and policies about work from home and open leave vary across departments. It was chronically understaffed when I was there, putting more responsibilities on those who were left without any kind of compensation or recognition (everyone is salaried, no overtime). By the end of my time, I saw 10 people I personally knew leave in the span of a couple of weeks (this doesn't include those that left that I didn't have any connection to). Moral was low even on the best of days, with a goodbye party almost every week. I avoid Indigo Hotel because I associate it with those departures.

To give you a better idea of what people are talking about when we complain of ""low pay."" I think they start off low and are stingy with raises, which leads to larger disparities as you gain more experience. When I moved on, my new manager told me I had the honor of being the person he'd given the highest percentage raise in salary during his decades long career! I was honest with him about my previous salary and also about my expectations for compensation after doing some research on average salaries for the new position I was interested in."

The culture is also pretty paranoid and hostile.

Because it's a publishing company, when the volume is high, everyone gets very stressed about deadlines and acts like the often-menial work that we do is of the utmost importance. There is also a focus on quantity over quality.

-Extremely low pay
-Constant turnover

(Example: they promote an assistant site editor to associate site editor, but they're the only editor for said site and the pay bump is almost nonexistent).
-As a result of the constant turnover and editorial/managing positions shifting to compensate, combined with fast promotion of inexperienced employees, management is incompetent.

-The survey for the ""best places to work"" list is very skewed, so the award is mostly meaningless. You won't find much different here than you would in any other office casual environment."

I experienced pointless micromanaging, down to how I took notes and which way I faced when sitting at my desk. If you need to actually hear the phone calls you're making, this may not be the place for you. I was also chastised by people who felt I ought to be able to drive from my home to the office faster -- they'd want me in a phone call from home at 9:30 and demand that I reach the office by 10. Not legally possible, and I never did figure out why they even cared. 

Although during the interview process they emphasized ""journalistic ethics"", my supervisors' idea of ""ethics"" fell a little short. If sources in the field did not agree with the storyline the higher-ups had pre-determined, the whole story would get thrown out. Made it hard to build relationships of trust with either sources or readers. I was told to find sources who would agree to have quotes I invented (supporting the pre-determined storyline) attributed to them, rather than finding out what the sources actually observed. 

There was also a tendency for people to declare themselves ""experts"" on technology they clearly didn't understand -- leading to editorial decisions that undermined the sense and integrity of stories. 

Finally, the irrational and mechanistic reliance on hit scores led to mandates like, ""Find more ways to put 'free' in the headlines."""

bagel Wednesdays

Lots of turnover in management leads to new managers not knowing what's going on. I found that if I had a question, it would never get an answer - or I would get told to ""ask someone else"". When things would go wrong, you screamed at either in private (like - one on one in a room) or just out in the open. Don't try to take a vacation either, you will be talked about when you're not there. Multiple times I heard management yell ""where the blank is (employee)??!!"". You hear people cursing out other employees behind their back on a regular basis. Witnessing management do this is pretty bad as an employee. Try to keep it professional. 
This brings me to my next point, most of these new managers take plenty of vacation time, while the people who have been there for a long time either don't take vacation, or are given a hard time about it. I imagine it's because the people who have been there a long time are the ones actually doing the work and the managers likely can't do it without them. If *still* don't know how to log in to your system, it's probably hard for you to do work.

Some managers/directors are hard to work with and make it obvious that they have no respect for you professionally, especially within the marketing department, and in extreme cases have driven some people to leave the company.  There is very little training because no one has time, it's more sink or swim. There is also a massive disconnect between the different departments - collaboration/cross-departmental communication is basically non-existent. Everyone thinks their way is the best way.

Promotions/Benefits – promotions are synonymous with the fast-paced changes that happen fairly frequently.  Healthcare benefits, open door policy, and free gym access

Professional Growth - I was at TechTarget almost 8 years and managed entry level, and global territories, a media group sales team, & managed vertical sales growth. Point: hard work is often rewarded with new challenges, opportunities, and professional growth. 

Family friendly – it’s not 9-5 which enabled me to be both successful, and raise a family.  In emergency situations, there were no questions asked. I will always be grateful for that support across layers of management.

Located close to public transportation.
.
Not much in terms of formal training, meaning you'll hit the ground running and learn quite a lot beginning on day 1.","If I had to give a quick summary, I would say to not think long term at TechTarget. Get your feet wet, but don't start doing laps in the pool.

Please consider the following:

Pay - entry level jobs start around $30K. Not much, if anything, offered in terms of comp increases year over year; it's a crap-shoot and dependent on company performance against benchmarks and market goals. If you do receive a raise, it's very little added to the very little you currently make. Having a second job is not uncommon among younger employees. For some it may be a necessity, not a choice.

Time off - the company offers unlimited vacation. However, depending on the group you work in, you may feel guilty taking time off when you see your co-workers trying to manage a million tasks at once. I usually monitored email or made myself available when on vacation if something came up, and invariably I would spend a few hours on the phone trying to put out a fire when the point was to get away and take a break. Work-life balance can be hard to achieve.

Staffing - the company operates very lean. You'll feel like your doing the work of 3 people. On top of that, TechTarget runs through employees at a rapid pace; there is a constant stream of leavers and new hires. Once you've trained someone on a process, they've left for greener pastures. Who can blame them? It's hard to maintain continuity due to high turnover.

Recognition - several factors play into this, some of which are out of your control. In situations where TT cannot over a reasonable comp increase, they'll substitute it with additional responsibilities or some new job title. That's nice, but up to a point. It's great to demonstrate your competencies and be trusted with more tasks, but due to the lean operation, you'll get burned out. TT is a meat-grinder in that sense. 


If your resume is nothing but a empty sheet of paper with your name on it, it's better to have something than nothing. You'll learn so much in a short amount of time, and have days when you'll feel frustrated beyond belief, but the skills you can develop can be a stepping stone to opportunities outside TechTarget."

Nothing like knowing what you're doing now will be meaningless to the company within a quarter. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you're unemployed (because low pay is better than no pay, right?) or are right out of school and need something to beef your resume up with.

327,TechTarget,Don't do it! Only consider if you are a desperate fresh grad,2013-07-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Flexibility, it’s pretty easy to come in late/leave early/work from home. Getting time off is NOT as flexible though. The whole “open vacation policy” doesn’t mean unlimited vacation- people actually take the same or less vacation as elsewhere. Entry level seems to be about 10 days vacation, not generous.

-Forgiving- as in, forgiving of mistakes/screw ups. I wouldn’t say TT is “laid back” really because at times it can get quite stressful and overworked, but I don’t think people actually care THAT much or live minute by minute (as I have experienced at other places I have worked).","-Salary is barely sustainable. Entry level gets paid somewhere around 30k (low end). A lot of people at TT have 2nd jobs just to be able to afford a car or maybe save something/pay off debt. This is a #1 problem, not only because it sucks not to be paid what you deserve, but this results in a TON of turnover, as eventually all the good people leave (after they gain some experience). It’s depressing to watch everyone keep leaving and also causes a lot of work stress on the people left behind to take on the extra workload. Company doesn’t care, since they just keep hiring new fresh grads to work as slaves. They compensate by bestowing titles instead of money- you will find that there are many 25 year old “directors” or 30 yr old “VPs.” The titles are inflated and meaningless.
-No time for training. People here do not have formal training, and the “sink or swim” practice is used. It’s very bad for newcomers, as TT does everything its own way, so you basically learn mostly by making mistakes, and it is just not a good experience to have and sets a bad mood/initial foundation.
-Poor communication/teamwork between depts. During my time there, I witnessed a lot of fighting between depts. that was very surprising to me. People seem to care about the blame and “pushing back” more than the overall success of the company. They encourage it, in fact.
-Company is barely profitable. Do not see this company lasting very long, or having a bright future.
-In short, don’t join TT unless you are a fresh grad desperate for experience- and planning to move on after 1 yr building your resume here."

You'll get a coveted promotion and a fancy title with a small or even, no raise. In comparison, marketing managers in our department were  only compensated $37K to $42K, which is WELL below industry averages and WELL below averages in other departments at TechTarget
* Promotions - don't be surprised if you get a promotion from an entry level to a manager very quickly and are literally thrown to the wolves. There is NO training structure for managers and NO support from HR in fostering effective, professional managers. 
* Lack of planning/proper QA - you'll develop a new process, test it once, and then immediately roll out without fully baking in failure plans. There isn't a proper project management protocol or QA protocol.
* Flexible work schedule - depending on the department you work there, there are SERIOUS restrictions to this open leave policy. The department I worked for had restrictions 33% of the year, which directly conflicts with the whole open leave policy. Also, as you succeed in the company, be prepared to be ""on call"" at all times. You will be expected to answer emails at all times of day and night and the majority of my department worked weekends to complete their job. If someone complained about working on the weekends,  nothing was done to alleviate this and it became expected after a while. The work life balance became unbearable.
* Lack of communication between managers and direct reports - your manager will be too busy to meet with you one-on-one, and you'll have to learn to deal with stuff on your own quickly.
* Sink or swim methodology - TT doesn't invest the time or money into projects or employees - you basically fend for yourself. Your project/career either succeeds or it doesn't - and they could really care less either way because if you do well, you won't be rewarded."

Some of the pros include:

Flexibility
Good work environment

Telecommute-friendly","The biggest issue with TechTarget is the health insurance costs.  A recent benefits change in 2011 was a big factor in driving away many employees.  It's a benefit to the company in cost savings, but really takes a toll on out of pocket employee expenses."

350,TechTarget,The experience is what you make of it (and who you work with),2012-04-05,4.0,Editor,"- I have had a fantastic experience at TechTarget. I've been blessed with awesome coworkers, fantastic managers and a lot of room to grow. In 2.5 years, I had two promotions. This is definitely a reap-what-you-sow kind of place.
- The work/life balance is so great. Having previously worked at a several newspapers, it's just unreal. I can take off early to go to a night class, start later to go to yoga, work from home most days. As long as you  get your work done on time and do it well, you get a lot of latitude. 
- Underperformers are shown the door. Some people might cite this as a con, but for those of us who work hard and care about our jobs, it's a relief. I think people are definitely supported if they're struggling, but those who take advantage of the system don't stay very long. I've worked in places where it seemed impossible to get fired, and the result is there's a lot of dead weight. I don't see that here.
- Although there are a number of entry-level positions, I disagree that this is just ""a good place to get your feet wet."" I think it's feasible to make a career here.
- It's a relief not to have to worry about how many personal days I've used if I need to take the day off for something.
- The bagels, etc., are a nice touch. The company also runs quarterly ""innovation awards,"" giving away iPads for simple ideas that save/make money for the company.","- Pay isn't that great. A competitor recently reached out to me about an open position, offering between $20-30k more than what I currently make. I know it sounds nuts to shrug that off, but I'm pretty happy here. I made the mistake once of taking a job solely for the pay (and turned the blinders on the bad environment). Pay isn't everything.  
- You do work hard. But if you come from the news/publishing world, this shouldn't be a wake-up call or anything. I actually thought it was less intense than previous jobs. That said, I still burn the midnight oil from at least once a week.
- If you have no experience in technology, there is a steep learning curve. It can be frustrating, and TechTarget doesn't offer much by way of education there. 
- The content is pretty dull, which can weigh down on you after a while. Try as I might, I can't be passionate about servers and software.
- As with ANY job at a midsized to large company, your experience will strongly depend on your group/manager. I'm lucky to work with a really great bunch. I have heard of some less-than-savory experiences."

Increased demand (from managers / directors) to work in the office despite the company's public declarations to the contrary.
