1,Tencent,Challenging and Rewarding Environment,2022-04-07,5.0,Recruiter,"- Great work environment 
- open-minded and internationally experienced management 
- Individual ownership
- good company perks (gym, and etc)",- long decision making processes internally
2,Tencent,Pretty good in game industry,2022-04-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,great place to work but so much politics,"lots of over time working, too heavy"
3,Tencent,A nice and different journey in my career,2022-04-07,5.0,Recruitment Manager,"* Mentor assigned for me in first 3 months to help me get into Tencent and the team easily.

4,Tencent,Overall a Good Company,2022-04-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Good Culture

7,Tencent,a,2022-04-04,4.0,Associate Director,The company feels good so far,The company is currently feeling disorganized
8,Tencent,Balanced View,2022-04-01,5.0,Corporate Functions,"1) This may be surprising but I'm having adequate WLB - Bosses are flexible, colleagues are supportive - End of the day, it's an output driven company - Work smart and deliver results, you can plan how your schedule goes.

2) Culture is great, there are team bonding budgets for team planned activities, social activity clubs for people to participate outside of work (running club / badminton club etc)

3) It's always about looking to be better, faster and of higher quality - The company is relentless in its pursuit of excellence which is why they have grown to what they are today

4) I was blessed with great team managers, through them I felt empowered and they had often pushed me to do better - Again, this is all in the mindset, do you perceive feedback as constructive or criticism?

5) Compensation is competitive but when is money ever enough?","1) Systems are not the best, unintuitive and often fragmented - You will need to be versatile in finding alternative ways to track your own work processes and deliverables

2) Ambiguity is really for breakfast, lunch and dinner - If you enjoy solving problems as they come and not having a dull day, this will be great

3) Structure is more business group driven as opposed to a regional format, might take some adjusting of mindsets to get used to the matrixed environment

4) Market share in some business groups may not be great but that presents opportunities to make things happen

5) Pros mentioned above might vary from team to team, it still largely depends on the team's leadership and style - so please do your own due diligence during the interview process"

2. Forced ranking system to punish (bonus cuts or even dismission) employees who ranked low.

If everyone in your team works hard, that will be a tragedy.

3. Limited experience in game design know-how and methodology. It is ok in the past, but crucial and lethal when Tencent wants to produce AAA titles to expand the global market.

4. Impatient managers. They expect developers to effectively produce and iterate content with superior quality (ideally to finish a AAA quality game in a year) but leave limited time. If the test data of your game is non-ideal, they will cut your project unhesitatingly.

No one expects you to be on the dot at 9am if there's no meeting. As long as you communicate with your team on project needs, your hours are yours to dictate. If anyone complains about OT, it's usually voluntary because they want to put more effort into their project.

Culture: Very open-minded colleagues. They're usually bilingual or multilingual, so they understand various perspectives from different cultures. My manager and colleagues frequently ask for my opinion on various things, regardless of seniority. I can speak my mind, as long as I say it in a way that's appropriate for the given audience (i.e. colleague my level vs hiring manager). Trust me, it's fun to hear 2 languages going on throughout a single meeting. It makes you feel like you're truly working for an MNC. Also, the people are honest and have a high sense of integrity. They're transparent about their intentions, want to protect their colleagues like family, and help them grow career-wise.

Management: They try to put me on challenging projects that highlight my strengths and don't rely too much on my weaknesses.

Compensation: Generous + the red packet culture","If you're working directly with the HQ, and have never worked for a Chinese company before, there may be the normal culture shock and language barrier. If you work closely with the HQ, then you need to understand that high-context communication style, as opposed to direct communication style in American companies."

Managers - Those that are leads from China, give you no room to grow and everything needs to go through them for approval prior.  Takes forever to make a decision.  Those managers are often seen as immune from any type of disciplinary issues as often complaints are ""investigated"" but nothing is done to change.  They steal all of your work and give no credit to you and either take the credit themselves or give that credit to those that are around them.

Company uses a employee rating system, and though it isn't a bad system, the managers will give a bad rating to anyone they don't like, and won't offer an explanation of that bad rating.

All in all, I will say, if you want to be nothing, and do nothing, appear to be working and 
 just never shine as a employee, I think its the job for you.  You will go through life just collecting a check and whittling away until they get rid of you.

730,Tencent,"Pretty good place to work, but difficult if you don't speak mandarin",2017-07-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Really excellent benefits
Most employees are kind and sensible people
Nice office in a good part of town
Good salaries
High quality random swag gifts
Opportunities to travel abroad","Working in the US office is extremely difficult if you don't speak Mandarin. You may feel socially excluded and depending on your department, you may be cut off from certain kinds of career advancement opportunities
Some departments in the US office have, in the past, been grievously misused by management in China. Despite its good investments in videogames and tech, Tencent in general does not have a strong strategy for actually doing business in the west and will often start and stop projects in the US at the drop of the hat. This can be a major career blocker for the western employees assigned to those projects
Some of the management in China seems fundamentally unsuited to managing employees in the US. This includes American-born management working in China.
Some employees in China tend to ignore work done or recommendations given by employees in the US, particularly if those US employees do not speak Mandarin
Once you get off the high of getting a cool trip to a foreign country, you may become exhausted by demands to travel to China over and over again, particularly at times of the year which are sensitive to US employees but not Chinese employees. For example, they may ask you over and over again to spend several weeks in China at the end of December
While US HR obeys US labor laws, the departments in China do not seem to have many of the protections we have and you  may find yourself in some awkward situations if you go over there and visit. However the biggest harm you are likely to experience is to your sense of self-respect at being associated with a company that does this kind of shit-- in general, I was treated very respectfully
Throughout Tencent, disruptive reorganizations are common and it is likely that your job or task will change frequently, often before you are able to make any big successes for yourself. Because this is ubiquitous in the company however it is not exactly a career blocker"
