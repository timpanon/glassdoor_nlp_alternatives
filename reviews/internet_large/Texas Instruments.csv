4,Texas Instruments,Decent to work if you want to learn supply chain sales and marketing,2022-04-06,4.0,Senior Member Technical Staff,"TI has a huge portfolio of product so for marketing, sales,supply chain its a good place to work. Their portfolio is > 50k products! Its also essentially a manufacturing company .",Ok TI is cheap cheap cheap when it comes to salaries in engineering. Expect a 2% increase year on year. Run for the hills if you are a SW guy. Innovation has gone close to zero. Just look at IEEE papers and you will see none or few from TI. so the quality tech folks  are gone. You have either some old folks ( brilliant) but close to retirement so they dont want to move or the fresh grads from college who couldnt join a better company. A lot of their engineering has also moved to india. so Dallas is mostly marketing sales demand create.

8,Texas Instruments,Meh...,2022-04-05,2.0,Engineering Manager,Steady job with decent pay. Could be more competitive. That's about the only good thing so far.,"I’ve been with the company about six months now and doubt I’ll be there much longer. I was part of the Lehi Fab that Micron sold to Texas Instruments. Mediocre sums up my experience so far. TI was a once industry defining company that is now one that most people don’t even realize is still in business. TI is in a business that just doesn’t promote or rely on innovation, and as such they don’t incentivize their talent in any special way, nor do they seem to concern themselves with the retention of any of their workforce.
Their claim to fame is the efforts of a single employee, Jack Kilby, whose contributions to TI are over forty years old, back when TI was a different company with different goals. Now they’ve devolved into a budget business reliant on used equipment, decades old technology, and human resource practices that I haven’t seen any company employ in over twenty years.
TI is a profitable company, for sure. But profitability is not a direct measure of the employee experience or the culture of the company. The truth is that my transition to TI saw a huge increase in my employee health care costs, a massive reduction in budget, and a complete 180 in enabling innovation and career growth.
My advice to people that are looking at jobs at TI is to not be fooled by any of the short-term recruiting tactics. There are extremely limited career opportunities once you hire on. There is a huge lack of incentive to retain employees past the first 2-5 years. And finally, and most importantly, the culture of doing the bare minimum for the bare minimum is extremely frustrating, especially if you want to do bigger and better things with your life. Other than a simple steady paycheck, which I understand is all that some folks need, TI doesn’t do much for the soul. In the end working at TI feels hollow and unappreciated."

39,Texas Instruments,A company where you’re just a number! They hope the lowest.,2022-03-16,1.0,Equipment Engineering Technician,There are no pros for this company unless you’re moving from Samsung.,"Tool to technician ratio. Dishonest hiring strategies. Pay. Environment. Work life balance.

At this company, there are a number of technicians with the same years of experience, same tool set experience, and even coming from the exact same position at the same company at the same time that make drastically different hourly pay. We are talking 12+ dollars an hour difference! This is because one asked for a low number thinking that is typical pay for the industry and the other asked high. I work with a guy on night shift that makes 28 an hour while his friend is making 40 an hour with less experience for the same exact position. Management and HR openly accept people at low amounts and then question why they leave later. This is bad business imo. My discussion with my supervisors while attempting to “retain” me included them factoring in my night shift differential as my pay. They use this to compare against a higher hourly day shift position and act as if this is why your pay is what it is. A night shift differential is given because NOBODY wants night shift and you are missing out on time with your family so they pay you an extra amount based on that aspect. IT IS NOT TO MAKE THE SAME HOURLY AS A DAYSHIFT EQUIVALENT POSITION WHILE WORKING NIGHTS! Do yourself a favor and go to a company that will pay you what you’re worth and not just what you say the minimum you’ll accept is. There are much better options and much better environments to spend your days at! Check Broadcom and Qorvo first before landing here. Don’t short yourself while performing more work than you would at almost any other company."

71,Texas Instruments,Overtime Pay for non-exempt hourly employees is calculated and paid by the day,2022-03-04,4.0,Equipment Technician,"Okay, let's get into the weeds shall we? Compressed work week (CWW) shifts, which command your presence for 12.5 hours (1 hour is an unpaid 1 hour lunch), the employee is paid 8 hours straight-time and 3.5 hours at time and a half - each day! CWW shifts have a bi-monthly pay period so one week consists of 3 days and the next is 4 days. Each day consisting of 12.5 hours physically present and 11.5 of those hours being calculated for payroll. Therefore, one week has 24 straight-time and 10.5 over-time hours and the second week has 29.5 straight-time hours with 16.5 over-time hours. Remember to calculate correctly! Although each day is calculated for over-time, the second week reaches it's 40-hour limit on the 4th day after only 5.5 hours so the 5 hours remaining on the 4th day is all over-time not just the 3.5 hours as calculated in the days previous. Also, night shift employees enjoy a 15% differential which is factored in so that straight-time is equal to 1.15 times their base-rate and over-time is calculated at 1.725 times their base-rate! Absolutely delicious!","Unable to find where Texas Employment law is requiring Texas Instruments to pay their employees in this manner.

100,Texas Instruments,"Overall decent company and benefits, some areas need improvements",2022-02-10,3.0,Systems Engineer,"Decent company and decent benefits. Good mentoring from the experienced, but rapidly shrinking experienced workforce. Most managers are understanding of work life balance. Good profit sharing maxing out at 20% for the last few years. Discounted employee stock options with 15% discount. 4% 401k company match. Best chance for promotion is in managerial ladder. Big company with many groups makes it easy to move around while maintaining benefits, learning different roles and functions, and obtaining experience. Each group can have very different work environment and culture. Work tends to be highly involved with local offices and customers in China, India, and Europe. Good set of company values. Large field group with prescence in many countries. Lately taking some efforts to improve diversity in upper management and technical ladder. Some managers are very good and do not micromanage their direct reports.","Some really awful managers that somehow maintain their position through the years. Little diversity in technical ladder with big emphasis on design engineers. Hard to get promoted in the technical ladder. Extreme cost cutting on employee computers, software, and IT departments, while company pays for a lot of customer visits and travel. High push for security and locking down computer resources that gets in the way of doing your job. Very old lab equipment with very long process for any capital expenses. Mostly hiring new college graduates. Most innovation is just incremental, not given much latitude to experiment. Due to large number of new college graduates, experienced workers spend a lot of time training new employees. Most new college graduates do not stay more than 5 years, so experienced engineers are constantly training people. Prepare for many early morning and late evening meetings due to working with co-workers in China and India. Centralized labs facilities are very noisy, crowded benches, small or no monitors, and difficult to concentrate. Some open office areas deter collaboration rather than foster it due to distracting noise. Management highly focused on short term gains rather than more involved and well thought long term plans. For example, big push to sell what we have and have very short design cycles were features are removed, instead of trying to understand why a device does not sell and spend the time to make a better device. Most employee career focus is just for new college graduates, so experienced workers tend to stall and leave the company. Your salary growth is highly dependent on your initial hiring salary. Hard to catch up if you fail to negotiate a good salary or we’re hired close to a recession. You might find yourself a few years down the road earning less than a new college graduate a few years down the road. Texas locations suffer from personnel that have highly partisan views that does not favor science and regard for facts.

The people who have been here for years all have knee problems, back problems, carpel tunnel- you name it they’ve got it- all due to the forced amount of work and never ending walking. The schedule may seem nice, but if you work nights (for that nice 15% pay raise) you basically don’t have a weekend. You’re spent trying to recover what hell you’ve put your body through the past four days you’ve worked. No one in management cares, you’re nothing but a walking number and no matter how much strain you put yourself through to get your numbers up, it still isn’t enough. Please, beware.

- Toxic Environment and Bad culture: A lot office politics, don't even bother reporting to HR as they are will only be helpful during onboarding. Managers will also be speaking chinese during meetings and day to day interaction with team members with no regards for the non-chinese members present.

Great culture for growth and learning - most of the employees treat each other equally and with respect. Everyone tries to learn from each other which makes it a very collaborative workspace. Everyone is passionate and hence provides with a competitive workspace to learn a lot and grow in career
2. Industry leader - Being an industry leader, employees get to work on challenging problems that quench the thirst for problem-solving
3. Focus on individual careers - The management cares about employees' careers. The tasks are assigned in a way that advances the employee towards the preferred career progression (management ladder, technical ladder, customer-facing roles, and many more)
4. Innovation focused - TI is a factory of innovative solutions for everyday problems faced in the semiconductor industry. There is a lot of automation going on to make work flows more efficient in design/layout/DV/test and some wonderful in-house tools are available to make lives easier. You also get opportunities to work on such tools and contribute to the team/company
5. Texins - An awesome place to unwind and network with people from outside of the team. Facilities include a wooden flooring basketball court, table tennis, music room with various instruments anyone can access, gym, yoga room, filmmaking room, dance room, tennis court, badminton court, pool table

P.S. - needless to say that being a product company it provides a very good experience on a full product lifecycle (from concept phase to release to market). You get to participate in cost analysis to choose a technology node, feasibility analysis of design architectures, customer research to maintain the competitiveness of products. Given you show interest and spend more time","1. Culture is a bit invasive towards personal life. As everyone is extremely passionate about their work, an average individual may be required to put in extra hours to be on par with peers. Employees don't shy away from working on weekends or during late hours which creates a culture where everyone has to do the same even if they do not want to
2. Though the compensation is at par with other companies of the industry, the kind of hard work and innovation employees put in should bag more salary. If the amount of effort vs salary is compared with the IT firms then TI compensation definitely pales and may appear to be minuscule to some"

-TI will look good on your resume
-The top semiconductor in the Philippines
-Most advanced manufacturing tools/systems in the Philippines(Probably?)
-The golden standard in semiconductor manufacturing in the Philippines(I hate to admit it, but TI is the baseline of all manufacturing company in the Philippines)
-Profit Sharing
-14th month pay
-High Ethical Standards? Not Really (At least in the Baguio plant only)","*All Pros/ Cons are only applicable to TI Baguio only*

-My manager is a power tripper and a gaslighter. My former manager had 5 engineers(including me) resign in a span of 4 years. HR did nothing.
-Toxic management
-Lots of bootlickers
-Toxic workplace and people
-HR won't help you. HR will guilt trip you and will make you think the management is right even of they're obviously wrong.
-HR is pro management (you have no power even if your manager is abusing you)
-Dismal starting salary compared to other companies. Increase is yearly, but your increase is not a lot.
-HMO is only applicable for your kids and husband/wife only. If you're single, you can't enroll your parents or siblings as dependents. (My current employer allows up to 3 immediate family member)
-They love cheap labor. TI does not consider you as an asset. Employees are disposable. They'll probably hire a fresh grad to replace an employee with 5-10 year experience and call it a day.
-Tech Ladder is politics based. If you're friends with the technical committee you're highly likely to get elected. 
-Management prefers fancy looking presentations and projects with ""cost savings"". Imagine a patent-capable project with technical advantages the can optimize processes and manufacturability losing to a project that used recycled materials to make an organizer/container. I mean, why?
-You'll get calls even at the middle of the night and during your rest days. 
-Thank you OT is common practice.
-Managers dedicate their life to TI. TI is their way of life. TI is their oxygen and water. Why live if you can work at TI?
-What's TI's response to covid? They put fancy tapes on the floor for ""social distancing"" and called it a day."

If you plan for long term, you're wasting your years here",2021-02-16,1.0,Product Engineer,"If you plan to move abroad, this is a good place to start. If you plan for long term, you're wasting your years here. For Philippine salary rates, they pay too low (All semicon in general actually do pay low) for the job that they make you do. A technician in the nearby Aircraft production line makes more than the engineer at TI. The best learnings and take away from working in TI: I just can't feel the pressure of working where I am now because the pressure in TI was the worst! Nothing can top that kind of negative culture and environment (Test production and managers are toxic). I appreciate the workplace I am now even if it's not the best. Whenever I think about the toxic experience in TI for almost 5 years, I'm just glad I'm not there anymore.","They will hire new college graduates cum laudes because they are still young, on fire and mostly will not demand a high pay -but this is a trap. If you're a cum laude, you're wasting your years here if you plan to stay. They can't hire experienced engineers because they cannot pay as much. Yes, they pay too little. If you look at most engineers who stayed for 10+ years, they are sad, negative minded, and have not gone anywhere (financially at least). Only those who get promoted to managers will get paid well. But even managers are not spared from the pressure. They have this culture that you're giving your life to TI. You give your weekends to TI. You give your holidays, restdays, you must overtime if there's an issue (and there's always an issue! It's a trap), They e-mail at night. Engineers can't do sh*t to production supervisors or managers. You cannot practice real engineering because delivery is their priority. They say Quality is number 1 but they don't practice that. You are pressured to just deliver. If you're a cum laude engineer, use TI as a stepping stone to abroad. If you plan to stay in PH, maybe 3 to 5 years is enough then go out! They won't even care cause they'll just hire the next batches of cum laudes. They are really smart to keep the salary low by hiring new college graduates. I moved out, got paid double by the another company and then got easily promoted. If you have a family, stay away from TI. They won't say it, but they want you to give them your life (your time)."

1131,Texas Instruments,TI Continues To Improve Its Mighty Legacy,2019-10-04,5.0,Software Engineer,"TI has a challenging but worthwhile environment. There are very smart people that work here but they don't show it. They're mostly native Texans. Humble and grateful people. There's a reason the average TIer lasts 15 years here - because they make it hard to leave. The company has great benefits that are competitive. It's a fortune 200 company and you get exactly what'd you expect and more. There are great leaders at TI, especially the ones at the very top. TI does diversity right, too. They don't just diversify on race like some of the other silicon valley type companies, but a many different attributes. Politics and bureaucratic incompetence just doesn't get in the way of your work or the companies mission, unlike some companies. With all of the extracurriculars that TI has, there is opportunity to make gen-u-ine friends here","If you don't like Texas you probably don't belong at TI. As a matter of fact you probably don't belong in Texas. Please, just stay in California. Depending on where you live, the commute can be pretty bad. The DFW area in particular is getting crowded so there's not much you can do about it. Again, stay in California. While there is a lot of mobility at TI, it doesn't always translate to a significant increase in salary. You have to understand that working in IT at TI means you are fundamentally supporting the business, so you won't be on the cutting edge of technology necessarily. Of course that does have its perks, but you'll have to decide for yourself if that's desirable. In my opinion it's hard to beat."

1149,Texas Instruments,"Only intern here. Gaslighting, breadcrumb culture.",2019-09-04,3.0,Product Marketing Engineer,"You will have a great experience as an intern and rotator and possibly for the first year or so after your deploy to your full-time role. When I started, we had a 2-week orientation and really got to bond with both PME and Sales rotators. That bond is something that made TI feel like a family to me and not just a place to work. (They've since gotten rid of that culture) My peers were and still are some of my best friends. 

There's lots of growth in  corporate behavior, work ethic, communication skills, and presentation skills that can transfer well to other companies.  

The PME role allows for domestic and international travel (unless they cut that out too now), which is fun but a lot of work. 

They have a lot of training opportunities that are of no cost to the employee that many employees do not take advantage of.  I highly recommend taking these courses, even if that means taking a day from work to do so. 

The only jobs I recommend at TI are HR and Digital Marketing.","PAY / PROMOTIONS  / WORK-LIFE BALANCE
Starting pay is great but over the years, the raises are not competitive. They pay you less and work you more than other companies. I have not heard of a single person unhappy with their decision to leave TI. 

The culture of the managers is to make you feel like you should be GRATEFUL for the breadcrumb raises and to not even ask for more. They make you believe that the typical annual inflation raise (that every other company offers) is a merit-based raise. It's actually very, very difficult to get a true raise, bonus, or RSU. They don't openly talk about the fact that there even is such a thing as a mid-year raise to be considered for. Other companies give you shares when you start, an annual inflation raise, AND a true merit-based raise. And other companies have a better work-life balance. TI will say they do, but when you start working 10-14 hour days, you'll understand it's just words.  This gaslighting behavior is one of the biggest reasons I left and never want to go back. It's a toxic culture. 

Managers across the board have fallen short on promises made to employees whether they're raises, bonuses, RSUs, or promotions. Promotion methods are very unclear. While there are some great managers, there are a good number of bad managers that seem to be in that position because they're pals with upper management. Even when many, many people leave TI or leave the group to escape that manager, that doesn't register with HR or they don't care.  This is not a good place for upward mobility. 

TECHNOLOGY
TI is not longer an innovative company. They're never going to be at the forefront of technology. They're followers and it's not that exciting. 

ROTATION PROGRAMS
The rotation programs were one of the biggest reasons I recommended joining TI but now they've cut so much from the programs that you don't get the benefits from them. They seem to play the role of temps during their rotation: cheap labor to do menial tasks that product lines don't have the time to do. If you get a good manager, you'll learn and grow a lot. But most of the time, rotators are treated this way.  Also they got rid of the pay bump you get when you deploy to your full-time role. 

SALES / FIELD ROLES
They're turning the TSR role more into a data-entry role and the FAE is taking on both responsibilities. I do not recommend joining TI if you want to go into a TSR or FAE role. 

PRODUCT MARKETING ENGINEER
This is a made-up role by TI (or maybe ADI, who pays more) that combines the responsibilities of a Business Development Manager and a Product Marketing Manager while paying you one salary for 2 roles. It's also difficult to translate this role to other companies. Most other companies have never heard of a ""Product Marketing Engineer"".  While this role is fun with strategy and all the travel, it doesn't help a lot with becoming an expect as a BDM or as a PMM. It may not be a great move for your career unless you want to stay with TI. 

TI knows they're the main company to be at in Dallas as a EE and they treat their employees accordingly."

There is no mechanism for holding managers accountable to their employees beyond creating an HR issue or the employee going head-to-head with their own manager (which is toxic to anyone who touches it). Employee annual pay reviews happen behind closed doors with no employee input. (You have five years of good-excellent reviews, but this year had a poor review because your boss is going through a divorce and can’t separate personal issues from work? Too bad, no one in management asks why a good employee turned bad, you just have to suck it up.) There is no company culture to prioritize managers actively communicating to employees to make sure they don’t get surprised by a bad end-of-year review.

1228,Texas Instruments,From Great to Living Nightmare,2019-04-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good learning opportunities out of college. Profit sharing has been strong. First year was great, then it turned into a nightmare.","All comments are my opinion.

Do you enjoy having to cc your manager and their manager on every email you send? How about weekly micromanaging sessions which you'll spend many hours preparing for (but always get crapped on during)? Watching your team of ~5 all quit in the last year or two?  Management which is commonly referred to as ""slave drivers?"" 

All this while being paid 40% under market value!? Bay Area compensation is truly awful. Don't think being new to relocate there will help - I knew someone from a rotation program who was let go within 9 months due to reorg. He shared a room with 2 other people. Seriously, compensation is low. 

What I learned is that there is a ""culture of fear."" All decisions are top down and all you are supposed to say is yes. This place will kill your soul and make you woefully unprepared for anywhere you actually have to be creative or think for yourself. Seems even after more than a year in a new company that some still couldn't shake all the bad habits and it hampered their ability to perform optimally (such as speaking up or coming up with ideas in a more open culture).

Management varies a lot in quality, had some great (all left within a year, smart), and some truly evil managers. Even after a whole team left over a couple of years and managers kept dropping like flies, nobody asked a single question of why that might be (terrible management).  

I do think the company is aware and the awful management is purposeful to some degree. Cheaper to get employees to quit than lay them off. Better to grind through people or only have the people who don't know work life boundaries stay around. Or so the thinking goes. 

Tech is awful, large parts of work should be automated and systematized. Management should be happy to hear large parts of the job could be done away with.  Does not work like a tech company under the hood. 

I learned the irony of Silicon Valley being named after dinosaurs like this while real tech companies push boundaries with their products, business model, operations, compensation, and culture. 

No CRM. Seriously, everything is tribal knowledge, email chains, and spreadsheets meticulously updated for many hours each week. Lots of early and late calls with Europe and Asia while still needing to be butt in seat during normal hours. Innovation = cheaper, long gone are the days of exciting new tech. 

Thanks for the depression, anxiety, and low pay, but I'll go elsewhere."

My experience has not proven to help me develop and get into management. If you want to move around be weary that each group is very territorial so it is best that you think about moving on your own and seek mentors as groups are not embracing of you moving across groups (business units). 

Compensation is usually based on the market and if your manager can really make it or break it for you. I have personally only ever had a good manager once and i have had about 6 or more managers at TI.

TI reorgs A LOT to the point that it doesn't make sense. I understand the power of reorganization but when you reorg too much it makes the team feel very depressed and unwilling to perform well. The story seems to repeat themselves a lot.

I feel that TI spends too much time focusing on reporting up to senior management where you are not moving or doing much progress. Also too much reporting makes it so that you are only focused on the numbers and not innovating.

Overall a good company to get your career started, but you need to change some key things to make this place a much better place to work. I think many folks tend to feel stuck and as if they can't move around much. Maybe try to copy more on how F&O encourages every 3 years for individuals to move

A billion dollar company setting record earnings yearly along with major corporate tax cuts recently and they can’t afford decent insurance for their employees?
My other issue is that the corporate culture panders to the lowest common denominator for their employees. There are no rewards for being an excellent employee and going above and beyond. You are given the same raises and bonuses as those doing just barely enough to not get fired. There are no consequences for those workers and they continue to do a terrible job and barely work. This brings all those with a modicum of a work ethic down to their level. It doesn’t take a genius to realize this brings the entire company as whole down."

Great opportunity to network across departments and learn something new. TI truly believes that you shouldn't have to check out a part of you at the door. Our different backgrounds is what fuels innovation.

IT isn't that great though. As a software engineer, it's hard not getting dulled by the ""just get it to work"" mindset. Unfortunately, this has created a lot of problems with our applications which are a nightmare to maintain and support.

They fill up your traditional 40 hour work week with meetings, and checking-of-irrelevant-boxes, various United Way campaigns and diversity initiatives and then expect you to do the actual *work* in your free time.

Great efforts driving web first strategy. Amazing history of innovation. Opportunities to work across the globe.,"Micro management and very short term financial perspectives have stifled innovation. Everything goes by the “playbook” and there isn’t much room to be creative. Heavy age bias. If you are over 35 and you have not made the cut to leadership, you probably won’t have your career progress  here. You will be constantly watching new college grads that you train and develop grow in the organization and eventually become your boss while you stagnate. TI is the only major semiconductor company in Dallas and so  leaving TI is also difficult if you are not willing to re locate. In summary it is a great place for new college grad. But if you are over 35 this is not the place."

1539,Texas Instruments,Applications Engineer Rotation Program,2017-11-04,1.0,Applications Engineer,"TI is a great company with heavy cash flow.  Some groups are more profitable than others, and typically there is a direct correlation between the group’s profitability and employee happiness.","The rotation program is a scam.  Officially, TI HR will say you will be placed within the company based on business needs.  This translates to the fact that statistically speaking, you will deploy to a group with the highest rate of turnover and to a position they couldn’t fill via direct hire.  This is why you see an exodus of deployed rotators after 2 years or less with the company.

To make matters worse, TI often couples technical achievement with management capability—leading to many issues.

If you decide to go into the rotation program just know you are taking a shot in the dark that will not statistically be in your favor.  My advice is to always choose the direct hire position over any rotation program if it’s a role you are interested in."

-They implement 5S,  and workplace ethics.","***Disclaimer: written here are only with regards as working as a product engineer, and as an employee in Baguio and not in other sites***

- Salary is too low for an engineer, unless you are a manager.
-Work culture and management is bad.  You're graded by the amount of projects you have made but management is pushing you more on doing sustaining activities (like machine repairing and disposition of hold lots) and not much on projects. During quarter end, management always tells you to DROP all projects and do sustaining jobs instead.
-Employee training are not that in depth because trainers are not expert themselves. Sometimes they just assign someone to do training even that person is not an expert on that field.
-Training topics are very shallow, like how to read datasheets and a how to fix a setup, no training on actual topics needed by a product engineer (e.g. device testing methodologies).
-Shifting schedule except for managers. This is the only company site in the whole world where product engineers are in shifting schedule.
-ZERO amount of team bonding all year, except for the Christmas party.
-you virtually can't attend activities planned by the HR since workload of  product engineer is heavy.

* Very large company, enabling a curious mind to dabble in a number of different areas over the course of a career.

* Solid compensation and benefits

* Finally getting serious about renovating the campus.","* Since it's the only major semiconductor company in North Texas, a lot of people stick around for decades.  They are called lifers.  This prevents young, ambitious talent from growing into leadership roles.  Not all lifers are bad.  A lot have great ideas and a wealth of knowledge.  But, there are some lifers that are dead weight and need to be removed to make way for fresh ideas.

* Politics and Bureaucracy.  It's a big company, so it comes with the territory.  But, the combination of the two tends to stifle innovative and creative ideas from ever taking root.

* ""Old Boy Network"": some of the lifers mentioned above have escaped layoffs and have landed cushy roles via the network.  They always seem to be one step ahead of strategic shifts and the fallout that ensues.  Governing philosophy of these types is to hire capable people below them to do all the work, which frees them up to travel the globe on the company's dime.

* Lack of Innovation and Entrepreneurial Thinking.  Upper management is dominated by sales and marketing types.  Primarily a formulaic, sales-driven approach to things, which is odd for a historically innovative technology company.

1847,Texas Instruments,Application Engineer Intern,2016-09-08,3.0,Applications Engineer Intern,"A very good place to start out as an intern. The work life is very simple with all work completed during work hours. Also, work hours are very flexible. People there are friendly when talking to or asking questions. The work difficulty really depends on which group you are placed in, so it can vary from very difficult to incredibly easy. The management tries to get the interns and new hires to meet together during various ""Intern and New Hires"" events. Very relaxed dress code, varying from regular shirt and jeans to business suit. I learned and was exposed to a lot of subjects I never intended on studying in my career during my internship at TI.","A very work-intensive environment. Everybody always has something they need to be doing with deadlines, thus you can see the stress on their faces everyday. People don't bother to say hi to others and tend to dart their eyes awkwardly and ignore the person unless directly spoken to. Very hard to get information when that information is greatly needed to complete particular assignments, requiring multiple emails and many days wasted. It can get very lonely as an intern since you will be assigned to a group where usually everybody is at different points in their lives and hard to relate to (30+ age difference with families). The work assigned varies from week to week, sometimes just reading big documents all week, solving issues with faulty devices, serving as the typical intern guinea pig slave, or working on your ""intern"" project. It can get very boring at times since nothing will need to be done for you, but you still need to fulfill your 40 hours/week work requirements. 

The following may or may not be cons, but did give me somewhat of a negative impression:
-Workers complaining about their current job and progression at the company
-Software from the company not working and it is up to us to fix the group in charge of the software's problems
-Lack of communication from the supervisor. Supervisor would only come to talk to see results on the assignments.
-People there seem to have this need to educate others on certain topics that the listener might already know about (The need to assert intellectual dominance and feel superior to others). This can get really annoying after a while.
-Workers start gossiping and loitering once their manager is not around
-Workers work slowly and procrastinate their work until close to the deadline where they start overworking just to finish the assignment"

You can't learn new skills at TI and they don't even allow participation in industry conferences other than their own.","TI's embedded processor business has not introduced a new design in about 5 years. There is no innovation except in analog circuits. Very bad for software engineers. All digital chip design, manufacturing and most software development is outsourced.

Age discrimination is systematic through a secretive stack-ranking system that is gamed by more experienced managers. You must be in management by age 45 or be gone and it's best to be gone.

Today, as it stands, you are guaranteed profit sharing of 15 to 17%  (if the company does good) and an annual 3% raise for just showing up  to work! If you are one of those who goes above an beyond to do the right thing and try to help, you might get lucky and get a 4% raise....a mere 1% extra raise!! ... so what is the motivation and incentive for high performers to stick around?  especially if we lack leaders that inspire and motivate!? and a compensation structure that is average to say the least!!!"

1863,Texas Instruments,Process Technician,2016-08-14,3.0,Process Technician,The benefits are great. Relationships with coworkers are awesome! I've worked with some very good people at TI.,"Management does not promote from within and HR will block employees from advancing. Manufacturing specialist cannot be promoted even with degrees. Moving forward is difficult and very political. They will hire new college grads over promoting their own employees. They will hire technicians from technical schools and pay them much more than current employees make. Even though the new hires have no industry experience. They do very little to recognize talent. Often aggressive employees are rewarded for being 'go-getters"" when actually they are bullies. 

TI needs to realize they have very talented employees who currently work for the company. They say they want to improve moral. But they hire manufacturing employees through a contracting company and give them no benefits  (no 401k, discounted stock, health insurance) and keep them waiting to be 'converted' to TI for YEARS. They should have a minimum of 1 year to conversion, but some people wait 4-5 years before TI hires them. That seems highly unethical.  And definitely contributes to low moral and turn over. Also, the training is poor. There is too much emphasis on moves over quality. When new hires are brought in training depends on how much pressure trainers are feeling to produce, rather than to take their time nurturing the new hires. New hires feel the pressure and see the writing on the wall (no conversion date) and look for jobs elsewhere."

2152,Texas Instruments,Great for a Few Years,2015-08-29,2.0,Marketing Program Manager,"- Socially, there is no hierarchy. It's really easy to be friendly with people at all levels of the company. Getting beers with a director after work as an entry-level program manager is a relatively common occurrence. Conversations with people at all levels of the company will take on tones far more casual than you may expect.

- You demonstrate your value as a resource with your work and especially with the size and strength of your intracompany professional network, not the amount of time you spent at your desk that week. This is truly one of the best, most progressive aspects of TI's culture.

- Working at TI, you will receive a crash course in the ""human"" side of your discipline (the part they never taught you in school). Getting a project off the ground and working for your customers will require buy-in from about a million other teams before it's possible. At TI, obtaining buy-in can sometimes be an incredibly counter-intuitive process. That is, it doesn't usually mean convincing people your ideas will help the business, but rather convincing them that it's worth it to them to let you proceed. This would be a con, except that making it through this crash course will overprepare you for the political side of jobs at any future employer.

- It is exceptionally easy to move around into different teams at TI. You express an interest, get some recommendations, and you're in.

- They pay well and seem to pride themselves on it. I negotiated poorly and they still had no qualms paying me more than I expected.

- A manager who likes you is a manager who will sponsor all sorts of business trips around the world.","Professionally, the organization is very hierarchical. Entry-level employees do entry-level work, and middle managers at TI likely define ""entry-level"" differently than you do. I heard the phrase ""have to pay your dues"" more than once while I worked there. Often, team managers do what program managers normally do, while program managers do what assistants normally do. This can get extremely frustrating as you witness your team's direction slowly evaporate while your manager gets lost in the strategic customer-facing work and you do the time-consuming simple tasks with which he or she would rather not be bothered. This means a 5-person team with a manager and four experts executes like 1 person who has 4 assistants."

Decent amount of vacation. They are finally updating most of the buildings, which were in very bad shape previously.","The work/life balance is getting out of hand. Since 2009, many jobs have been offshored. Working with these coworkers requires lots of nights on the US employees' part and introduces extra work and delay, simply because of the time difference. Flex schedules and part-time are becoming a farce--if you go part time, you will never truly work 75%, but you most definitely be paid at that rate. 

Experienced employees are being replaced exclusively by new grads (or not at all). While the quality of these new grads is high, they need time to learn and be trained. This leads to extra work being dumped on existing employees and inadequate training and inappropriately large workloads for new hires. There seems to be a big gap in middle-aged (30s) employees and the knowledge gap is going to be huge in a few years when key people retire and all that is left is people with 3-5 years of experience--who tend to jump ship more often.

The pace keeps increasing to the point that employees are burned out. The long hours and hard work that were previously rewarded and appreciated are now expected 100% of the time with little regard to how it is affecting resource morale and work/life balance. Managers are good at reassuring us that they will push back when needed, but it never happens in practice.

It has been made very clear by upper management that IT is a cost and we are definitely 2nd tier corporate citizens."

-""Old boys club"" culture.  Comms and HR are trying hard to turn it around and offer fun activities like Jack Kilby Day, but as long as the company is full of disgruntled people, the culture will definitely not be turning around anytime soon.

Nat Semi acquisition was sought to add tech talent, but Nat Semi was never in the top 3 of analog, and many of their best people left. Recent lay-offs tended to remove a lot of talent - those who stayed seemed most politically skilled, not technically talented, consequently a lot of talent got picked up by top competitors, probably on the cheap.

If it is already in but others start showing up, it happily drops the ball, drives the business to the ground and leaves it all behind. Basically, TI chooses not to compete (let's not get into why). This mode of operation is most disturbing for the technically talented. You might be very good at what you do and strive to stay on top of your trade, but you know that it is only a matter of time before TI will leave your area, selling out entire businesses or shutting them down.

2.  Size of company lends to opportunities to move within organizations

4.  Diverse roles and expectations per PE/TE depending on your group","Advancement and opportunities are more dependent on your timing (joining the group), mentorship (find one), your soft skills (like-ability, communications, appearance) and your internal management's capability to advocate your skills, rather than your technical skills and work ethic alone. It's a very inaccurate expectation to think that performance and hard work alone pays off in any corporate culture.

If you get a design win it was luck...If you lose a socket it was your fault. Useful training is absolutely impossible to obtain. The whole peer/mentor system has shut-down. No one has time to train you, they are too busy trying to get their projects moving along. Management will show up and schedule you for a meeting and ask ""So, what have you been doing"". Management will release proclamations to save money and basically cut off all tools you used to use and implement new ones. Then give you no time to learn the new tools but your project better not suffer. Kind of like, you shall make bricks without straw. Oh my gosh...I realized I am starting to hate it there. How in the hell did they get on the list for one of the happiest places to work? All I see are miserable people. Except for the ones always dishing out the work.

Work is rewarding and salaries are I believe competitive with industry. It has a good brand name and other companies respect employees working here.","1. Bad office politics at senior level.
2. Employee performance review system is not very objective and depends on votes from whole lot of other manages who do not even know your work.
3. Arbitrary decisions at senior management level impacting productivity of employees (changing design tools, shifting focus too often, too much changes in management etc)
4. Not too impressed with sudden closing of large business lines just because there is too much competition or margins are low (still profitable). I believe this may impact long term where the company may not have the required IP to get into new strategic business."

2664,Texas Instruments,"Challenging work, keeps your skills current",2013-11-09,4.0,,"- Always have challenging work. You won't become a dinosaur working here. 
- I've never heard of a more humane company when it comes to family emergencies or personal issues (assuming you don't have a history of abusing their trust) such as death in the family, hospital leave, etc.
- You will work with the smartest, gentlest people and will love going to work. There is a strong emphasis on teamwork and egalitarianism. They must intentionally look for collaborators because there are very few bullies or uber-negative competitive types. If you're type A personality but also ethical and respectful, you'll fit right in. 
- True flex time. Work overtime when its needed and take off when it isn't. No one cares when you arrive and when you leave as long as you perform above a certain level. (You have to earn the privilege first, so not many people abuse the system.) This is the first place I've ever worked where I wasn't frustrated by deadbeats. 
- Truly collaborative. The web team doesn't one-up each other. Everyone is hired for a specific talent, and is expected to exchange ideas and help each other. If I don't know how to code a particular feature, I can literally go ask around and people are excited to pitch in. (The web is so splintered, there are a lot of processes, and we change things so quickly that this is really critical. No one can make it alone in this game anymore!)","- Onramping is difficult. Things change quickly and we're interdependent. Just chill for the first year and half -- all your colleagues went through this too. Do not expect to be 100% independent as quickly as you would be elsewhere. No one will blame you. Its just part of working for a fast-paced, global company."

To do so, they created something that crams years and years of experience into a concise two year program. I have the amazing opportunity to work with four completely separate groups that all tie back into my work as a product engineer. This type of exposure so early on in my career is the thing others dream about.

Additionally, TI has such a wide portfolio of parts that I am always able to satisfy my curiosity and desire to learn. I can dive deep and learn all about the device physics of a certain part, or I can go broad and learn all about a family of devices and how they operate. And when I get tired of those, I can repeat the process with other devices.","The only thing that people might consider a ""con"" is the fact that this job REQUIRES you to move abroad for 6 months. However, I don't consider that a negative thing. In fact, that was one of the main selling points for this rotation program."

This rotation program allows me to learn about the Product and Test role while also contributing to a team. Not only does this role incorporate Fabrication and Design, but Ti is also paying for me to work overseas and learn about the Assembly of integrated circuits.","The only con that I see is the rotations are only for six months.

Some good people still left in the company
Dallas is one of the most affordable cities","Texas instruments is not the leading edge company that it used to be several years ago. 
Main business has become analogue with other areas being cut or closed.
SW is consider secondary and SW engineers are really not paid at the same level as SW eng. in SW companies.
TI much or less has re-orgs and layoffs every year (sometimes twice a year), more so since Rich Templeton became CEO (this is the only area he excels at)

My advice/survival guide for those SW eng. planning to join TI (assuming TI is your only option) is:
1. Become buddies with decision makers, this will come handy when layoffs come your way
2. Be political, don't rock the boa (specially if you are right) as you will be the first one in the layoff list
2. Don't kill yourself at work, due enough to get the job done and more importantly stand out as the problem solver even if you created the problem
4. Layoffs are inevitable, just be prepare and you will be OK if you master 1 and 2 above
5. Stay long enough to get good experience and then find a company where you can build a career (TI is not the place for SW eng.), advice is to stay 2-3 years then find something better

Dallas has very few high tech companies, hence it will be hard to find something else after layoffs.

I agree with others that TI facilities are ""ghetto"", where cubes are 20+ years and forget about free coffee or any other common perks available from companies making as much or less money than TI."

Strong history
Healthy Culture

To summarize, if you look at TI's history it should be very easy to see the kind of company it is. There is nothing hidden from you and the goals of the company are clear from the minute you walk in.","It is an older company and at times still clings to older concepts as well as large corporate mentality.

It has less of the conveniences that newer tech companies have."
2847,Texas Instruments,Texas Instruments is a results oriented serious engineering company,2013-01-28,4.0,Senior Software Lead,"TI practices diversity in hiring and opportunity in ethnic background and gender. There was diminishment in the quality of work - in fact, having a mixed environment of ladies and gentlemen from all over the world removed some of the ""Old Boy network"" that I've seen in other companies.","TI runs on a tight budget. As a semi-conductor leader, they need to invest upwards of a hundred million dollars for a product line, so they aren't afraid to spend money. Teams however will need to justify any expenditures very thoroughly, and those expenditures must be focused to making a profit."

This has led to a company with no vision and lack of technology leadership. They do excel at cutting cost by laying off the people who really make a difference except for those who are buddies with management (good old boy network going strong).

Those thinking about joining, my recommendation is to stay away as this company is heading in the wrong direction, more so if your field is SW programmer (there are very little to no career opportunities)."

Compensation has been reasonable and long term contribution is regcognized and rewarded. Lots of good people with an environment to learn and grow. Overall an excellent place to work.,Software development has never been highly regarded. It is more a means to an end to deliver hardware instead of a value adder to product lines. Not much focus on how to make products easier to use and incorporate into customer designs.

TI is committed to innovation and creation of new and exciting ideas for next generation technologies.,"Due to the fact that TI is a publicly owned company, some of the ideas and innovation never see the light of day since making money quite often involves being at the right place at the right time; and making products and delivering them to the consumer needs to be a well and thoroughly thought out strategy."

I have heard, however, that Java was in consideration to replace TI AutoShell. Factory automation is important but be aware that if the fab will become 100% automated, there will be a very reduced need for software engineers so, expect a reduction in staff in that case."

2885,Texas Instruments,The good and the bad,2012-12-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"TI has good ethics, good respect for the individual and is a leader in many of the fields it engages in. It has proven to be a survivor in the tech world (not so many other >75 year old tech companies). Good culture for helping others, people will generally go out of their way to help.","High-level ""strategy"" is very sales-driven, and might not really be strategy in the true meaning of the word. Cuts can be brutal, when TI figures out that it wants to get out of a particular business, it does not hold back from cutting entire businesses. If you are in the wrong place at the wrong time, it doesn't really help how good you are. On the other hand, this is maybe a key reason why TI is still around (see >75 years on the pro side). Bureaucracy can feel stifling sometimes; support functions may be removed without reducing the paperwork load. Depending on the location, there may be a lot of politics at lower levels (Dallas is probably the worst location in this regard). At higher levels, there certainly appears to be some political wrangling - at least some decisions only make sense in this light. Although there is focus on work-life balance, workload can be on the high side. TI has succeeded in having some big windfalls with small staffing in some fields and may have too high expectations that this can be replicated across the board."

The IT group has suffered as a result of this with increased work loads and decreased appreciation from the business as the business users are unable to get the help that they need with computer software/hardware issues. IT is not viewed as a core competency and has been increasingly out-sourced to the detriment of TI, in my opinion."

- Recent years trending towards very short term focus instead of 3 - 5 year look ahead and encouraging innovation, technical ladder is a valuable asset with excellent people that is losing credibility as it has become a tool in the hands of managers to promote their favorites and retain squeaky employees
- Frequent organization changes are a distraction to committed employees, the problem with having sales and marketing managers in charge is they tend to think of design resources as interchangeable and skill sets as transferable, these changes prevent engineers from having a long term deep focus that results in fantastic innovation
- If one does not have management mentors and supporters, the workplace can appear stagnant for one's career; can become worse if one manages to speak one's mind and upsets middle management
- Management too focused on tasks and end goals and does not listen to the staff on the ground very much; constantly experimenting due to lack of experience in org leadership and personal insecurities"

3028,Texas Instruments,Getting to learn a lot,2012-05-03,4.0,,Work culture is very good and obviously the salary is very nice .Work -life balance is fine and its very light working environment,"You may have to wait for long hours when product release is nearby, but that happens almost in every firm in this industry"
3029,Texas Instruments,An amazing work-life balance.,2012-05-02,4.0,,"A lot of facilities given early in the job, work-life balance with Texins (Texas Sports Club), Ample opportunitites","A very long technical and management ladder to climb, Less recognition due to huge number of employees"

3032,Texas Instruments,Texas Instruments Is a Good Company to work for.,2012-04-27,5.0,Product Test Engineer,"Technology is advanced, with many diversified product portfolio. Each organization has unique structure of business(manufacturing structure, Wireless Business, DLP,  DSP,  and HPA). Most groups are easy to work with. The benefits and pay are great.  Most engineers share their knowledge.","There are a few bad groups and managers(just like any company). H1 Visas and college hires is a big strategy for hiring.  For many years, TI was called Training Institute(hiring college graduates). They are back in that mode during the recession. Three years ago, there were 30 percent H1 visas. Now it is 60 percent walking down the corridor.  They are on the edge of segregation per language barrier, but hey  still have a chance to prevent this problem. 

    You have to watch how their technology is not standardized with other companies. They build many systems internal and unique. Not good during a downturn."
3033,Texas Instruments,It's a place where you can learn everyday and gain real experience rather than repeating the same things again and again,2012-04-23,4.0,,"1. Great Management Culture.
2. Excellent set of people that work with you. The threshold of competence is very high, so it is easy to work.
3. Very inclusive environment with all kinds of diversity.",Not anything serious that I can think of. Dallas summers can be quite hot. Learning curve might be steep at time due to the complexity of systems.

Employee benefits (health, vision, 401k, ESSP) are very competitive with other like companies.",No work life balance.  Not a good place to work if you have a family or want to ever have the opportunity to spend time with them
3038,Texas Instruments,Very old company,2012-03-26,3.0,Test Engineer,"Well organized
Fair compensation
Good knowledge sharing","A way too old company with unbelievable regulations everywhere
Restriced working environment, lake of flexibility in every aspect, lake of efficiency
Not performance driven, talent not rewarded
Stopped in new technology development recently"
3039,Texas Instruments,"Work was boring, but they love co-ops at TI",2012-03-22,4.0,Hardware Applications Engineer Co-op,"TI is very supportive of co-ops and new hires.  Every single recent grad in their rotational program had great things to say about their experiences, and most of my fellow co-ops really enjoyed their work and their supervisors.  The facilities in Dallas were really nice.  TI definitely has their stuff together and seems to have a knack for getting into the right markets.","During the summer I spent at TI, my team was in the middle of a very uninteresting phase of work.  Applications teams get to do a lot of cool, hands-on stuff, but while I was there, they were preparing documentation, tweaking software tools, generating header files, etc.--extremely tedious, logistical tasks that could almost be done by a team of fairly knowledgeable high school students.  Apparently I was just unlucky, because I met about 100 other co-ops who were doing interesting stuff.  
Seems like a bad move to put co-ops or new grads on teams that are doing mind-numbing work... the real value of a co-op is not their work, but their potential as a future employee.  Even though I got a chance to see that TI is a cool place, my experience left a bad taste in my mouth."

3044,Texas Instruments,"TI used to be a great place to work, but not any more",2012-03-08,2.0,,Flexible hours. Decent pay and benefits.,"Non-stop reorg and lay-off recently. People just don't feel stable and secure working for TI these days. Virtually no opportunity for engineers to advance their careers. TI has essentially stopped investing in its digital side business especially DSPs, which it used to dominate even 5-6 years ago. All upper and middle management are now coming from the sales side and has no clue nor interest in technology. All the emphasis is on sales and marketing. In the past several quarters, TI spend more money buying back its own stocks than investing in R&D. This speaks loudly about what TI is really about these days.TI's internal cost control is to such extreme that it has become even laughable in certain aspects. For example, replacing 4-5 year old PCs has been really difficult if not impossible. This results in big loss of productivity in return for a few hundred dollars of savings."
3045,Texas Instruments,"Very good company, great benefits, but conservative with raises.",2012-02-27,4.0,Business Planner,Generally a very good work life balance.
