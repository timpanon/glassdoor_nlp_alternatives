- Great brand recognition and products
- Hard working, intelligent and creative junior trading and account management teammates","- HR 'business partners' do not protect or look out for employees, only the company. No managers or leaders held accountable for their mistakes.
- No clear growth opportunities or consistent job descriptions 
- Annual review process used for penalization not growth and awarding
- Without transparent people management processes (each pod is managed differently), cliques and favortism are rampant and are required for any career growth. Not a meritocracy."

- The kind of work perks (snacks, coffee, etc.) that young tech people love
- Customer service is a priority which leads to strong retention","- Pay is nowhere near industry norms and they know it
- RSU package is no longer very competitive 
- Mixed signals on priorities and product offerings
- Historically leaned so heavily on agency partnerships that playing mad catch-up at the client-direct and/or mid-market levels
- Way too many titles that result in unclear responsibilities across roles

TTD is a company that can’t decide if it wants to be a mature start-up darling or a tech powerhouse. Constantly being asked to position ourselves against Google, Facebook, and Amazon which are so multi-faceted beyond just being a DSP. There’s so much talk of culture and I still don’t fully understand what this is supposed to mean; for a company in rapid growth mode, leadership is quick to say OGs don’t like change or “that’s the way it’s always been.” Bringing in others with many years of experience but blowing off new ideas, creating a clear rift between those with long TTD tenure and other new faces which is creating animosity that’s neither mature nor professional."

Experience to see the cutting edge of programmatic, and how it's evolving
But overall, just staying here for the stock honestly","Culture has become such a big issue. I do love the cultures itself, but when culture becomes prioritized over hiring the best people, it's difficult to keep to culture. The company is growing rapidly so we're hiring at an equally rapid scale, which means that a lot of not competent candidates actually get the final offer, and the existing people are quite forced to show every bit of the good culture to people whom we don't think deserves to work here.

Regardless of good culture, we're a company, not a charity. Good culture comes when we hire the best people, it doesn't work the other way around. Don't expect good culture after you hire people who aren't even mediocre at their jobs.

Also, when it comes to culture, it seems like people who are more high up can give public shaming and go away with 'it's business'.

I do believe that the C-level's emphasis on Culture is genuine. But there's a huge gap between the C-level and the actual implementation part. Culture has become a joke now."
17,The Trade Desk,Very competitive ppl and bad mid management,2022-02-17,1.0,Trader,"If you are assigned to a good advertising agency, great commission.

I think any bumps in the organization are related to normal transitions that occurs when major growth and development is happening.
20,The Trade Desk,Not a modern company  - AVOID,2022-02-07,1.0,Finance Manager,"The people are great to work with.
The business is ever growing
ESPP program is great
Palooza is great.","Not offering a hybrid working option. All other companies around the globe have now adopted this model. TTD is way behind, especially considering TTD has been voted a great place to work and is a ""Tech"" company. No WFH or Hybrid working going forward - what a joke!!"
21,The Trade Desk,Boys Club Mentality and Stock Will Only Get You So Far,2022-02-03,1.0,Client Services,"What kept me at TTD for so 4 years were the people, majority of people on your peer level genuinely got along and cared about each other as well as provided a community outside of work. Generous benefits like full health care, Anniversary program and obviously stock & ESPP is what keep 95% of people there.","I agree with the other review of ""it was great until it wasn't"". I loved my first 2.5 years at TTD but then it took a nose dive when COVID hit and I realized how much of a cult this company is. 
First, terrible middle managers. So many unhappy employees because of these new middle managers that were hired externally and lie about what they do on a day to day basis. If you have a terrible manager, good luck you'll never be able to move teams nor get promoted. No matter how much feedback you provide to their boss, HR and leadership, that person will never be fired because they'd rather have someone terrible at their job than no one and risk losing high performers because of it. 

Second, this is a boy's club and you'll only see success if you're in the inner circle which is comprised of 90% males. There is high turnover of female leadership and stealth firings (6 female leadership stealth firings to 1 male stealth firing in the 4 years I was there) whereas under performing male leaders continue to enjoy their cushy jobs while everyone that reports to them is questioning why they're still at the company.

Third, below industry standard pay and bonuses. Have historically made up for it with soaring stocks but that's a thing of the past. 

Fourth, no career progression unless you're in the inner circle. The expectation is do the job above you + yours for 12+ months before you are ever considered for a promotion. And a promotion is 5-8% salary bump which is nothing compared to competitors.

Fifth, there used to be a strong TTD culture but with remote work, that is a thing of the past. OGs stick with OGs and newbies constantly feel like outsiders unless they work 24/7 to ""prove themselves"". If you ask people why they stay, ~80% will tell you because of stocks even though they dislike their day to day work. 

Sixth, terrible work/life balance especially in NYC. Expected to work from 8AM-6PM+ with no breaks. Constant slacks and emails late into the night and early morning. Leadership is all talk and no action on implementing a better work/life balance"

Trying to have POCs and women in leadership positions/visibility","The CEO wants to build a great company based on a great culture but as we triple in size in 2 years, that base culture is beginning to slip. The OG employees are tribal towards new hires in the pandemic, cold shoulders and unfriendly behavior towards new hires so much so that the CEO had to tell the OGs on an all hands to knock it off.

Comp package is way under market rate. Their stock price isn't the golden goose it once was but they aren't adjusting wages for flagging stock performance or rocketing inflation while insisting that employees live and work in very expensive cities.

HR is suffering from a big competency gap. Org HR managers skills are variable and some have made errors that could get the company into major hot water. HR needs to have the house cleaned and employees brought in who understand how to run a company that is no longer for hundreds of people but instead thousands."

I was bullied for over a year for my disability, gas lit over a promotion they gave to me and then made me wait for a year to receive, and forced to join in ‘mandatory’ social hours after work with people who bullied and harassed me even though I don’t drink. I would have to stay for a while because if I left early I would be made fun of. I often sat at a quiet table with nice people and watched the ‘popular people’ get wasted, until I deemed it safe to leave. I often overheard people making fun of me in the office. HR was aware of the issue and did nothing. Felt like high school but worse. The work was fine but the people were so horrific. They used to read a glassdoor review about a woman who was sexually harassed and make fun of her, saying she wasn’t pretty enough to be sexually harassed. Don’t join if you’re anyone but the popular kid. Left and have never looked back."

46,The Trade Desk,The culture TTD previously bragged is long gone.,2021-09-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,ESPP. Benefits. WFH. Covid Support.,"Employs wrong management people. Someone is sure to climb corporate ladder if you love politics, micro-management, terrorize the staff and talks a lot. Upper management always accepts initiative (without evaluating) by these inexperienced, ""trying to prove something"" manager creating chaos and unnecessary pressure and inconveniences to the staff. They also encouraged referrals to the point that everyone in a department is from same company or friends instead of diversifying hiring people from different backgrounds, industry and experience. This spoils the culture."
47,The Trade Desk,Decent company,2021-09-11,3.0,Staff Software Engineer,Ok company to work for.,Micro management is the norm.
48,The Trade Desk,Really outstanding culture sustained for many years,2021-09-08,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Colleagues are invariably friendly, generous, and great to learn from and collaborate with. People (especially in London office) from all over the world with diverse backgrounds and life experiences.

Work is challenging and stimulating, generally quite varied. There's a need to be agile about strategy (always more to do than time to do it!) which is a good learning opportunity.

Social side of things is pleasant, with some 'top down' events (well, before covid anyway) and more 'organic' hanging out with colleagues. Pub, restaurants, board games, sports after work or at lunchtime etc. Nothing forced if some or all of those things aren't for you. Great office breakfast and lunch.

Managers typically genuinely care about their direct reports' wellbeing and make an effort to provide challenging, interesting work and growth opportunities.

While engineering is encouraged to proactively attend to real business and customer needs, most of the time the trust and autonomy are there to do things with quality and in a direction dictated by engineering experts. Engineers at all levels are expected to become experts and owners of the areas they work on.

Stock incentives and bonuses have been very generous historically.","Work can be difficult and the nature of the business gives a seasonality to things so challenges and pressure can hot up in the approach to a Q4 of the year or a particularly big release.

The frequent need to respond in an agile way to new opportunities and risks can be daunting, and occasionally makes it harder to spend focus time really digging deep on a particular problem.

Some of the higher-ups in sales can come over a bit self-congratulatory but most of the time they're also actually good at what they do and good collaborators."

As you can imagine, it's incredibly difficult to work with a disengaged or disinterested manager, and of course there's never any change made at that level. 
Also as mentioned in other reviews, really high performing team members will be let go in the middle of the night with little to no warning and without any insight into why. It's strange because the company boasts about long-term employee tenure, but neglects to point out how many people were brought on board for short stints and then unceremoniously let go outside of a PIP.

There are no real mechanisms for giving feedback about your manager, though they'll tell you otherwise. You'll be tainted politically if you know how to, anyways. Doesn't matter if your manager is demonstrably lying and known to be incompetent, you won't be given the benefit of the doubt.

The development process is quite painful and doesn't seem to be getting better. You'll receive unclear, constantly changing requirements from product to start. Testing patterns are strenuous and not well defined, deployment is also cumbersome. Every change requires detailed documentation and multiple approvals, regardless of size (they say that's not true, but if you don't, it can be used against you when useful). Production issues result in more process for everyone instead of genuine reflection from leadership about what actually went wrong. 

Management relies on stock growth to make your compensation enticing, but the stock growth will level out at some point, if it hasn't already. Looking past that, salaries aren't anything special."

They do not write reviews, thinking that stating that is a waste of time and doesn't change anything. 

The CEO appears to be a nice and honest guy, but the revenue and the opinion of Wallstreet is what matters to him the most. He fired hard working employees around the world during the COVID pandemic time, not only because of employee’s performance. Even though he assured that the company would not be doing any layoffs. It’s a fact that can be proven, but he calls it a myth. 

I strongly agree with the previous reviews regarding the micromanagement and the hire & fire culture. The management got replaced, but it didn’t make things better, only worse. In every single month of my employment people were laid off. 

The current EMEA Human Resources doesn’t have empathy or people skills, keeps complaining about the high workload and gossiping around about others.

One has to constantly watch out what to say and to whom as they might use it against you. There is a lot of politics and not much trust.

Palooza employee events are being used for branding and to brain wash employees.

Company offers good working conditions and perks but also expects a lot. This kind of high pressure is not worth any money. Often long hours, working in the night and weekends, constant availability. Late calls because of different time zones, sometimes after 11 PM.

Lack of consistency and structure, no clarity on who discusses what with whom.

Very slow processes and too many stakeholders involved. Plans are constantly changed."

This company is a good ole boys club led by Jeff and his inner circle. He dictates everything and on occasion will announce big new initiatives publicly before internal teams are even aware, creating endless fire drills to shift priorities. 

There are no goals other than revenue, no real vision or plan. Or if there is one it's not widely shared. They just took away bonuses for most of the company because MBOs don’t make sense here. 

Being at this company is an exercise in how to exist in an environment where the CEO's mood on any given day impacts a year's worth of product strategy work. Yes-men get far. Tell Jeff what he wants to hear and you're a hero.

• Incredibly appalling finance UK management (Supervisor, Director/VP) who handle Accounts Receivable; they’re rude, aggressive, non accountable, condescending, can’t take constructive criticism, micro Managers, arrogant. They value people based on their title, so if you don’t have a management title they’ll think of you as a lesser person & don’t value your points. They’ll listen to those that are higher than them even those individuals are the wrong people to listen to as they’re not on the ground doing it themselves. They’re a massive suck up to management which they have to be, as if they got judged on performance alone they’ll be long gone. They only care how they look in people’s eyes & just to save themselves they’ll throw you under the bus even at fault of their own. They try to avoid responsibilities of their roles & ignore certain actions to be taken even if it’s their job. They’ve managed to destroy the team in just 2 months of trying to take over. 
• Due to an appalling skill of picking the right candidates even when there are 4+ people involved, rude & lazy individuals get employed in a sociable environment... As a result you get a somewhat high turn over in the department. People from Sales & BD always amazed how constantly we swap our staff. 
•Long hours, hard work, results & reliability as an employee - means nothing to them & they’re ready again to dismiss everything because you’re not from management.

This starts from the CEO, who is incredibly smart but also very caring and thoughtful, and permeates down throughout the company.

The programmatic advertising industry is expanding rapidly and still has a lot more potential to grow, especially with the shift to connected TV. This means that TTD continues to grow quickly, and employees have lots of opportunity to make an impact and achieve career progression. 

It's fun to compete against the ""big boys"" (Google, Facebook etc.) and feel like you genuinely have a more transparent and superior product offering.","Take on board the feedback in other reviews about mid-level and senior management.

Your chance of career growth will be based in large part on the integrity of your manager and/or your own integrity (or lack thereof) . 
The Trade Desk's growth has created the space for middle managers to exercise their more natural paternalistic tendencies. 
The vision and leadership of Jeff and Dave that previously inspired and empowered engineers to do great things is being suffocated by small, grovelling, little men who have only ever demonstrated engineering their own career growth.

- The company operates under extreme micromanagment starting from the top. The CEO is very involved in the day to day and CMO reviews everything and controls every decision. This might create good results in the end but also means no one on the team can make decisions or bring new ideas to the table and their roles are diminished.
- The marketing leadership team is ineffective and full of huge egos who are trying to build big teams. People get hired without clear roles and this leads to confusion and inefficiency. Some people on the team are overworked while other of the more recent hires have nothing to do. Some of the leadership team likes to remind everyone they are friends with the CEO or other c-levels but are largely ineffective in their roles. There have also been complaints of sexism which have been ignored.
- There is a general lack of caring. Plans are constantly changed- often at the last minute which means people have to scramble and work/life balance doesn't exist.

This is true across positions, but especially apparent in Sales/Client Services.  TTD wants to hire all of these amazing/intelligent people but expects these candidates to take a SIGNIFICANT pay cut. The overall compensation structure is confusing and often times non-transparent. With any start up culture, there are always a group of people that have been at the company for years and are now just collecting a paycheck and getting a huge piece of TTD stock.

CEO seems genuine, solid and an inspirational leader.","Company lacks ability to set priorities and align w/in departments and across departments. Leadership lacks higher level leadership skills of inspiring, motivating, empowering individuals & making them feel proud, operating with indecision and insecurity too often. The company doesn't support growth or movement within the company.  Not a collaborative environment - very territorial and overly protective & fearful tone, rather than open and trusting. Hiring too quickly without clarity of roles and responsibilities, or a long term plan.  Too much time working on cosmetic, surface polish and not enough time on substance that impacts the business or drives action and results. Micro-management from certain leaders overly concerned with time in-seat even at the expense of generating business growth.  If you're over 27, avoid this place - it doesn't offer challenges, or growth within the company and the 'big perks' of gummy bears and bar carts might be good in early 20's but they aren't big perks for many."

The team has become toxic with poor management trickling down from the top. While The Trade Desk claims to prioritize understanding the difference between individual contributors and people managers, my experience illustrates otherwise. Despite concerns being raised to higher leadership -- and despite their agreement with those concerns -- no real action is ever taken. In fact, the opposite continues to happen as they hire managers that seem to lack any positive management experience and any semblance of empathy. In addition, the Marketing Team's leadership seems to have no concerns for the career paths or the growth trajectories of its team members.

Horrible HR
Mistreatment of employees
Incompetent leadership

The Trade Desk can be really good for some people, and really bad for others, depending on how you play the game. In most offices, there is a clique that runs the office, and if you get in with them you’re golden. TTD hides the cliqueness by calling it ‘culture.’ If you’re part of it you’ll be given promotions, HR complaints lodged against you will be ignored, and you won’t have to work hard. There are some truly evil people protected by these groups, and I’ve seen many people in my office bullied by them. If you aren’t part of that group, your life can be absolute hell. It’s high school all over again, except you’re financially punished for it because you’ll miss out on clients/career opportunities by not being friends with these people.

HR is tiny and doesn’t even have people in most offices. There are too many people that have gone to HR with complaints of things that are blatantly illegal or horribly wrong, and HR just tries to shut them up and they don’t do anything. If they go to your managers, they just try to shut them up and advise them that the best way to get ahead is to feign happiness. There a absolutely miserable people here just trying to smile to get that next promotion. 

Women aren’t treated equally. The CEO essentially acknowledge that pay is unequal across the company last year and that they don’t have a plan of fixing it. 

A lot of managers were given their jobs because they got here early, or were friends with the right people. This goes all the way up to the top where there are some people that everyone knows are incompetent, but are kept around for cultural aspects, when in reality they just bully people in their own offices and don’t do work."

161,The Trade Desk,"Great perks, but passively controlling",2018-11-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The perks of working at The Trade Desk are great. While we’re not as big as Google and Facebook, you still get free lunches twice a week, attend the annual conference in LA, go to cool events and there’s plenty of snacks in the kitchen. Ever since I’ve started working here, I think I’ve gained a pound or ten.","Ever since The Trade Desk became publicly listed in the last two years, the focus on making more revenue has become more apparent. Now there’s nothing wrong in making more point, that is a main point whenever you start a business – but I feel that workers have become overworked due to the aggressive targets that need to be met.

To top it off, there are times I want to question the decisions that senior managers make at times. However, I don’t voice them as I don’t want to be on the wrong end of the stick as well. There’s also a cliquey culture that’s becoming more evident as well, and often these people get promoted and other people in the team become overlooked as a result of this. 

The team dinners and events are great, but I feel like I'm forced to attend these events because if I don't go, it looks like I don't want to be part of a team. One time, I couldn't attend an event for a personal reason and I was asked a couple of times if I could reschedule it to another time. To get this person off my back, I rescheduled my appointment to accomodate this - but again, it felt like I was forced to go to the event.

On the surface it may seem great but when you actually delve deeper there are really big issues that no one wants to address. For example, upper management is a complete joke. Most of them don't want to be managers but were put in those positions because they've been there the longest. Along with all the other ""managers"", I would say only a handful are qualified. This is taking into account all the offices across the world. They are put in those positions without actually wanting to be in a management spot. 
Lots of people take advantage of expensing things, it's shocking. There are people who work hard and are really smart. There are others that are just plain awful human beings but don't get fired because they have friends or are connected with managers and upper management.

I was genuinely shocked to find that a large portion of my colleagues seem to enjoy coming to work.  Who knew that was possible?

This place isn't Google or Facebook, which I see as a positive. While we aren't pampered with chefs, barista bars, or personal massages, the perks are still quite nice. There are plenty of snacks, free lunches once or twice a week, annual company conferences, sit/stand desks for everyone, legit company swag that I'm not embarrassed to wear around town, and a relatively solid work-life balance. While I don't speak for all, I find the compensation to be far better than that of other companies in our industry.  

The leadership team seems genuinely interested in hearing employee feedback and I found them to be accommodating when making special requests.","I fear that we are focusing too much on the big guys in the room, Google and Facebook, while ignoring the competitors that are in our league, Amobee, Media Math, Oath, Amazon, AppNexus, and Adobe. Some of these similar sized DSPs are slowly gaining market share right under our noses.

One of our biggest selling points to clients is transparency, but this can sometimes be a tricky topic internally. When it comes to compensation and management decisions, I find it's in my best interest to not speak up and ask the obvious questions for fear of angering management.

As a whole, the company is very young, and in some cases, this shows - especially with regard to some of the other reviews on this site. Compensation, work/life balance, and growth opportunities are all things that should be earned and come with time and hard work. I've had several jobs prior to TTD which have provided me with perspective on each of the aforementioned topics. I feel that some of the disgruntled folks don't know how good they have it."

 The company runs on rumors. Many reviews have said something along the lines of being the best place they have worked, being around the most intelligent, curious, hardworking, and tenacious people. That is the kool-aid talking.  You WILL be underpaid. If you read, the ones who said ""decent"" pay were the engineers. You WILL work long hours because everyone else does it.

The work is not mentally stimulating. One fact, some people (plural)  have spent their day trading on the stock market on a separate computer while working. That should tell you how challenging and stimulating the work really is.  I get it. We all have to make a living even if it means having two jobs.

""Rumors of pure tyranny and bullying (or poor work ethic) from our head of client services "" True. You will interview and know what we are all trying to say as soon as you meet her. Be humble.

- Even though transparency is a value, the company is not transparent with clients on how the technology really works. We teach clients all day long but if they pay attention they will see a paradox and we are discouraged from being transparent with them on this 
 
- no work life balance, looked down upon if you leave before 7 pm, we are not saving lives people. The CEO has mentioned how some offices can be better at this but management should lead by example

-vacation during peak season is discouraged

- management can be passive aggressive at the time you arrive even if it is 9:15 am, it is more the culture of agencies since we work closely with them

- promotions are just fancy titles, rarely you are actually doing something new

- compensation is really low in comparison to industry standards, they supposedly negotiate by giving three months of free commision which they claim they never do but actually give to everyone. You should negotiate for more months of secured commision since you start earning it way later

There are Directors who would be VPs at bigger companies, and Directors who should be individual contributors.  

The biggest disappointment came when our CEO basically shut down any conversations around diversity.  At a company our size, it's a reasonable and fair question - what are we doing about it?  His response was insulting, basically ""I have friends who are diverse so I know what diversity is.""  I feel reluctant to write this comment but I've heard he reads these reviews, and hope he takes it seriously that we weren't satisfied with that answer.

192,The Trade Desk,Loving life!,2017-11-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"3 months in and loving life!  What an amazing culture.  Fellow employees are dynamic, collaborative and incredibly bright.",The business model (of being in close proximity to our clients) means that we are very decentralized.  It's a brilliant model but it does present it's challenges in staying connected with your teammates.
193,The Trade Desk,"Excellent Product, Toxic Work Culture",2017-11-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"When it comes to the DSP landscape, it's clear that The Trade Desk is in the lead. The product is powerful, versatile, and fairly easy to use. The senior leadership is aware of the challenges in the evolving AdTech industry and is definitely on the forefront when it comes to issues such as fraud and precision targeting in the programmatic space.","Unfortunately, I had a very negative experience working at this company. 

Firstly, this company demonstrated a problematic attitude toward addressing sexual harassment in the workplace.  I experienced sexual harassment from a male coworker. I promptly formally reported the harassment. While my managers were sympathetic, HR took minimal action against the perpetrator, who then remained at the company for several more months. Furthermore, I overheard other coworkers making jokes about sexual harassment. 

Secondly, I found it difficult to work in an open office environment with a high noise level. The company has a homogenous culture with most social events centered around alcohol. I prefer a quieter office environment and a division between my work life and my personal life, so I found this office culture very hard to navigate."
194,The Trade Desk,Smoke & Mirrors,2017-11-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Our technology is considered one of the best in breed.  Our service team really tries to find value for our partners.  Kitchens are always fully stocked with food.,"Although our tech is considered to be great, it's not very automated, which is why we have so many Account Managers advising our clients (however this can work to our benefit since we are very service oriented).

The managers need to take management courses.  The C-levels, VPs, and many of the GMs are very manipulative.  Job seekers beware!

They think they are going to run the world, but they should remember to remain humble.  The arrogance has become toxic."

Very consultative atmosphere, where everyone can contribute and put forward ideas.  Products are released when ready, nothing is rushed or botched, but still incredibly quickly.  Always at the forefront of programmatic and online advertising.

Focus on client service is great, and is the foundation of success.  All clients get wonderful account management and a huge amount of contact and support.  The client retention rates back that up.

Amazing atmosphere, the culture (both working and socialising) is very important and everyone gets on.   That's not to say you have to be outgoing or head out for drinks with the team at all - everyone is understanding of work life balance, and the company avoids a monoculture.  It just means that recruitment is very thorough, many hours, with people who you may never work with closely, to ensure professional and cultural fit are there.   Despite the rapid growth the culture has been maintained, and staff turnover is low.","As with any multinational company, the need for early or late calls can be tiring!
Some functions still lack international support - having to go to the US for these areas can exaggerate timelines.
When people do leave, they can occasionally disappear without mention, regardless of the reason.  Senior management (local or global, as needed) should address these situations better."

- CEO, Jeff Green, has a great vision for the company and industry and everyone has confidence in his leadership
- great product built by an outstanding team of engineers & developers, supported by a dedicated client team that makes us stand out to clients","- definite original boy's club in leadership positions (women ""leaders"" are kept back of the house in legal, HR, finance) & those at the top are untouchable 
- the political game is getting strong
- management training is not enforced or encouraged. Just because someone is good at one part of a job, it does not mean they can be a leader
- although we are growing quickly, a number of departments lack direction, organization and roles are filled only externally rather than exploring current employees as candidates
- focus is shifting away from service and employee happiness and towards putting up numbers for the street, as expected
- New York work life is intense and draining. Other offices are more balanced, but word on the street is those employees are seen as lifestyle people, not career people (since they're not in NYC), so opportunity is limited"
204,The Trade Desk,"amazing product, good people (for the most part), but not a perfect company.",2017-07-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- first of all, TTD is an amazing product and clients absolutely love it. the commitment to service level is absolutely there. they're also one of the moral companies in ad-tech and the CEO, Jeff Green, is a genuinely good guy who does what he says he's going to do. 

- benefits are very solid (ESPP, 401k, vision is amazing, dental, health, etc.) and the company does take care of its employees in that respect. you can expect typical start-up checklist items like catered lunch twice a week, stocked fridges for snacks, standing desks, etc. in most offices.","- there have been some pretty severe commission issues and they do claw back commissions when receivables are unpaid by agencies. before this, several people were not getting paid for months at a time. for a company that touts transparency, there is frankly zero transparency into how people get what commission (AM teams get paid based off of some mysterious merit-based commission structure). 

- there's also an intensely kool-aid culture in some respects. i almost feel like i'm committing sacrilege by giving TTD less than 5 stars and putting my job security at risk. there are many situations where you'll be heavily vilified by other team members for leaving before 7-8 o'clock. this is not a WFH friendly company in almost all situations with a few exceptions and you should not expect to take any vacations sept-december. 

- i've heard that a couple VP-level folks are downright mean. keep in mind that for the most part, people are super super nice and great to be around so it really depends on your team."

207,The Trade Desk,Great company with great people,2017-05-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great people and great culture. The company ensures all employees have a clear career path with various opportunities to grow professionally and personally.,I've been with the company for 4 years and still struggle to find cons.
208,The Trade Desk,No place I'd rather be,2017-05-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"This company is the real deal.

I've  spent many years writing software and I've worked for many companies, the Trade  Desk has a very unique blend of culture, market position, strategy and success. 

The people here really like each other and enjoy the time that they spend together. The company understands how important culture is to their overall success and shows time and again that the culture cannot be risked in the pursuit of other goals. There is no lip-service to this here.

The engineering team has scaled very nicely using methodologies that many other companies wouldn't dare attempt; distribution of development around the world and shared ownership of all key components. There also is absolutely no benefit to being in the ""home office"". This is a tremendous benefit to the people that do not want to live in the expensive areas where tech and the advertising world tend to congregate. People can work on any project from any location around the world. That's very rare in the world of software development.

We celebrate company successes more than individual successes (though we recognize and celebrate those as well) and there is a constant focus on doing things that make the company and our customers successful.

There is a good mix of short-term and long-term focus in development. It is so easy in a world of limited resources and unlimited things to build to focus only on what can make us the most money tomorrow while not planning for what's needed in 6 months or a year. That always leads to tons of pain down the road.

Somehow, even with all of that, work/life balance is as good as it gets. People work hard and then go home. Our office lights up around 8am every day and nobody is ever there past 6:30p. Most people in the office work a solid 8.5 hour day and we typically eat lunch together, including two days a week when lunch is provided by the company.

tl;dr; best job I've ever had.",I really had to think about something significant here. It really is difficult to come up with something that I feel is much more difficult at the Trade Desk than other places that I've worked. The biggest difficulty in our office is that we can't find enough engineers who are qualified to do the job and who find their way through the door. Being from a not so well-known company definitely has it's drawbacks when it comes to recruiting new employees.
209,The Trade Desk,The best company I've worked for!,2017-05-23,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I've worked 15 years in the industry and this is the best work culture I've ever encountered.

During my first few weeks I was taken back by how warm and friendly everyone was. The company is very focused on helping new employees integrate and keeping.

After years of working for large corporations with copious amounts of politics, it is refreshing to work for a company where you can focus on the mission and be able to speak your mind.

If you are an individual who enjoys constantly learning, working on challenging problems, and contributing, this is a great place. However, if you are simply looking for a paycheck, love politics, or looking to the star in a sequel of “Office Space”, you probably should look elsewhere.","I don’t have real cons.

There is something to be said when everyone at the company is equally enthusiastic & dedicated to the company's goal. While the interview process was lengthy, it was reassuring to see how seriously they vetted every new hire to make sure they were a perfect fit. Additionally, I can not speak highly enough of their on boarding/training process. As I am new to this industry, it has been tremendously helpful to have such an in-depth process laid out for me.

253,The Trade Desk,Incredibly Company,2016-05-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been at The Trade Desk  for a little over a year and a half now, and I can honestly say that this has been, and continues to be, one of the best work experiences of my life. I chose to work here as a bit of a gamble; I'd never been in the advertising industry prior, and had another offer at a very well-known company. Something about TTD seemed like a better bet, however, and I am so glad I chose to go with it. 

Everyone at TTD is approachable, dedicated, reliable, and willing to help you if you need it. From the C-levels to the entry level folks, there is no barriers to separate you, and everybody is willing to do what they can to help. 

The technology and caliber-of-employee are, quite simply, the best in the business - leagues ahead of any of the competition. I wouldn't be surprised to see this company reaching over a thousand employees within the next few years, given the incredible growth and demand TTD is seeing. Plus, TTD promotes heavily from within, so the growth opportunities are vast (even cross-departmentally).

The company guidance is fantastic - Jeff is clearly in this for the long run. This is not one of the standard ""build it and sell it"" start ups that plague the technology industry (although, let's be honest - TTD is not a startup anymore :P).

I don't think I even need to mention how incredible TTD's culture is, despite having 300+ employees and 17+ offices. Just read some of the other reviews. It's never lost that ""tech start-up"" comradery, and it is a pleasure coming into work every day (in fact, Sundays no longer even feel like the end of the world). 

Perk-wise, there's not much more you could ask for. Fully stocked kitchen, beer and soda fridge, events, catered lunches, the occasional breakfasts, a yearly company-wide summit, darts, pool, the list goes on and on. 

Although I was hesitant to join TTD at first, to take a step away from the big-name companies I'd worked for prior, I am beyond glad I did. It is an incredible company with incredible employees.","The NY office is insanely crowded, but we'll be moving soon. And then I guess I'll probably complain about my chair being too green or something."

It feels like he has a crystal ball when positioning the company.  Everyone is excited to get to work.  Hard work is acknowledged and rewarded here.  It results in some incredible work ethics.  No place I'd rather be.,Get ready to work.  There is something new to learn every day.  Also get ready for a lot of interviews.
255,The Trade Desk,It doesn't get any better than TTD,2016-04-29,5.0,Sales,"I have learned more in my short tenure at The Trade Desk than any previous employer. The energy is infectious and the culture is collaborative. While the product is incredible and truly differentiated in a saturated DSP space, it is the people that make this place so special. I am legitimately excited to come into work every day. I did not know this was possible.","I cannot think of a single con. Yes, there is a LOT to learn, but the resources are available and plentiful. Regardless of how busy any one employee is, they are eager to help a fellow TTD-er."

The company is growing very quickly, but it does not seem to be negatively affecting anything"
257,The Trade Desk,This company takes care of you,2016-04-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This company takes care of you.  Jeff Green knows this fact:  You take care of your employees and your employees will give the best of themselves.  You take care of your employees and they make your company great.  Why wouldn't you?

I know people read glassdoor wanting to know about culture, pay, interview.  If you are on the business team at TTD, you should know that we value having incentives aligned.  Having a pay structure (read: base + commission)  where people are rewarded for the value they add both individually and as part of a team is fundamental to the way we work. Just remember what I said about ""this company takes care of you.""


The training and onboarding is great.

We value being good, smart, resilient, gritty people here, and doing transparent, honest business.","We work hard!  Sometimes I wonder if we work too hard...but it's so darn rewarding. I personally find work/life balance hard, but I do that to myself.

So many new products and being on the cutting edge of an omni-channel platform can be hard to keep up with!"
258,The Trade Desk,The Cultural Mecca of tech,2016-02-09,5.0,Trader,"TTD is an incredible company to work for. What it feels like to come to work here is unlike anything else I've ever experienced. All the offices have great camaraderie, and the company goes to great lengths to build and protect its culture. There is no other trait most vetted in candidates than cultural fit, and I'm very thankful this is the case. The company also feels like a small company, but has all the perks of a giant company, which is a very unique characteristic. The loyalty the company builds in its employees, as a result of the work environment they cultivate, pays huge dividends, as everyone is so committed to what we do here, and takes so much pride in protecting what we've built.",There is nothing to comes to mind.

Transparent and inspiring leaders.",I have not experienced any cons so far.
260,The Trade Desk,Amazing workplace environment!,2016-01-27,5.0,Account Coordinator,"The interview process at the Trade Desk is comprehensive, meaning that they want to make sure you're the perfect fit for the role and the company's culture as a whole. Though there's a good amount of interviews (I think I sat with at least 10 people), not once did I feel intimidated --  each interviewer radiated warmth and wants to communicate that passion with you!

Since I joined, I've found the onboarding and training process to be a dream -- not once have I felt without a paddle. As an entry-level client-facing employee, everyone - and I mean everyone - has pitched in to get me up to speed. 

I've found that the Trade Desk hires for the person more so than the role, and the result in the most inspired, driven, intelligent and well-rounded group of people I've ever worked with.",I'd be hard pressed to find any
261,The Trade Desk,Such a motivating environment!,2015-11-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"When I applied to work for The Trade Desk, I was so impressed by all the recognition it had received for its culture and work environment. Now that I'm here, coming into the office each day really serves as a reminder of why we've received so many accolades. Everyone here is extremely passionate, hardworking, and truly kind, and has so much pride in our product. It's great to be a part of a company that so highly values transparency of the business and has such respect for each of its employees. As an entry-level hire, it's difficult to imagine a stronger morale or more motivating environment than the one I get to experience everyday.",I can't think of any yet.
262,The Trade Desk,Account Management Coordinator,2015-11-03,5.0,Account Management Coordinator,"The Trade Desk offers a great training/on-boarding process. The training was super organized and in-depth, which was vital to someone like me who was new to the ad tech industry. The Account Management Coordinator role offers great exposure to client facing, and paves the way for a holistic understanding of the programmatic advertising and real-time-bidding. This company is headed in the right direction and is constantly called out by the major industry publications as being the best demand side platform in the space. The Trade Desk is ranked 9th on Forbes 2015 “Most Promising Companies” as well as Crain’s “2015 Best Places to Work”. This company has senior leadership that has a vision and will, without a doubt, change the way media is transacted. Working at The Trade Desk offers so much opportunity for growth as well! Put simply, this place is awesome!","On rare occasions, the kitchen runs out of chocolate covered almonds."
263,The Trade Desk,Best place to be in adtech!,2015-11-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The Trade Desk is one of the best places to be in the adtech industry right now. I have only had one previous employer but have never in my life been surrounded by so many motivated, intelligent, and driven people. Everyone comes together for a common goal, and it makes you want to do your best. Hearing our CEO’s vision for the future of the company is extremely inspiring and makes you excited for what’s to come. Not only are we a group of smart and driven individuals, we like to have fun and the company culture is amazing. From poker night to Halloween beer pong tournaments, I look forward to going into work every morning. In terms of career growth, there are both set career paths as well as the flexibility to move between departments. Because of our setup, you are exposed to every single department in some form or another, which definitely contributes to the great company culture as well as you are able to personally know every coworker in your particular office.",not really a “con” per se and I think it was mentioned in a previous post but make sure that you are committed to learning a ton before applying because there is something new to learn every single week and if you aren’t proactive to learn all of our new offerings it can be easy to fall behind. But that is also what makes working here so exciting and rewarding!
264,The Trade Desk,Keep it up!,2015-09-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"When I interviewed for the job, I could tell by everyone's enthusiasm that they really loved working here and had a lot of pride in the product.  Multiple interviewers mentioned this was the best job they've ever had, and now that I'm here, I couldn't agree more.  I'm inspired by the leadership every day.  I've honestly never worked for a company with so much transparency of the business, respect of peers entry to executive level, and genuine care for maintaining company culture.  We're protective of our company culture, and I'm impressed every day by how effective our hiring processes are and how thoughtful and generous with their time everyone is.

I have never been surrounded by such smart, motivated and generous people in my life.  I truly love coming into work every day because I am challenged and fulfilled.  

*We now have 401(k) matching, which was previously a ""con"" is several reviews.","Because you tend to care so much about the success of the company and your clients, it is difficult to separate work from your personal time, so I'm typically emailing with coworkers/clients when I'm not in the office.  It can get stressful at times, but because it's a team oriented environment you always have the necessary support."

This is a special place and I consider it a privilege to be a part of it.",Downtown Boulder location has it's commuting and parking challenges.  The frenetic pace of growth means some business and product processes are ill-defined or in their infancy.
269,The Trade Desk,Like Microsoft was 16 years ago...,2015-01-13,5.0,Senior Software Design Engineer,"The benefits and salary are great - the people and the culture are phenomenal.  The working environment reminds me of when I first started at Microsoft 16 years ago.  The company is close-knit and you'll make great friends at the same time as you work together to change how advertising is done now and in the future.  I've worked here for less than a year now, but I'm excited to see what we will be able to get done.

Technical work involves dealing with more than 1 million requests per second in the lab and testing and development are constantly moving the lab forward on a weekly basis.  Definitely a fun experience engaging in all components from the web UI to logging, bidding, caches and data analysis.

All of our meetings are distributed between Boulder, CO and Ventura, CA in small groups, so you get to know both sites well.  We use Skype and GoToMeeting with video to stay in touch so working from home is never an issue.

Next week everyone in the company will be getting together in Ventura, CA - the company and leadership really work hard to make this company an experience and not just a job.  Come and enjoy the journey!","Boulder parking lots are full so we have parking permits on the street, but a 2 block walk has actually been really enjoyable through Boulder side streets off Pearl Street.

272,The Trade Desk,Best place to be in Ad Tech,2014-10-16,5.0,Business Development,"Fantastic company full of the smartest, most driven people I’ve ever worked with. When it comes to product, I really feel like we are at the center of innovation—something new and exciting comes out literally every other week, so there’s no shortage of things to talk about with your clients, and the communication loop between product and those on the front lines is excellent—product prioritization is both transparent and responsive, and when something gets pushed back, you understand the strategic reasons why.  Also, the products actually work, and don’t get released until they do, which is a rarity in this industry that routinely sells the sizzle. Senior management is strategic and smart, and when it comes to our CEO, he is held is such regard that it almost feels cult-like, but the weird thing is it’s entirely deserved. He’s just one of those people who hires well and gets out of the way of his employees so he can focus on the big picture and where we should be headed next, and that’s a rare thing in a world where CEOs constantly micromanage their startups. We don’t really have politics, but that might be a function of our size. Overall, everyone feels extremely lucky to be here.","We’re moving so fast that ongoing and initial training is vital, but it’s not yet consistent across departments or offices. It’s definitely a sink or swim mentality, so if don’t have the motivation to actively train yourself and look for ways to contribute, you will definitely start to feel left out, because everyone else here is so driven."

We have a flat structure that focuses on contribution over process.  Management has the best vision of any company I've worked for, not just for the company, but the market.  From an engineering perspective, we are pushing the limits of technology and working with the bleeding edge, making every day a ton of fun.","Training and mentoring is not super extensive or in-depth, which means that you need to swim or sink."
274,The Trade Desk,"Finally, a home within media",2014-09-03,5.0,Director of Sales,"I am inspired, challenged and learning every single day. The whole team is gifted and I feel lucky to be a part of it. I can honestly say that we're all working towards the same goals and go the extra mile to get there daily.

If you're looking for a long-term fit and a challenging position, apply! The company is growing, so there is plenty of opportunity for career advancement.

Exceptional benefits (health care, vacation, etc.).","There are minimal 'processes' in place, which is a good thing, but a con for me since I came from a large company- the King of processes/form. Also, they don't match any 401k."
