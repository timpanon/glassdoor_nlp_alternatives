0,Thumbtack,The BEST company ever.,2022-04-04,5.0,Chat Support,"I joined Thumbtack 3 years ago and so far this is the best company I've worked with. I am with the working force for more than 30 yrs already. They are very employee centric company. They made sure that you are covered in everything that you need and not just only me, including my family. Right now, I am able to look after my kids and my dogs due to the remote work model first. Aside from that, they are making sure that everything that you need is provided for. Now, we are a global company and they even have ERG that you can join.","You can't just transfer to a different department. You need to excel first in the department you are in before you can transfer, and the cons are what if your current position is not something that you can shine and provide the best that you can be."

2,Thumbtack,Overworked and underpaid,2022-03-24,3.0,Trust and Safety Specialist,"Strong sense of community, loved the team.","The expectations Thumbtack had for its employees are unrealistic, to say the least. It felt like no matter how hard you tried, no matter how much overtime you worked, there was no way to meet the standards they set for employee success. On top of that, very little opportunities for growth and development exist. It was hard constantly providing the same feedback about the issues with expectations only to be met with no change and watch everyone around me burn out."

Weeklong company shutdown over Christmas and one week in the summer. The engineering culture is collaborative and focused on continuous improvement. Everyone is always willing to help others. Lots of room for career growth, but you have to be proactive about it. Thumbtack is great about communication and has to be one of the most transparent companies that exists. Oh, and pay and benefits are right up there with tier 1 tech companies!","The wokeness and focus on diversity and inclusion are mostly genuine efforts, but can be tiresome at times.

Constantly getting messages from co-workers miserable and complaining."
38,Thumbtack,Not worth the effort,2021-09-25,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Remote work is the only thing.,"When joining the company I was so excited about the culture and growth they talked so highly about. That easily went away when new leadership came in… what brought so many people to TT and kept them was turned upside down. MTS and CS are overworked and very undervalued. Numbers are important but at what cost?! In addition to this I believe Marco only cares about how much valuation he’s bringing in and in turn price gauges leads for the pros, it’s very unfair system for them and robs them every day. They talk about ROI for pros but the numbers are WAY OFF. The sales team tricks people into buying packages some pros not realizing what they sign up for at all. The perks and benefits they advertise are not worth the life you get drained out of you. There’s absolutely no growth opportunity unless you’re friends with someone and with this they will hire their friends with no experience. 

I could go on for hours but will save everyone the reading.

Now Thumbtacks social support team will reply with the standard “we hear you and we wish you the best of luck” and ask for people to come in and leave 4 good reviews for the 1 bad."

Pros are being robbed of money with the ridiculous price gauging and refund policies. Support and MTS team are over worked and incredibly abused by these pros and customers, I get where pros are coming from. New leadership for Support didn't care about keeping culture only wanted to impress Marco and then started hiring only from her previous company. Growth is nearly impossible, you can be doing everything for the company and they'll hire a friend with no experience. This place truly crushed me and burned my out so bad, I've always prided myself on being a hard working but it didn't feel worth it here and made me depressed every morning."

Health care coverage is great and maternity/paternity leave is competitive with other tech companies. Benefits are the only thing making me give the company 2 stars as opposed to 1 in this review.,"You'll see several reviews left in early 2020 from disgruntled employees that were laid off due to COVID. While it may seem easy to dismiss those reviews given the circumstances, but let me give you a review from an employee that spent several years at Thumbtack and survived COVID layoffs. You'll see that the feedback given by those employees that were laid off is valid feedback and should be taken into consideration when deciding what kind of company you'd like to work for. I'll keep this as short as possible but I think every potential hire has the right to hear what it's really like working at Thumbtack.

I'll start off by saying that every month or so Thumbtack sends out a survey to employees and one of the questions is, ""would you recommend Thumbtack to a friend?"" For at least the last year my answer has consistently been ""no"". If ""strong no"" was an option then that's what I would be selecting.

Thumbtack doesn't care about your career growth. You're simply a cog in their machine. There is a total lack of career mapping and leadership never discussed growth opportunities with me despite asking to have the conversation many many times. If you ever decide you want to move on from Thumbtack you will be replaced by another cog that is less qualified and will do your job for less money since Thumbtack doesn't like going out and backfilling positions externally--they will find someone internally that can fill the gap. They very much operate with a ""next up"" mindset. They then underpay those employees because they have less experience or are less qualified but fully expect them to carry out the responsibilities of those employees that have left. Despite how long you've worked there, you can very well expect a ""don't let the door hit you on the way out"" attitude from the company if you decide to leave.

The product team operates in their own bubble in San Francisco and regularly pushes out product updates with no warning or education regarding the updates being rolled out. This leaves support and success teams floundering when discussing product changes with Thumbtack customers and businesses on the platform.

The sales team is a runaway train at this point. Thumbtack will do everything necessary to continue growing the sales team and they will provide whatever is necessary to scale and grow that team. If you're expecting internal support then be ready to fight sales for resources since they are priority #1.

There is a revolving door of leadership at Thumbtack. Leaders come in and often don't stick around long when they figure out how things are run at Thumbtack. Expect change often as you'll likely have new leaders regularly. In my experience, leadership is also extremely out of touch with what is going on with their respective teams. They are so underwater with outstanding tasks or projects that limited support and unfulfilled promises are very much the norm.

I'll wrap this up with an analogy: if you're a top draft pick in the NFL draft and you really want to win a Super Bowl, do you really want to be drafted by the New York Jets? You'll only go so far with a poor coach, bad ownership, and a lack of a gameplan. Plus, good luck getting another team to look at you if you hang around long--being the best player on the New York Jets isn't necessarily impressive.

Now cue the Thumbtack damage control team with a standardized statement about how they are grateful for my time at Thumbtack (or at least I'm hoping they respond since no one ever thanked me after several years working for the company)."

79,Thumbtack,Great Place to Work,2021-02-22,5.0,Operations Manager,"Thumbtack really cares about its people and has made very visible efforts to make sure benefits are fair and equal across locations as much as possible. Thumbtack has great benefits and flexible time off, they support you in having a life outside of work. I've always felt that Thumbtack was an inclusive place, I've always felt welcome and comfortable being myself. Overall there is a great culture and they support the person, not the employee.","As Thumbtack has grown, the opportunity for growth within the company has gotten slightly more difficult. There may be a wait before a significant career advancement opportunity presents itself. I think this would be the case for any quickly-growing business. However, they do a great job of supporting skills and educational advancement so you can always be improving even if there is not a promotion readily available."

And of course, the work Thumbtack is trying to accomplish is inspiring and the opportunity for success is big.","Leadership, specifically Marco. Over the years I've watched him transform from a humble, easygoing co-founder, to a CEO that seems angry and annoyed when anyone questions him. it's been hard to watch him make mistakes impacting hundreds of people and prioritize money over small business owners that are hurting. Unfortunately, Thumbtack leadership as a whole has a long way to go. Women and other underrepresented minorities don't have a seat at the table. And there really is no excuse for that.

Another problem they have is their product. Their product vision is a mess. I'm all for pivoting and trying new things, but many of the experiments and updates teams roll out equal a poor user experience and rarely benefit the end user. 

Another issue I had working there was career development. They make a lot of promises but rarely follow through. The requirements for promotion also vary across teams and roles and isn't consistent. The reasons they give for promoting one person, but not another don't make sense."

92,Thumbtack,"Thumbtack Review - creative, huh?",2020-12-23,4.0,Software Engineer,"I have been at Thumbtack for less than 1 year (similar to many other TT-ers). I have never been to the office, but I hear there was an amazing culture pre-Covid. The company is pretty spread out already with teams in SF, Salt Lake City, Toronto, and the Philippines. 

Based on hiring since Covid started, I would be surprised to see a strong move to have everyone back in an office post covid. Though, I do think that there will still be a majority of employees working a reasonable amount of time in an office with exceptions for roles that can largely be done remotely (engineering comes to mind). There have been leadership role hires outside the Bay, which seems to have been rare (non-existent) pre-Covid. 

This year was a rollercoaster for the company, but luckily things seem to be looking good going into the end of the year. People are optimistic about the future, and there are a lot of new, strong ICs and Leaders that joined to help continue the current momentum into the new year and beyond.

Pros:
- Overall the people at Thumbtack are smart and kind.
- The people team really does try to create an awesome culture (even while working remotely).
- Leadership at the highest levels seems aligned and focused, with clear goals in mind.
- There is a lot of freedom to try things and experiment, as well as own your area of the product.
- TT Bucks, Internet, Phone Reimbursement, Good comp
- Remote events show that the people at TT also have skills outside of work (singers, poets, chefs, athletes, overall musicians - people are crazy talented)
- The work on my team is interesting, the problems are hard, and the data are actually quite clean (not the dumpster fire of most companies) - so the opportunities are large.","Cons:
- There are a lot of new people, and (like a lot of other startups) also reasonably high attrition, which can make it hard to move in an aligned direction and know where everything is to help move together. Some TT-ers seem to still be holding hard feelings from layoffs earlier this year.
- There are a lot of things that aren't figured out or haven't been built that you might expect a company that has been around for 12 years to have already figured out. Why this is the case - could be related to attrition - there is a lot of poaching of TT talent, but I am truly not sure. Could be that the problems are hard - yea, they are, but I don't totally buy that... 
- Note: Many of these projects seem to be on the roadmap, but from my observation, short-term wins often seem to take priority over these lengthy investments. In the remote world, my view isn't super far into what other teams are working on.
- I have been here almost a year and have not once had a talk about growth or a performance review from my manager. Potentially folks being overlooked due to not having these conversations also leads to attrition? 
- No 401k match"

94,Thumbtack,How not to handle COVID layoffs,2020-12-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Many before COVID, none now.","The leadership team decided to lay off 250+ employees right at the beginning of the pandemic (late March 2020). We were all given 3.5 weeks severance pay, regardless of tenure or level. All 250 of us were told that our jobs had been eliminated on a pre-recorded 3min Zoom call with the CEO. Immediately after the Zoom call ended, our laptops were shutdown remotely. We later were instructed to ship the laptops back to HQ and that was it. 

This was a truly cold and heartless decision that was ultimately unnecessary. It was handled sloppily and executed with callousness and ambivalence. 

The most egregious actions came immediately after they layoffs. A large number of employees on the people ops team were promoted and likely received comp increases. The people charged with leading this braindead layoff process were then immediately rewarded with promotions. What a joke. Extremely disappointing."

It was really important to me that I found a company that actually lived their values, and I can confidently say that Thumbtack does. Our values are at the foundation of everything we do. 

Something else I really appreciate is how open and honest our senior leadership team is. It's not common to work for a company that is so transparent, so it's very refreshing.

Thumbtack really cares about their employees, especially through the pandemic that we're facing. They've given us extra paid holidays to support our mental health. They also hold workshops to learn more about mental health, healthy habits for working from home, empowering women, and so much more. They even have fun yoga classes taught by a Thumbtack pro, which is my personal favorite! This is just a small glimpse of the benefits you get for working here.

Overall, I love Thumbtack. I can't wait to see how much I will grow by working here!","As of now, I haven't seen any cons of working for Thumbtack."

Many times, the decisions are made among several people. Sometimes, 2-3 analysts were responsible for same PM or team. And the leadership team only took advice from the lead analyst.

Flexible work from home even before the pandemic. Health and safety of employees are a priority.","No longer customer focused. Sales is pushing increased revenue, but Thumbtack is purposely employing so little staff that customers wait excessive amounts of time for issues to be addressed.
Older female employees do not last long here. The majority of women in senior leadership older than 40 has been pushed out or laid off by the ""moral compass"". Anyone with the audacity to disagree with People Ops becomes a target.
Marco condones individuals in People Ops who bully, make derogatory comments publicly about employees, and have extreme integrity issues; even calling them the company's ""moral compass"" . All escalations of inappropriate behavior in People Ops have been brushed off possibly not even looked into. Disciplinary action is not equitable. Someone can steal thousands of dollars and still be employed while someone else will be terminated for far less.
Customer support is no longer a collaborative entity. One person controls all meetings. One person speaks through the majority of these meetings. Managers were even told to stop having one on one meetings with each other.
Planning used to be a collaborative process with employees on several levels providing ideas and input. Now one person creates all planning initiatives and dictates them to the team. Input from anyone at a ""level"" beneath Director level is routinely ignored. Titles are more important than actual knowledge.
Turnover has increased exponentially in Salt Lake. The atmosphere is now that of a typical outsourcing call center. Constant back to back contacts with no end in sight.
The hierarchy of San Francisco as most important, Salt Lake as 2nd class, and Philippines as 3rd class employees has returned."

The executive team (this includes execs recently called out in a negative light on GD) has high integrity and they are more transparent with their employees than any other employer I have worked for. I believe the reviews in disagreement with this sentiment haven't worked for very many other companies and have a very limited view of the world. 
The company works hard to provide its employees with incredible benefits and perks. There are development opportunities (which come in different ways than simply climbing the ladder) for those who are driven and passionate about their work. One area that they are really doubling down on recently is building flexibility and support in a remote environment. They are rolling out a remote work support fund to assist in the cost of family care (child care, elder care, tutoring) and continuing education options. As a working parent, I am so very grateful for the flexibility that allows me to bring my whole self to work and also help my child with online school this year. 
The business is doing very well! They have hired and promoted people into leadership roles who are having an incredible impact early and it is showing in the business performance. This is incredible given the uncertain times we are in and yes, we did have a layoff but I will say that I admired the fact that the execs took action quickly. It was a very hard thing to do but necessary given the circumstances. I have worked in other start-ups that waited beyond the point of no return.",It is a very analytical company and there are times when they get absorbed in the data rather than acting.

It was a bit of an adjustment to my past jobs but not anything I couldn't do. I hit quota every month just fine. During the fall of last year they started hiring so many new sales representatives. We were all concerend they were growing too quickly. They assured us they weren't even though we all knew it wasn't a good idea. Then they started firing people left and right. Then COVID struck. My team had the best sales out of all of the other teams and almost every single one of us had a PR in sales. My whole team but 2 people were laid off. Explain to me why the best sales team from March would be the ones chosen to lay-off? Under all of the pressure of the first month of quarantine and working from home, cut the only team that made record sales and worked the hardest? Not logical but thanks Marco. I can't even begin to talk about how emotionless Marco was when laying off his employees. It was a Zoom call and then immediatly after, our laptops shut off. We couldn't say bye to anyone, didnt know who else was laid off, was not sure what was going to happen next... So inhumane, so disgusting. I tell everyone I know to never go near Thumbtack if you are looking for a job. They make you think they care by giving you free food but when push comes to shove, they don't care about you :) so find somewhere better, trust me, it is easy to do. Try Mcdonalds.

The company is at a scale where there are serious problems to tackle on the product, BI, and technical sides of the company.","Leadership is poor and has a high turnover rate. Management does not care for their reports and ICs are left to fend for themselves. Decisions are made based on who speaks the loudest, defaulting to whoever has the highest level. ICs have little input in what they work on and sometimes boil down to little more than highly-paid contractors instead of software engineers. This leads to an overall culture where engineering holds the product hostage and blocks (purposefully or otherwise) the implementation of new features."
117,Thumbtack,Thumbtack used to be a great place to work in customer support. Now? Avoid at all costs.,2020-08-11,1.0,Customer Support Specialist,"Thumbtack had a unique culture with a startup mentality where people come first. At one time, CS agents had the autonomy to ""do the right thing,"" and go out of their way to make sure we were giving the best assistance possible. Our role was to help the users of our site succeed and understand how to make the most of the product.","There was a drastic decline in culture and the embodiment of company values in Customer Support when the new CS director took over in 2019. It became like any other soul-crushing call center job. We were consistently understaffed, which was intentional to save money, but extremely stressful and draining to CS agents. The call volume was relentless, and we were encouraged to be less helpful so that calls would be shorter.  Our users seemed to be increasingly losing faith in us, as customer support is the face of Thumbtack. The attendance policy was changed to require everyone to work despite previously planned vacation, etc. if an especially busy day was forecasted. We lost all the great perks and benefits that set Thumbtack apart from other companies."

HR is a joke they do not listen and associates are scared of them. They get rid of the people that are good assets. They promote the ones that are loud, but not qualified. If you want to talk about anything that is of concern they push you off. They are not transparent at all and avoid answering real questions. They value sales more then engineering team. Real leaders stay away because they can see the lies of management. HR was also pretty much untouched during COVID layoffs by D&I was and now they want that role back. They laid off people then offered them jobs in a lower role and some. Ad no choice but to come back. Very poor ethics overall."

121,Thumbtack,"Incompetent Leadership, Hypocritical Culture -> Ship is Sinking",2020-07-08,2.0,Undisclosed,"- When times were good pre-2020, Thumbtack cultivated a culture of transparency, humility, and work-life balance.
- All my managers for the most part prioritized my professional development and supported me to do my job in a fulfilling way. 
- Most of my coworkers were a pleasure to work with. There wasn't as much politics as other companies at my level due to some good operating processes set up.
- The onsite meals were great and the culinary team was world-class.","But a company's true character shows when times are tough, and Thumbtack completely failed the test. In a founder-CEO company, the true color of company morals is usually a manifestation of the character of the CEO, and I am extremely disappointed how Marco handled the last few months. While Marco had issues pre-pandemic (most prominently, his inability to put together a good executive team and broker cohesion amongst them), I still believed that his overall capability and moral compass would guide Thumbtack through ups and downs. I was wrong:

- The covid layoff was a disaster and you can read more about it in the previous reviews. 3 months later both former and current employees are still reeling. Go compare how you handled the layoff to how Brian Chesky handled the Airbnb layoff, night and day difference. Just go read Airbnb's Glassdoor reviews around the same time frame and you will see laid off employees not nearly as scarred.

- The icing on the cake is laying off the entire DEI team. Then when BLM protests happened, trying to claim in a public blog post diversity and inclusion is top priority and that they would prioritize hiring DEI folks, without mentioning that they actually laid off the entire DEI team just a couple months ago. Utter hypocrisy.

- A lot of the executive team are not qualified. They can't get along with each other. And they keep leaving or keep getting fired. This again illustrates the incompetence of the CEO:
 -> 4 CPOs over a few years with the last one getting straight up laid off. I think Marco doesn't know how to have a CPO and needs full control over the product.
 -> No one on the executive team has stayed for more than 3-4 years. The last few years saw complete turnover of the exec team. The current CTO, who's actually qualified, just quit.
 -> Unqualified people keep getting put onto the exec team. Just one example, the current head of Design has never worked as a Product Designer, but rather a User Researcher and was in school only a few year ago."

Even though the company wasn't profitable before, it's weird that we laid off over 200 employees and now we're being told things are looking good, even better than ever. Also, our CTO just quit, claiming it was time to take a break and maybe that's true, but who knows. Many of us don't know what or who to believe anymore. The few people who have interviewed here in the last two months ask questions about our culture and we're told to focus on the positive but they can just read this page and see all the stories. And I just saw a negative review below had the wrong copy/paste template response as if the review was praising the team. Engineers are going to keep quitting here, it's been months since the layoffs and morale and culture continue to suffer. I read a story that they tried to hire back our old head of diversity after laying him off not too long ago. Who would've thought that was a good idea? These are such ""senior"" leaders and they don't know the rule of burning bridges?"

Thumbtack used to have a wonderful culture, where actions matched company values, employees were genuinely appreciated, and decisions were made in the best interest of the small businesses and employees. I had the opportunity to work with a lot of intelligent and hardworking people that drove me perform highly and learn new skills.","Culture shifted to one that includes a lack of transparency, poor management, actions of leadership don't align with company values. Thumbtack also does a really poor job of implementing feedback from the small businesses that rely on them. It became very clear that revenue is the only driver of decisions at Thumbtack, probably due to the amount funding from Sequoia Capital; I'd imagine they're very concerned about their ROI. 

The lack of loyalty to employees also really stands out, Thumbtack let go off many tenured, loyal, and high performing employees due to Covid.

Head of Diversity & Inclusion and many ERG leads were let go as well, but due to current events Thumbtack is claiming D&I is a priority. Just one example of Thumbtack talking the talk but not walking the walk."
128,Thumbtack,It's gone from bad to worse...,2020-06-10,1.0,Success,"I am not sure I can really list out a pro for Thumbtack anymore. The only pro I can give is that, they gave us a definitive timeframe that is far out into the future for work from home so that we can plan our lives accordingly.","When the layoffs happened things were pretty bad. A lot of people felt blindsided, but you can read more about that in the previous reviews. Our success organization in the last 6 months has made 3-4 significant changes at the detriment to the employees. Morale is incredibly low, and no one seems to really care. We hear a lot of ""we're working on this"", ""we hear you"", ""your feedback matters"". But we're going on 3 months of a really bad working environment and it's only getting worse by the day. We have managers who can't manage the amount of employees they now have underneath them, managers who are unable to make decisions and best of all managers who are unresponsive and non-communicative to their employees. Some teams went from 12-15 employees and are down to three, doing even more work and with less pay due to the layoff pay cuts. We communicate to management that we can’t take on anymore and we’re at capacity and all we get told is “I hear you”.  There seems to be no one who can even help anymore. Management and HR's version of help is ""we hear you"". Great, so what can we do about it. Thumbtack is going down a hole that I am not sure they will be able to dig themselves out of, specifically for this department. Majority of the team is looking for new opportunities, but at this point, I am not sure anyone cares."

That being said, I should be much further in my career than I am. They stunted my growth, they played favorites, and HR didn’t protect us. We weren’t paid to industry standards. 

Management, before I was laid off, was getting to a better point, but prior to that management was awful. They played favorites and had hidden agendas. They threw people under the bus, and sometime the people they threw got let go for “performance.” Many of the people in leadership positions should have NEVER been in leadership positions.

I was taken for granted, my skills were taken for granted, my entire team was taken for granted and it hurts me to my core. I gave you two stars because I love what Thumbtack is doing to help businesses. I will continue to use Thumbtack, but I do NOT recommend working for a company who has hidden agendas, who lacks transparency, and who lays off 250 employees without batting an eye.

132,Thumbtack,Two-faced company towards new employees - Very Disappointed,2020-05-26,1.0,Product,"- Workspace is very nice and chill, free lunch and snacks.
- Coworkers are friendly and willing to help.
- Initial learning opportunity is good for new employees. Until everything happened later, I was learning a lot about the company and the product and really enjoyed my work.","- Worst possible way to layoff 250 employees
It is understandable that many companies are suffering during this crisis and have to layoff employees. What differentiates a good company and a bad company is really how it handles the layoff. Thumbtack is definitely NOT good - hiding the decision and playing around with words on layoff-related questions during AllThumb meetings. The layoff meeting is literally 3-5 minutes with the CEO just reading a script saying it's your last day with a neutral face. Then laptops are immediately shut -> probably the fastest IT team during the layoff season. Ironically, revenue went up and almost back to normal just couple days after the layoff. Wondering how the decision is made? 

- Two-faced treatment
The team is very friendly and helps each other, creating a very good work environment before COVID hits in middle March. However, throughout the layoff, as mentioned in other reviews, the true color of this company is revealed. Like some other people, my manager never reached out to explain what happened, though showed signs of negligence days before the layoff.
Completely agrees with ""One week after [layoff], promotions of the remaining employees started trickling in on linkedin. Downright UNETHICAL and INSENSITIVE while a number of us are still reeling from the job loss."" I have to admit, it is heart-warming when seeing some coworkers I never worked with willing to help me during my job search. It is also disappointed that some people I regard as teammates are just so cold during this difficult time -> that's why I feel the company as a whole just has a culture of two-faced treatment when there's no longer any value/benefit to be extracted from you.

- Company values look good for outsiders, but that's it
The severance package is by far the WORST among tech companies, especially during this WORLDWIDE HEALTH CRISIS. Many people still need to feed their families and worry about the health of their families -> Thumbtack is definitely not considerate at all. Moreover, a month after the layoff, posts again appearing on LinkedIn suggesting this company is praised for providing support for wfh supplies. Remember a month ago it doesn't willing to provide better severance pay."

134,Thumbtack,Best Startup I Have Worked At Thus Far,2020-05-26,4.0,Recruiter,"Transparency. Stability. Knowledgeable and strategic leadership.

I have worked for six startups across the country. Startups are risky because you never really know the stability until you get in the office. I have been laid off four times from startup environments. 
The reason I joined Thumbtack is for the ""recession proof"" product. I did not want to be laid off again and felt the market was leaning that way when I joined. 

My managers and the founders were transparent in most avenues, more so than I have ever experienced. The first few weeks I was there I saw clear revenue reports, met everyone on the leadership team, and most of the directors that I would be reporting to. I had clear goals but the way to achieve those was left to me. I appreciate that I was given the opportunity to learn and flourish on my own while having a supportive team of managers behind me to help with any issues or questions I had.

As I continued with Thumbtack I felt trusted, relied on, and appreciated. That combined with the support I have received really opened my eyes to how offices could be run. I also enjoyed the whole team. Working in SF it is so easy to run into tech egos and complete lack of perspective (ie: privileged af) . Thumbtack was a breath of fresh air. All the big company perks with the big company jerks.","Post Covid Morale

Thumbtack saw its first lay off with the emergence of Covid-19. I will admit, the layoff process was cold but I understood from a business perspective. It is hard to ensure the safety of a company's networks and assets when saying goodbye to 250 people at the same time. But, it also had to protect those things to protect the 600 some odd employees remaining. My two cents, no one expected this lay off. Mistakes were made. It sucks. People are hurt. Perspective, Thumbtack did one big lay off in one solid move to ensure future runway and limit debt incursion. For those that are still there, I am glad they are with a company who thinks strategically and doesn't drop 30% of its staff more than once as we are seeing in other companies in this market."
135,Thumbtack,Lacking real leadership,2020-05-25,1.0,Full Time Employee,"Amazing food when we were in the office
Good work/life balance when in the office","- I didn't get laid off during the mass layoff but the way it was handled really upset many people including me and leadership never addressed head on why they were so heartless. It was a ton of platitudes and avoiding the real question. Just take a look at the copied and pasted responses to all the reviews to understand the type of stuff we hear weekly as questions are asked. There are things that need to be done to keep a business alive, but there are more humane ways to do it (literally any other way would have been better). 
- Performance across teams and offices are uneven, which comes across as unfair, making it difficult to get promoted. Leaders don't even seem aware of the numerous people issues or at least they don't care about them. 
- The culture seems to really vary based on the team you are on and if you end up on the wrong team then it's difficult to move up because of the inconsistencies stated above.
- Leadership and management in general can never seem to take ownership of mistakes they've made or continue to make which makes it difficult to give meaningful feedback without fear of repercussions. This is even harder because feedback is not anonymous.
- Benefits have deteriorated in the past year including pay cuts"
136,Thumbtack,All good things must come to an end!,2020-05-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The culinary staff and ERG Leaders. Unfortunately all laid off.,"Unfortunately all good things must come to an end, and that is the case for Thumbtack's culture and employee morale. Once a thriving employer has seen it's business decisions both internally and externally cause massive waves of attrition across multiple departments (this is well documented) and in masses in 2018 and 2019. 2020 saw Covid layoffs of 250 employees a mere 2 weeks into lockdown (Huge cash issue signal) including many ERG Leads, and all Diversity staff. Struggling to find CPO and CFO. Valuation is barely beating inflation over past 4 years. The work is meaningful but the culture is completely shot unfortunately. Many left there after layoffs are actively interviewing."
137,Thumbtack,Worst place for mid-senior people to grow,2020-05-18,1.0,Product,"Robust infrastructure to support new product launches
Detailed documentations for new hires to get hands on quickly","*Worst place for mid-senior people to grow*
Thumbtack is great for new grads to learn and grow but not for mid-senior people. Overall, Thumbtack SUFFERS FROM HIRING SENIOR PEOPLE for all teams. 75% of my teams was at my level. 25% was below me. There were no seniors above my level except my manager. Managers spent more time on managing up and judging you based on limited knowledge. You would think you could learn from XFN teams but after just a few months, half of the senior people from XFM teams left. What a coincidence!

*Unfair evaluation + non-competitive pay*
The 360 performance review was completely unfair. Managers ignored XFN teams say about you and made ratings based on pre-judgement. There were no salary raise + no bonus + no 401k match. I would SUGGEST incoming new hires NEGOTIATE YOUR BASE SALARY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. Because you had no chance to raise your pay unless getting promoted. That’s another reason why the average tenure at Thumbtack is less than 2 years. 

*How Thumbtack lose top talents during layoff*
5-minutes Zoom layoff message from our CEO Marco marked the ending of ~250 employees life with Thumbtack. Everyone understood the difficult times Thumbtack went through. However, the 250 employees had no individual 1:1 with their HR partner or senior leaders to know specific reasons but forcing to face a lockout screen in front of them. This poorly handled layoff message not only made the talents you laid off NEVER WANT TO CONSIDER THUMBTACK AGAIN but also give survivors a big cue to start to look for new opportunities ASAP. Oh forgot to say, the revenue went up in 10 days since the layoff. Are we really running out of the $150m money received 9 months ago?

*Less feeling like a family”
After laying off, my team never hosted a goodbye party for us. My manager also didn’t call me to explain what has happened. Totally echo the comment below
“Thumbtack laid off ~250 employees as a result of the covid pandemic. One week after, promotions of the remaining employees started trickling in on linkedin. Downright UNETHICAL and INSENSITIVE while a number of us are still reeling from the job loss.”

Yes, that’s happening everywhere and it was a necessary business decision, but the way it was delivered was not good. Employees were left scrambling to call their managers and peers trying to figure out what next steps were after being let go. Computers were shut off within minutes (we weren’t told they would be cutoff so quickly, no time for goodbyes) and we barely got 3 weeks of pay and about 4 weeks of health insurance. So many teams, and we’re given absolutely zero details on who they decided to cut. Even executives and long-tenured employees CHOSE to leave alongside those layed-off. I’m not even sure if there’s a recruiting team there anymore but I imagine Thumbtack is no longer a “best workplace”."

140,Thumbtack,Avoid Thumbtack If You are a Doer,2020-05-06,2.0,Analytics,I loved my team and my manager to death. It was a team of great people who really tried to help me grow. I was fortunate to work with them and they became some of my best friends in SF. The tech infrastructure is also decent. When I do analysis seldomly would I face blockers from data infra. I also like the accessibility of information. You can learn what other teams are doing easily from reading their decks and dashboards.,"(I’m biased because I was impacted by the COVID layoff)
The leadership promoted some of the worst culture a tech company could have. First, Thumbtack culture had stifled innovation in favor of predictability and forecast. If you interview, ask them if they can name one big innovation Thumbtack had succeeded in the past year. Second, the leadership is more a politician who cared about appearance more than execution. Not only would it would never admit to strategic failures, it celebrated the silver linings as success. Third, instead of defending the truth, the business analysts were forced to hack analysis to deliberately confirm the result leadership wants to see, and those numbers were used to set company annual planning. Lastly, the leadership is a hypocrite. They will tell you how they cared about employees by doing PC things like paternity leaves, while laying off 30% people without any performance based review."

The actual job itself is pretty standard to a call center job, however, it doesn't feel that way because of how many fun things are going on at Thumbtack. There is a very open feel, as there are no cubicles, couches to sit on, weekly meetings with leadership, that makes you feel like you are included in the process.  You get catered lunches Mon-Fri which save a ton of money especially since they are great caterers that make the food fresh every day,  kombucha on tap, and tons of snacks to munch on. There is a gym to use, and tons of events to break up the monotony of the work week. Culture is everything here! Oh and you get ""Thumbtack bucks"" to use quarterly which can save you a lot of money on your personal projects you'd use the site for on your own.","Constant changes with teams and the product itself, this can be good or bad depending on how you like a changing environment. For me I don't mind but I know some people have a hard time with it. There is not as much room for growth as I would like, it seems a lot of people when they get to where I am at have left for other companies after applying for multiple positions here and not getting them. There has been talk of getting a bonus structure built out for quite a while, but nothing put in place yet and it's been over a year.

Well someone at Thumbtack thought it was cool and turned that into a policy. Now it becomes the norm to have to message the coworker sitting right next to you to ask a question, because they wear their headphones on.
- At some point, someone pointed out that employees should clean after themselves and not leave their mugs behind.

Honestly so many things I know I am forgetting.
Regardless of your personality, you'll find a friend here there are so many different people that work here with so many interests and hobbies it fun coming into work and getting to know all the kind people you work around.",Honestly the only con I think of is that no one has an office which is great for team building but at the same time distracting. If you need your own quiet space you'll need to work anywhere else other than your own desk. But there are plenty of empty conference rooms and comfy couches where you can work with fewer distractions.
244,Thumbtack,Out of touch leadership can't retain quality employees,2018-05-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Thumbtack's historical bar for hiring is shown in the quality of team members. Employees are incredibly smart, talented and humble.

-The food is amazing","- The management team is incredibly out of touch with employees. They boast about the great culture that stopped existing a year ago. Every week employees are told that ""There has never been a more exciting time to be at Thumbtack"" while almost half of an entire team quit in a 4 month time period. No leadership member is held accountable for this attrition.

- Promotions are incredibly rare, and people can excel at their jobs for 2+ years without any tangible career progression.

- Employees are starting to loose faith in product direction."

Everyone seems to value each other's time, fulfillment, happiness, and well being. Being at work is a genuinely enjoyable experience - partly because of the people, and partly because the work we're doing is towards making something really exciting.

Employees are truly happy, kind, and great to work with. 

The in-house culinary team is absolutely incredible. Friends from other companies frequently ask to ""stop-by and have lunch."" 

Executives truly care about building a thoughtful product.","While the benefits are great (health insurance with no monthly premium, phone reimbursement, and delicious food) they could look to match other companies with perks like a fitness reimbursement, fertility benefits, and  401K match.

They are constantly working to make the environment competitive and rewarding. Those who don't survive here don't work hard.",Very laid back to the point where some employees push the limit to unprofessional - napping at work or wearing in appropriate work attire.
256,Thumbtack,Management Changes Killed The Culture,2018-01-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Thumbtack offers a lot of perks and benefits, including a generous PTO policy, laptops for work and personal use, free lunches, tons of snacks, coffee machines, fun company events, etc. The company vision is something that I believed in from day one, and still do. They want small businesses to grow and succeed. It shows, especially when you visit the San Francisco office. There's a lot of energy behind that vision.","In the Salt Lake office, the culture was once laid-back, fun, and amazing. At the time I started working there, it was hands-down the best place to work in Utah. People were promoted based on hard work and drive. Employees constantly went above and beyond because at that time, you were recognized for doing so.

Now, however, the Salt Lake office has become riddled with political agendas and favoritism. Managers that were once friendly with their employees became bosses, pushing numbers instead of empowering people. People get promoted based on their friendships outside of work with their managers, rather than their actual achievements. (For example: The people who go out drinking with the boss are the ones that get the most attention, rather than the ones that keep their heads down.) You can have the exact same metrics as someone else, but they'll get promoted over you because they're sucking up and you're not. This never, EVER used to be allowed at Thumbtack (most managers would be annoyed with the teacher's pet kind of employee), but now it's the norm.

Many departments are weighed down by stressful goals and ridiculous, impossible performance plans that only set people up to fail. There are multiple managers in multiple departments that aren't people leaders and don't know how to be. Those managers in particular are a HUGE part of what has destroyed the culture and have pushed people to their limit. 

Surprisingly for a company that's growing rapidly, there's little to no opportunity for growth in many departments there. The only hope you have for moving up is starting in customer support. However, once you're out of that department, good luck going anywhere else. 

The Salt Lake office is also riddled with HR red flags, but it's virtually impossible to go to HR without getting in trouble for it. Multiple managers and ""star"" employees are walking HR violations, but continue to be rewarded rather than punished for their behavior. 

Overall, Thumbtack WAS an amazing place to work but now the culture is stressful, toxic, and severely overrated."
257,Thumbtack,Great place to work,2017-12-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,People at Thumbtack are very thoughtful and kind. We try to make decisions rationally and deliberately. The company is unafraid of making big bets and moves fast. People are here because they want to be here.,Most of the cons that Thumbtack has are cons that any growth-stage company has.

261,Thumbtack,Without a doubt the best place I've ever worked at.,2017-11-14,5.0,Technical Sourcer,"-Inclusive Culture

The culture here is excellent, it really feels like family when coming here, which is a good thing since we spend most of our days with our co-workers. Cross department communication is great as well.

-Room for Growth

Internal mobility is encouraged here, as well as opportunities to be a mentor or mentee with another Thumbtacker. 

-Seamless Onboarding

This really gets started about a week before you get here, you get to pick your own equipment and desk setup before you even get here. When you do get here all of your stuff is ready to go at your desk, including a sweet little welcome package. Extended onboarding includes Thumbtack University which is a multi-day training session that goes over the company and its history. The product’s evolution and current state, and some research methods and options within Thumbtack. 

-Food

The food here is ridiculously good. Food here is cooked in house by some of the most amazing chefs. You’ll be enjoying daily breakfast, lunch, and dinner (except Fridays). Also with Thursday snack days you’ll be treated to an assortment of in house snacks and beverages. Speaking of beverages there are ‘coolers’ or ‘refreshers’ made in house, a personal favorite is the Passion Fruit cooler. We also have a few beers and wines on tap, and in cans/bottles if you don’t like those options. There’s even an instagram account dedicated to this talented crews’ work. 

-Extremely flexible with PTO

Need time off? Take it.

-Transparency

Meeting notes are dispersed across departments which provides a window on what the company is working on. This goes all the way to the top.

-Thoughtful and Hands on Leadership

Leadership here is astoundingly great and active! They’re quick to respond to major events and set a great atmosphere for the company as a whole. They listen to feedback 
	
-Offsite Team Building Events

Want to get to know your team better? Don’t worry you’ll have a lot of opportunities to get out of the office with your team and build that relationship up!

-On-site Guest Speaker Events

Thumbtack is increasing their efforts in being thought leaders and having more community based events. 

-Community Involvement 

Thumbtackers respond to help out our local community, especially when they need it most like our most recent fires. We also have a few internal groups for different sports and activities that take place outside of work hours.	

-SF Office Space / Location 

We’re in the Twitter building which is pretty convenient for most people living in the city, and pretty close to most transportation options.",It's hard to write something here without sounding pretentious and entitled. I don't have any complaints.
262,Thumbtack,Unique Culture & Start-up with Real Potential,2017-11-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have worked in many start-ups in my career and this is the first one with incredible potential.  The executive team is engaged in the success of the business and with its employees. We are shifting the product and the culture to drive better outcomes for our pros, customers, and employees.
Thumbtack is great to its employees. They are very transparent with how the company is doing, the company goals, soliciting feedback from employees, leadership is very approachable to all.","Things have been really laid back and at times it is hard to drive accountability. The good news is the leadership team recognizes this and is making changes to address this.
There are growing pains for sure but nothing that cannot be worked through."
263,Thumbtack,"The outside is appealing, that's how they get you",2017-11-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free food.
Decent working hours.
Specific teams aren't bad.
The benefits are great.","Faking it completely. The CEO came to Salt Lake to deliver news and decided to plant people in the audience to say kind things about the updates to shape the narrative. If that isn't shady, I don't know what is. 
The politicking is insane.
The ""culture"" isn't diverse. Hiring the same type of people doesn't get you new ideas or thinking outside of the box. Getting actually diversity in people instead of who they voted for would do you good. It's a fancy call center for lazy hipsters.
The CEO and leadership think they are bigger than they are and walk around with their noses in the air. They company is still growing and it's a good time to be humble.
There wasn't an HR until the last year or so. Lots of issues brewing that aren't being solved. People get promoted to leadership because of who they know, not because of their work ethic. Overpaid management and underpaid staff. 
Management who used to be in HR actually sexually harassed employees without any repercussions even with ALL of senior leadership knowing about it.
Firing managers, senior leaderships, and VPs is seen as a weakness so they will keep people around who are clearly unqualified just to save face. 
Being a ""cool place to work"" invites inappropriate behavior that is brushed off as being ""fun"" or ""hip"" yet they push unbias training down everyones throat and make it mandatory that you show up. It's not helpful and all it does is push people who were already afraid of speaking up further into their corners."

I've read other reviews about Thumbtack too especially the negative ones and they're all on point. They say that they're not micromanaging you but the truth is they are. They use positive-scripting to ""keep the culture""  but they're not really doing a great job. 
- when it comes to promotion, it's also who you know and not what you know. 
- people that are personally struggling don't get much support from the management and the company although that WAS their intention. It used to be an employee-centered company too, but now they're just about numbers and how to make the company bigger. 
- I used to brag about Thumbtack but now I would not even recommend it to anyone anymore because of all the changes
- not much career growth. They used to say that since it's a start-up company, there are tons of growth opportunity, everything has been filled in I guess so you're staying where you're at now."

On top of that, Thumbtack is taking its thriving marketplace and taking a huge swing at a radically improved experience for local services. Trust me when I say this is a once in a lifetime work opportunity. 

I would happily recommend Thumbtack to any great employee who wants to love their work and make a huge difference.","Building something new and different is not easy.

You get catered lunch, free snacks, and awesome events are planned. The product Thumbtack is working on will change the services market, if they don't continue on this horrible path they are on.","Micromanagers, bosses instead of leaders, metrics that are hard to obtain, constantly being told you're paid more than you're worth, constant changes that don't make any sense.

The changes that are made on a weekly basis just anger professionals we work with and they feel like Thumbtack is just in it for the money, which is it seeming like it more and more everyday. When you bring up feedback, you think they care about it, but they don't do much to implement it. We have 2 offices, and the office in SF is not in tune with SLC, so they make changes that WE know are going to anger customers, and they are surprised when they get negative feedback. 

TT used to brag about transparency and how much they valued their employees, now they only care about numbers and you can end up getting fired in a matter of weeks because of their high metrics. 

Lots of politics, if you're a brown noser, you will get special projects to work on and not have to work as hard as everyone else. 

You are only important to Thumbtack as long as you are performing, if you have a tough week, you will get into a bad groove and it's hard to recover.

Some ""leaders"" take it upon themselves to target employees and try to get them fired for bringing up issues to upper management or hr. 

The good people are realizing that it's better to leave then stay and deal with all the garbage going on so tenured employees are dropping like flies."

270,Thumbtack,"Amazing growth, business problems, and team",2017-10-06,5.0,Software Engineer,"I've personally grown much faster than I expected. I've learned as much about software engineering as I have about product decision-making, analytics, and project management—all as a new-grad hire.

Almost everyone here is exceptionally helpful and cooperative. The company is intensely mission-driven and people are well-aligned with the company's vision.

People here are smart. With few exceptions, I am impressed by the caliber of team members here and the lengths they go to not only understand our customers, product, and market.

There is immense company growth potential. We are years ahead of even our biggest competitors in a market that, in the US alone, is worth $700 billion annually. There are few other tech companies that can even claim to have that much potential for growth—let alone a strong chance at realizing that potential.

Upper management is excellent. I rarely question the decisions made by executives about our team and our product because they are accessible, transparent about their reasoning, and deeply concerned with data-driven decision-making. At the same time, they seem to balance these traits with well-honed intuitions about how to make step changes in the product that take us in the right direction.","While the company has been receptive to feedback about career growth, it still has room for improvement. I realize catering to people's career growth needs is often in tension with team agility and bureaucracy minimization, but I think Thumbtack is capable of finding a better balance.

Given our ambitions, we need to grow our team more quickly than we currently are, without resorting to the pell-mell of hiring that was 2016. I think a crucial part of this will be polishing our brand and doing better at publicizing the great work we're doing here."

288,Thumbtack,Great People Unleashing Great Potential,2017-05-26,5.0,Software Engineer,"I have been working at Thumbtack for a year and am very happy with the choice I made in joining Thumbtack!

- Very user (pro and consumer) focused
- Really humble co-workers
- Open and honest culture
- High bar for shipping features, designing architecture and investing in infrastructure
- Data driven
- Not afraid to move fast
- Starts with the assumption that everyone is a rockstar and given very high impact projects (with mentorship and guidance along the way)
- Very good growth opportunities
- Competitive compensation and benefits","- Still trying to figure out processes that work best, allowing us to move fast and make the right decisions at the same time
- Hopefully we can maintain the culture and potential of Thumbtack even as we are in this high growth phase
- Although, we are data driven, we still haven't explored the full potential of the experimentation techniques and tools out there. We should invest more in those tools, especially as our product becomes more sophisticated"
289,Thumbtack,"Great people, Great Mission!",2017-05-16,5.0,Technical Sourcer,"There are too many-- however, our product and the people are what make this place so great! Also, we get to empower local professionals to focus more on their work/craft/vocation, and we've made them over $1,000,000,000 (and rising).

That is the baseline for continued employment at this company. You must constantly innovate, push ideas forward, generate solutions, and think of problems that have not yet arisen and solve them. If you simply go about your day doing the duties written in your job description, it will not be enough. You have to be a Thumbtack true believer, or you will not make it for very long.

Very fair pay and compensation. I think some people might take for granted what they get from this company because they go above and beyond compared to what you can get elsewhere. They treat CS like Tech employees. 

A lot of available trainings to improve your skills in the workplace.",There are is a click vibe with the Marketplace Integrity team. They very much keep to themselves and honestly could do better at being a part of the team.

People are great
Work-life balance is respected
Culture is very collaborative and consensus-driven
Hiring process is extremely selective
Company is very data-driven
All 3 founders are actively involved and care deeply about the company
The company is unbelievably transparent
Culinary team is top notch
Onboarding process for new hires is outstanding","Having a consensus-driven culture is a strong asset when big & bold decisions are made. It ensures that employees have an opportunity to weigh in and are on board with important decisions. When it comes to small, tactical or operational decisions, this culture sometimes slows us down. People need to be more comfortable recognizing what matters and what doesn't and spend less time on the latter:-)"
300,Thumbtack,Public image is far off from reality,2017-01-11,1.0,,"The culinary staff and the meals they provided were amazing. I also really enjoyed the awesome office layout/design. It felt like you weren't going into work, but rather a really cool and trendy cafe or coffee shop.","The leadership is incredibly disappointing and there was a ton of nepotism and elitism amongst them. During my time there, I saw 3 VPs let go who all had much more experience than the founders who never worked in tech prior to starting the company. Though a startup, they acted like they were already an established company 5x the size."
301,Thumbtack,Best company I have ever worked for,2017-01-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The culture is fantastic. There are no egos, and pretty much everyone is willing to drop what they're doing to answer a question or to point you in the right direction. The company is built on transparency, so you know what other teams are working on and how that contributes to the larger vision of the exec team.

Everyone has an opportunity to make an impact. We're at that stage in which the user base is relatively well established, and yet is still growing rapidly. You won't be working on some widget that only a handful of people will see or use.

People come here because they believe in the product and the mission, not just to collect a paycheck.

In-house culinary team provides great food 3x a day. It is wonderful not to have to wander around SOMA every day looking for lunch.

Work-life balance is great. There is no pressure to work a minimum number of hours a day, and you have the flexibility to work from home if you have an obligation that prevents you from coming into the office. I've almost never done work after leaving the office for the day.

We're beyond the instability and uncertainty that comes with early startups, yet we've only captured a small fraction of the $700 billion local services marketplace. There's enormous room for growth and I'm confident we are moving in the right direction.","The company is growing so rapidly that sometimes there are breakdowns in communication, or teams step on each other's toes.

Understaffed in certain areas. Until recently, the mobile team was understaffed, and people with substantial front end experience are still in short supply. That's one of the major pain points in the overall dev cycle.

Greater proportion of people here (anecdotally), as compared to other companies in the Bay Area I've worked at, are married and/or have kids. So, don't expect a lot of interest if you ask people to go out for a drink or do something outside of work as they're probably making a beeline for the Caltrain station."

303,Thumbtack,6 months in and loving it,2016-11-30,5.0,Software Engineer,"I joined Thumbtack because of the special energy I felt when I came to interview here, and I have not been disappointed. This is a very creative and open work environment, with tons of hard problems and smart/fun people to work on them with. The company is in a huge growth cycle right now and so there is plenty of opportunities to make a huge impact very quickly. I've surprised myself by how much I have accomplished since coming here because of the responsibilities I've been given, and this is without anyone pushing long unnecessary hours on us!

Most importantly to me, above anything I mentioned above, is knowing that I'm building a product that is helping people carve out careers for themselves by their rules. We constantly get to hear stories from people that have created meaningful employment for themselves and others through Thumbtack and it really makes me feel like I'm doing something that matters.

Also we have an AWESOME in house kitchen that feeds us oh so well!","Plenty! But they are primarily in the department of growing pains, and it seems like management is doing their best to address these problems correctly... or let all us motivated go-getters offer up potential solutions ;)"

- Mission-driven, with great prospects. 
- Smartest and most curious people you will ever work with. Work here if you like to ask why. 
- Female and LGBT leaders trusted and supported in very visible, impactful roles. 
- Learning emphasis. We've been getting better and better at bringing opportunities into the building. 
- Very reasonable working pace and culture. It fluctuates based on project demands but you can have a real life outside of work. 
- Food isn't just a perk - it is truly amazing and it brings people from different teams together.","- Agree with previous reviewer re: creating a culture of gratitude, not just featuring people at All Thumbs. People here are so nice that they don't jockey for credit - but current system is built to reward good-looking metrics, not necessarily the important things (like infrastructure or supporting team members). 
- Extremely cautious, planning oriented culture. Good and bad. Helps work/life balance, feels mature and improves execution. But we could make bigger, more creative bets if we found ways to make occasional failure OK. 
- Career development needs work. Titles here feel junior (vs. other companies) and can make people feel like Thumbtack doesn't believe in them (even when it does). Need to give people more chances to build new skills, not just execute their one function. 
- Gender issues here are better than elsewhere, but we can still improve on unconscious bias, especially on more male teams (eng/product).    
- Ditto what other reviewers have said about average comp/benefits (for tech)."
313,Thumbtack,Highly Recommended,2016-06-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The two main reasons I love working at Thumbtack:

1) We're actually having an impact on the world. A lot of people use Thumbtack to fuel their small business. Some wouldn't exist without Thumbtack and some would, but just be smaller. To be able to empower people to pursue their entrepreneurial passions is really cool.

2) The people at Thumbtack are great. It's not always common to find a culture that prizes ambition, intelligence, AND kindness, but all three are definitely present among those working at Thumbtack and this makes working at Thumbtack much more enjoyable.","It's scary to not be an established player like Google or Facebook. While we're doing well financially, there's no guarantee that Thumbtack will be around in 10 years. Having said that, this is also an opportunity. Everyone can make an impact at Thumbtack and leave their mark here in a way that wouldn't be possible at one of the aforementioned companies."
314,Thumbtack,Great vision.  TSF is on point. Heavy Politics in TSL.,2016-06-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Founders really care about affecting the world in a positive way and translate this through to their product, interactions with pros,  Aand investment in employee perks. They are really stand-up guys who are concerned more about the good they do and how they affect people's lives than their bottom line.","Very heavy politics which bleed into upper management in TSL.  One or two weak managers promote and keep weaker players in leadership positions because they are liked and not because of their contributions or proven skills. They tout transparency but fail to examine the facts behind complaints about management and look for anywhere (or anyone) else to point the finger to rather than holding the leaders accountable first - which could end up being a much larger downfall and problem as Thumbtack scales.

Weak and inexperienced managers are allowed to continue making the same mistakes at the cost of their direct reports productivity, career progression/security,  reputation and morale and are not held accountable to any level of responsibility for their own actions or inactions."

318,Thumbtack,Amazing people,2016-05-16,5.0,Product Analyst,"*** TEAM ***
The people and the culture they embody make Thumbtack a truly special place to work. These adjectives describe the team:
+ Hyper intelligent
+ Friendly
+ Positive & optimistic
+ Ambitious
+ Open minded
+ Collaborative
+ Trustworthy
+ Emotionally intelligent

A lot of qualities emerge from this mix. I'm a person who tends to attract conflict. I'm loud, outspoken, and I don't react well to foul play. I can truly say that in 1 year of working here I have yet to had a single conflict with anyone here, work related or otherwise. I also haven't met one person who I really don't want to work with. For me, both of those facts really stand out.

*** VISION ***
Thumbtack has been around for quite sometime, 7 or 8 years. Throughout that time, the founders' vision has remained remarkably consistent. They also communicate it effectively. That solves a lot of problems for a growing team. We may disagree on execution, but we all share the same long term vision for the company and the product. That, combined with the attributes mentioned above, make me really feel like I'm part of a team all striving together towards the same shared goal.

*** SOCIAL GOOD ***
It's really hard for most of us to be excited about working for companies of neutral or dubious societal value. My last job was in social / F2P games so believe me, I know what I'm talking about. Working on a platform that empowers small businesses to succeed and helps customers have confidence in hiring professionals is really easy to be excited about. Every week we are treated to more stories about professionals whose lives have been changed by the ability Thumbtack gives them to pursue and succeed at their dreams.","- The salary and benefits are very average. Certainly not bad, but also not a selling point.
- Thumbtack expects a lot out of its employees. The high bar in hiring corresponds to an equally high bar in performance. This can create a climate where people feel taken for granted. If you're not shipping product that moves a key metric by 20%, you're generally not receiving much praise. Not a good place to feel insecure. If you're doing well, meeting expectations, you probably won't hear very many thank you's or good job's."

I won’t go into details on those aspects as they are mostly covered by other reviews. What really makes me excited to come to work each day is what Thumbtack differentiates from other startups.

Thumbtack is competing in a huge market (800 billions per year in US for local services)/ Like in any other big markets: search, social network or online shopping, there will eventually have one dominate player at the end. (Google for search, Facebook for social network, Amazon for online shopping). Based on the current competition status, Thumbtack has a good shot to win this game.

Tech startups live or die on growth, no doubt about that. Thumbtack focuses on making a profitable business as much as pushing impressive growth rate. We don't play games of selling 1 dollar for 70 cents to feed the growth like many other startups. The business model of Thumbtack is creative, healthy and having a great potential.",I feel we are not moving fast enough on the product and engineering side. We are emphasize too much on engineering excellence. A bit of “move fast and break thing” spirit would be useful for this company at the current stage.

- We're on verge of getting very big, very quickly.","But thing's aren't perfect.
- A lot of very similarly minded people—a little diversity of thought would do us good.
- Our high focus on data and conversion changes is good but comes with the danger of thwarting creativity, big-picture thinking, and risk taking.
- All those smart people who work here mean a lot of employees are doing work they're overqualified for with unclear paths for internal growth.
- Growing pains. We're still learning how to adapt our structure and process to accommodate a much larger office. There's a lot of hustle and far less attention to culture."

Benefit is good enough as start up. Busier than big companies but reasonable work life balance as start up.
Unlimited PTO is not trick. 4 weeks maybe 5 seems common practice. Managers themselves take vacations so you don't need to worry when you are not take much more than them. Some people takes multiple weeks time off.
Open source friendly, using AWS and 3rd party tools rather than in house infra and tools in big companies. Knowledge of in-house infra/tools is useless when change job though the common idea will be similar.","Over one mile from Caltrain.

-In it for the long haul to build a sustainable business, and I think we have a very good shot at succeeding","I have basically one con.  We're rather image focused.  This takes several forms:
-We are recruiting heavily, which means we want to appear like a good place to work.  We send out multiple reminders to fill out Glassdoor reviews, write and upvote recruiting blog posts, and so on.  Now, we actually happen to *be* a decent place to work.  But it's a little weird to be in a place where a large part of your job is proselytizing rather than doing the things you are proselytizing about...
-Our business was built around SEO.  Fortunately optimizing for SEO tends to somewhat aligned with creating value for the world.  But when considering a feature, we sometimes ask ""what will get Googlebot to like us more"" rather than ""what will make a better product for our users."""

While there are exceptions, most of the leaders act like fraternity leaders who are all talk and no follow-through unless threatened. 

Next, it seems that everyone works in silos instead of working together. While the new org structure attempts to remove geographical boundaries and silos, it's actually created a bigger gap between the three main groups.Some groups are being ignored and are working independently because of time zone differences and because some leaders refuse to be flexible enough to either wake up early or stay up late to meet."

383,Thumbtack,Best company I've ever worked for,2015-03-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"Thumbtack is amazing. The culture is extremely open and trusting. Everyone has a manager, but they are very non-interfering. Thumbtack hires extremely intelligent individuals who are capable of getting whatever tasks assigned to them done. Therefore, managers aren't micro-managing and are really there to ensure your development as a person.

Everything that goes on is super transparent. Every meeting that occurs has meeting minutes that are emailed out to the entire company. Any email list or slack channel is open for anyone to join. We work in an open-floor plan, meaning that I sit two desks over from the CEO. Everyone from the CEO, to the VP of engineering, to the person you sit next to is very approachable and extremely willing to hear your thoughts about anything.

I love all of my coworkers. I would seriously be very happy to hang out with every single one of them outside of work. They are all super friendly, super smart, and super humble. They all want you to succeed on anything you are working on because we are all one team, with one mission, trying to make service professional interactions better. They are all very willing to give up their time to make sure your projects succeed.

Lastly, but not least importantly, the Thumbtack product is amazing. There was a survey done of our service professionals, asking where they would be without Thumbtack. One of the most common responses we received was ""hungry."" These professionals literally would not be able to find customers without Thumbtack and would not be able to afford food. I love waking up everyday and coming to work because I know I am making people's lives drastically easier and better.","The only negative I can think of is that we're now getting to a size where I don't know everyone's name.

Thumbtack is a place where every voice has value. No one's input is above or beneath anyone else's. As a mid-level manager, I am empowered to make the decisions I need for my team. When I request resources I am extremely well supported, and I feel my team makes valued contributions toward long-range company goals. The transparency, while at times overwhelming, is incredibly refreshing compared to other industries I've worked in.","The culture of transparency contributes to information overload, which means internal communication isn't nearly as effective as it could be. I believe this will be resolved eventually but it's definitely a pain point today. Also, my compensation is lower than I would like, but I get incredible work-life balance and very interesting work to off-set that. So my salary is okay for today, but will likely be a problem for me a year from now."

Thumbtack is tackling a pretty massive problem and growth has been really great to see- $130M in funding since I've joined, the team size has doubled, we've set up a new office in Salt Lake City, and we've hired a handful of really sharp senior hires to learn from.",The company is still young and leaders are still learning as we grow.

For example, we are making out a new org structure for one of the departments and the changes were not communicated to the right people at the right time. It raised questions and caused the existing team, which was very passionate about what they were doing, to question decisions. That said, I think everybody learned from the experience, and now we have a VP of HR to help with this sort of thing!"
388,Thumbtack,"Great place to work full of mission-driven, intellectual people",2014-12-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Thumbtack is a really great company with a very strong culture and an obsessive focus on improving itself. Everyone from the engineers to the recruiters to the operations teams are approachable, curious, humble, dedicated to learning, and fun to talk with. The product makes a difference in people's lives and the opportunity is huge, which makes the environment exciting and the work satisfying. Decisions from hires to product changes to ad buys are made in a very thoughtful, rigorous manner, but bad decisions are owned up to and abandoned quickly. 

Very little ego or politics within the company, as everyone seems committed to making the best decisions to help the team, and working hard to make that decision making process as analytically rigorous and free from bias as possible. As a start up there are many opportunities for team members to contribute and expand their horizons and leadership offers support for people to figure out and implement new things. 

I love coming to work here.","The relentlessly thoughtful decision making process means that the company can move more slowly than it perhaps should at times. Engineer hiring has proven to be a major bottleneck due to absurdly high standards for new hires. As a result, teams that could get by with less than world-class engineers are left without any engineering resources at all. Also as a result the product has simple, glaring flaws that go left unaddressed, and there are clearly areas of the company set up years ago that have been given no thought in a while as attention is focused elsewhere. Huge opportunity for new hires to fix these things and help this company realize its potential."
389,Thumbtack,Best place to work in the Bay,2014-11-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've only ever worked at start-ups and, unfortunately, a big percentage of them require non-stop work with little reward, cut-throat team members and no say in major changes. Thumbtack has been a breath of fresh air in a sea of ridiculousness. Of course there are the perks that every other company here offers - home cooked meals, fancy gadgets, beautiful office, lots of fun events, but it's really the kindness and support that makes Thumbtack stand out. 

It's the handwritten letter from the founders on your work anniversary. It's the encouragement to really explore what you want out of your career. It's the complete transparency around tricky situations. It's the trust given to you because you know that if Thumbtack hires you, you're opinion and expertise is respected.

It doesn't hurt that the benefits are good too - unlimited vacation (no - for real, you're encouraged to take it), good pay, work from home days and an amazing $1500 education stipend. Working here makes me feel like I'm not only investing my time in Thumbtack, but investing in my career long-term, wherever that takes me.","The one similarity Thumbtack has to many start-ups is the crazy fast growth that sometimes means important decisions and processes are long over-due. Sometimes you'll hard on a project that then gets changed last minute. Or that they're so busy hiring leadership that you end up floating and without a ton of direction for stretches of time. The opportunities for career growth here at Thumbtack are unclear. I think management is open to progression (promotions/raises) in theory, but I've never seen it in practice. A lack of cost-of-living raises is also a bit of a downer."
390,Thumbtack,Very laid back company that will excel in 2015,2014-11-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Senior management is very supportive which allows the employees to be much happier.  I actually loved going to work every day.,Opportunities for advancement were somewhat lacking however the culture of the company is so great that I wouldn't really consider this a negative.
391,Thumbtack,"Thumbtack has an excellent work environment, interesting challenges to solve, and a great culture.",2014-11-12,5.0,Software Engineer,"Thumbtack provides a wide range of perks and makes an effort to stay competitive with their salaries. They also encourage employees to always be improving themselves and to take online courses together or even teach eachother things in an informal classroom setting if they are so inclined. The culture is warm and encouraging, and it definitely inspires great work from the employees.","As is often the case with smaller companies, employees are expected to learn whatever they need to learn to get the job done in the best way possible. At the time of writing there are about 80 employees in the San Francisco office, so you'll often find yourself quickly becoming the authority on a subject since no one else has done your work before. It can be stressful at times if you find yourself in over your head. There are two sides to this issue, however, since you will learn a lot by being in this position."
392,Thumbtack,Good Platform,2014-11-11,5.0,,Good For New Employees according to their growth and also for the growth of the Company.,"Interesting Projects, More Familiar, Great safety Precautions."
393,Thumbtack,Always interesting work; great people,2014-10-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Before Thumbtack I was working for a larger corporation... in search to work for a smaller and more innovative company, I found Thumbtack. I have absolutely loved it here. We operate at a super fast pace, which keeps you on your toes. Thoughtfulness is also highly valued, and therefore people arent sloppy with their work. We do things with intention and it ties up into the bigger picture. Also with the growth, by default I've been able to own a substantial chunk of the business. I've thrived off of the breadth of responsibility and opportunity for broader impact. 

Needless to say, the perks are great too. We have flexible time off (so there is no set bank) and we have the ""typical tech start up"" perks - i.e. 3 chefs.","With rapid growth there are of course some growing pains. For example, we are building out a new org structure for one of the departments and the changes were not communicated to the right people at the right time.  It raised questions and caused the existing team, which was very passionate about what they were doing, to question decisions. That said, I think everybody learned from the experience, and now we have a VP of HR to help with this sort of thing!"
394,Thumbtack,"Great team, Great mission",2014-09-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This is one of the best work environments I've ever been a part of. The team is smart and dedicated. Everyone is pulling their weight and collaboration is fun, not competitive. 

Compensation is generous and the benefits are comprehensive. Family style meals a huge plus, lots of opportunities to be social with the team.","The company is growing fast, and the inevitable growing pains can be a drag. Initiative is required on the employees' part that might not be required at bigger, more established companies.  On the other hand, it is a big plus to have a ton of autonomy."
395,Thumbtack,Rocketship startup. amazing culture. transparent and impact driven team,2014-09-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Thumbtack has an impressive group of talented, thoughtful, fast-moving people. It's been a pleasure and absolute fire hose working here. You take on as much responsibility as you can like and in a company growing this quickly, it's endless. Love the no politics, get things done attitude. Checks the boxes on all the silicon valley startup perks.","As with any startup, there's growing pains around communication and and moving too quickly. However, be proactive and bring up issues as you see them, and people really appreciate it and always (almost immediately) work to make it better."
396,Thumbtack,Awesome environment with talented people,2014-08-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Exceptional people; pretty much everyone is very good at what they do. No tolerance for jerks and a nice departure from the increasingly common ""brogrammer"" startup culture. Lots of opportunity for trying new things and stretching yourself. Everyone really cares about what the company is trying to accomplish. Solid work/life balance - people work hard, but no one is afraid to take vacation or work from home if the cable guy's coming.",The flip side of lots of independence is that there isn't the degree of mentorship or training you might find a more established company - you really have to seek it out and make it happen.
397,Thumbtack,This team is awesome and the opportunity is incredible,2014-07-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The team is really amazing. People are whip smart, thoughtful, and hard working while simultaneously being humble and earnest. Thumbtack optimizes its hiring process for people who are 1. humble, 2. really super smart, and 3. mission-driven. You can see the outcome of this process in the current team - I seriously feel like I learn so much from my colleagues - both on a professional and personal level - every day. I feel so lucky and blessed to be here.
- The opportunity is incredible for two reasons: 1. the enormous size of what we're going after is insane - we're trying to improve the way the entire professional services economy is run globally!! - and 2. we're helping real people in the real world. Literally every day we have service professionals write in to us and thank us for building Thumbtack - ""I was down on my luck and out of work, then I found Thumbtack. Thumbtack has transformed my life. I'm now able to put food on the table for my family again, feel proud of myself again, I just bought a new pickup truck and am finally able to invest in myself..."" Seriously. Every day. I can't tell you how good it feels to build a product that affects so many people in the real world so positively.","- The distance between the current product and its potential is huge - this can be frustrating. I sometimes wish we were able to move 10x faster than we currently do!
- It's a relatively young company - there is tons of room here for people of all experience levels but particularly for people who have been around the block and can contribute managerial and general company-building expertise."
398,Thumbtack,Momentum,2014-07-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Thumbtack is an ideal work environment: thoughtful and smart colleagues oriented around a massive, challenging problem that has a lot of momentum.

The culture focuses on thoughtful, data-driven decision making and dedication to the product. There are great perks like a beautiful office and fantastic chefs who cook lunch and dinner every day.","Keeping up with growth and scale is not always easy. I wish there were 10 of me, and 10 of each of my colleagues, to keep up with everything."
