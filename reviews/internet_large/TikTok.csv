3,TikTok,Good 'resume builder' but not an organization you'd want to work for long-term.,2022-04-08,2.0,Product Strategy Operations,"‚Ä¢ Hottest place to be in social media right now

‚Ä¢ Pre-IPO

‚Ä¢ Pretty directionless, so you can chart your own path.

‚Ä¢ Everyone has a voice in meetings - the very structured and polite nature of Chinese culture impacts interactions - a formal agenda is almost always present, a clear leader, and everyone's opinion is asked. It's nice for people who don't ordinarily volunteer to speak.","‚Ä¢ Very strange, secretive culture. I did not anticipate how large of the role would be 'ByteDance' (parent company) vs. TikTok. No knowledge sharing across orgs (e.g. side of business that makes money and/or user side).

‚Ä¢ Nickel & dime with salary - TikTok is rapidly hiring and is somewhat at the advantage of being the 'hot' place + send low-ball offers (I was borderline offended when I got my first offer; nearly 75% less than what I was making at the time) 

‚Ä¢ Wouldn't bank on an IPO (at least anytime soon): In salary negotiations,, they focused on the 'pre-IPO stock' as being key in the total compensation package (so they could pay you less in direct cash). In all honesty, I would not be surprised if this company never went public. The amount of information they would need to disclose would be radically different from how the company operates today. They were set to IPO a while back on on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (to appease the Chinese government), but this got axed amid the anti-trust investigations towards Alibaba, etc. 

‚Ä¢ High turnover - a fast growing company is great, but a fast growing company with fast turnover is a sign. After losing several people on my team (also - my recruiter quit while she was working with me!), it definitely impacts morale. Few are committed for the long-term. 

‚Ä¢ Non-existent culture: If you're coming from another big tech company, don't expect anything like what you had previously. Whether or not the Google's of the world are actually committed to their mission statement is up for question, but ByteDance's mission (which does not exist) would be 100% growth at all costs. It feels a bit brutal. 

‚Ä¢ China-based: This was probably the most jarring part when I first began. Everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) is in Mandarin ‚Äì emails, internal chats, documentation. I would estimate 90% of engineering teams sit in China, so communicating with them is nearly impossible due to 1) time difference and 2) language barrier. This, of course, impacts every team (as we are reliant upon them to build what is needed). 

‚Ä¢ Working Hours/Expectations: Aside from the fact that the China-based teams are regularly *required* to work on weekends to balance 'holidays', working with these teams means late night/early morning meetings all the time. If you're up for that, great - if you have kids or just would prefer to not start work before 7:30am and end at 8:30pm, I would be cautious. 

‚Ä¢ No organizational structure - ByteDance believes in a 'flat culture' (which does not work for a 100k personal company) - you have absolutely no way at all to know who works on what. Onboarding was a total nightmare because of this - you just have to speak with people who are more tenured to know who does what."

2. Lack of transparency in pay ranges. People with same role and same job titles may have WILDLY (2 or 3 times difference) different salaries. 
3. HR refers to certain ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù that are not published or shared with employees.

Brands are doing some really interesting things on the platform and I think it‚Äôs a real game-changer for how businesses and consumers connect. Huge potential as a marketing platform.","Total chaos when it comes to communication across product, strategy and propel. Half baked info some days, no info the next. Even trying to understand the process for managing people and performance is a mountain to climb. Certain data points on your team are kept hidden making it very difficult to present yourself as a valid leaded when you can‚Äôt even discuss salary with your team. 

Micromanagement up and down the chain. You have managers, even as high as your +3, randomly jump in on things without context and as a leader myself, this creates more overhead than adding value. Very senior leaders like to show up and suddenly want to know everything about some small detail, until another thing catches their eye and then they‚Äôre gone again. 

Work-life balance? What‚Äôs that? The default is that if your calendar is open, it‚Äôs fair game. That applies to 6am - midnight. Regularly calls are dropped in my calendar last minute for times that seem absurd at most companies. A new hire on my team was really asked to join a call at 1am until I intervened. 

People are not ‚Äúnice‚Äù. Well people aren‚Äôt paid to be ‚Äúnice‚Äù I hear you say‚Ä¶ well that‚Äôs true, but I come with 14 years experience in this field and barring a rare exception every so often, I never doubted that every single person I‚Äôve worked with  showed up with good intent. Not so at Tiktok. People are harsh, curt, possessive and not strong on collaboration.

I once raised some of these points with a senior leader and I was told - ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not happy, leave‚Äù. Tiktok is the way it is. It doesn‚Äôt want to and won‚Äôt change. If you can accept all that then great, if not, and you want to feel like you can change an organization in your own small way, then Tiktok is not for you."

- HR team was not supportive/helpful at all
- Horrid leadership, stemming from higher leadership down to your direct leaders (most things fall on deaf ears when concerns are voiced)
- No personal career growth or development, just more stress (instead, too much focus on numbers and everything being for the sake of the business)
- Too much focus on growth and scaling = meetings always felt like everyone was trying to one-up each other and clamour for attention
- Didn't feel like we were supported at all when it came to ""flex"" working announcements, despite them trying to brand it this way. Newsflash: Being forced to work in the office for specified days of the week is NOT flex working.
- The one ""mental health day"" that we got during lockdown was a joke, since some in HR openly noted that they still worked that same day.

DO NOT BELIEVE the ""Great Place to Work"" awards that the U.S., UK, SG offices have ""won,"" because LinkedIn tells a different story of some of the most amazing, insightful leaders who have left for personal reasons OR professional development. The average tenure of someone at TikTok, regardless of the location in the world, is 6 months - 1 year, and the high turnover rate is clearly indicative of the work culture.

Highly advise anyone to look up videos by Chloe Shih, Jamie Lim Yin Yin, etc. (or just Google ""why I left TikTok""), since they're highly accurate depictions, not just of my negative experience, but for countless others. 

Remember that you deserve better, so take your talents to any other tech company that doesn't work you to the core (996 culture). You deserve a company that doesn't make excuses about promotions AND that also values your contributions - so if you don't care about any of this, then sure, take a job here."

I don't see it a big problem for Tiktok esp. late night meetings/working happen often also at MS, GS , Big 4 and other techs.

- Neat WLB so far
- Great Colleagues & Tech Culture
- Great Managers
- Competitive Package compared to FAANG","- Might be a little hard for non-Chinese speakers due to docs in Chinese but I could see them improving

- RSU value are low for recent joiners because they priced $195 so you get limited shares compared to ppl who joined before early 2021

- Only certain office employees got $45 per day for meal expenses even during COVID, that's about $20K annual salary boost; Company seems to push BTO hard."

Performance review cycles are just a sharade everything is settled to make the majority of the people fall into middle rates even if everybody is working much more than a person Should 

Processes and Procideures are making everybody lives impossible, they claim to be a start up but they are just a product line of a very hierchical and bureaucratic multinational group:Bytedance

Everything is decided by HQ in China, there is no willingness to adapt to local markets needs, habits or needs in termes of internal organization

Company culture pillars are just empty boxes, e. g. they talk about giving honest feedback but if you do especially crtizing the company, even if in a respectful and constructive way, all you will experience is retaliation

Compesantion and benefit are redicoulous if compared to what you will be asked, they might seem competitive formt he outside but everybody soon discovers is not like that. 
Career path are very unclear, agai. They declare to be a start up but internal moves are made impossible  by internal. Politics and rules

- The benefits are also quite fair.

- It's a good place to start a career I'd say. You really get your chance to distinguish yourself from the crowd if you are smart.

- They started bringing people from big IT companies, and hopefully these experienced people will fix the bad foundations of the company","- The organisation is absolutely hectic, everyone works in silo, and the priorities of each department are often misaligned. In my time there I was able to detect multiple caveats, but too often I wasn't allowed to fix these issues, because I was told it wasn't my scope, or they had other prios, which is frustrating.

- There is tons of useless reporting. When you know your data accuracy is low.. don't ask for the team to justify of numbers which are incorrect. But I think it's part of the company's culture to track everything, whether it's useful or not, and whether the info tracked is correct or not doesn't matter.

- The people you get to work with are very junior. When I joined I figured many of our former agents who were previously on a PIP in their previous job landed more senior jobs here in TikTok.. I was not impressed by the people there unfortunately

- Some teams over-hired and everyone is chilling... there isn't much work.. while some others are absolutely swamped, with sometimes 1 Team Lead for 40 agents. It's very inconsistent, and just like many things in Tiktok, ther eisn't always a logic !"

201,TikTok,"If you value your time and skills, it‚Äôs a waste of them!",2022-01-28,1.0,Quality Assurance Analyst,"Two pros, but they‚Äôre not necessarily due to the company: 
- very lovely colleagues!!
- And the benefits are not too bad‚Ä¶could still be better though compared to others in that sector.","So so much!
- first of all there is zero!!! Flexibility around working hours and arrangements. You are in minimum 9-6, no discussion, every day. 
- the communication is not just tedious and long, but merely impossible. For several reasons: so many things get lost in translation, for communicating with China is exclusively through texting and that can be tough. The decision making process is endless and problems forwarded are completely ignored. 
- distribution of responsibility and the power to act upon it is messed up. You keep reporting an issue, as above, it is being ignored, and at the end of the day you have to explain what happened‚Ä¶as if you never mentioned it. And because you‚Äôre not allowed to act upon an issue you identify, even though you could, you just watch the whole scenario evolve, knowing it‚Äôll be your fault. 
- they only pretend to care for their employees. There are no meetings with team mates unless work related. There are no ‚Äòwhole team‚Äô meetings, only once in a month, it encourages a very separated work environment. 
- depending on your team there‚Äôs not enough or too much work. If it‚Äôs not enough, you just have to sit there, for you have to be available 9-6, if it‚Äôs too much you start drowning very quickly for it is very unorganised. (That‚Äôs what they call fast paced!) 
- internal promotions without pay rise!!! And the general pay is not that good to begin with! 
- they don‚Äôt actually know what they expect from an employee. You get a review that is most likely worse than you expect. When you ask why and what‚Äôs missing, no one can tell you exactly what was actually wrong with the job you did. I think good reviews are actually based on your obedience towards China, rather than your actual performance. If you speak up, you already lost.

Overall I‚Äôd never go back there! It was a waste of my time for not enough money and way too much strain on my mental health. If you take at least a bit of pride in the work you do, just don‚Äôt go there. You will not be valued in the slightest."

I see a lot of negative reviews which I can only imagine would be from the sales teams (newsflash - sales isn't any less gross anywhere else) which frankly has a lot of egos. My experience has been nothing but supportive and positive, and I couldn't recommend it more.","Same cons as any other tech company or big company in general, but better in my opinion. People often complain about a lack of transparency, but fail to think critically when at the same time internal meetings about important, honest topics get leaked to Business Insider within an hour. There's no win-win and I feel like TikTok's execs really tried their best to balance humanism and professionalism."

211,TikTok,Avoid at all costs,2022-01-26,1.0,Incident Manager,almost no pros in comparison to industry peers unless you like to work thankless long hours and unpaid weekends.,"Do yourself a favour - go on linkedin and look at the number of people that have departed after less than 1 year of tenure. Given the global hubs are only operational about 15months, that is a shocking stat. 

- toxic work environment. One that is heavily concentrated on office politics and conflict, every single person has been negatively impacted at all levels of seniority. Please look at linked in to see the number of senior, mid level and entry level people that quit after just a few months

- zero work life balance. Leadership talk a big game about this, but do nothing to actually address it. 

- clueless leadership, most likely due to not having any tech experience. Talk out both sides of their mouths they have lost all credibility. 

- terrible benefits in comparison to industry peers. TikTok is a company that looks for ways not to re-imburse you for your own costs, never mind actually trying to give you anything additional. For example, wellness benefit is 550 euro. Facebook will offer 3k plus, but your recruiter will be telling you about how Tiktok aims to be the same. Disregard anything they say. What you should expect is to be paying for your own internet and phone 100%, and your own costs in numerous other situations 

- zero recognition for any work, never mind the extended 12 hour days and countless unpaid weekends you cover

- culture. Everything is red taped so dont expect to move fast. Global culture is non existent - it is literally like having 5 different companies competing against each other than what should be 5 teams in 5 hubs collaborating with each other

Every time I login to work at TikTok, I die a little bit more inside. Avoid this place like the plague. 
If you are considering a role, then make sure you ask the hiring manager what their most recent result was for the employee survey andjudge them on their response.  There is a huge number of clueless, unqualified and incompetent managers on the global team, and their employee survey results for leadership back that up with data"

You really feel like collaboration, inclusion, diversity of thought, healthy debate, ownership are not only encouraged but celebrated and rewarded.
The people are incredibly smart and helpful, from day 1.
Diversity is not just a buzzword, the ERGs are making a real impact, not just internally but on the platform itself!
It's INCREDIBLY fast paced, seriously! If that's not your thing then that's ok, but TT won't be for you.
The people are class!
The culture is very important, from the top down. 
Career development is not just hoped for, it's inevitable and proactive. 
Did I mention the people?!","It's a very flat structure, so it can be hard to grasp who's who, what people do, who your best POC is, the leadership structure in HQ (China) etc. If you want to see an org chart, you'll be disappointed.

The pace, it is a 'rocketship', it's hard work that could easily lead to personal mismanagement of time, or imbalanced work/life. But honestly, I do feel that everyone is empowered to make it manageable for themselves, set their own boundaries, communicate their ""hard no's"" (i.e. early morning calls, missing lunch, evening calls etc) etc. It is a multi-national company, so you can easily be added to meetings outside of your timezone, but there is zero issue with missing those calls and catching up later. My point is, you can make the pace work for you or against you, it's up to you! Personally I enjoy that decisions are getting made!

Like most places, comp could be better. But it is going in the right direction."

It is not a company that you want to stay for the long term unless you have something truly special (e.g. no more than 50 people in the world can do what you do, then they make sure they take care of you... until they don't need you any more).

A LOT of management issues. Why do others keep saying ""no WLB"" and ""crazy hours""? That is because what takes 1 hour at Google will take 1 week at TikTok/Bytedance. The HQ staff in Beijing simply have different kind of understanding of how the business world works. I am not saying one is better than the other. I am just saying they are VERY different and it takes a tremendous amount of efforts to align, and unfortunately, all decisions of some significance have to go through Beijing.

Staff in Beijing does not experience the same cultures in America. Therefore, they sometimes say things that Americans will frown upon (what? did he really just say that?). They don't have bad intentions. They just don't have the same culture. They just don't know what is not culturally appropriate here in the US."

- Smart colleagues! It feels awesome to collaborate and be surrounded by some of the brightest software engineers around, 
- Great benefits (amazing pantry, free lunch everyday, lots of company swag all year round, etc.) 
- and contrary to what many reviews here say... Pretty good work life balance! However, do note that this is largely helped by the fact that we're based in Singapore and thus exist in the same timezone as Beijing, so international meetings don't happen at odd hours for us compared to offices in London and Bay Area, for instance.","- Less annual leaves than my previous company (but with the ability to carry forward unlimited leaves), 
- Slower career growth for non-China based employees (according to my co-workers) 
- and the occasional language barriers when dealing with international teams (which honestly isn't a huge deal breaker because everyone can speak English to some degree anyway)"

If you don‚Äôt have any friends or have friends that also work all weekends I guess this is the job for you. We now have one full weekend off every 6th week. Meaning it‚Äôs not easy to be spontaneous and make plans. They now added one Sunday before this weekend and one Saturday off the week after. Then you‚Äôll do 3 weekends in a row. 

The targets and expectations are also from a different planet. I mean having high targets is fine. But if none of the team members reach it for months even if working hard, it‚Äôs just a motivation killer."
295,TikTok,"Intense, but worth every second!",2021-12-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The most amazing people I have ever worked with - every colleague has a voice and this is a company where you can truly make your mark. If you hate working with red tape and are fed up of classic corporate hierarchy, this is the place for you. I also feel I have made more genuine friends here joining remotely (covid lockdown fun times) than I have in previous companies where I've spent years in the physical office. People at TikTok are ambitious but warm, kind and willing to go above and beyond to help another colleague out.

Creative and joyful are in the company mission statement and are true to day to day life at TikTok. I have never had more fun at work than working here, and it feels like the sky is the limit.

Lastly, a pro or a con depending on your working style, 'fast paced' doesn't even cut it in describing this company. Things move at lightning speed here, particularly when it comes to areas of the business people are passionate about such as D&I, and standards are always high. You will achieve more in a short amount of time here than anywhere else, but if you don't suit picking up a new idea and running with it at short notice then this might not be the place for you.","Being completely honest, it can be pretty relentless particularly if you work in a role that covers multiple timezones. You will have to be really strict with yourself on your working hours and make sure you look after the wellness of you and your team. If you set boundaries people will respect them - this is not a company where honestly declining a meeting or project due to resource capacity will get you red flagged, but it can be very easy to fall into the trap of being available at all hours, particularly with the way many people work on their phones."

Managers appear to be parachuted in without knowledge of day to day running of the business. Promotion of individual contributors into lead/management role appears to be a non-existent practice. Management does not appear to spay heed to request for resources/direction and may appear intimate that certain regions are not a priority. Management may also sling allegations against employees without the appearance of any investigation and may dissuade employees not to pursue the matter further.

Asking for guidance and/or direction (which management is seemingly unable to provide) may possibly result in poor performance reviews or certain career opportunities being taken away. Asia region and its employees does not appear to be a priority to management based outside of Asia."

There are also great mentor programmes and lots of great professionals to learn from and be mentored by. You can progress in your career path is you show loyalty to company values and are willing to go above and beyond and do more than your job scope. Good bonuses, possibility of a raise upon good reviews. 
Exciting and fun company events.","Moderators are overworked, they have to work 3 weekends per month and they have no say in which workdays they will have off instead. They cannot fulfill child or other care duties while working 3 weekends per month, they have absolutely no time to be with their loved ones, which leads to burnout and mental health issues. Management makes little and hypocritical effort to help restore and maintain their mental health. 

Goals and KPIs are unclear, it feels like management keeps moderators intentionally in the dark, hoping they will work harder and faster if they don't know what to expect.

Salaries are dependent on your native language thus the team you join and there's disgraceful discrimination between nationalities this way. Some nationalities earn more for the same job. Eastern Europeans e.g. tend to receive lower pay, even if their team performance is far better. All the while the management claims they are championing equality and diversity. Massive BS. I'm not even sure it is legal to discriminate in this way."

375,TikTok,Best Employer I've Ever Had!,2021-11-11,5.0,2D Illustrator,"TikTok is my second professional role, and has been my first working for a social media company. In my personal and professional experience, I have loved working in the design team at TikTok:

1) Management: My supervisor and the other supervisors that I have worked with have all cared deeply about not just the work that I do, but also making sure to check in and ask how I am doing, if I need anything, and are always welcoming any questions or concerns I may have. 

2) Work: I work on many projects at once, which I really like since I thrive in a place where I get to work on multiple very different things. We get a say in which projects we'd like to collaborate on, so you aren't just blindly assigned work without input about production.

Office: The office has all of the perks that you've heard other tech and social media companies display: galley kitchens, gaming stations, outdoor grills and fire pits - all that and a bag of chips! And since we have been working from home, the company sent us whatever hardware and software we needed to be safe and sound at home while we work.

Benefits: Out of this world! We have a very good health benefits package.","I would re-evaluate how bonuses are determined. While the system they have in place makes sense, I think they could do with a minor update. Just that little bit - other than that, no cons!"

That's about it.,"Long, time-wasting internal meetings to hear leadership talk about how much they care about each and every employee, only to turn around and treat everyone the exact opposite.

Where to even start? 
- Insanely long hours mainly due to extremely high sales goals, interrupted during the day by endless internal meetings, therefore requiring you to work late to get actual work down. 
- No real process or structure. It's all a facade. Millions of internal docs for everything, but when it comes down to following the steps, it doesn't mean anything. Every day is an endless stream of panic and doom while we try to put out fires because all of a sudden ""the process changed"", or ""yes, it says that, but what it actually means is...."", or ""pre-approvals are required, except in the end they don't mean anything"".
- Referral bonuses are NOT paid out. They will string you along for months and months, passing you around from team to team, and you won't get what is due to you. But, miss a deadline for another stupid internal account plan, and they'll have your head. 
- Constantly talk of the importance of mental health, but won't thnk twice about why everyone is struggling and miserable. Extra sessions of Better Help don't matter if WE DON'T EVER HAVE TIME TO STEP AWAY FROM WORK


I literally hopped on a Zoom call with a coworker first thing in the morning last week, and was met with this colleague in literal tears, sobbing that she just couldn't handle the stress anymore, and there was no point in escalating, since her leaders were also just as miserable."

*The salary do not match with Ireland average salary if you have a QA position at least you should get a decent salary or the average wage in Ireland non less, As the QA position is not a entry level role ( if you come from a vendor as a reviewer or moderator you might be happy with the salary they will offer you but if you have a senior role or another role in your current company you might be not happy with the salary that the interviewer will offer you). 
* There is not salary adjustment after you became Senior in your role, at least everyone that is senior in the same Role should get the same amount of Money. For example If your colleague with same experience as you gets 38k and you get 30k and you did same interview, at least after you became a senior or after 1 year working in the role company should adjust the salary for everyone to gets the same amount in the same role.

- Low salary compared to competitors. Currently they pay vendor's rate even though people are directly hired;
- Absolutely no opportunities to growth. There is no internal job positions whatsoever. Once you want to progress, HR tells you to look for positions on Tiktok careers website and compete with external people. And it gets worse. If you manage to get a higher position, you WILL NOT get a salary increase. Let's say for example you apply for a Project Management position and you get it. Your salary will remain the same. However, if the hire an external person for this Project Management position, this person will definitely have a higher salary, though still not competitive compared to other companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. PS: I am not even sure if this is legal in Ireland;
- Dublin HR is incompetent. They are ineficient, inexperienced and they do whatever HR China tells them to do;
- China HR is mean and they have 'exploratory' mindset. Get more for less is the way they go. Everytime;
- Leadership and management are beyond incompenent. Favoritism is evident and if you're not in their group, you will have it bad everyday;
- Demanding place to work. They always want more and more. Targets are unrealistic;
- Tools are buggy and won't help you do your job efficiently. Servers are slow and video watching freezes all the time;
- All and all, avoid at all costs. If you work for a vendor and consider Tiktok to be a step up, think again. If you already work for a respectable company and consider Tiktok to be on the same level, laugh it off and continue with your day."

- WFH Flexibility: It doesn't seem like full remote work will become an option here at TikTok but there appears to be flexible work arrangements at best."
484,TikTok,Fast Paced and Exciting,2021-09-15,5.0,Account Manager,Fast Paced and innovative Company. Colleagues mostly smart and hardworking,High stress. Not everyone can cope with the fast pace. If you are left behind its hard to catch up.
485,TikTok,"Worst tech firm, period.",2021-09-15,1.0,Trust & Safety,"‚úÖ Working hours: Flexible, great for working parents
‚úÖ Remote working option
‚úÖ Standard employee benefits like most tech companies: Health insurance (medical, vision, dental), food allowance (Deliveroo credits), gifts on special occasions (ie., Christmas, New Years), paid time offs, drinks & snacks at office pantries.","Disclaimer: Do not assume this is a China company culture or behaviour. This is simply an organisation that ruined their culture due to bad hiring -- this can happen to any organisation that lacks proper leadership planning, regardless of nationality.

‚ùå Compensation Package/Employee Benefits
- Salary is not competitive to other tech firms, yet claimed they've done research to provide a fair compensation package. 
- If you come from non-tech, you'll most likely be lowballed.
- Worst insurance provider (Aviva), what you see on the insurance handbook is not what you may be able to claim. If you escalate this to HR on call, you might get your money back, all depends on your luck.

‚ùå Organisation
- The company claims to adopt a flat organisational structure, but employees (ie., managers) like to play politics and ranks at work.
- Lack of a proper org chart for an organisation that has thousands of employees. - Inefficient communication paths between employees, departments & divisions - Lack accountability for actions or decisions at different management levels, hence slows down work and decision-making (everyone says it's not their job?)
- Copycats & lack creativity: Tries so hard to copy literally everything that the other tech giants do without reviewing if it fits the org (ie., Facebook, Google etc. Even office swags looked similar in colours and style?!)
- Core values are only for show or to mimic other tech firms. The leadership teams do not do what they preach.
- Power struggle among hubs that impacted work efficiency. Leaders need to learn how to collaborate together.
- Resignation process is tedious, apart from speaking with your manager and drop a formal notification, you are required submit an application on the app. Also, they may or may not pay the final salary on time.

‚ùå People
- Extremely toxic environment, people backstab each other or play office politics to shine. Rude & competitive, even when they're not skilled.
- Mass hiring for the sake of expansion, but literally ANYONE (with/without experience) can join the company, as long as you behave like a ""Yes Man"" during interviews.
- Job mismatch is the biggest problem. When they're not capable of doing their own scope, they do other team's work instead.
- A mix of candidates from fresh grads, public sectors, tech & private sectors for the SAME job level. So expect the inexperienced ones contribute nothing, but claim credits for everything.
- Workplace bullying committed by higher level management is backed by HR, they'll try to brush it off or blame it on the employees.
- HR & management level are pretty gangster, ""be candid and clear"" ONLY if you have good things to say. They take constructive feedback extremely personally and will most definitely ruin your performance reviews for as long as they can remember.
 
‚ùå Work
- A huge discrepancy between actual work vs. job description. Job mismatch is a norm here. 
- Plenty of manual & duplicate work, because not all hires are familiar with basic tools or systems commonly used in tech firms.
- Lack work life balance or unable to finish work within 8 working hours, mostly due to inefficiency, resistance to new changes/technology, manual or no processes to guide, lack of time management & prioritisation.
- No flight plan or job progression paths for employees to work on next steps. Performance review scores were based on favouritism not job performance. When being questioned, they simply cannot provide any basis of your scoring and will blame it on employees."
486,TikTok,Toxic,2021-09-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great company to have on your resume
- Progressive on DEI
- Culturally relevant","Where do I start?

- Absolutely no strategy around growth which leads to arbitrary and unattainable goals. Followed by extreme employee burnout.
- You will be online all day, everyday. While there isn‚Äôt a written expectation of this, employees are so overworked that it‚Äôs not unusual to get a ping from a coworker in a local time zone at 2am. The structure for approvals and process forces people to always be online if not the work will stop. And you cannot be the one causing that - even if you‚Äôre on vacation. The expectation is to be online should any urgent requests or approvals come through. 
- TikTok‚Äôs culture is centered around selling you on the opportunity of working for the biggest platform and tech company in the world. With that comes a culture of gaslighting and dismissing employee concerns and general unhappiness.
- Compensation is not competitive. Normal increases are 3% which happen can happen anywhere from 12-18 months of working there with no stock refreshes. Zero growth opportunities in terms of leveling. If you want to get promoted to higher level you have to present your case to a panel."

-Work is a grind, no work/life balance
-Leadership does not address employee issues. ""We're looking into it"" is the response to every issue/concern and perpetuated for months/years to no avail. Culture has taken a big hit this past year, most attribute it to our US GM.

531,TikTok,Don't know where to start,2021-08-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fast-paced environment
No micro-management 
You have your own decision-making power in your domain
Fun people and team
Benefits are improving to match with other techs
Flexible working environment (you can start & take off whenever you want as long as you get your work done)","1. Pay is not competitive at all. 
They particularly lowball people coming from non-tech. As a result, big attrition, everyone wants to leave for a better pay and benefits. 
Note to HR: We know that you guys are lowballing us. If you want everyone to leave the company in less than a year, keep doing that. 

2. Weak management & leadership. 
They want to mass hire people for the sake of expanding the team, without thinking whether the headcount is necessary. They think that more headcount will result in more work output. They're not addressing the root cause. All these incompetent people will be fired when the company goes IPO for redundancy.

3. So many incapable people
Many people are not qualified for their role, period. They don't know what they're doing and their communication skill is zero. Very rude but they think that they're doing their job well. Don't thinks their managers are giving 'candid' feedback to them.

4. Bad culture
Everyone is so competitive. They want to show their work to leadership and reply them first. I think it's partly the fault of the company's Bytestyles. Aim for the highest? You've gotta step onto someone's head to be the mightiest and highest of all. 

4. The company holds you back until the last moment.
Resignation process is messy. They don't pay your final salary by the day they said they would. They hold your pay as long as they want as if they hold grudges against you for leaving the company.

5. No transparency in career opportunities
Some people get promoted even before probation because they are favored by certain leaders. It's arbitrary and biased. No clear paths for progression either."

2. Hired way too many people without thinking where to place them. End result = Too many useless, incapable people doing nothing & Too many stakeholders to align for a company that's growing fast. 
3. Leadership is subjective and biased (or seems so at least, because there's no transparency anymore). No one is ""candid and clear"" - the company's core value.
4. HR administration work is a nightmare. You really have to push every day for days to just get a single document - and even then, the company doesn't want to be flexible with its template to abide minimum official requirements! Employee's needs (not even wellbeing) comes last here."

This has given me amazing opportunity for personal and professional growth as someone at a relatively early stage in their career. I have worked on huge projects and had a large amount of responsibility, pretty much from Day 1, which has been exciting and eye opening. People at TikTok are incredibly friendly and willing to help, probably due to the fact everyone is really in the same boat working towards the same ultimate goal. I feel like often projects that are worked on are genuinely industry leading, and there is a huge scope for creativity and imagination if you have the perseverance to argue for your ideas.","TikTok is definitely an ambiguous environment. Many policies aren't yet in place, and many teams are growing at a very rapid pace. If you are uncomfortable in that environment, it's definitely not for you.

-No org charts anywhere, while positioned as some sort of rebellion against hierarchy, actually creates difficulty. It's very hard to finds out who owns a process, tool, or project (unless you happen to know someone who knows someone who's working on it).

You need to do basically what you are told to do regardless if you have to work outside your work hours.

Working hours turned out to be yet another blatant lie. I was told there were only 2 shifts (early and late) and only 1 working weekend. It turns out you only get 1 weekend off a month! Nonexistent work-life balance. New shifts were also introduced which sit right in the middle of the day (12 to 9 - 10 to 7) making it near to impossible to have a social life. Despite the disappointment and discouragement, you are reminded by your TL that bonus is also based on participation and visibility and the pressure to keep a smile on your face and crack jokes like nothing really happened is really high as your bonus depends on it. Very little support from your manager if you're a quiet person who prefers to do the job independently. You are reminded you need to keep your camera on, talk, participate and show interest which would be fair enough had it not been for the lack of trust and motivation the company caused. Lastly, the salary. Quite possibly the lowest salary I've ever been offered and no room for negotiation, no matter your experience. Overall a very disappointing experience and one I wouldn't recommend to anyone. I can assure you your mental health will be greatly affected should you decide to take this job."

3) Many team leaders are power-hungry and compete for scope at the expense of individual contributors.

4) The company philosophy is to intentionally allow for role overlap and fuzzy swim lanes to have teams compete.

5) On most teams, it's an extremely long and tedious process to get promoted, even if you've been performing well and there is a business need.

6) Benefits don't even come close to comparing to top tech companies like Facebook and Google.

The company looks a lot like a vendor. A QA-language specialist position is just a basic content moderator position. To obtain a salary review or a promotion it is necessary to wait for two performance reviews that can include anonymous feedback from coworkers, this means that others can actually leave a bad feedback not necessarily based on real performances, lowering the person's final vote. Having to choose beween different offers of employement, I deeply regret coming to Bytedance-TikTok, I've been lied about my duties and responsabilities, there is no transparency and lots of negative vibes coming from other coworkers that try to put others in a bad light to gain the attention of the leaders."

622,TikTok,"Growing Too Quickly, Late To The Culture Party",2021-06-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The company is expanding quickly so there is lots of growth potential and interest. Really great startup to have on your resume.,They are really pushing people to go back to office sooner than later even though most companies in the space are moving to a hybrid for fully remote concept. If they do not update the stance on PTO & Remote work they will loose really great talent to other opportunities that offer better work life balance.

Not only they make you moderate 1000+ stupid videos per day but they made the rota where they give you only 1 weekend off only per month (its easy to plan your weekend in this case cause you only have 14 weekends off in the whole year). Ah let me add that the 2 days off per week were not be together HAHA. And by the way they make you say on the interview that you have to be available 7 days a week so they full control over you.

Good compensation pack with all the things you did not necessarily need but probably want, like health insurance, dental insurance, order-in allowance etc. but these aren't worth it when you work on long shifts with a set time for a break and not having the chance to enjoy all of the benefits.
The salary doesn't worth it at the end of the months. Well-being and mental health are mentioned all the time as important, but not even once someone actually cared. The interview draws a nice picture of 8 hours shifts, one weekend a month and some other things, whilst in reality is way more intense, so what's been said in the interview was a lie.
I had to quit this job, even though I didn't have any other opportunity, just because of the above and how they've treated me and others.
I would not recommend working there. At least not in this role.","Working from home budget so you can work comfortably. A good starting salary at this level, however as mentioned, doesn't worth it against the hours."

No shift swaps are allowed between colleagues. You cannot take AL anytime you want. Forget about planning any trips as people in charge of the schedule announce it month by month and due to annual reviews in August and December you are not allowed to take any days off then.

675,TikTok,Best tech company to work for in the US,2021-05-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've worked at other companies (Silicon Valley software company, media entertainment in LA, smartphone company, semiconductor company). These things set TikTok and ByteDance apart from other companies:
1. Tremendous growth potential - fastest company in history to reach $17B and $35B revenue, fastest mobile app to reach 2B downloads, just getting started.
2. Opportunity to work on what you want - unlike older companies where you are pigeon-holed in a role, TikTok is only 2 years old, and you get a lot of white space to work on what you want and shape the future of the company.
3. Amazing people - super sharp, humble, friendly, hard working, supportive.
4. Culture: the teams that I know do not work 996, contrary to a couple reports out there. I work hard M-Th (8-10 hours per day), then stop working on Friday at 2, 3 or 4pm. Only worked 1 weekend in last 10 months because of an urgent project.

We were told we would do one weekend a month, after we started it turned out it was actually every other weekend.

783,TikTok,"Toxic work environment, actively hostile towards employees",2021-02-25,1.0,Business,Fast growing company that's hiring quickly and moving into new areas.,"* Old-school hierarchical structure where your place in the hierarchy determines everything and colleagues will decide how to treat you depending solely on where you sit in the reporting line. Claims to be flat, but the exact opposite.
* Highly political: performance reviews determined completely by politics and manager favour rather than objective measures. Drawn out performance evaluation process for the illusion of fairness to then just have a manager decide how much they like you with no recourse. Colleagues rewarded for pleasing managers rather than doing objectively valuable work.
* Zero consistency: everything changes every two months at the whim of leaders and you get told to drop everything and do something completely different.
* Policies are designed to keep employees on a tight leash. Zero trust that would be considered standard at any other big tech company. No flexibility regarding work hours or location. Expect return to the office full-time as soon as possible with no changes from before while most other companies are offering at least some flexibility and our competitors in tech are offering lots of flexibility.
* Zero work-life-balance, everyone is expected to work across timezones so expect meetings from 6am till well past midnight UK time and during weekends, holidays and PTO.
* UK leadership doesn't engage with employees; solicit questions to then actively avoid answering them (""oh look, we've run out of time for questions"" happens on every team call) and block any channels that might lead to feedback. Feedback (and certainly criticism) of management decisions is not tolerated.
* Lots of dissatisfaction and mistrust with UK HR as many colleagues were misled about their roles, titles and levels during recruitment and accepted their roles based on false information. UK HR actively refuse to answer questions on levels, promotions, bonuses and compensation to hide this fact.
* No compensation strategy: you're assigned a level but given no information about it (only the convenient excuse that they can't increase your salary because it's determined by your level) and the company doesn't have a known process for promotions, no standard salary increases, no standard equity increases and no clarity as to what bonus you will receive based on your performance review (or if you'll even receive the target bonus that you were told was guaranteed).
* All the negative UK reviews here mention the same set of issues but negative survey results are swept under the rug with no plan or desire to fix problems that are obvious to anyone paying attention."
784,TikTok,Open and accommodating (just not for its employees),2021-02-25,2.0,N/A,Overshadowed by the cons (see below).,"High control from base in China regarding working hours, culture and (lack of) flexibility. Constant avoidance from senior management regarding implementation of flexible working to match that of competing platforms, when there is no longer health risks, despite global employee demand for it. For such a current and diverse/ accommodating brand, their culture and approach in regards to employees is not reflected. It still shocks family and friends in the industry that such a big employer pushing an 'inclusivity' message, does not allow its employees a little more freedom in future. Lastly, if you think you are signing up for a 9-5, for most positions, you are actually signing up for an 8-5. If you want a life, try at instagram or facebook."

807,TikTok,Super creative and innovative,2021-02-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Well positioned for exciting growth
- Super creative, innovative, and fun place to work
- Flat, non-hierarchical, low-ego culture; bottoms-up suggestions highly encouraged","- Work-life balance is challenged by long hours collaborating across timezones
- Typical growing pains of a young hypergrowth company at this stage"
808,TikTok,Great company to work for,2021-02-03,5.0,Quality Analyst,"Good salary, benefits, flexibility, brilliant people",Sometimes it may be unorganized
809,TikTok,Definitely Avoid,2021-02-03,1.0,Senior Business Analyst,"- Great brand to get on your CV and externally has the wow factor amongst family and friends due to it's explosion in Europe notably over the past year or so, and especially since lockdown

- Always hiring and money isn't a stumbling block and that in itself creates an artificial reality with what is going on in the real world

- Fairly diverse workforce, although the average age throughout Bytedance is 30 (there is a reason for this and it's listed in the cons)

- The share prices is going up, up, up and it will be exciting to see when the Company IPO's

- Folk I came across seem genuinely grateful to be employed by TikTok although it concerns me whether that is real or not given one of the dimensions for getting a bonus / salary increment (see cons)","- You are joining a Chinese company Bytedance and not TikTok. 996 exists but expect and feel a pressure to work longer hours as normal, regardless of where you are located. This is the main reason the average age is 30, any older and balancing life, children, home becomes near impossible

- Trust and safety advertise a lot of updates which quite frankly should have been implemented when the app went live. It becomes quite difficult to get excited about an initiative to protect the younger user when this initiative should have been in place from day 1 for safeguarding purposes

- Be prepared to be overwhelmed by the sheer number of groups that you are entered into from day 1 and deciphering what is important and what is not, especially as a lot of material is in Chinese

- There is so much duplication and decision makers and processes and approvals being defined would help but they are just not in place

- There are too many tools - Microsoft. Google suit and lark and this just adds to the confusion and frustration. Try finding anything and when you ask you are pointed to documents that link to other documents that link to other documents!

- Some leaders were hired and are part of the Bytedance group and were in place before TikTok blew up so they may not be best placed to lead a much larger and more experienced international team now

- Absolutely zero work/life balance - this can't be emphasised enough. Know what you are letting yourself into. When you speak to employees who have been with the Company for a little while you can see this in operation - exhaustion and frustration, with comments such as ""no one joins to have a life"". Be prepared to be measured on which demonstrating ""the Bytestyles"" and engagement - what and how do you measure engagement other than a subjective how many hours you work as decided by your manager

- Job descriptions are left vague on purpose

- Facebook and Google employees will get in quickly but whether the culture will be a good fit for them remains to be seen as to how long they stay with the Company

- In summary the place is exhausting and there are a lot nicer environments to work and spend your time in"

Honestly incredible!","The only con (but a major one) is the fact that there aren‚Äôt a lot of perks to move up apart from the job title on the CV/own career progression as you do NOT get a raise if you change teams or position. This has to be the only place I‚Äôve ever worked at where stepping up (becoming Advisor, QA or MPOC) doesn‚Äôt mean a salary increase which is ridiculous and not motivating for a lot of people! Changing role means more work and responsibilities but there‚Äôs no benefits from it really!
ALSO some locations across Europe are getting paid significantly more than those in London doing exactly the same job as you which can be very demotivating if that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre based. Something to keep in mind!"

- If you are in a sales or client-facing role, the brand sells itself

- Chinese company therefore speed of innovation is its currency - incredibly fast paced

- Much younger/newer tech company in the arena so I really see teams working hard to match industry standards especially around trust and safety, policy, content moderation

- Fairly diverse workforce","- Business leaders in China HQ have never turned up in EU/US townhalls

- Some team leads were hired before TikTok blew up so they may not be best placed to lead a much larger and more experienced team now, leading to lots of unmet expectations within the team

- if you are ""lucky"" enough to report to a manager who was seconded from Beijing, good luck trying to explain European business culture to them

- Comp and benefit still to be improved

- Absolutely zero work/life balance. I clock 8am to 11pm on average and work on Sundays. This is not due to my poor time management but the unrealistic expectation from incompetent leadership within my team

- Job descriptions are left vague on purpose. I found myself in a job that was not exactly what I expected when I interviewed for it

- This place worships ex-Facebookers and ex-Googlers blindly, doesn't matter what sort of role they held there. As long as one is from a FAANG company, they are seen as an ""outstanding employee"" even if they are indeed mediocre"

From senior to junior level, this pattern has been observed through out my time here. There is a lack of ownership and accountability, definitely non-existent client-serving mindset.

THIS IS THE JOB: Watch 1000 TikToks everyday for 8 hours. Sounds easy right?... Wrong! Often come accross some terribly triggering content which you will inevitably need counselling for (you couldn't imagine the disturbing content i've seen on that app). Sat on my bum staring into space for 9 hours watching some 50 year-old dance to Jason Derulo isn't my idea of a banging Sunday evening at 11.30 pm. Oh yeh, that reminds me. The rota changes each week. 8 till 5 or 3pm till Midnight (they dont tell you this in the interview). 3 month probation within which time all sick days are unpaid by the way (got a warning for booking a COVID test for not giving 'enough notice'). You'll hardly ever get weekends off so say goodbye to sinking 18 pints with your mates in the pub watching Villa spank Liverpool 7 - 2 on a perfect Saturday afternoon. HR non existent. Everything from emails to training is all in Chinese. I've even started to speak Cantonese in my sleep after sitting at my desk translating all of my emails trying to get my dental filling reimbursed.

906,TikTok,Tiktoks Strong Values provide a backbone to however wants to excel in their career,2020-09-14,5.0,Quality Analyst,"Good Salary with great benefits such as Gym membership as well as Health insurance and daily vouchers for food, deliveroo vouchers and the list goes on.. Occasional cash bonuses from mother company ByteDance apart from the main yearly bonus! The bonus is not difficult to obtain at all, If you simply have a good work ethic & are motivated & willing to grow with Tiktok you will receive the bonus.

The actual workload is doable & not difficult.. they provide good quality training and slowly ease you into your work with enough time to get accustomed to their system & work style. 

There's plenty of room to grow & a high chance you'll be promoted very quickly if you simply show youre motivated & you want to get promoted. 

The job is really global, you'll be working with teams from all around the world, you'll have meetings with them & you'll be in touch with not just your market but many markets & its really enjoyable!

You have management but the eay the system is, you manage most of your things such as annual leave, overtime hours, its self management. Of course they'll be approved by a manager but I've worked at many companies and I havent seen the same trust in employees as Tiktok.","Prepare for a busy workday everyday! This isn't necessarily a con but it might be for some.. everyday is filled with your daily targets but also meetings & updates & emergency tasks will pop up so you'll need to find time for those too. It is not the job where you can just sit down and have chats at your desk for hours.. there is a lot of workload but again its doable just not for the lazy.

Updates can be overwhelming as its such a fast changing environment & the policy & procedures will change faster than you might expect so be ready to accept change & be able to change with it. You need an open mindset & a modern take on things. You need to be a chameleon, follow the trends, stay on top of things. If you can master this, you'll do great at Tiktok! 

Having no opinion is simply not an option.. you will be asked for recommendations & how to improve policy & procedures & saying nothing is not an option.. you won't be fired but its expected from you to constantly look for ways to improve everything.

Again, most of these cons aren't as bad as other cons in other companies."

I was lucky to start in the office before the global pandemic this year hit. The office was a fun and inclusive place to be. I feel I have grown in my career and learnt so much since being here and it's only been 8 months.
I have been so impressed with the way the company has adapted to a work from home culture during this pandemic. Especially inducting new employees into the company. The onboarding is seamless.
As a current employee at TikTok during this difficult time I feel well looked after and I am proud to work at such great company.

926,TikTok,Dysfunctional company with incompetent management,2020-08-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Fast growth creates the opportunity to increase responsibilities and scope of role.

- Cool brand that is attracting talented colleagues from top companies.","- Incompetent management: people who have been here the longest are made managers, provide little support to their reports and get in the way of work progress.

- Top-down culture where goals and way of working are set by management without soliciting or considering feedback from those below them.

- Complete lack of transparency and siloed information means little cross team collaboration.

- Chinese work culture, hours and policies dominate, conflicting with how things are done in the UK and create significant bureaucracy.

- Benefits and compensation are significantly below market and general sense of dissatisfaction with management's poor response to work-from-home transition.

- UK HR are out of touch with what is actually happening in the company, turn a blind eye to reported problems and act as if everything is perfect the way it is."

Everyone is an expert at what they do and the work place is extremely open. Any help I may need all I have to do is ask and people are more than willing to help. Pay is amazing the people are great and they make sure as an employee you are taken care of.,For me this is not a con but if you are not used to a start up environment this place is not for you. Because things change so fast here we are constantly changing processes as well as learning new things week to week and the difficulties in that are our higher ups are learning them as well with us. Like I said to me this is not an issue but for people who need constant guidance I can see where this could become difficult for them.

-The overall company culture is positive and optimistic. Always day one!","-The interview process was pretty long and rigorous, but my recruitment coordinator (A. Adams) really made a difference! She was super thorough and transparent in our follow up connects."
934,TikTok,AVOID AVOID AVOID,2020-08-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,It's honestly not worth having a 'Big Name' on your CV as you're practically selling your soul and life to the ByteDance organisation which lacks empathy and does not promote diversity internally or on the platform. Absolutely awful organisation to work for.,"I have worked for some incredible organisations in the past and working for TikTok has been the worst experience of my career.

If you're being headhunted by TikTok during the COVID-19 period then I'd resist the temptation to join and would look elsewhere; here's my raw and unfiltered truth on why you should pass any offer to work for TikTok.

1. UNORGANISED IN ALL ASPECTS: This organisation and its leaders do not believe in processes. You will be expected to continue working in the same unorganised way as your team even if establishing new process would be a win for the entire organisation.

2. AWFUL MANAGEMENT: I was discriminated and bullied by my manager and another colleague where HR turned a blind eye to the discrimination. Senior Managers are extremely inexperienced in managing team members - My manager was extremely unorganised and could not keep up with their own work let alone mine where I was expected to deliver without being given access to the right tools or resources to succeed. My manager even created TWO task lists where neither matched one another and was wondering why no progress was made despite sharing updates everyday and keeping them informed.

3. NOTHING IS LOCALISED: Be prepared to feel overwhelmed and be expected to use bespoke tools and processes which are all written in Chinese including emails with no way to translate this information.

4. TOXIC HR: I placed a meeting with the HR team who accepted my invitation and did not attend despite sharing follow-up emails - No apology was given or reason for being ghosted; extremely unprofessional.

5. GENERIC JOB DESCRIPTIONS: Let's be real - TikTok is growing at such a fast rate that they dont know what they need or want in terms of resource. Be prepared to be underpaid and do a role suitable for 4 individuals and then be ready to be questioned by your manager on why no minimum progress has been made in one element of your role.

6. ZERO WORK LIFE BALANCE: I was working 12 hour shifts including weekends and burnt out on my third week. My manager was aware of the hours I was putting in and did not recognise this hard work or effort - It was expected because they were also working on weekends and 12 hour shifts.

7. UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS TO DELIVER: Your manager and team will expect you to deliver but will not give you the training and resources needed to set you up for success.

8. ZERO DIVERSITY: There is no diversity internally or on the platform - No Diversity & Belonging groups.

9. TOXIC TEAMS: The central team are extremely toxic and were an absolute nightmare to work with and would not be willing to support you or set you up for success.

10. EGOS: My team had some HUGE Egos that felt bruised as processes and progress was made to unlock business efficiencies - No surprise as TikTok would fall head over heels for you if you've worked at Facebook or Google before. The jealousy was very real."
935,TikTok,Great recruitment experience,2020-08-02,5.0,Corporate Communications Manager,"The recruitment process was really smooth and transparent, I was supported the whole way through and got to know the organization much better through the interview process. The recruitment team were very responsive to my questions and made every effort to answer them in a timely fashion and provide more insight into the role, team and company!",Virtual onboarding has been good but it is always great to meet your new team in person
936,TikTok,Its not work if you're enjoying it!,2020-07-22,5.0,Partnerships Manager,"- Speaking to brands about an exciting offering that is well known.
- Working with a team of people who are very talented and come from various 
 fields of expertise.
- Inspiring and experienced leadership team who care about people, coach, mentor 
 and lead by example.
- Very quick to adapt to change and embrace change in a positive manner.
- The culture is very team oriented and diverse in terms of cultures represented 
 (multi-cultural).
- A forward thinking, people first organisation that is passionate about wider community issues, such as indigenous culture and representation, BLM, Australian Issues, Women at TikTok, LGBTI+
- The organisation embraces and celebrates working hard, delivering results and having fun
- You are treated with respect and treated like an adult
- No meetings for the sake of having meetings, each meeting has a purpose and objective and if it can be completed in half the time you get your time back as opposed to other companies that stretch out meetings for the sake of filling in the time.
- Opportunities to advance your career.
- Transparent and open door leadership team.","- To manage expectations, onboarding during COVID-19 is not easy in any organisation let alone online but that's the way it is for the moment. 
- This is outside the company's control, they do give you all equipment and support, but just the human face to face in real life element is missing, being exposed to background noise and chatter which can help expedite the onboarding experience. - - - Its a strange time, but it won't be forever, but just be prepared to be proactive, take initiative and ride the covid-19 wave. 

If patience isn't a virtue of yours, by the end of this it will be!"

The management likes to order sushi and their are free bananas so you don't starve during night shifts.","Contra
The sort of feudal system where each manager has a manager all the way to the HQ in Beijing. The way managers just seem to care about their own power base and building their little empires. The favoritism of the management rewards the wrong people (the so-called ''top performers'') for the wrong reasons.
They don't keep their word / make empty promises (about career perspectives and improvements that never happen).

Arbeitsatmosph√§re
It's your worst nightmare. Nobody talks to anyone. Since only individual performance counts for the Chinese management and every minute, every mouse-click is tracked, the pressure is too high to join in casual conversation with your coworkers, but you can watch a never ending show of short videos instead.

Vorgesetztenverhalten
Disturbing and disgraceful. Absolute lack of leadership and even basic management skills, but good at delegating tasks to others and basically let them do most of the work. Mostly absent during hard times or when painful decisions to what remained of the team had been or had to be taken. People the supervision didn't like or didn't know how to deal with, were sidelined or fired. The higher management and HR just stood by, watched and did nothing as the initially highly motivated team died a slow, but certain death.

Kollegenzusammenhalt
I have never witnessed such a hostile and toxic working environment. The petty Machiavellian plots and schemes just never stop, the backstabbing goes on and on. People who are strong at self-promotion while ruthlessly downgrading their opponents thrive at this company. Because supervisors actively involve in this kind of behavior themselves, lend their ear to all the gossip and use it against people, they make this workplace a living hell.

Interessante Aufgaben
The development of the app has been stunning, yet the tasks carried out in the Berlin office are mundane and extremely monotonous. Watching over a 1000 short videos everyday in a dark office building slowly but certainly turns your brain into a mush and give you nightmares you cannot imagine.

Kommunikation
The higher management has still to acknowledge there actually exist cultural differences between Europe and China, especially when it comes to human relations, communication styles and dealing with conflicts. Any major decisions will basically be passed along the chain of command all the way to the bottom where you are left to deal with it. No protective shield, no constructive discussions: just do it or get lost.

Umgang mit √§lteren Kollegen
Most employees Bytedance hires are relatively young (23-35).

Karriere / Weiterbildung
The company doesn't care about your career interests, they only care about their own business needs. So far, I have never participated in any serious training or had a conversation with HR about my career perspectives. When you do your job and you do it well, they just want to keep you there, right where you are. Competent and qualified people know better and move on.

Gehalt / Sozialleistungen
The salary used to be above average, but it seems somewhere along the way they changed their mind about that and now new employees make much less. This has led to a ridiculous pay gap between people who actually perform the same job.

Arbeitsbedingungen
The office is situated at the Potsdamer Platz WeWork area. The building (not the office) offers quite a magnificent view on the Tiergarten. The IT equipment, tables and chairs are OK. The air quality in the office is bad, especially during the night and on weekends.

Umwelt- / Sozialbewusstsein
Bytedance doesn't mind to have flashy neon signs with the company's motto and flat screens with company propaganda wasting energy 24/7 and importing tons of cheap plastic marketing merchandise from China. Or fly in a tech guy from the USA to fix the internet.

Work-Life-Balance
When you work from 16 PM till 1 AM, there is no such thing as a Work-Life-Balance, doesn't matter which promises were made by the company's recruiters. Normal office hours are only to be enjoyed by the management and supervisors. If you do have two weeks of normal office hours, this will be presented to you as ''divine mercy'', although it will only help to further ruin your sleeping pattern and what is left of your health. (Don't mention home office. There is no such thing in China.)

Image
The company obviously pumps a lot of Renminbi in glistening marketing campaigns to promote their apps, there have been some scandals concerning their apps, but the reality underneath the surface and the truth about the company remain mostly hidden for the moment. If the CPC-loyal company wants te become a global success, it really has to broaden its (eastern) horizon and be cool (instead of another big data monopolist-wannabe)."

This office reflects the company ethos and aims to foster a corporate culture embracing diversity. It is a multicultural and inclusive work environment where people from all walks of life thrive together to make the social media jungle look a little less of a survival of the fittest zero sum game but rather a place where everyone can be a creator, far from the glossy, all-too-perfect narratives we've grown used to.
