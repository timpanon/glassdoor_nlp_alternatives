There are collection of diverse business grouped under an immature and naive business head and are called Communities. This is a perfect example of how an individual can bring down the real growing and high potential businesses with in-experience and arrogance. 

The simple strategy of high headed COO is to delegate all all core business activities to support services and then  write emails to blame them. Most of the high performing team members for years have either left or being asked to leave to ensure he is surrounded by mediocre YES-men. 

Only if business can grow on whatsapp from home or holidays. The office schedule of him is tightly guarded secret and revealed to none. So much for open door policy that meeting with team (shrinking at the speed of light) is celebrated event. 

Penny wise pound foolish, or following divide and rule policy within team is the mantra that kept him last so long into the system. But its surprizing that how is he able to manipulate financial numbers and fake projections. Maybe top management is too shy to accept the failure in identifying the individual and his capability to run the business. 

How else would you explain his audacity to call his business failures as successfully leading mergers.  No even 1 single business under his leadership has shown a slight growth or promise to perform in near future. 

AOP's and roadmaps are not excel sheet and strategy is not writing lengthy ambiguous mails. There is a difference between Cost and Value. But alas! these are not taught in classrooms. 

And the BEST part he doesn't understand how internet function but believes he is the best digital entrepreneur mankind has ever seen.

One of the reasons I believe which makes TIL so distinct is the leadership of Mr. Gautam Sinha, the CEO of TIL.  Gautam brings on table a very fresh and startup like work culture in TIL where people work with much more ownership and responsibility. He shuffles between strategy and execution balancing a huge portfolio without interfering much in the day to day ops. 

If one wants to learn and grow fast in their career, I would recommend TIL is the best place to go.",Not sure about one as I was working with a fantastic team in TIL.

Dineout is my first organization in my career and it has given me lots of opportunities to grow and learn. My review is not only meant for future employees but also to higher management, for  I didn’t know another anonymous way out to reach out to them. My intent is to deliver the message to right people before it gets too late.","Dine out belongs to internet company Time Internet and parent company for times internet is one of the biggest company in India – Times of India. But in no way Dineout speaks of culture and values that Time of India has carried for so many years.
 
Enter the office after 9pm and one would not be surprised to find that people have reported to office drunk, not from a nightclub but right from the lane in front of office. When we initially shifted to this building the decor of empty liquor bottles at reception gave me a start up and cool feeling but I started detesting it once I was witness to above mentioned drunk employees after 9 pm.
 
I understand market is extremenly dynamic and jobs are not safe but it has now become very usual here to fire, tranfer or do anything irrational without giving  rationale. I am reporting to multiple people who themsleves are confused if I am reporting to them. While Time of India has never allowed any competition to be even remotely close to them, Dineout is directioneless. It is like a boat which has lost its oars and is bound to sink.
 
When we moved from times centre, with other changes, we also noticed a change in food menu and kitched standards. I am a non-vegeterian myself but did not appreciate that both types of food (veg and non veg) were being served from same kitchen.The empathy factor has gone to the extent that hygeine is not prioroty for management anymore.  Either the leaders didn’t believe in necessary such hygenie  practices while they were at Times Centre and they could not speak to the management or their values changed with change of premises. And Immature leaders are made to run the company and have been given an important responsibility of bread and butter of many families."
