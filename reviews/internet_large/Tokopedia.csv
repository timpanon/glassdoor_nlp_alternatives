Yeah no- for software engineer thats pretty much out of the window.
I was in 2019-pandemic era and pressure are mounting high with WFH.
Unrealistic deadlines. Really high expectation matrix for appraisal with dysfunctional 360 peer feedback. Disputes makes things blurry. Subjectively negative feedback even a single one can hurt your performance metric as long as it comes from product team.
Comms can get lost in slack channels. People are just really lazy to document things in jira/google docs.
Too many channels will invite you even tho you dont know whats its all about and youre not really part of the feature. They just ""overcommunicate"" resulting in ""overflow of unessential information""


Look for review titled ""The Golden Age is Over"", it is hitting all the spots.
- The politic. so spicy. You can see someone is promoted because of nothing, meanwhile, some poeple are consistently resigning because burned out.
- There are a lot of useless meetings
- Some managers/product owners just care about what the upper management wants, not protecting the team from unreasonable requests
- Information flow from upper management never goes to everyone, just several people. Like some new features or changes that can impact our workload
- Individual Contributor that can't really perform can just change to managerial, it's really stupid if you think about it.
- Promotion Driven Development, ""if it's not giving me a good point for Performance Appraisal then I don't really care"" Attitude. So this really hurt innovation and creativity."

Lead sees us working but still, will not be promoted because there is quota for promotion here, so the leads will promote their favorable staffs first rather the most hardworking one. The performance appraisal system is not transparent, and staffs cant complain at all about ""the real reason that person get promoted meanwhile I stuck here"". if you want to have good career path you need to be close to the leads and do the politics. Every month we get flash sale TV show and my lead even don't give us compensation leave because they think ""it's already our job to keep the system running"" yea dude this is professional work not a charity work i should have get overtime payment or get compensation leave. Be ready if you make even 1 mistake in this quarter, your performance appraisal will get ""beat to death"" because they will use you as scapegoat (so they can fill the quota meanwhile you will not get the quota to get bonus).

- Good teammates.
- WFH.
- Good tech stacks and challenge for high traffic (depends on your team/tribe)
- English speaking environment (depends on the team).
- You can find good mentors for work and life.
- A good experience to learn things about marketplace.","- WLB is not good because we have monthly event(s) and so we will need to do ""loadtest"" around 2-5 times. The loadtest will be done after midnight and will finish around 2-5 am. You will get 0.5-1 day dispense leave but still, you still have your task in sprint and destroying your sleep schedule is really bad.
- Each event, the request per second (RPS) target is really arbitrarily. The management was really afraid or traumatized by the first failure that happen around 2019. As example:
Let's say our (Business as usual) BAU RPS is around 2k and for the event the target becomes 12k. Even though the real RPS when the event is 4-5k. Then suddenly we have this ""exciting"" event and upper management suddenly says let's double our rps target and it becomes 24k. We have already done this for almost 2 years now and the actual RPS target was not even going more than 3 times the BAU RPS.
- The way we create features already changed, previously we developed features for users but now it's for the ""numbers"" in business metrics.
- Salary is below the average of other unicorns.
- The politic after the Lead level is really toxic, everyone here just cares about themselves. There are some exceptions but it's really rare. Everyone trying to get a promotion, it's rare to see managers that trying to help their team to grow. 
- There are a lot of useless meetings, the content basically explains issues/something to your higher higher ups. Let's say A is your manager, B is A manager, and C is B manager. There will be meetings to explain to B and C. The communication is not efficient. 
- Some managers just care about what the upper management wants, not protecting the team from unreasonable requests.
- Access requests can be a bottleneck because of the team that can grant the access to busy and overwhelmed by the total of requests.
- If you get a bad manager, just prepare to resign otherwise you will be burnout. The bad managers don't really care about their teams.
- Promotion Driven Development, ""if it's not giving me a good point for Performance Appraisal then I don't really care"" Attitude.
- Information flow from upper management never goes to everyone, just several people. Like some new features or changes that can impact our workload, you can suddenly be told ""hey we have this new feature/event tomorrow, can you help us do this.
- Some people are sweet talkers because of the promotion thingy (Exposure > actual work).
- Individual Contributor that can't really perform can just change to managerial, it's really stupid if you think about it. It's great if they can perform as managers but the reality is not like that. They are the kind of people that the team will become much better without them.
- Can pay billion rupiah for events but refuse to increase salary increment even though it's already below market standard. For reference, several engineers that left to another company (not even go to Gojek/Traveloka/Bukalapak) get salary increase around 30-60%."

- You surely can be promoted (with the note in cons part)
- You will be offered many opportunities to do more. It depends on you to decide to take it or not.
- The stacks are good for you to learn.","- Mostly almost all the managers are not good enough to lead a team/tribe. Sometimes they are just promoted quickly enough, or they are promoted because they are already in the company for many years.
- Politics! Oh my god! You can see someone is promoted because of nothing achieved (?), meanwhile, the team members are consistently resigning because burned out.
- If you are still a SE or SSE (not a manager), it's relatively hard for you to be promoted, you can, but you need to sacrifice your life to get it. You will see the managers keep being promoted while the lower position is working hard to make things happen.
- Overtime and overwork is your friend. You can still be at work until 3 am twice or thrice a month because of over-projected traffic for the monthly campaign.
- You're looking for a competitive salary? This surely not the place.
- Someone ping you at a random time is expected, even someone can send you only a ""hi"" message without directly asking you the real question.
- Don't expect anything from your Architect (but some are good tho). They will never help you. They are just random people that type ""+1"" or ""agree"" in the conference room.
- Too many unimportant meetings.
- Some product team has no insight into engineering. They come with ridiculous requirements and with a crazy timeline!"

- Work from home is implemented at this time (could save you money), you could request to get in building via their internal site","- As always, politics. Not much room for engineer to grow last time I worked, only for managerial position (which could be good depending on your position)
- For engineers, the managerial above can be a hit-or-miss. So the most reliable way to grow is to do/carry anything yourself
- The company relies somewhat on a closed-source, in-house, development tools, which you might not be able to put into your overall experience, since you probably won't see that ever again once you've decided to find other better opportunities"
204,Tokopedia,Promotion Driven Development,2021-10-28,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Good to learn a lot of tech stacks, because Tokopedia provide self-managed platforms for infrastructure (instance provisioning, deployment, etc) which ""force"" us to understand how those things works
- Huge traffic for some modules is a good challenge. We will learn a lot on how to design a scalable services.
- Flexible working hours (start 7AM-10AM; end 4PM-7PM; 12-1PM lunch break)
- Fully remote works during Covid (hopefully still fully remote after covid, because before covid, the remote-leave policy sucks -- only allowed 2 remote per months and for engineers-related only)
- Some individual contributors are really nice and knowledgeable and willing to help you. They will be a good mentor for you if you meet them (be wary of the cons)","- Managers and above are ignorant. They don't understand their own module. Every time we encountered an issue, they will ask template questions without giving solutions. For example: ""What happened?"", ""Why we don't catch it in staging?"", ""How do we prevent this in the future?"", etc.

- Monthly event with unrealistic target. The managers always push to aim for higher target in preparation (e.g. 5x BAU traffic). Even though we have event traffic data for up-to 1 year, they still being paranoid on the target.

- If you were on oncall shift, you will be paid with nothing. If you are a PIC for load test, you will be paid 1-day dispensation leave. But keep in mind that your task will not be decreased (depends on your lead and PM, but most of the time, we are still going fast with features)

- Compared to other companies in Indonesia, salary relatively lower for the same titles.

- Tokopedia performance review policy force us to ""sacrifice"" people to get ""below expectation"" grade. So if you have 10 high-achievers members, good luck! 1-2 of you must be under-performed.

- Low standard on interviews and probation for individual contributors (architect level and above). We hired a lot of technical architects but very little who meet our expectation. Most of them only create meetings and in the end asking the squad leads or principal engineers to do the job.

- Some engineers are lazy to read and don't know how to text efficiently (e.g. ""hello"", ""hi"", ""Can I ask a question"" without further context). They always send annoying question in DM and tagging you in public channels for their exposure. 
 
- Managers level or above can be promoted without real contribution. In contrast, it's really hard to get promoted for people below manager level."

They really want to burn you out

Hr and Upper management say they understand there is burn out but still set aggressive targets despite shortage of people being communicated again and again by the team. 

Team morale is low, it's one project to the next, with timelines arbitrarily set by business without taking into account team headcount. Upper management will just muscle their way to force the team not sleep to get the job done"

Benefits, training, empathy are all top notch.","Make It Happen, Make It Better is a great concept; but often misused as individuals would take in a lot of projects at once, create things in a short time just to hit deadlines, but does not really fit the needs, and would create a lot of new problems with the product/program/features. Would recommend for us to take a step back, reprioritize, and create sustainable products/features.

Being an agile company means people would sometimes take their off time as work time, heavy work that burdens the mind to sleep and the next day. Would recommend to not create an environment/culture/expectation of High Performing Culture that is misguided as long hours = good productivity. Good productivity should prioritized as highly impactful & important projects.

A tiny portion of leaders are not good role models - low empathy, low engagement, low training & development, lack of team communication/strategizing. Either they are being promoted too fast before maturity, lack of training, or it's the individuals themselves that are the problem. Would recommend to held internal 360 from their subordinates every 3 months to see their team's healthiness and be acted upon when needed.

- Where you want to be if you want to grow and learn. You gain so much even if you feel unsure at the start (that's normal), and everyone wants what's best for the project so they don't mind sharing their knowledge with you. No drama, no ulterior motive.
- Various benefits for employees.","- No work/life balance. Expect to never have a day off without working (yes, you will still have meetings during vacation). On normal workdays, meetings could go for 9-10 hours a day, well into after working hours--especially during WFH.

They also treat employees very well, more than anyone can expect: bold decision to go for WFH until today (6-months now, since crisis) really help me and my family feeling safe, no pay cut at all, and company choose to reduce advertising and marketing spends instead of cutting employee costs which allow us not to terminate any employees — while other big Tech in Indonesia did laying off People.

Flexibility","They hire juniors and no one but juniors. So if you are a lead and would like to build your own strong team -- forget about it! Only fresh grads, others are too expensive here.
As a result, you ( as a lead ) should totally forget about vacations or even weekends, since your junior subordinates will easily derail the work. Yes, you can claim a vacation and no one will refuse to approve it, but in your best interest is to avoid the vacation at all means.
As a result, you obliged to micromanage because otherwise they will make tons of mistakes and you can never predict whether they will meet the deadline or not.
But guess what? Higher ups are behaving as if their team was from Silicone Valley and demand timely results with huge impacts.
 They scare you and manipulate. Even if you delivered indisputably impactful results you will still be blamed akin to others, who did nothing. Just to scare you again and stress enough for you to work like a mad 24x7x365.

This leaves no place for growth and spreads burn out, but they don't care, since every junior is easily replaceable. 
But if you are a junior -- you are welcome! You will get all you want here. Only for your lead the journey will be not that bright..."

594,Tokopedia,Poor Benefits for New Employees,2019-02-12,3.0,Software Engineer,"Tokopedia is a good company to start your career, you'll get to work with cutting edge technologies and solve real problems that millions of Tokopedia users are facing. 

The salary is okay for an Indonesian company, though it could be better: you will be asked your expected salary before they give you their offer, even if you're a new graduate don't undersell yourself by pricing yourself the minimum wage. If they're asking for your expected salary this means you most likely already have a foot in the door so don't undersell yourself.

You may get free breakfast in the form of bread and some jam or chocolate rice. Free milk and coffee too, but the bread is limited (four packs a day, if my memory serves right) on a first come first serve basis.

As a software engineer you'll be lent a laptop with Ubuntu installed on it that you'll use daily for your work so you don't really have to worry about bringing your own computer to work, and you can leave the laptop in the office so you don't have to bring the laptop home if you don't want the extra weight.

Great location, you can get anywhere in Jakarta from the office fairly quickly (unless there's traffic).

It's the biggest market place in Indonesia so there's a sense of pride in working there, and knowing that what you do matters and impacts a lot of people.","Tokopedia has some company values that I feel most of their employees don't believe: while being ""customer-oriented"" is one of their values, in my tenure I've personally heard and seen management decide things based on profitability and not on customer benefits. In terms of their being a corporation I understand the need for profits, but I do think it's hypocritical to claim they're customer obsessed while discarding solutions that benefit customers over profitability.

When you join Tokopedia you'll be placed in a three-month probationary period where you'll get limited access to tools to help you work, no paid time off, and no work from home opportunities. Once you're through you get 2 monthly work from home so essentially you lose six days of work from home during your probation. It's common to feel like second-class citizens during your probationary period.

Open office: this is subjective, but personally I don't like the open office concept. Lack of privacy and the need to ""look"" productive all day.

Not every team is great and you don't have much say in choosing what team you get in (you can say your preferences but it doesn't guarantee anything). While I was a part of a great team, I knew people who were placed in less... amazing teams."

Always chasing the next deadline and pressure from management has worn down the team. Sometimes we need more time to release quality products. But since we're always chasing the next target, there's never time to improve code or iterate.

2. Minimum teamwork and mentorship. Due to the pressure on team members and lack of initiative, everybody focuses on their own work. There's no sense of ""developing people"", rather strictly completing tasks. This later results in a blaming culture when tasks are not delivered. Minimum constructive criticism.
