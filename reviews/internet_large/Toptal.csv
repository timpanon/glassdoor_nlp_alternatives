6,Toptal,Don't be tricked by the false advertising,2022-03-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,100% remote. You can work from anywhere without needing approval.,"I highly doubt many of these 5-star reviews are real. There's no way that many employees can find absolutely no cons of working here. There's absolutely no way 70% of employees think the CEO is doing a good job. My team had a 30% turnover rate and none of us thought this is a good company, let alone one with ""no cons"". I know many groups who are in the same situation we were. 

Their top 3% of talent slogan is incredibly misleading. Top tech companies have way lower offer rates than 3% so it’s not even something to brag about to begin with but also keep in mind that most top developers don't even bother looking at Toptal because they can make way more somewhere else. Toptal keeps the acceptance rate artificially low by having recruiters reach out to people that have no real shot at getting accepted and getting them to apply. 

Toptal has fallen behind a lot of similar companies that do pretty much the same thing. Those companies offer better benefits, culture, and pay. Many of them also have the backing of top VC firms."

24,Toptal,Embarrassing place to work,2021-12-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,You can work remote. Though obviously that's the case at many companies now,"- This isn't a good or interesting company but Toptal keeps trying to convince you they are. They keep telling everyone how elite the team is and how so many companies are dying to work with them. In truth, most of the people that work here are contractors from developing countries and most of their clients are small companies no one has heard of. 

- Even with that reality, you better drink the Kool Aid if you want to work here. Toptal does not take well to any criticism. Very few people actually like this place but we all know we must pretend to or else risk getting outcasted. 

- There's a blame culture and some really poor managers. Combine those together and you get a toxic culture. If anything goes wrong, be prepared to be thrown under the bus even if it was your manager's fault. 

- Almost no one in the tech industry has heard of Toptal and those who have don't think highly of them. Its reputation was destroyed due to screwing over employees and investors by withholding equity. 

- Their marketing plan is essentially to spam and post fake reviews on every possible website. They've already been banned from a number of sites for this. Just look at some of the reviews here. Most of the positive reviews are clearly gibberish. 

- The turnover is terrible. Toptal used to list both current and former employees in the company directory. The former employees list was 5 times longer than the current employees list. Looking through that list also showed most people left within a few months of starting.

- Many people have already mentioned this but the HR team is terrible. They are completely unprofessional and are basically a propaganda arm of the company."

42,Toptal,How to get Free PTSD?,2021-09-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Good for people that have just started their careers
- Remote, but who isn't remote nowadays","- Leadership

So let's start here. I'm not going to waste too much time on the CEO. Lots of horror stories about him online. One thing to note is that he has a nickname ""psycho"" among the execs in the industry which is actually quite funny. The self-proclaimed ""genius"" leads the self-proclaimed ""greatest talent company in the world"" . But enough about the guy who fires people on a whim, openly threatens his employees, condones racism and sexism and calls people retards on team calls with 500+ attendees.

The People Operations team is the biggest reason why Toptal has so many bad reviews and why it's such a terrible place to be at. What stands out about that team is its leadership and how they fabricate stories about other people, their sex lives, gossips openly in team calls, and shares personal and private information that were shared with them, only to make them look bad. They've proven time and time again that they can't be trusted, that the sole purpose of this team is to eliminate any threat from within at any sign of trouble no matter the cost.

A whole lot of nepotism happens there as friends and acquaintances get hired regularly and are tasked them to run errands, seemingly wanting to help people, but really wanting to remove anyone who is in the slightest way unhappy. People that have built the place that it is today have been backstabbed, sabotaged and removed by them.

- Culture

Reeeeaaallly doesn't exist. It's great when things are great, but at first sign of issues, whether internally, or externally -- people get thrown under a bus at first chance. The culture isn't terrible everywhere, there are smaller teams that have different dynamics which helps, but cross-team collaboration is non-existent 90% of the time. Toptal cares about revenue, and definitely not about it's employees.
What's funny here is that they've implemented a ""cultural interview"" as a step in every interview process, and it's hilarious that some of the people that are ""culture ambassadors"" don't know a thing about the company history, and if you ask them questions about bad reviews here -- they will of course blame the people that posted them, and label them as traitors, spineless dirtbags that have nothing better to do, than being jealous. You see, Toptal can't be wrong in anything. =D If you are this far in the interview process, and you get turned down, trust me -- You've just exhibited traits that make you a normal person, so anyone who wants to know how they fare on the ""psycho-meter"", they should try this out. By the way, we have a chat for culture ambassadors and it's hilarious to see how much they like praising each other and pat each other on the back. Seems like group therapy more than anything else.

As an example of how screwed up this company is, they refused to comment or issue a statement (lost a couple of employees because of this) on the BLM movement. And while they're within rights to do so, it's the reasons why they refused to do it that are terrible, and apparently, that's because they might upset some larger (Fortune 50) clients and lose business (since decision makers are white).

A word on leaving Toptal? You signed your death penalty. Prepare to get threatened, asked weird questions and reasons for leaving. Prepare to get terminated from Slack immediately in case you wanted to say BYE to people.

- Growth

I heard the Toptal didn't have career paths designed for most of the organization for years. People worked in the same roles for ages, without promotion, bonuses or raises.
That hasn't changed much because if you do get promoted, the raise is barely noticeable, but, you get a lot more responsibility in your role, and more things that you can get fired for.

- Compensation

You'll probably climb the Himalayas before you get a raise or a bonus here. At least it rarely happened in 2020 and it slightly improved as decent talented people started leaving.
The only people that do get it are those in leadership positions where their comp is attached to the ""$1B goal by end of 2022"".
As mentioned, when people started leaving, they realized they might lose those that they have trained for months, and started throwing money at them. 
Mentioning you're considering leaving is the only way to get paid more.

- Diversity and inclusion

People are neither trained nor aware of what these terms mean. 
Oh yeah, and take a look at the leadership roles, that should tell you how diverse this company is. 

- Strategy & Mission Statement

"" Let's get to $1B. ""

You see, this company used to care about the ""talent"" around the world, but it no longer does. They've made some really good hires in leadership that could get them there, but they also made some poor choices as well.

And while it's OK to have great growth goals, it should not come at the expense of its talent.

Talent frequently gets the short end of the stick, when working with clients, and if clients complain and threaten to take it public, the talent ends up not getting paid, threatened with expulsion if they complain etc.

- Reviews Online

Most of the reviews here are posted by people that have been at the company less than a month. What Toptal did is hilarious, given they knew Glassdoor is like cancer, and it will continue to spread the more people leave. They included swag as part of the interview process, and made it necessary for people to post about it on social media on how great the company is. 
They also often run NPS surveys and brag how the score is very high.

That is very much true except that there's fear of retaliation and termination if you score as anything less than 8 because every concern, and conversation you have about anything will result in you being blamed for how you feel. Again, Toptal can do no wrong. And people were bullied, harassed and ultimately fired for feeling anything but GREAT at the GREATEST TALENT COMPANY IN THE WORLD.

Read the reviews on other sites, and you'll notice a very odd pattern.
A massive amount of 5 Stars (barely any 2 - 3 - 4) and then a considerable amount of 1 Star reviews. Seems selective, doesn't it?

- Business Model

There is really not much ""genius"" here. We vet talent, and it's not that difficult. This is obviously visible from the slow growth, and poor retention from clients since quality has gone down.

Our proprietary platform is a decent tool, but probably obsolete and too complicated for what it was designed. We hear Taso talk about it as it was invented to cure cancer, but it's really a bunch of legacy code that nobody can't touch because it would stop working.

On the flipside though, Toptal is really not afraid to charge clients exorbitant rates. There's an insane markup to the rates engineers ask for. 
For an example, an engineer would ask $25/hr and Toptal would mark it up to $80/hr while they mark it up even more for larger clients (they would add in excess of $100+ per hour). 
We're pricing ourselves out, but I guess getting to $1B justifies the price. Oh yeah, good luck managing our talent and being responsible for failures. Toptal will only ever admit anything if you take it to court! =D"

For those considering Toptal as way to get into tech, don't do it! This is NOT a tech company. Most of your work will be boring repetitive tasks that do not build any useful skills. 

Toptal likes to fire people with no warning. It's an unprofessional way to do business and has left my team scrambling to figure out how to continue projects with no heads up. 

There's been a lot of complaints about the CEO. However, a lot of the exec team either condone his behavior or are too weak to stand up to him. The HR team is particularly slimy. They basically hit every negative HR stereotype you can think of."

Do yourself a favor and filter by most recent - you will find a pattern of one/two horrible reviews followed by 5-6 5 starts right after. As other posters have said - the CEO is abusive (not even borderline) and a narcissist to the highest order. He ultimately ends up firing anyone that tries to think outside of the box - he is so obsessed with social media presence because it feeds his ego. HR is absolutely no help and the CPO is like his personal police - HR isn’t there for you at all.  This place was so awful to me that I often day dream about the company’s demise 😅.

Run for the hills. Seriously."

I see most of the good reviews comes from the freelancers in the talent network rather than the core employees. That says a lot.

 The leadership team is such a joke. There are people leading sales teams who don’t know the first thing about either sales or people management.  One of the pitfalls of a remote organization is that nobody truly knows their colleagues. This means it’s entirely possible for incompetent people to hide behind their more successful colleagues and pass their success off as their own. So toxic.

Honestly, there are much better places to be where you can work with smarter/more inspirational people.  A lot of people are plotting their exit routes."
56,Toptal,Terrible,2021-08-10,1.0,Core Team,Remote work. No traveling. Potential for quick promotion given high turnover rate. Some friendly junior people. Not too much else.,"This place is embarrassingly bad. It's not so much that it's just a poorly run company. It's that some of the execs and recruiting team think this is actually a good place to work. I've seen recruiters tell candidates that Toptal is the best talent company in the world without a hint of irony. That's right, Toptal, a company with crazy turnover, no name recognition, below average pay, and managers who are now resorting to openly begging people on LinkedIn to apply here is trying to market itself as the best talent company in the world. No wonder it's lost 3 CMOs in 2 years. 

Here's the truth about Toptal:

Toptal does not have elite talent since its pay is not competitive against top companies. 

Toptal has sued more employees than given them equity. You can look it up and confirm if you think I'm exaggerating. 

Toptal isn't a unique company. There are countless places that basically have the exact same business model including 100% remote work. 

There are no company holidays here. You need to be approved for any day you take off. A lot of people end up working major holidays. 

HR mainly exists to protect the CEO's ego. Internally, any negative feedback is followed by a meeting with an HR rep to discuss how you're wrong. Externally, HR focuses on inflating its ratings. Just look at how many one sentence 5 star reviews here consist of everything is great and there are no cons."

The company works really hard but they try also very hard to improve work life balance, and to have wellness activities
There are book clubs, working moms clubs, fitness, photography club, outdoor clubs, cooking clubs, and you can join whatever you want and participate in their activities.","Work life balance is sometimes they are aware of, however nobody in the company will ever force you to do extra hours, burn yourself out or work on weekends and night time. At the end work life balance is a bit tricky to assess considering the jobs are completely remote! So at the end of the day the o my person responsible for their sanity and balance is the employee. 
The company managers, at least I can speak about the people team side, do encourage you to take breaks, go for walks, divide your working hours if necessary, block your calendar if needed and they have flexibility."

Solid product with a great product-market fit","The CEO is the worst leader I have ever witnessed and creates a horribly toxic work environment, causing an obscene amount of turnover (and tears). I can handle a tough executive with high expectations from a competent leader who just wants the company to reach its full potential. That's what we all want. That's not this CEO. He thrives on publicly shaming his leaders in order to make himself feel bigger, because he doesn't actually know what he is doing. He has this alternative view of the universe that doesn't align with any best practice of a high performing organization. You can't disagree with him. He hires strong leaders for a reason because he needs them, though has no interest in them actually bringing those excellent outside perspectives to Toptal. It's his way or loud, angry, public humiliation. He has never really worked anywhere else, yet thinks he knows how mature companies operate. He has no idea. His influence (whether you work directly for him or not) will rip your guts in half emotionally. No matter how much he offers you, run far and fast the other direction. The damage to your mental health is not worth a day of working here."

76,Toptal,Disappointing company and culture,2021-05-28,1.0,Core Team Member,"They pitched the role and the company well during the interview process. The HR team kept telling me how great the company was and to ignore the reviews from disgruntled employees.

Certain roles and teams are more removed from the larger issues of the company. 

Remote work was a nice perk since not every company offered it at the time.","The benefits and pay were below average. Toptal’s salary is 20% below what most tech companies offer. They offer no bonuses, 401K match, or equity. I had to even pay for my own computer, internet, and any other tech I needed. 

Despite being told by HR how Toptal was one of the hottest tech companies, very few people have ever heard of this place. The people who knew of Toptal mainly had a negative view due to the CEO’s reputation. This made finding another job more difficult. 

The company is uber cost focused. Management tries to spin decisions for other reasons but it’s usually due to keeping costs down. Most employees are from developing countries. Spun as we identify the best talent in the world. Real reason is they can be paid less and get no benefits. Also unlimited vacation is spun as allowing flexibility. Real reason is so they don’t have to pay people out for unused days.

Likely related to the above but the tech used here are really poorly designed. Rather than using 3rd party tools, Toptal tries to have their tech team design in-house options. Unfortunately, what ends up being created is usually really bad. 

Poor people managers across the board. Toptal has a lot of turnover so people are often put in manager roles without proper training or experience."

The people are great, the culture is great, the work-life balance is great. Do you see a pattern here? It is GREAT. Toptal is my favorite place that I have ever worked.

I just spent some time reading some of our recent reviews, and it is my opinion that someone is trying to ruin our reputation by writing these negative reviews. 40% of our hires come from Employee Referrals. If everyone here was miserable, they wouldn't refer their friends to work here! Also - they write ""after this negative review, you'll be see positive reviews, don't believe them."" Give me a break. Anyone who is reading negative reviews, find a Toptaler on LinkedIn, and write them. See what they say. I am confident that they love it here, just like I do.","Remote work and our fast-paced, over-communicating culture isn't for everyone.

Some of the people were helpful and knowledgeable, most were not and truly lacked leadership and communication skills. Onboarding is a joke and new team members are frequently blamed for mistakes made by older team members or managers. My manager told me to take good notes during meetings then told me I was the problem when I caught him in lies or mistakes.

- There is a culture of blame and fear. If you make a mistake, people will shout at you.

Please read the other low rated reviews to get an impression of how it is to work with the core team. For me, I would never recomment Toptal mainly because of the management and the CEO."
98,Toptal,The best employer I hadn't heard of ...,2021-04-01,5.0,Copy Editor,"Some may be skeptical of glowing reviews but I honestly don't have a bad word to say about Toptal.

The work we do is important, sure, but the people are what make or break a company. And on the people front, Toptal shines. I work with a great group of folks doing interesting work and I'm happy to work for a company that's innovative and always striving to be even better.","Toptal is remote by design and I joined the company during a pandemic so I wouldn't have in-person encounters regardless. If going to an office every day is important to you, you'll miss that with Toptal.

104,Toptal,Toxic,2021-02-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Remote work. That's about it.,"Toptal is a toxic workplace with a fear-mongering, egomaniacal narcissist at its helm, who is filled with delusional ideas about the importance of his insignificant little company. This toxic culture stems from that because, as we know, it trickles down from the top.

You can bust your gut, spill your blood, use your industry clout and expertise to promote Toptal, and it will be for nothing. Toptal takes it all for their benefit, with you getting zero recognition or appreciation, with the real possibility of being dumped in a second. You will also find yourself in a dead-end job with zero opportunity for career growth.

The quality of the people and the resulting output has suffered immensely over the years. In late 2018 a popular co-founder left and everything went downhill from there. A major exodus of good people followed for several reasons. First, without fail, the company consistently hires the wrong people to head departments resulting in the exodus mentioned above. Second, they promote incompetent people from within. This stampede toward the middle, the sacrifice of what was a potentially good idea on the altar of the Peter principle, is leading to the destruction of the hard work (that took years to realize) of the few that did spill blood to make it happen. 

If you have integrity, a modicum of self-respect, and the impulse to do the best work possible, you will soon become dispirited, discouraged, and demoralized. The politics, the favoritism, the egos, the backstabbing, the sycophants —the list could go on, all the while the company professing to have a culture of high standards and incredible people. Don’t buy it. None of it is true. The only way to survive in this toxic environment is to drink the kool-aid.

This is a company where only sycophants and booty-smoochers survive. It’s become a place where anyone with half a brain, high-end talent and skill, and solid industry expertise who speaks truth to power will be pushed out in no time.

In my opinion, the company is so unhealthy, it will be dead within five years."

110,Toptal,Spend an hour or two with this team and form your own opinion about us,2021-02-05,5.0,Director of Recruiting,"FULL DISCLAIMER: I'm a part of the recruiting team. I'm writing this review not because I've been asked to (I haven't), but because I'm tired of seeing negative reviews showing up on this page that are recycling years-old data points and painting an inaccurate picture for candidates of a team that I'm very proud to be a part of. Toptal is a rapidly-scaling start-up, and like many companies, we made mistakes and broke some things early on. It happens. If you're trying to truly move fast and innovate, breaking eggs is a necessary part of the early recipe. Change is necessary and sometimes painful, but as someone who has watched things evolve firsthand for the last four years, I believe the changes have been positive. They’ve helped a good company strive for greatness, and achieve it regularly in departments across the organization. 

For the last two+ years, the executive leadership and overall direction of the company have elevated dramatically, and it’s made this a great place to work. The company has become much more people-centric, and as a result, over 40% of our hires last year were Toptalers referring friends and former colleagues. The benefits and perks have improved. The internal mobility opportunities are fantastic for autonomous, responsible people who thrive in dynamic organizations. Our communication is direct and honest, always with the intention of trying to help people grow. The feedback we receive from candidates who interviewed with us but didn’t end up joining the team is nearly unanimous in its positivity, both relating to how they were treated as people and their overall enjoyment of their interview experience. I encourage anyone curious about joining us to throw their hat in the ring and meet with us for a few hours: regardless of the ultimate outcome, I’d be shocked if you didn’t have a good experience with us (and I’d personally want to hear about it so we can continue to get better).","Toptal isn't for everybody. The company has a very high bar and pushes its people, and most of our teammates are committed to each other at a ""sisters-and-brothers-in-arms"" level. We don’t want to let each other down. In that vein, we look for people we can rely on when things get tough (and in a 40%+ YOY growth organization, things do get tough). It stretches all of us outside of our comfort zones. Toptalers need to be open to direct, constructive criticism and be comfortable defending their viewpoints with data, not just intuition. If that doesn't sound like fun to you, it probably won't be."
111,Toptal,"Toxic culture, arrogance, horrible company",2021-02-05,1.0,Software Engineer,"Absolutely nothing, it is a great idea with a horrible implementation.","The company has a horrible attitude since the recruitment process, where the tone of the conversation is like they are making you a favour to let you work for them, it sounds like an old fashion cult in which you have to make crazy things to prove you are good enough and join them.

The recruitment process is full of warnings that if you are not compliant to whichever rule, your application will be stopped or suspended.

The tests they use are absolutely academical and unrealistic and also having more than 20 years of experience will not help because they are totally abstract and designed to make you fail rather than prove your skills, treating people like junior students rather than experienced professionals.

The recruiters will just squeeze anything they need out of you and showing arrogance during the whole process.

The same attitude is then detectable while working with them, where the toxicity comes out in any element of the job at any time, bringing the stress level to the stars and making you hate every single moment you spend with them.

It is a great idea completely gone bad in a terrible way."

120,Toptal,Best hiring/onboarding process + amazing remote culture of brilliant grown-ups doing great work,2020-12-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I knew from the moment I applied for a position with Toptal--answering essay-style questions rather than just sharing my resume and a cover letter--that this was a different kind of place. I was right in the best way possible, though I'm still new here. I've now been on both sides of the hiring process at Toptal, and I've never been so impressed with a company. They truly care about candidates and make sure that their time and experience are respected. I took a very reasonable skills assessment before getting my offer--as opposed to ones that take days of work--and had great, candid conversations with the four people with whom I interviewed. It was the fastest I'd ever gone from application to offer, and it's because the recruiting team is seriously top-notch (and no, I'm not on that team!). Onboarding was thorough, making me feel up to speed so much faster than at other companies that don't have such a well-thought-out process. It was surprisingly entertaining too--I can't say I'd ever enjoyed sexual harassment training until the videos I watched here. Again, it speaks to how the people team cares about team members and wants them to have a great experience. Plus, they've developed a true, distinct culture with tight-knit communities, even though everyone is remote, which is no easy feat, especially given that there are hundreds of employees. They've invested in what seem to be the very best tools and resources for accomplishing that, which is so appreciated after spending years in a different industry that never spent for the right tech. Every single person I've encountered is exceedingly bright. My work-life balance has never been better (and I've worked at companies that are ""known"" for work-life balance), and it's all because we're trusted to get our work done when it makes sense and, at least so far, expectations for what work needs to get done have been reasonable. I love talking to people all over the country and the world each day and starting to feel as close to them as I would if we were in one office--except I never have to commute!","There's turnover. As the pool of talent at the company gets better and better, employees who got in earlier who aren't doing A+ work might not get to stick around, but there are supports in place to minimize these incidents.
There are also shifting priorities and ambiguity, as with any high-growth organization. That doesn't seem to work for all people.
There's history that sounds scary in these reviews, but I took it with a grain of salt and I'm glad I did. I've worked in truly toxic environments--this is absolutely not one of them.
It can be a little tough to schedule meetings with people because we are a globally distributed workforce, but people outside of the US are extremely accommodating.
Not everyone has heard of Toptal like they've heard of similarly profitable, talent-focused tech companies. Then you get here, and you can't believe your luck that you are here."

Honestly there’s very little that’s a pro of working here. Every month we get a nice group of new people but most leave pretty quickly.","Toptal has convinced itself that if you say you’re an amazing company enough times it will be true. This place is far from an elite tech company. It’s not actually even a tech company. Did you ever dream of working at any of the hundreds of temp agencies that already exist? Then this place is for you. 

The turnover here is atrocious. In the 2 years I’ve been here almost every executive position has turnovered 2-3 times. 

The HR team is the CEO’s personal secret police. No negative feedback is allowed. Every few months when the company ratings drop a round of requests go out to add positive reviews. We’re on year 3 of this endless cycle. People leaving are threatened to stay quiet. Several execs don’t leave bother to list Toptal on their profile because they hated it here so much. 

I could go on but just look at all the detailed negative reviews and compare them with the generic positive ones. This isn’t a company you want to join."

- Remote work can be life-changing for many, especially to those outside of the US
- There are some areas in the company where you can learn from people who are the best in their field - for example, Growth Marketing and Enterprise Sales","- Please google ""Toptal The Information"" to read an article about the drama between the founders. It's a dramatic story that signals how toxic can be to work with the CEO. 
- If you want even more details, including testimonies of a former employee, please google ""jason calacanis toptal"" and you will see the famous investor Jason Calacanis going for over an hour about Toptal and its CEO. 
- The company has high employee churn, especially for a remote company. Some of the people that left were not great, of course. However, plenty of good leaders left too. I believe over 80% of the people who report to the CEO have joined in the last 12 months."

143,Toptal,"Great Company, Great Future",2020-07-06,5.0,Product Manager,"Over the past three years I've enjoyed working with almost everyone I've interacted with. The company is fast-paced and full of many bright minds. The company withstood the global pandemic without doing any layoffs or salary decreases, which I found impressive. It's also good to see the company evolve at such a rapid pace, while bringing on more and more impressive leaders.","Not so many cons.

145,Toptal,Great place to work overall,2020-04-29,5.0,Support Engineer,"I'm a Core team member, not a Talent in Toptal's network (freelancer).

If you want to work alongside very talented people, be challenged on a daily basis, help shape the future of work while enjoying a fully remote work environment with flexible working hours, this is the place to be. To top it all off, you're paid in US dollars which can be quite interesting if you're living in a place where the US currency is stronger than the local one.","No benefits for international employees, so be sure to keep that in mind when negotiating your salary"
146,Toptal,Toxic culture with a lot of fluctuation,2020-04-24,1.0,Software Engineer,"Hi, unfortunately I agree with all the low reviews here. Don't get fooled by the positive reviews, change the sorting to ""Sort: Most Recent"" and check the critical reviews as well.

- 100% remote work
- You work mostly with experienced developers (however, >98% white man)
- Some developers are very friendly and helpful
- Some teams have quite interesting projects/codebases
- Ambitious company goals","- Unfortunately, the management is very chaotic and unprofessional.
- Most of them have no soft skills (including CEO).
- As a developer, you have almost no contact to the management. They don't care at all how you're doing, if you need help or support, etc. They only watch how many tickets you finish. If you underperform and you are lucky, you will get a warning, otherwise they will lay you off.
- Even though I never met the CEO, I just heard weird stories and jokes about him. The employees don't really trust him and they have quite a toxic relationship.
- They don't treat you as a valuable employee, you are just a role which can (and will be) replaced as soon as they find another role with better qualifications (on the paper).
- Strong ""hiring and firing"" culture.
- No diversity at all (which results in quite a toxic and competitive culture).
- During my time at Toptal I have seen a lot of developers leaving (or got terminated). In my team of 8 developers half of them either changed teams or left the company (in just 6 months).
- No support to improve in your field, no support in career progression. You have to do it on your own, in your free time.
- There is also just low support in understanding the technical parts. They will tell you to read the code, which is fine if you have the time, but in general you are already under pressure finishing your tickets.
- No mentorship.
- There is a culture of blame and fear. If you make a mistake, people will shout at you.

These are just the important points, I encourage you to go through the other low reviews with more insights on how it is to work at Toptal."
147,Toptal,Would not recommend,2020-03-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Some groups are more shielded from the overall company and leadership issues. Also ability to work remote.,"Huge turnover problem. Every year about 40% of the execs leave. Most of that is because the CEO is difficult to work with and extremely unpopular (see articles about him hoarding equity if you want more details). Toptal likes to hype itself up as a company that's ""changing the future of work"" but in reality it's just a typical staffing agency acting as a middle man. There's nothing game changing here so don't be fooled into thinking this is some amazing tech company. If you join, expect to spend needlessly long hours on completely unimportant tasks. Also don't be tricked by the ""unlimited vacation"" policy. It's far from that. There's actually literally no official company holidays. You have to request days off even for New Years, Thanksgiving, and Christmas."

- mediocre pay
- no bonuses
- no options
- no professional development offered or funded
- no equipment budget: you supply your own computer, desk, and any other gear out of your own pocket
- no employee retreats, travel budget and so forth
- no anniversaries or birthdays observed
- no diversity & inclusion. The CEO is anti-diversity.
- no confidential feedback: the People team will share anything you tell them with whomever they feel should see it
- no fun!

Employee happiness is tracked using a pulse NPS survey which is not anonymous. If you answer with anything lower than a positive score, you have to then take a meeting with the People team where instead of hearing your concerns, they push back against all of them and take nothing into account.

Massive brain drain is happening now. Anyone smart is leaving for greener pastures and lots of other remote companies are offering much better benefits."

By that I mean, the leadership cares more about how the company is perceived than how it’s actually doing. For example, any negative feedback or PR results in discussion of how to discredit that feedback instead of understanding whether the feedback is true and how to get better. - Inexperienced managers and leaders that don’t know how to properly grow a company or develop people. - Overinflated sense of importance. Toptal is an interesting company with a above average business model. However, it tries to market itself as a revolutionary company that’s changing the world.  - Average talent. Take a look at the LinkedIn profiles of people at Toptal and compare it to those at elite companies.  - Unnecessarily long interview process with an unbelievably quick firing trigger. There are several rounds of interviews, many of which don’t add any value. But once at the company, people get let go without any warning for items that are fairly easily correctable. - Poor benefits. Toptal is 100% remote and makes employees buy their own tech, pay for their own internet and phone/data plan. Insurance is OK but has a high deductible. 401k plan is expensive and there’s no match. No annual bonuses."

- No mentorship
- No OKR process or individual progression

161,Toptal,A great place to work if you're looking for a career with a great work/life balance,2019-11-15,5.0,Client Experience Specialist,"Toptal provides a competitive salary whilst, at the same time, offering remote working which, in itself is a huge benefit. I live in a remote part of a foreign country with my wife and infant son. I was unable to physically go to work as someone needed to take care of our son when he was a newborn. I found a job at Toptal and began working for the company on a full-time basis. That was almost 3 years ago and I've been promoted from the job I first started on. I couldn't be happier with my job. I have been able to earn and be ever-present for my family at the same time which is a priceless feeling. Not only that, my job is interesting, challenging and gives me real job satisfaction. I can't recommend Toptal as a workplace highly enough.","I won't lie - transitioning to a remote workplace when you've only known office-based work is quite hard at the beginning. That said, we have chat rooms, lots of community events and the company works really hard to ensure that everyone feels included every single day.

This is a truly global company with more than half the company coming from outside the US.  Although it is global and a completely remote team, Toptal maintains a tight culture of engaged, driven people that want to do great things and fuel growth.

The fully distributed model allows people to work from anywhere, and it works because team members get their stuff done and we all hold each other accountable.  As long as you do your work and do the right thing, you have the freedom to also accomplish your personal goals and a work/life balance that is much harder to achieve with a typical in-office job.

It is incredible to be part of a hyper growth company that is changing the future of work.  In only a few years, remote work and the freelance economy will be even more prominent, and Toptal will be at the forefront of this movement.","If you are in need of social interaction 'outside of the office' or if you're not a self-motivated/self-starter, then the fully remote work environment might not be for you."

Culture - The culture is one of the outstanding parts of being a part of Toptal. As a 100% remote company it gives you the flexibility to work from anywhwere, but also, requires that you work hard and be held accountable. Toptal has an entire set of objectives dedicated to a world-class culture that is employee-focused and they understand that to move the company forward, it takes people who are valued and driven.",I have no negative input to share.
170,Toptal,Cool Company,2019-09-18,5.0,Backend Engineer,"One of the best points of Toptal is the work culture: flexible hours, good practices, always learning and so on.

In addition, you can be in your comfort zone in your team or you can change team for learning more cool things if you want, I love that idea to keep improving yourself as engineer.","One of the downsides of working on Toptal is that the beginning is a little bit hard if you aren't used to a big remote company because you have to learn how everything works, it means that you can feel lost but only in the beginning."

Remote work can be great if you are able to adjust to less regular interactions. Some groups are more shielded from the larger issues at the company.,"Geez where to even begin...the co-founders are currently suing each other, each one accusing the other of fraud and generally being terrible human beings. Turnover is extremely high. If you're a current employee look at the terminated people list on the company directory. You'll see just how many people leave within a year of starting here. For those considering joining Toptal listen to the recent This Week in Startups podcast on Toptal. If the issues mentioned there about the company don't bother you then everyday problems like micromanagement, boring tasks, and unnecessary long hours likely won't worry you either. Many of the recent positive reviews are from HR or managers looking to boost Toptal's rating and applications."

- The remote environment is flexible and offers a great work-life balance. As everyone is remote, you never feel left behind, and as we have people working from multiple places, you are basically never alone. You can work from anywhere – I've spent 4 months traveling abroad without issues.
- Managers are smart and transparent.
- You can move from one team to another, depending on your interests and personal goals.
- You have the freedom to come up with new stuff and move ideas forward. New initiatives always bring technical challenges and you feel energized to learn more.
- During off-sites, you get the opportunity to get to know great people and work from amazing places.

176,Toptal,This is the place to be!,2019-09-04,5.0,Product Designer,"I am so proud to call Toptal home. Here are my top 5 reasons why I love working at Toptal in no particular order.

1. Great work-life balance through remote work.  

2. Autonomy to be creative and entrepreneurial.  

3. I am working on product features that are both challenging and exciting, but most importantly, these product features can help improve the lives of its users.  

4. Leadership and management team are attentive and caring - they ensure that your voice is heard and provide plenty of opportunities to contribute to the overall success of the company.  

5. Great impactful opportunities. If you like to be continuously challenged, execute against goals, and have an impact, then this is the place to be","Traditional growing pains that companies have in growth mode. However, growing pains are useful and vital to the company's growth and success."
177,Toptal,Best environment for resourceful self-starters,2019-09-04,4.0,Director,"I have been able to build and accomplish more in my tenure at Toptal than I have in my entire career. I own initiatives end-to-end and I get to work side by side with the best and brightest from all over the world, learning more about different cultures and people along the way.

This company is the best environment for self starters who think like an entrepreneur and are resourceful. The work is challenging, but after 2+ years here I am continually impressed by the teamwork and collaboration. I have worked cross-functionally on many projects and even though it might not be a person's ""job"" to help me, everyone I have worked with is always so encouraging and helpful and have helped me get many initiatives over the finish line.  

Our CEO is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met. You won't find anyone more passionate than him on the topic of Toptal's mission. He will challenge you to be your best. Some people struggle with direct feedback but in my case it has made me stronger as a professional.","This environment isn't for everyone. It is very fast paced and you have to be able to handle working remotely/from home (some struggle with boundaries and end up working 24/7). Most people want remote jobs but don't understand how difficult it can be. I personally find it hard to take vacation because there is a lot to do and I never want to be a bottleneck. 


A lot of the reviews here are disgruntled employees who have never spoken up. It's just like having a bad experience at a restaurant and giving them a bad review without giving the manager direct feedback so they know they even made a mistake in the first place to improve on. I'm not admitting mistakes have been made here and maybe they have, but the leadership team can't fix problems they don't know about until they read about them online."
178,Toptal,Challenging but rewarding at the same time,2019-09-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been working for Toptal for quite a while now and I still love working here for the following reasons:

* Remote work without an office at all. You might have had a job where you could work some days of the week from home but this is not the same thing. Due to Toptals fully remote environment, many things are different than in most office-based environments, regardless if they offer remote work or not. For instance, since there is no preferred timezone this makes a great work-life balance a lot easier to achieve - at least for me.
* Smart people, all of them being self-starters. Every company says that but I do believe that Toptals is far above the average.
* Interesting domain. I strongly believe remote, high quality work is the future of work and it's exiting to be part of this movement.
* Quality first. The idea of allowing only the best people into its network bleeds over into Toptals team culture and standards and it makes it a lot more fun and challenging at the same time.","Remote work sounds nice for most people but in reality there are many people out there who are not made for this kind of work. 

Absolutely nothing wrong with it, everybody is different. The thing is that quite a few people start to work remote and after a while they realize that this is not a way of living that makes them happy. Some need personal, direct human interaction on a daily base (Toptal does support face to face meetings and regular team offsites but obviously this doesn't happen every day). Others need the 9 to 5 discipline a regular office demands since they have trouble getting going themselves.

Another thing I'd like to mention is that while I don't consider Toptal to be exceptionally chaotic or fast-paced in comparison to other companies, this might be different for you depending on your background. If you are coming from more traditional companies then it might be difficult for you to adapt to this fast-paced environment."
179,Toptal,Challenging opportunity to work with best people across the world,2019-09-04,5.0,Engineering Manager,"I have moved from Back-end engineer role to Team Lead to Engineering Manager, where I'm responsible for a set of teams.  We've gone through a lot of transformation while growing the business and company, so one thing for sure - it will never was and probably ever be boring at Toptal.

Working remotely not only gives flexibility, but also puts you into something similar of ""NBA for business"", where you get to work with world-class peers, reports and leadership. This is not an easy walk by any means, however if you're looking for personal growth and learning opportunities, you're at the right place.","Working together with people from many distinct cultures is interesting and fun, however it sets own challenges from time to time, where we might be looking at the same event from different perspectives."

181,Toptal,An evolving and exciting company,2019-09-01,5.0,Director,"In the last year, I have seen a lot of positive changes at Toptal. The culture has shifted tremendously and the leadership has strengthened. Change can be hard, especially for people who have been at the company for a long time -- but it's exciting to see the positive momentum and morale shift, which in turn is creating new opportunities for all of us.

Toptal is an organization of really smart people who are experts in their field. It's a pleasure to work with such professionals on a daily basis.","Remote work isn't for everyone. You must be a self-starter and driven to be able to succeed here and tackle all of the work ahead of us. The speed of communication is immediate, but also extremely impressive as decisions are made and work gets done fast."
182,Toptal,Challenging environment & interesting projects,2019-08-28,5.0,Senior Director of SEO,"It is a challenging environment with many exciting projects. Also, the salaries are good. Last, but not least, I do like the mission of the company, and both clients and freelancers are mostly happy with the quality of the service.","For those not used to work remotely, it might be challenging to enjoy the freedom of working from home without getting distracted."
183,Toptal,"Very toxic culture with fear, manipulation, and a lingering eau de bro",2019-08-18,2.0,Anonymous Manager,"Hey, it's a salaried remote job with lots of really smart, wonderful people. They've done a good job hiring and for the most part you'll like your coworkers. If you can put up with the problems, you can enjoy the location-flexible lifestyle, and meet a lot of wonderful people from all over the world.","The CEO is extremely toxic, micromanager who routinely berates people until they quit. For a long time, the entire company was run by white guys in their 20s-30s. They've fixed that with a lot of new hires in the VP suite, but there are still quite a few people around who got hired because they were frat brothers with so-and so, etc. It's a demented culture where most people are not treated with respect, and the people who do get respect have done it by playing games and kissing the ""ego"" of the  emotionally fragile cofounders  (who are now suing each other, to give you an idea of how stable they are).

In addition to all that, the pay and benefits aren't great and there aren't opportunities to succeed or advance. Current VP suite seems focused on hiring externally rather that promoting from within. If you do get hired, plan to make this a stepping stone to a better company."
184,Toptal,Want to give 0 stars,2019-08-16,1.0,Product,"- Remote work
- Many colleagues are smart, driven, and good people
- Base compensation and benefits are solid","- A horrendous culture that's built on fear by CEO
- CEO is unprofessional and publicly berates employees for perceived mistakes
- Any $ you make at Toptal will probably go towards the therapy you will need to tolerate working there"
185,Toptal,Great place to be,2019-08-13,5.0,Product Designer,Nice payment for Brazilian standards,Remote work sometimes feel lonely.
186,Toptal,Change can be hard sometimes!,2019-08-08,4.0,Director,"I have been reading all of the reviews lately and it is clearly the work of a few exited disgruntled employees. And it is a little too obvious as well.  Toptal is not for everyone and we have grown and scaled a lot over the past 4 years, but especially in the past 12 months. Change is hard, people are not used to being held accountable or confronted when work is not being done and deadlines missed. As we grow, it is time for some tenured employees to leave. That is the cost of doing business in a tech start-up. But if you want to be part of something disruptive, industry-changing and work with smart people from all over the world, join us. We are a direct culture and this is not for everyone, but we do like to challenge each other and uncover problems. If you want to work from home, your favorite vacation spot and work with like-minded people, we welcome you.","There is a lot to do and we work hard. Yes, our CEO can be direct and in your face but he wants to push everyone to do their best and make Toptal great."
187,Toptal,A break down..,2019-08-08,5.0,Recruiter,"During the interview process I worried this would be too good to be true. Well, it's the real deal. I'm grateful to be a part of a successful and growing company that's an industry-leader bringing inventive and disrupting ideas. It's dedicated towards constant self-improvement and has a thoughtful growth plan.

✔ PEOPLE: Being fully remote I was shocked at the relationships I quickly built and continue to develop across my team and the organization. Everyone is readily available and willing to help each other.
My team communicates very well and help each other out wherever it is needed.
*Toptal is FILLED with people that truly care about their work and come up with impressive, innovative ways to better the environment, our goals, our processes, and any other area they can envision.

✔ CEO: He's not yachting or making decisions from the golf course. He's on the ground, contributing daily. He's involved and cares about this place. He's very intelligent, passionate, and strategic. He is a very direct communicator, but without direct communication you'd be left with ambiguity and inefficiency.

✔ CULTURE: Quickly reinforced what I was told during the interview process. This is a culture of collaborative and driven individuals. We show up and work hard while  building relationships along the way. A very straightforward and blunt communication style which contributes to an open, ""carefrontation"", and efficient work environment. We have team outings so you get in-person with your team and occasional virtual happy-hours too!

✔ WORK: The job descriptions are purposefully created to lay out a lot of what pertains to a job, but what they don't tell you... because of all the innovative ideas and strategies you get to do a lot of interesting work. You're driven to think of things from new angles and contribute to conversation driving improvements in processes, strategy, and innovation. You'll be challenged here.

✔ FLEXIBILITY: I can work from where I want. Some days I need the quiet concentration of my home office and other days I enjoy sitting at a local cafe. I have coworkers that enjoy working on their patios and others that travel the world full time.
*The PTO? I thought my last employer was generous and lax about time off, but Toptal proved that wrong. When I recently took time off I mentioned that I'd check-in on slack and was told ""NO, enjoy your time off. It's YOURS."" The PTO is the real deal.","✘ Toptal isn't for everyone. If you just show up to work just for a paycheck you won't succeed or like it here. Toptal is for people that care about what they do, are driven for a greater purpose, and want to have impact.
✘ Remote work requires someone that is a self starter and passionate so they can stay on the ball. It also requires a strong ability to communicate proactively."
188,Toptal,Culture of Blame and Fear,2019-08-06,2.0,Department Head,"Totally remote workforce, so theoretically there's plenty of flexibilty","Working remote can make collaborating inefficient.
The CEO is abusive, rude and immature and has created a culture of blame and fear. 
The good, smart and self-respecting  people leave within a few months. 
No equity. Fake 'unlimited vacation' policy; No retirement program."

You really feel like your individual work is contributing to the mission. Leadership is down-to-earth, understanding and supportive. Toptal is a transparent environment where you are encouraged to bring up possible improvements. You are not chained to a desk. You see your co-workers being able to spend time with their kids, outdoor activities on the weekends and balance their lives","I am disappointed by the few negative reviews I see here. Toptal's culture is built for and by high performers. There is a misconception that a remote job means, ""easy"". If you love to roll up your sleeves and be part of building something that has never been built before, then this is a place for you. If you prefer the ""everything handled for you"" corporate environment, then this company would not be a fit."
192,Toptal,Loosing its appeal day by day,2019-07-22,3.0,Talent Ops Specialist,"• Interesting problems can be tackled, in case you get the resources to do so.
• Ability to work 100% remotely from almost anywhere in the world.
• Travel perks for some roles.
• Flexible schedule. 
• Solid compensation.","• CEO is well known to be disrespectful, verbally aggressive, and diminishing of the success of teams and people he does not personally like. 
• Critique is dismissed on all levels and it feels more like a military camp than a company of educated and experienced adults enjoying constructive discussion to come up with the best solutions. 
• A ridiculous level of micromanagement is strongly encouraged by the CEO/top brass and practiced throughout the company. 
• Needed resources to solve various issues and advance the teams productivity are extremely hard to get.
• Strong preference for robots/task executors, not people, creativity and meaningful contributions. 
• Uninspiring company-wide meetings running overtime for the sake of platitudes. 
• Massive lack of authentic leadership and lots of hypocrisy.  
• Lack of direction.
• Tons of politics."
193,Toptal,No one cares about talent,2019-07-08,1.0,Talent Operations,Remote work is the only benefit I can come up with at this point,"Lack of transparency 
Poor management 
Lack of systematic and meaningful decision making 
Nobody cares about people that work there or talent
The culture is not really implemented as it is propagated (they say one thing, do another in practice)"
194,Toptal,Great company,2019-07-05,4.0,Software Engineer,really great environment to work in,Nothing much to say about the company
195,Toptal,Rewarding and challenging workplace,2019-07-05,5.0,Growth,"Toptal is a place for you, if:

- You wanna be at the frontlines of a hypergrowth company that is accelerating its pace of growth and you wanna drive this growth forward
- You wanna work in an environment where merit is the most important thing for your career growth
- You enjoy being surrounded by smart individuals who think outside the box and are ready to share and challenge ideas
- You are self-disciplined and can thrive in a remote setting. There will be no one looking over your shoulder and you will enjoy the flexibility and freedom of the location.
- You care about social impact. Toptal is bridging the gap of talent shortage in world-class organizations and top talent across the globe. People based on merit can now join world class organizations wherever they are in the world which they wouldn’t be able to do so without Toptal.","Toptal is not a place for you if you are looking for a calm, cosy place to work without expecting to be challenged. You have to be ready to thrive in the merit-based culture."
196,Toptal,The good and the challenging,2019-07-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Toptal is a hyper-growth company, so there is plenty of opportunities for learning, promotions, and cross-team projects that have massive business impact 
- Compensation is highly competitive, specially for those who live outside of the SF or NYC bubbles
- Toptalers are great. You work with people from all over the world, and they are really smart 
- Working remote is life changing in a positive way, yet not for everyone. You need self-discipline and the ability to communicate without burning yourself out (some people get messaging anxiety) If you have that, you will never go back to an office job
- Toptal is doing a massive transformation and its culture so much better. 1.5 years ago I joined a different company. Full of dirty politics. However, some bad execs and their followers left and things are much better now. Moreover, I am happy that we got rid of that sense of entitlement from some young  and unexperienced employees who were ""friends"" with some execs. They used to get away with anything without consequences","- Ambitious growth comes with hard and smart work. If you like your cozy 9-4 job with nap pods, probably not the place for you. I have seen a few people fail dramatically because they expected to join Toptal and get ""trained"" for 6-12 months before driving any impact
- Toptal's CEO is a super intense guy. I would argue that is the classic hyper-growth CEO, but I have seen plenty of employee coming in wanting a charismatic corporate CEO who just makes sure things continue the same. Not the case here
- Benefits are limited. However,  for those terminated employees who write some dramatic statements about it, we actually get a high base salary to make sure we do have money for our equipment and a home office. Nevertheless, I hope the company soon restructures its equity and/or profit sharing plans 
- Building culture and strong teams is hard if you work remotely. You will need some emotional strength to overcome the lack of meaningful human interaction in the day to day 
- We have an unlimited PTO policy that was abused in the past. Thus, we had two buckets of people, some people were taking up to 50 days off/year, and some barely took only a week/year. Luckily, the execs who were pro ""never take time off"" are gone"
197,Toptal,Very disapointed,2019-06-10,1.0,Senior Net Developer,"Remote job,   You can work anywhere","sporadic projects so it's bad idea as single job.  the recruiters do not know what they do, they contact you for other profiles different from yours.

I'm also happy about toptal clients, they are very adequate.","Gaps between projects. You should be ready for 1-2-3 month gap between your projects, so you have to do savings if you want to work only on toptal. 

Pure legal support. The contract becomes worse and worse after every iteration, a legal team gives no support if you have issues with authorities.

261,Toptal,Disappointing at best,2017-07-19,2.0,Full Time Employee,"Work remotely, decent pay, pleasant colleagues","Team morale is low. At first glance, it appears to not be a situation of micromanaging, but it turns out, Toptal has just figured out a way to automate the micromanaging process. If you're an independent worker/thinker, you'll quickly see how their system will dictate your day without any one individual needing to say a word to you. You'll be at the mercy of their automated systems.

Also, the calls with the CEO are incredibly disappointing. What is meant to be an open door/open forum call, is really an opportunity for upper management to defend any and every thing that you may or may not have a problem with. This same attitude trickles down to middle management. Suggestions and constructive criticism are met with apprehension and suggestions for you to change your attitude rather than actually considered as something constructive for the company to look into.

Additionally, don't be fooled by the allure of remote work. There is little to no work/life balance in many departments. You're expected to be attached to your phone, tablet, computer almost at all times."
262,Toptal,One of the worst experiences of my professional life,2017-07-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Solid business model that has allowed them to grow fast until this point. The flexibility and the ability to work remotely is the only perk.,"The CEO has no regard for his employees. He swears at them and calls them names. It is completely de-motivating and humiliating. If you are not working directly with the CEO, I imagine it is possible to have a great experience at the company (hence some of the glowing reviews on this page). I would steer clear of joining the company leadership. Feedback is given harshly, which creates a culture of not sharing or seeking advice. There are not many women among the company leadership (not unusual for a tech company), but those that do exist are largely ignored and generally not respected for their expertise. The attrition rate is high because the red flags become quite obvious once you're on board."

In addition, peer code review, pair programming, and feature demo are common day-to-day activities at Toptal though 100% of the team are working remotely, it's made by leveraging communication tools such as Zoom, ScreenHero, etc. We always stay connected!

- Discretionary time off is another advantage when working at Toptal, as you can organize your time to be always productive and performant.",Working remotely with flexible time means that you need to manage yourself very well to get rid of feeling lonely and to always perform 100%.
287,Toptal,A true Top Company,2017-05-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"At Toptal you get to work with the very best, which for me is very stimulating as you get to tackle various opportunities and challenges (and there are many, which is what you would expect from such a fast growing business) with a group of really high-energy and talented individuals.  

The remote working is certainly a great benefit, but honestly, the exciting work/projects and the amazing people is what truly makes Toptal stand out as a Top Company to work for.","Remote working is not for everyone.

Another pro is that the company has the highest quality bar that I've pretty much ever seen.  They value the quality over pretty much everything.","Some recent hires were not so good, however they were fired very fast.  This causes some tension, though it would be great to ensure that Toptal only hires exceptional people without these issues."
292,Toptal,Buyer Beware,2017-04-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working remotely 

Somewhat flexible hours (except don’t believe them when they say you can set your own hours and that they care more about work produced vs hours worked, what they actually mean is that you can work during the hours that are most convenient for them and during the same time they are working.)","They like to be intentionally vague about details and facts until you’ve become an employee and then the truth comes out. Examples: If you ask a recruiter about benefits they’ll tell you about unlimited PTO and a 401k plan. However, once you start you’ll find out that the they don’t actually believe in unlimited PTO, instead they describe time off as discretionary which you should only need to use if you are burnt out (and, according to Toptal, that won’t happen in your first year). However, they will provide you numerous examples of how you can work during your vacation, and will emphasize how little time off you actually need to take.

Then you’ll find out that while, yes, they have a 401k plan they do not match any contributions. Instead of matching they have a profit sharing program. Don’t plan on getting any details about that either, they can’t tell you how they calculate profit sharing or any general guidelines about the program.

Finally, for anyone who has actually worked at a fast-paced company you’ll quickly realize that their definition of fast-paced is completely different than everybody else, processes are clunky and inefficient but it’s the “Toptal Way” so don’t question it. 

Bottom line: Do your research of Toptal vs other distributed companies. You’ll easily see the benefits offered and culture established at the other companies is head and shoulders above Toptal so set your standards low and you won’t be as disappointed. Get in, get experience working remotely, then move on."

""Remote work"" at a company that only has some of its employees working remotely or work at a company ""that is OK with remote work"" is a totally different thing. Here all the workflow is built around the fact that everybody is working remotely, it's not an afterthought.

The company is pretty big and I definitely didn't meet everyone yet, but so far everyone I worked with were great, helpful and interesting people from various countries/continents.

The company has not settled yet. It's still evolving rapidly on the technological side, so it's a nice technical challenge to be a part of. And of course - there is plenty of room to make an impact inside the company.

I've seen great feedback from both talents in the network and companies hiring them on how happy they are with the service received. It's always fun to see happy clients.","Working full time remotely from home might be isolating a bit. Even though teams do bond quite quickly, having some live meetups with other people is a must.

The benefits are fantastic as well, offering a 401K plan. I feel that Toptal is the type of place everyone dreams about working for. 10/10.",Nothing comes to mind.
301,Toptal,"Exciting, challenging and flexible work environment",2017-04-10,5.0,Junior Data Scientist,Exciting projects and challenges in which you feel that your work does matter. Flexibility to work from wherever you want.,An important caveat of the remote environment's flexibility is the fact that sometimes it is difficult to log off and wrap things up for the day. A lot of discipline is required in order to avoid burnout.
302,Toptal,Transparent company with great work-life balance,2017-04-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Expectations of performance are very clear, and everyone is there to help if you ask them. The opportunity of working with people from anywhere in the world – literally – is amazing, and working from home creates time to dedicate to other important aspects of life (family, studying, eating well...). Salary above average. Room and encouragement from management to improve your work. Strategies are designed based on data and previous experience, and decision making is simple and quick. Candidates that go through the screening process receive feedback constantly. Leadership trusts you are on top of your game, so no micromanagement!","To be a Toptaler you must have a great self-discipline; I believe some adapt, others don't since there's no one watching what you're doing. You might find yourself constantly checking your phone to make sure you aren't missing out on anything. Although salary is above average, there are no benefits."
303,Toptal,The best company that I have worked for,2017-04-03,5.0,Operations Specialist,"I've been working for Toptal for over a year, and I can tell that it has been a great year. Working with such incredible and talented people has been a huge experience.
Toptal makes possible for me to have the perfect balance between work and family, to travel while working, and Toptal also allows me to pursue my carreer without having to give up on my dreams.
Being part of such a fantastic team, formed by top-notch minds and by people focused on solving problems and helping each other, it makes working for Toptal a pleasure.
We have built a trustful environment where we can focus on our goals and we can always count on our team mates.
I really enjoy being a part of this company.",Working remotely is not for everyone.
304,Toptal,Amazing workplace,2017-04-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working with great talents from all over the globe, it is a truly awesome team. A completely distributed company with a great work environment. I have been here for over a year now and I am still amazed by the sense of community and the level of interactions we have across the entire company","Given the worldwide footprint, sometimes the working hours can be a little longer."
305,Toptal,I feel lucky to have found Toptal!,2017-03-24,5.0,,I work with really smart people that push me to do my best work on a daily basis. We are solving real problems and I feel like I am making a difference. I never thought I'd find a company that would allow me to grow in my career and travel the world. Being able to work wherever I want allows me to find inspiration. I've been able to meet up with Toptalers in different parts of the world throughout my travels. I am excited about what we are working on and can't wait to see where we go!,"I find this as a plus, but not everyone would. We encourage and give feedback quite a bit. Both positive and negative.  I find it helpful to always find ways to improve,  but if you don't have thick skin, you may not like that. Also, remote work isn't for everyone."
306,Toptal,A complete waste of time,2017-03-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None that I can think,Terribly long process for no projects
307,Toptal,Incredible Company with an Incredible culture,2017-03-23,5.0,Sales Engineer,"Work with unbelievably talented individuals with a very diverse background.
You get to work completely remote 100% of the time. 
A rapid growth company that is disrupting the market.",Nothing that I can think of.
308,Toptal,"Great Idea, Poor Culture",2017-03-22,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The ability to work from anywhere.

Most of the people at the company are really smart and fun to work with.

The work is interesting and challenging and everyone works really hard to accomplish their goals.

The compensation is fair and in line with the market.

The technology is top notch.","Unclear and often unprofessional or aggressive communication at the executive level.

High turnover

The culture as described does not always ring true in reality.

Transparent, 360-degree feedback is pushed hard as a pillar of the culture from your first day, yet many executives do not participate.

Working remotely is awesome, but you are expected to be available almost all the time as taking ""unplugged"" time off is not encouraged. This is more noticeable on the operations side, not as much on the technical side."
309,Toptal,Great Company!!,2017-03-21,5.0,Designer Screener,Simply great company with even better culture.,So far I don't have anything to add here.
310,Toptal,Best company I have ever worked for in over 20 years.,2017-03-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Having been in the workplace for over 20 years this is a company that values their employees, gives them the tools for success and truly has developed a unique culture of integrating work and life.  I have worked for Toptal over a year and have found that unlike any other company I have worked for they have excellent communication channels and truly embrace management/peer/subordinate feedback in both directions.  I have great benefits, compensation, and room for growth that is encouraged.  I have literally found my dream job and employer.",Toptal has high standards and expectations for their employees and they should not settle for anything less.  It affects the morale of a team when one member is allowed to perform at a sub-standard level for extended periods of time.
311,Toptal,Exemplary of professionalism and quality!,2017-02-26,5.0,Communications Specialist,"I have been working for Toptal for a few months now and I am beyond happy with my choice to join Toptal. For those who appreciate their time and want to retain freedom and flexibility, working for Toptal is the way to do so. I, in particular, am more motivated to dedicate 110% of myself to work when I have ability to run my errands in the middle of the day or just take a walk or hit the gym in between my interviews.","Toptal might be difficult for those who are not great in self-discipline and with regular office mindset, in terms that you get work done once supervised and limited by strict deadlines. In Toptal, supervision is minimal and you are responsible for organizing and executing daily tasks."
312,Toptal,"Vision, Mission, Culture, Values",2017-02-18,5.0,Director of Design,"If you're looking to make a global impact with a tight-knit distributed team, Toptal is the perfect place to do so. Visionary leadership, a flat organizational structure, explosive growth, and a results driven work ethic– these are just some of the qualities that stand out.","No cons from my perspective, but remote working is not for everyone. For example– near perfect punctuality is expected a half-dozen times a day (as opposed to showing up between 9am-11am once like you might expect in a physical office)."
313,Toptal,Best company ever!,2017-02-17,5.0,Technical Sourcer,"Working in Toptal changed my life completely. The company is amazing and very well organized. Having an amazing boss, flexible hours, working from wherever I want are just a few pros that I'd like to list here. Since I joined Toptal a year and nine months ago I've traveled more than ever, discovered so many things about myself I didn't know and expanded my knowledge in the field of recruiting.",After almost 2 years of experience here at Toptal I have no cons to list whatsoever.
314,Toptal,"Challenging, although fulfilling",2017-02-16,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. Freedom to be wherever you want,
2. Lots of flexibility in regard to working time,
3. No micromanagement, lots of space to make your own decisions,
4. I actually learned a lot while working at Toptal, not just on the tech side, but also about business and operations.","1. Feel overworked more often that I'd like. Partly this is due to timezone differences and early\late meetings.
2. Expectation and goals are not always clear."
315,Toptal,Strong team but weird management...,2017-02-13,4.0,Ruby On Rails Developer,really great and strong team. you can learn a lot,"weird management, really huge dev department and weak communications"

317,Toptal,Changing the way people think about work (& life!),2017-01-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- I get to work with kind, intelligent, and passionate co-workers. 
- The projects are abundant and fast-paced; never a dull moment.
- There is ample opportunity to make an impact as we continue to grow. 
- I really have an incredible manager: smart, thoughtful, gives meaningful feedback, and does so often. 
- My experience with all the leaders at Toptal has been similar- they are awesome at what they do, while also allowing their teams the freedom and autonomy to do what they do best. 
- Knowing you are on the cutting-edge of the market with an awesome disrupter.","-This job took some adjustment for me as this was my first experience working remotely with a fully distributed team. You definitely have to have a space and a mindset of a ""work zone"" to get things done and also make sure you are unplugging during the evenings and weekends. 
- You must have a level of comfort with ambiguity and an ability to make some decisions on your own. (Not a true con- but again, an adjustment and learning opportunity for me.)"
318,Toptal,Overall good experience,2017-01-04,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fully remote, unlimited paid vacation, great colleagues, equipment  paid by the company, three conferences per year","Too much ""democracy"" leads to people not being happy with some choices, my team had two team leads with completely different views on leadership."
319,Toptal,Toptal - Scaling Distributed Teams,2016-12-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"When location isn't a factor, bringing the very best people together in a virtual and collaborative work environment is not only possible, it's scalable. As someone who has been here for awhile, I have seen the positive effects of building an expert level, distributed company. Our proven growth, revenue and employee retention have far exceeded the traditional onsite business model...

Now, as someone still in the 'trenches' here at Toptal, I can say that this opportunity has been the most amazing experience of my life. When you work remotely, it really does come down to the people in the company. I have learned more, and grown more, than I ever could have in a static office environment. Toptal is a family. We care about each other and we meet up when possible during our travels (which is often). I have made many, very strong relationships here over the years, which will continue on through whatever lies ahead.","It's not really a 'con' but working remotely isn't for everyone. People who need a structured work environment with a set schedule to keep them on 'track' aren't going to be happy with a distributed model. Toptalers travel, and work, by their own schedule. As long as they are making required meetings, and being productive, they can schedule their own days off and vacations. There isn't anyone looking over your shoulder at Toptal. People here love what they do and the lifestyle of working remotely. We work hard, and we play hard, and we are changing the freelancer industry one empty cubicle at a time."
320,Toptal,The best freelance community,2016-12-27,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Working from home. A lot of smart people in the community. Internal Slack allows everyone to chat quickly and solve technical questions faster than using StackOverflow. Excellent Engineering blog.
I'm working remotely the second year via Toptal, and I never regret I joined this marketplace. I was lucky to get long term projects (C++, FrontEnd), so this is pretty much like permanent employment, except that you are working remotely.
Toptal is making more and more events that should help on missing socializing.
For two years - never had troubles with payments. For Eastern Europe - this is a brilliant opportunity to earn the same level of income as if you would work in the US.
If you end up working for the same client with other Toptalers - be sure they as great as you are and you will be happy working together.
You can adjust your rate as you go (asked for increase and my client accepted it instantly).
Community is growing.","Interviewing/onboarding was hard, which I could compare to the big IT companies by difficulty criteria.
Time zones... clients and colleagues are in all possible timezones.
Finding your best rate ($) is though: if you ask less - you earn less, otherwise you can wait for a matching project for long time."
321,Toptal,great to work from anywhere; pros stop shortly after that,2016-12-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,freedom to work from anywhere,"horrible communication between and among teams, putting out fires right and left, decisions made at the top aren't explained, very hard to forecast workload for the day or week which undercuts the benefits of working remotely and thinking you will therefore have more control over your schedule."
322,Toptal,"horrible, crazy leadership",2016-12-08,2.0,,work from home is pretty great,"i've never interacted with someone so off their rocker as the CEO. I was attracted to the business model, the remote environment and the pay was okay but the insane way this company is run I would think twice if I could go back."
323,Toptal,Amazing community and culture,2016-11-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Own time management and fully remote company.,Lack of an office space.
324,Toptal,Great Flexibility and Work Life Balance,2016-10-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fully remote work means you are entrusted to handle your work schedule as you see fit. Can work from home or while traveling, and are encouraged to make the most of this. Working with team members located all over the world is an awesome learning experience, and promotes a global perspective in everyday life. Team members are by necessity adept at communication. Decent pay.","Expectations can pile up and become unreasonable. Hours can become very long to keep up. It's important to be able to step away from your computer once in a while.

As the company grows, it seems it must give up some of the ""small company"" feel and culture."
325,Toptal,Communications Specialist,2016-10-17,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Things move fast. 
People in the team are willing to collaborate.
They are open to suggestions.","The initial job offer is not quite the same as the actual job, each recruiter will add or change information about the position. You will only get all the specific tasks related to the position once you have signed the contract. 
Payment is not the best for qualifications."
326,Toptal,Software Engineer,2016-10-13,3.0,,"* Access to many interesting projects with different technologies.
* Clear process to taken on projects (as a freelance/contractor, that is).
* Fast interview process
* Events with other developers in the network.","* Way too many front-end or full stack projects to choose from - even if there are many backend projects, the ones highly dominating the spectrum are the front-end ones. Bad if you are a backend guy.
* Can take so much time between project and project, depending on the client, the client & Toptal interaction (paperwork and similar), or the client can turn you down in the middle of the interview process.
* There's a slight tendency to advise developers to keep their salaries relative to their region. This is not enforced but I was told a few times to decrease my fees as they are 'too high for your city/country'."

Good support from management and awesome travel opportunities.  When I suggest an idea, I am often amazed how quickly it gets implemented - managers really listen.","Paid USD only - be great to be paid in local currency if possible.
The ""unlimited vacations"" policy recently changed - more guidance on vacations would be good - but this will likely happen, as more guidance is given.
Sometimes there is too much micro management - but overall, the management are great to work with."
329,Toptal,Keep away for now,2016-08-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Remote work, freedom to work from anywhere, some really smart and great people there.",It's  a revolving door.

- Very talented colleagues (from whom you can learn)
- Tons of community events
- Toptal helps you to grow as a professional (free Pluralsight account)
- Lots of opportunities (apart of jobs): Write in the blog, screen developers, organize events...
- Flexibility to work everywhere you like
- You decide the salary you want to earn
- You decide the vacations you want to have or the hours/week you want to work
- I started loving software development again (on every company, you learn something new)","Most jobs are remote so, if you like to work in a more social environment, you'll probably miss the office colleagues. But Toptal promotes and pays for organizing social events, co-working days... so it kind of compensates it.

Your hourly wage is in american dollars, so, if you are not from the USA, you need to pay a lot in currency conversion and bank fees (but that does not depend on Toptal). They could provide salary in other important currencies, such as EUR; this will be fantastic."
