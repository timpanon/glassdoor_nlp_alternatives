2,Tracxn,Needs a lot of improvement,2022-04-06,2.0,,"Salary on time and no variable component
Certain policies are good","The main problem with this company is that it is run by people who although are intelligent, enthusiastic and hardworking, they lack experience, maturity and patience required to run a company, manage people, assign right tasks, train, get the work done and finally measure the impact.

The culture of 'Yes Sir' also prevails despite most employees being young.

There is not much work and hence management makes employees work on unnecessary tasks. Nobody knows what is the expected outcome. Nobody knows whether the outcome makes sense and can be (or should be) implemented (again, the reason being lack of experience in the management).

AVPs are literally disposable. AVPs are hired, used as, when and where required and then fired to make way for new AVPs. The reporting structure of AVPs is also quite random and directionless.

They have been trying to work on employee engagement and satisfaction since last few years, but they are not hitting the nail, rather beating around the bush. Certain old employees have made this company their home. Their performance needs to be critically measured periodically.

Surprisingly, the young bright minds who work here, often use foul language while giving feedback to their subordinates. This is not expected from employees with IIT/IIM background."

1) Working hours - They will say 9- 7 is the job timing but usually it starts at 8:30 and end by 8:30 to 10 PM on most days. Lunch break is 1/2 hours and no other breaks will be allowed. Your calendar is strictly monitored.

2) Micromanagement - Highest level of micromanagement. They will even ask you what were you doing for these micro seconds. You will always feel like you are in a pressure cooker, waiting to burst. Don't loose your peace of mind for some extra salary.  

3) No Guidance - There is no set of defined roles and projects in Tracxn. They will give you a lot of exploratory projects even your bosses bosses boss will never know how to do it. But they will pressurise you to show progress each day to your manger and his manager (This can never be empty, if so soon you will be thrown out). 

4) Hire and Fire Policy - If you see constantly the AVP-BSO the so called leadership position will be open all year long. Because they constantly hire and fire people and will not think tiwce. And AVP BSO layer is the most vulnerable layer. And the worst part is their notice period - 1 month.

5) The Sector - The sector in itself is very different and niche. First of all do a lot of research about the sector. I personally never liked the sector. 

6) Fake Reviews - Dont go by this, they are asking their employees to give these reviews. Read the reviews you will find a lot of similarities.

7) Yes Sir Driven Culture - A highly ""Yes Sir"" driven culture. And Tracxn doesn't waste time so even discussion against your boss decision is considered a crime. Reason to be given for even the smallest decisions you make.


My Request to You All
Even if you don't have a job please don't join Tracxn and waste your career. That's my humble request. Search for a better organization with great culture."

1. Fixed working hours (8 to 5 or 9 to 6). No work post your 9 hrs of work, no work on weekends. 
2. Very well set processes. This is a big deal in smaller companies and I think no other company of similar size have solved processes so well
3. Quality work. Heavy emphasis on problem solving ability and less of inter team management (which is a good thing if you ask me). Based on your portfolio, you might even get to directly interact with customers (again only if your product demands so)
4. You will find some extremely talented and passionate folks. All AVPs in the product team are good to work with
5. Your work and contribution defines you. Completely merit driven org.
6. Good hikes, far better than many other companies. Your appraisal is on your work anniversary (no need to worry about the bell curve model)
7. Top level management takes feedback well and more importantly, they build on it","1. No direct interaction with tech team, which could be a major turn off for some
2. Only uses free tools. You would be disappointed if you're expecting fancy tools like Jira, Confluence, Slack, or some fancy wireframing or analytics tools. But quite honestly, they do the job, albeit a little slow and irritating when compared to Jira

- Favoritism is followed up badly in this company.
 - They do not have a good pool of leads and simply keep rotating leads within their old people. New people are only given outbound process, whereas their conversion with outbound is negligible... They only get deals from inbound leads. So my advice to the ones who are joining these time wasters that from the day one, ask for assigning inbound leads and don't fall prey to VP's saying that you will get leads very soon... Ask them for P1 category accounts assigned to you from whom inbounds are coming.

- Absolutely no pressure to work after office hours
- Company is improving its infrastructure gradually and its quite better than what it was about 2 years ago
- Opportunity to completely own a task from end to end
- Health insurance for self, spouse, and kids
- Good place for fresh out of college automation engineers and research executives (some of whom are in fact ex-gig workers eg Swiggy delivery guys)","- Micro management is a big issue in almost all the teams. This is driven straight from the top
- The work can get monotonous (broadly speaking) quite quickly. Department change can be a issue if you want to move around (specially during covid times)
- People policies are much to be desired. Not enough interaction with the top executives and whenever there is some, it leaves much to be desired
- There is a very limited client facing opportunities across all the departments
- There is a very defined way of 'thinking' about a problem, which is also driven straight from the top, (think in terms of only right or wrong) and many people find it difficult to adjust to it
- Very bad leave policy. Annual leaves get accumulated monthly on a pro-rata basis , which is about 1.2 per month. So, in case of any emergency, you might have to take few LOPs as all the 14 odd leaves are not credited at a time
- There is a bit of bias towards IIT and IIM grads (specially for AVP + roles)
- There is no distinct (in positive sense) culture. No focused intent has ever been put to create that. At best, the current culture can be defined as the culture of progressive improvement or culture of excellence"

173,Tracxn,Even worst than your locak kirana store!!,2020-11-18,1.0,Manager,Not much other than the salary is credited on time,"Here the word countless comes into effect but a few major ones are - 

1. Senior Management - One has to be a 'YES MAN' in order to succeed in Tracxn. The senior management feels that if they are paying you then you have to perform 100% day in and day out and take pride in finding faults in people. Humility is a word that is not known to the senior management. For them, the processes that they have made perfect because they are from IITs/IIMs. In short, the senior management likes to suck the blood of the team and this is where the culture of micro-management comes. Additionally, the senior management wants quantity and not quality. They are in such a hurry to implement processes that errors and bugs come mid way in the project. For them, everything should be done immediately.

2. Work Culture - To simplify it, THERE IS NO CULTURE. People are not allowed to speak with each other during work hours. The culture of 'team' is alien to Tracxn. Senior management frowns upon managers who are friendly to their reportees even after office hours. Work timings are strict 9-6:30 and yes the company does not promote working on weekends but so much blood is sucked in weekdays, there is no strength left in the employees to even invest in themselves, leave alone work. Furthermore, Tracxn has a pathetic leave policy and HR is only visible during onboarding or during exit.

3. Work and growth - For entry level freshers, one can only learn how to operate a computer and google sheets. One will start the day on google sheets and end it there as well. People with 1-2 years of experience are made managers. For managers, there is only 1 thing Tracxn expects them to do - REVIEW. No scope of learning something new there as well. For mid-senior level or the AVPs of the company, The senior management says that “You are CEO of your team” but one cannot implement anything without the approval of senior management. If you do, you will be shown the door. 

To conclude, there is a reason for why tracxn is always hiring and a reason for so many positive reviews in just recent weeks. Tracxn calls itself a corporation but operates like a local kirana store."

I get salary on time.,"Here we go, 3 months back i was hired as research analyst after tedious interviews like case study submission, hr interview and other verification processes. I joined this company after seeing all the bad reviews. Even then i took a risk. I got trained for a month which was quiet good but later after i realized i was not trained with complete process of work but after harsh meetings i learnt them all. Within my 2 and half months they were not satisfied with my work were i was trying to get better and i guess for me i was doing good and better than others. One fine beautiful evening i was called for a casual meeting with senior manager and he was talking respectfully. I thought i would get changed from team but i was wrong. You know what they did to me 'THEY FIRED ME' without any warning letter. But the documents looks like i have resigned the job. Even i was not emotionally stable i tackled to ask them questions why they did this to me. The answer was i didn't have any skill set. I asked you should have better known this before hiring me its a true betrayal. They replied in a cool manner we could not determine their skill set by interviews but could only be known after joining. I was not the only one prey for their betrayal. A lot got affected before and after me. I have mentioned as current employee because i was supposed to tell this. Now I'm jobless and depressed, haven't got any hope or faith to tell my family about this and pretending to be working in this company. I have the papers where their policy mentioned before firing an employee within a year there should be an official warning or intimation letter before a week which did not happen to me.

People who are in the higher level hierarchy will never accept their mistakes. If they commit a mistake its a ""Mistake"" but at the same time if you made a mistake its a ""Crime"". They have more numbers of AVPs & Managers then employees whose primary responsibilities are to find mistakes in their team members. Apart from salaries don't expect anything from Tracxn not even sweets in festivals. They have started a new culture, if you take LOPs on the Friday they will deduct salary for Saturday and Sunday as well. You will receive mails for smiling and talking with your colleague.

290,Tracxn,"TRACXN: Crush Life, Job Satisfaction, Moral Standards, Ethics, Career Progression in 1001 ways",2019-05-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I will honestly put points in Cons section and treat this as a very serious feedback for your career and life.
Note: all the 5 star review are fake. And recently Tracxn have started putting fake 1 star review. If i am not wrong Tracxn opened new account as the first one was completely bombed with reviews.","Case 1: You are expecting offer or thinking of interviewing in Tracxn. Have faith on yourself and put a bit more effort in finding a job. Else one fine day you will break down and leave Tracxn and put a blot in your CV/Career.

Case 2: You are still in Tracxn. Dont loose hope. Better now than late. Leave the job with or without offer.. Many of us did the same at all levels. You are not alone.

I will try to put only the important points so as to save your time as I can go on with small things:

WORK CULTURE/JAIL

NO SMILE ZONE: More than 2 or more employees cannot sit or stand near the office and half a small talk or laugh. Employees are expected to behave like slaves who should silently walk to the bench and start working without any smile/laugh/communication. Whether AVP or Executive, nobody smiles near office. Managers are reprimanded if their team members seem to be smiling. I am not making up. This is 100% True.

SLAVERY like the movie “MORDERN TIMES” : On paper it is 8.5 hours working hours out of 10 office hours. But your entire days' calendar will be set for 9.5 hours where each and every minute will be approved by VP/COO. Spending more than half an hour on breaks, loos, and lunch is despised and frowned. You will have to justify how you spent more than 30 minutes every week to your senior.

ZERO TRUST on employees: Whether you are from IIT or IIM or Ghanshyam college, even for changing spreadsheet cell color,width,font you will have to take approval from your senior. You will learn how not prioritize important things and waste discussions on non value adding things.

HIGHEST Employee CHURN/ATTRITION Rate: In three months,⅓ of Tracxn changes. In a year you will feel everybody near you is a new face and you will feel as if you are the least intelligent person to have been incapable to move out of this jail.

YES MEETINGS/BASH MEETINGS: Nobody laughs in the meeting. You will be shouted, humiliated just for explaining a point for 2 minutes instead of 1 min. The VP/COO thinks that his time is so valuable that he cannot waste extra 1 minute for listening difficult points. Forget about brainstorming. Be a robot. Just say Yes V. Soon you will be dreaming about the bashing you are going to get in the meetings and loosing control of your life. Your wife or girlfriend will soon get stranded and left.

NO RESPECT: Junior employee are treated as use and throw pens. They are paid like Rs 11.5K and are made to work twice the work done by average IT employees. For such a paltry amount, we are humiliated and scolded and threatened to perform like machines.

TIMINGS: Your in time is 9:00:01 instead of 9:00:00. You are done. Everyday your in times and out times are sent to all your seniors and CEO. Your appraisal ratings, salary hike, and daily meetings will be started with this “You are not putting efforts. You have been late by 1 minute at 4 instances in last 14 days.” OR “You did not complete 10 Hours at 2 instances in last 14 days”. And remember you are a top graduate from IIT or IIM. Feeling Lucky right???

ETHICAL ISSUES IN TRACXN:

TRAP APPRAISALS: So you think you are getting promotion. HAHA. You are in a trap. Your salary will not be hiked. According to some insane policies your salary will not be increased until next appraisal and appraisal happens after completing 1 year. And the TRICK is to give you promotion rigth after your last appraisal. ;)

FAKE ESOPs: They will lure you with ESOPs in job offers but what they dont tell you is that employees who are in the Tracxn or who have left Tracxn after Two years have not received ESOP papers till now. Ideally, according to policies they have to provide ESOP papers every year with the ESOP you garner for completing each year.

ONE SIDED NOTICE PERIOD: If you ask for early relieving, then they will ask you to buyout the number of days including holidays, weekends. But if you ask them that you want to complete notice period, they will give you early relieving papers saying you can leave early if you want to.

DUBIOUS LEAVES: The flexi leaves are too flexy. If 2 of the flexi holidays like HOLI and UGADI fall on weekdays, they will ask you to make a choice among them. But in case one of these fall on weekend, then they will make the one in weekend as the official holiday and remove flexi option from those two days which effectively cancels your holiday.

DESTROY 2 BIRDS with one stone : You are a AVP and you might slog for days and night and setup a department, then they will promote a junior employee and make him AVP. You will be thrown in a corner. Now the junior manager/employee is wondering how am I ever going to switch. My salary is 3 lakhs and I am AVP. Who will take me?

SALARY DEDUCTION: 
You might have spent weekends/slogged extra hours to get things done but when you have planned leave for EURO Tour/HoneyMoon/Marriage/Family Emergency they won't allow you to club even one sick leave with your earned leaves if you are falling short of earned leaves. 
They love deducting salary with the policy Leave without Pay. People have lost salary because of bad leave policies,technical failures, and miscommunications with HR because nobody can question HR. HR has ultimate authority to deduct salary anytime even if the fault is not of employees.

FUN FACTs:
INVESTMENT REJECTION: Some Investors did not invest in Tracxn due to failure to comply in due diligence report regarding unethical culture and bad behavour towards employees..

HIGHEST RATE of SALARY DEDUCTIONS: Almost every manager/AVP has got his salary deducted due to high number of anxiety/frustration holidays which could not be accommodated within earned or sick leaves.

LAST WORDS:
If you still want to join TRACXN and you dont believe me. Do yourself a favor. Please talk to some existing employees. 
AND Remember you have been WARNED. PEACE. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU."

Monotonous work. You learn nothing. There's no exit option either. As an analyst, you LL find it difficult to get a job outside (with this profile and experience). They will conduct interviews every month and they will offer you a job during every month. Bcoz so many employees are leaving every month.

Join this company only if you have no other option. Otherwise, stick to your existing company and wait for the right opportunity. Because Tracxn is not a company for human beings to work.

- They do care about employee nutrition, though. You will find instant source of protein near the coffee machines in the form of beloved cockroaches (not the VP layer ones) and ants.

- The entire ""VC Ecosytem Intelligence Platform"" is being run by data entry guys. Did they just advertise ""100 Sector Specialists"" to you. Wrong! They have 10 analysts and the rest data entry guys doing their menial work.
- Hiring and firing policies change with the time. Except, that this time changes everyday. They'll hire people just because they're the friends of the ""ideal VP"" and fire the the deserving people without logic. Oh and BTW, the friends of the VP are idiotic imbeciles.  
- The chairs break! Yes, people have been injured because their chairs gave away

One is expected ruthlessly following his calendar (set by his / her manager and approved by the CEO) throughout the day without compromising a minute. Each day's output has to be presented to the manager on the next day in a dedicated hour. Personally, I am afraid the place has more cons than pros.

1. The responsibilities of my role were immense. I was not even handling one-fourth of that in my previous org. It allowed me to get out of my comfort zone and prove to myself what I am worthy of.

2. Employees are extremely talented and their problem-solving approach is unparalleled.

The senior management considers employees as yet any resource like a data centre, capital or electricity.

The company's business has sound potential.","The Top-level management treats employees like machines or at best, humans with absolutely zero intellect.
No trust between any two (hierarchical) layers of employees. The system is designed in such a way that people should not work on trust.
Absolutely top-down management philosophy. Processes are just thrust upon the ground level teams and no feedback is taken from the imposed upon teams. Any differing opinion is met with the statement - ""this is not a democracy"".
Extreme tracking of employees to the point where it is almost demeaning. High point of this is a time-sheet that an employee needs to fill which tracks his/her activity in real time. Each item tracked is scrutinized by the VP of the firm himself who then asks clarifications on work effectiveness or people not working at their 'peak potential' for 10 hours.
Senior-most Managers walk the floor peering into people's laptop screens to judge what they are doing. By the way, reading news is also frowned upon for an analyst. 
Another worse behavior that could have possibly been exhibited by any company is putting fake reviews on Glassdoor. Read some of the 5-rated ones and you will know.
Lead level people are encouraged to 'tell on' other employees - which is then used in evaluating that employee during annual appraisals - disregarding any other commendable work accomplishments.
Compensation is not commensurate with the level of work being extorted. Once you join, there is a constant fear of getting fired for even slight misgivings.
People with over 7-8 years exp will be asked to justify decisions that are dictated by common sense."

2. No Cab or facilities for employees in other shifts. Unhygienic Canteens (Infested with Rats)

3. Work Culture - An extremely toxic work culture and a battleground for Ego's and clashes. There is no process or mechanisms to deal with an issue and it is completely ad-hoc.

386,Tracxn,Worst place to work but you will learn a lot,2017-06-02,1.0,Software Engineer,"I was working in the development team. The best thing is the tech stack i.e. reactJS, grails, Kafka, Kibana, ElasticSearch, Ansibles and lot more. The software engineers are very talented in their respective fields, very friendly and will help you whenever in need.  The learning curve is too broad in terms of technology.

Team Architecture:
First we have two top heads i.e. CEOs. Both are quite intelligent in their field but also very penny-pinching in terms of infrastructure development. 
Then comes the VPs (Managers). So every team has 1 VP, tons of  AVPs, and then comes the labours (engineers, analysts, and other people)

In development team, they have several groups according to the products/tech viz. Search team, Data team, Apps Team, Designers (product managers) etc. Will give more details in Cons section.

Everything is transparent ie. all sits at same floor, no cubicles, just tables. You can see all developments and emails (common).","Pointing out development team cons only:
Manager (VP): Manager must be a leader who helps his/her team to grow with the company. But here the manager is just a boss. He is more like a Smart CCTV Camera which records all your activities like your timings, or which website you opened, or why you take 30 mins to finish your lunch, or how can you ask for leave. If you discuss anything with your team regarding tech/non-tech or for the organisation or some random things, he will join you and give his unnecessary ideas which has no meaning.  
2. Timings: You have to reach office at 10:00 AM, and can leave only after 10 hours of working (for engineers its 9 hours), otherwise half day salary will get deducted. At the end of month, you have to ask your manager (here they call as VP) to approve your 'why you are late arguments'.  
3. Office Infrastructure: I don't have that much problems with the infrastructure, but there should be good chairs and a good internet connection. A good internet connection will increases the productivity and a good chair is because it is too embarrassing to fall from chair infront of the whole office.  Also, office is too crowded, so sometimes its difficult to think of some logics or codes. You cant put ear phones all the time. 
4. Project Managements: Every engineer is busy in building/improving products. But most of the projects got scrapped after successful development. This demoralize the developers as they really worked hard to design/develop the product. 
5. Politics: Every organisation has some politics, but I have seen too much politics in tracxn. VPs, AVPs are talking about all developers. They give pink slips to employees without any reason. For new employees, they don't give enough time to learn the new techs, hence fired them after few days. The put too much pressure on the developers, hence sometimes they get too much frustrated.

If there is a good senior management which understands the employee growth, then tracxn would be the best company to work for, but unfortunately it is not."

Sorry there is nothing else I can think about","- Micro Management 
- No work for 10 hrs
- if you have research experience, then this is not the right place for you
- all you do is keep adding companies to the platform which can be done even by a diploma student
- Just because an employee is tre with the firm for a year, he will be the guy who u report too. This employee will micro-manage you like you are a school kid. Will peek into ur laptop. Look at what ur doing etc etc 
- Management is on a hiring spree. But they do not hire people relevant to the market research industry. Hence most of them dont have any idea about the work but since they are paid heavily, they keep silent.
- The process flow is very bad. for every e-mail ( even if it is one liner) you have to get is QCied. The most bugging part is that, people who dont know the technology QC ur work and the only thing they correct is ur grammar, the alignment and whether ur have kept an extra full stop or missed one.  
- Everyday u get around 60 unwanted emails and every small thing should also be conveyed in the email thread. Hence each email thread consists of 20-25 emails which is irrelevant and not required to you. 
- The company has got heavy investment and is burning cash left, right, center. But it is a sinking ship.  With this single platform, they cannot survive for longer. 

The cons list just keeps going on and on"
389,Tracxn,Good platform to poach candidates | Platform for tech-lovers | Think before you accept,2017-05-20,2.0,,"I have worked for more than a year in Tracxn,

There are a plethora of shortcomings if you are at Tracxn but at the end of the day you get a list of learnings which you'd never get anywhere in the world.

- Key to identify new ways of get things done when there is no support. For example, if you're in sales- no marketing, no inside sales, no product/tech support and literally a handful of inbounds. ""Go figure"" is the motto,  now if you closed a deal (a tech-giant) inspite of this, aren't you a rock-star?

- Process.Process.Process when you are a year-old, you'd have different modules for a single problem, result of several projects you handled/developed. And when you are out & people say how to do it, voila! a repository of models.

- Threshold skyrockets, you'd become more patient & resilient, that it'd be so easy to see a solution through an ocean of randomness.

At last one of the key things Tracxn has cracked is to hire really interesting folks who are driven & brainy especially the hires from 2015 to end of 2016, so i'd say Tracxn is a ready resource for any HR out there coz almost everyone is looking out.","In a nutshell have this when you apply/get an offer this is just a platform/a job between jobs/a chance to grab hold of startup universe but not a place you can grow, that should be the mindset.

That was my mindset, so cons infrastructure wise &  management wise didn't bother me, except the toilets."

Let me tell you, the person leading the tech team doesn't know how to code. If you have any doubts, you can see the commits in the git.

Nope. The reviews are accurate to the T.
- company culture is toxic. Their attendance policy is the highlight of this - anything less than 10 hours is deemed unproductive. Even if you're a productive and efficient person, time you spend looking at your screen dictates how much you're worth.
- people love making processes and spreadsheets for no good reason. They are excellent at looking busy without doing anything of consequence. And the management is pretty happy.
- every office interaction will involve bonding over how terrible the place is. Literally every single person cribs. Except, of course, the higher management - their salaries make it worth it.
- you will be told not to think - trust the ""system"". Yes, trust this awfully dysfunctional system.
- the internet averages less than 1mbps - also why you need to clock in 10 hours (at least 3 of those are spent waiting for your spreadsheets to load)
- a chair breaks at least once a week - and no, their insurance doesn't cover this type of work-related injury. Sigh.
- absolutely no feedback on anything that you do. Good or bad. Nothing. = zero learning opportunity.

-Near death penalties for reaching late, in-time is usually 9:30 am (folks living away from office are DEAD)
-Poor office infra (tables, chairs, you name it), retrograde laptops, horrible food hygiene and the lavatories (even the ones for ladies) can compete with those in trains running across UP 
-There is just work (bad, of course). No culture. Music sites are blocked to ensure that employees are deprived of any relaxation. Office internet is not available on cell phones (guess they still live in a JIO'less India)
-Strict protocols about tea/smoke breaks.
-Clearly defined hierarchies across all functions. Efficient processes for communicating within and across teams. Very strict, excruciatingly disciplined, prison-like suffocating atmosphere.

5) Hectic working hours with no flexibility: Punch in and out in a biometric machine to show how much hours you are spending in office, a minute less and your salary can be deducted. Work from home? Not an option. Have some emergency and need to leave early? Not an option. You can't leave even if you have finished your work, till you do your minimum working hours (9).


Overall the company has too many negative vibes. Attrition rate is quite high as employees are unhappy. But the management doesn't care. Everyone is replaceable. Work is anyway not challenging. Most of the good people realize this early enough and leave in much less than a year.
The recruitment people will paint you a picture too good to be true. But do not be blinded by their false claims and promises. Take the job only if you really need one right now and don't have any other options."
408,Tracxn,Perfect place to hone your tolerance levels!,2016-11-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Quintessential start-up culture. Teams are good and you're in the midst of IIT-IIM grads. Peer to peer learning is immense and it's a small community. So you pretty much know the in and out of the whole company. Transparent email communication and founders work alongside you.,"With the company growing in size, employee engagement has gone for a toss. There are three teams that are critical in Tracxn's scheme of things - Product, Analyst and Sales team. Product team is well looked after. After all, Tracxn's research platform is competing globally and if the product is not good, then who's going to use it? Analyst Team is treated like a ""data entry team"" that's supposed to complete manual profiling of startups daily as per a given target. Even if that entails using your personal dongle or mobile hotspot when the internet is not working properly, which of late had become a norm. If the analyst takes a break, that time is monitored and then later you're reprimanded for wasting ""company's"" time. Sales team is an unsung hero, working without motivation or sales incentives. They keep closing marquee names and yet are neither appreciated nor acknowledged. Every movement of yours is monitored. Going out for a smoke or tea is considered cardinal sin. Neither the founders nor the VPs care much. VPs are stooges and an epitome of absurdity and hardly evoke respect. Attrition is a norm. No surprise!

Birthdays are not celebrated. Going on long leaves automatically makes you a disloyal employee. In the time, I worked, the company never celebrated any festival. No theme based programs were done to engage employees. Your dedication to work is a measure of your in and out swipe times. If you're not in time for office, not working for more than 10 hours, you're tagged as a liability. Either fired thereafter or if you resign, it would just be another day for the management, doesn't matter even if you super performed. 

As long as you're in office, each movement of yours is closely monitored. Productivity is a function of how many startups you profiled or how many Demos you have in a day, rather than the end result. If you work the way founders expect, doesn't matter if you don't do well eventually, you will be handsomely rewarded. Otherwise, your presence and contribution is overlooked. For most employees, Tracxn is a gloomy place to work in! Tracxn doesn't believe in retaining 'rebellious' talent. It believes in harboring 'mediocre' loyalty. Go work for Tracxn if you're capable of pleasing the management. Otherwise, if you can't resist questioning archaic practices and rules, then join Tracxn at your own peril. This is the place where if needed, proven performers are let go without regret. Just because, they dared to be different. 

Facilities? Forget about it. Internet is not reliable. Affects the analyst and the sales team in equal measure. Chairs hardly ergonomic and broken. Overcrowded pantry and unhygienic food. Mosquitoes and Rats - occasional visitors. AC - Analysts literally sit on hot seats as ACs don't work."

410,Tracxn,Join Tracxn at your own peril,2016-11-06,1.0,,"Tracxn is a company that gives you a unique opportunity to showcase your data entry skills. You will also be given an opportunity to improve your typing skills. Best part of the job is you get to work 10 hrs on just typing random sentences into a portal. 

Tracxn is an equal opportunity employer. No matter what your skill set is, you only do data entry even if you are an MBA from ISB or an analyst from BITS. This shows that the company also does not discriminate between graduates and post graduates. The team is also highly bureaucratic. 

Tracxn is sees what its employees think about Tracxn. Infact, let me tell you a secret. Tracxn claimed its profile on glassdoor and even posted jobs on Glassdoor. But the reviews are too bad.(I am not making this up, their rating is hardly 2. Check for yourself. Numbers don’t lie). They tried to turn this around by writing a couple of 4 star positive reviews. It didn’t work. Embarrassed by too many people asking about negative reviews in job interviews and declining offers, Tracxn had to unclaim the profile.","Join this company at your own risk. Here are some reasons to reject the job offer.
Exit opportunities : Limited exit opportunities. Lets be fair to future employers. What skill have you developed at  Tracxn) to look for new opportunities . None. Who’ll hire a data entry guy? Nobody. Tracxn boasts that its employees go on to create startups. They do this to get out of Tracxn. 

Business model analysis: Sorry, you don’t do this. 

VC Exposure: No matter what they pitch you at the job interview, You will not have an interaction with VCs. Even if you have, you’ll correspond over an email. The VC will not even remember your name. 
If you think that VCs will hire you once you get into Tracxn. Think again. VCs hire people who have some financial modelling fundamentals. Tracxn will not expose you to those. It is a data entry role where you’ll learn nothing. Nobpody from tracxn joined a reputed or atleast a tier III VC. 

Timings: Official timings 10 to 8. 10+ gruelling hours.  You have to be at your desk at 10 on the dot. No wiggle room whatsoever, even you are met an accident. (I am not exaggerating)

Tracxn is a bureaucratic company.  They say that this is not a regular 9-5 job. No, it is isn’t. It is a 10 to 8 job. 

The outlook for Tracxn is also poor. As government almost shut down one of its departments. Tracxn Syndicate. They are not running Tracxn Syndicate anymore. 

Office Infrastructure: poor office infrastructure. They turn off ACs. No proper internet. They even expect you to work with your data connection when there's no internet. broken chairs. An employee spends almost 11 hrs on those broken chairs, which really hurts their backs. Sub par canteen. One thing that they measure correctly is in-time.  

after travelling an hour to office and spending 11 hours there and another hour traveling. you will not have time to yourself. And that is exactly the reason why people are leaving.  

its a dictatorship culture with no room for democracy. You'll feel that you are in North korea. As whatever the top management says the employees have to follow. The top management is not even willing to listen. 

Tracxn is so desperate to hire that you can see Trcxn post jobs almost everyday. This means only two things either they are expanding rapidly or the attrition rate is too high. If they are expanding rapidly at the rate  that they are posting jobs on job portals, they should be making waves in startup industry. But they are not. So, we can conclusively assume that the attrition is too high. Which makes sense given their work environment."
411,Tracxn,One of the worst company to work for !! only join if you don't any job currently,2016-10-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good Salary for Data entry work. 70% - 80 % work in finding data and enter those data into the database. This work is applicable for all analyst , sr analyst and lead analyst also.","Working in Tracxn can be really frustrating and depressing. Average employee stays for 3 months to 6 months in this company. Attrition rate is very high. They will micro manage everything on hourly basis, even you are not supposed to take more breaks. All higher management has very less experience (less than 5 years) in corporate and some of them has never worked in MNCs. They don't respect employees and behavior of them is demeaning and  insulting.  Poor infrastructure with broken chairs, poor internet connectivity, air conditioning not working and absolutely no employee care. No basic employee benefits - health care and even be ready for Loss of Pay if you go for even more sick leaves.
No career advance opportunities, no training, and no skill development opportunities. Even knowledge sharing session within teams are discouraged as they feel analysts are wasting their time.
No work life balance. You may have to work on weekends for assignment and over the top management will feel you are inefficient to do your work on time. No emphasis on quality of work. Typical Indian mentality - just provide report with lot of slides with hardly any insights.
You should only join this company if currently don't have a job and you think if you can convert any job in next 2 months."
412,Tracxn,"They call themselves as ""Gartner for Startups"". LOL!!!",2016-10-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You can join this company for one of the following reasons:
1. You need a job badly.
2. You were sold the idea that you will be joining the next ""Gartner for startup"", to be true by your own over ambition.","1. Wastage of talent - Data entry job.
2. No focus on identifying the problems faced by employees
3. People with no experience sitting at top and trying to manage, resulting in chaos
4. Too much micro-management
5. Bad work life balance - Expected working hours are 10am - 8pm. Expected to work on weekends and on night as well.
6. Worst Infrastructure - internet won't work, broken chairs, AC won't work, no meeting rooms. Interviews could be held at the desk of someone who is absent on that day (you get it right, the fish market feeling, specially because of ANZY career guys sitting next to you, making calls).
8. No PF, no medical insurance.
9. Not really an ideal place for a fresher or an experience guy or a girl.

416,Tracxn,data entry,2016-09-28,2.0,Analyst,great team and young work force. Tracxn growing fast so presents reasonable learning opportunity. Compensation at Tracxn is usually attractive.,unreasonable work load - Tracxn often expects 20 hours of work to be done in 10. This can be very stressful as Tracxn always expects more. Majority f the work here is data entry and other soul sapping work. Impossible to work here beyond an year.
417,Tracxn,Worst Place to work,2016-09-25,1.0,Anonymous,You learn patience after working here. Lot of patience,"Work is never allotted to you looking at your qualification, experience or profile. You will be asked to do any random work.
The directors think that the employees of the company are machines owned by them and they can use them in the manner they want and therefore ask them for any work (including their personal works, for example ordering food for them, booking cab for them etc) and then shamelessly they point out the mistakes in those works and judge their performances. 
Zero in employee engagement activities
Extremely bad cultured directors
Hell lot of politics.. especially in the HR team
ETC ETC ETC"
418,Tracxn,"Great team and good quality work, but clarify expectations before joining as company operates in hardcore startup mode.",2016-08-31,4.0,Software Engineer,"- High caliber colleagues, good peer learning.
- Responsibilities awarded in accordance with merit, not experience years/degree. Great place if you are looking forward to own up things and prove your mettle instead of coding away specs. People complaining about fixing builds at 3 AM, please introspect if you really want to work for a startup.
- Good coding practices and technologies.
- Good problems to work on. The technology architecture can be said to be in a nascent stage and provides ample opportunities to learn.
- Accommodating and flexible team management for personal work (I can vouch for technology team).
- Fast paced culture, great for people who are comfortable with rapid execution (well planned though) and hate long sign off procedures before working on any  module.","- Subpar office infrastructure. But I guess my work matters more than fancy chairs. (Seriously, the chairs are not broken, not fancy, but not broken)
- Little long working hours than other startups (10.30 - 8:00). This is a serious concern for many and IMO must be considered/discussed before joining.
- Slow internet but they are working on it. Again, internet not good enough to load media websites, but fast enough to comfortably work with my servers."

Now it's only filled with poor managers and their unskilled college friends. They will give you roles above your qualification to make you stay in the company. They are so unprofessional that they have tied up with Anzy Careers who will call you once in a month to check if you are exploring new opportunities. 
You will get to know the unskilled senior people here when they will be interviewing you.

420,Tracxn,Join this company if you want to waste your life,2016-08-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I was with Tracxn for considerable amount of time and I still have friends there. But I want to give you the truest account. Tracxn is not in VC industry. Its a KPO for the VC industry. You actually thought that you could make it into the VC industry (which actually is dominated by the Stanfords, Whartons ). You were impressed by the too good to be true job description and when you got the offer you're actually elated. Let me tell you, you signed up for a data entry job.  Here at Tracxn, we analyse a company from the public information(duh!). Although we do not have any access to the company financials we try to see who acquires whom.  
With inside information let me now give you some facts. The analysts here are not at all experts of any field. There are people in the market who track an industry for years and years to come up with meaningful trends. Here we do it in hours. The reports that we create are just farce, we copy paste some other report. Or we make up our own information. 
We used to have town hall meetings over the past 5 quarters but it has not happened this quarter. Why? Reason: We are not doing well. The BD team is cut by 50% and the Analyst team is seeing attrition at a rate that the management sees will bring the morale of the whole company down. There's nothing for employee engagement, you don't feel like coming to work everyday. The company wants you to work hard for the management (read as founder) to make money for them. The VP expects you to work even though there's no internet connection. ""Use your 3G/4G connection to work when there's no internet connection"" (A sentence from the company's rule book.). First they don't provide internet connection and on top of it these guys expect to use your own personal connection to do the job. Comm'on. So much jugaad to make money.","Nothing,  If you love data entry. Search for ""tracxn reviews"" in quora. You'll find a review with a snap shot that explains your job. The job description (in iimjobs) uses polished description of your job but you just do data entry. The firing is also high. The management fires and also gives bad feedback to your prospective employer. Don't get me started on work life balance. 10 to 8 strict timings. I actually want to give negative stars but glassdoor does not allow it. There's no learning and exit options."
421,Tracxn,A crappy job,2016-08-08,1.0,Senior Analyst,"Imprisoned with shackles on both your legs, you cant have pros in these situations. You learn the skill of butt licking and climb up the ladder, its even easier if you are a girl","There are so many. Management is making their employees sit and fill in positive reviews on glassdoor and make employees 'like' the good answers about Tracxn on Quora. 

Running out of cash (monthly cash burn of Rs30 lac) and not being able to raise another round of funding is a serious concern of employees soon to get laid off."
422,Tracxn,Messed up my career a bit too much,2016-07-28,1.0,Analyst,"If you are looking at Tracxn, you probably are interest in startups and want to startup someday, let me clear this out for you, Tracxn will NOT help you with it, only waste your 6-8 months whatever you spend here. Sure you will get to know about various things happening around the world in the tech world, which in any case you will be able to find on the internet. All the reports being made here are made by data already present on the internet. TRACXN is a DATA AGGREGATING company for the startup ecosystem, nothing more.

Coming to my experience here:
1. If you don't like open and healthy interaction with the founders or VPs, then this company is good for you; because apart from your lead, you wont be talking to anyone else unless it is work related or you're being reprimanded (for not working 10 hours a day or being 30 mins late at showing up in the morning on a regular day).
2. If you're found chatting with a peer (online or offline), the founder of the company would NOT shy away from coming up and asking you if you have published enough companies for the day. (That is for Analysts, who are expected to manually enter 15 companies in the database everyday)
3. Analysts job is pretty easy. No valuable inferences are required or expected out of your work. Performance metrics are really skewed and you can get away with just appearing too busy.
4. Values of the company include: Be selfish, get what you want, and leave. That seems to be the idealogy that the founder (AG) is following. He built a company, married the co-founder, now has a high stake in the company. We will most likely see Tracxn having a successful exit in the coming year.","1. Micro-management at every level.

2. Founders really don't care if you want to stay or leave the company. There are many who can replace you tomorrow, so if an employee wants to leave, noone really is bothered. And thats how 20-30 people are leaving every month.

3. Although Analysts are underpaid according to industry standards, overpaid acc to the kind of work they are supposed to do, there is a common dissatisfaction amongst the employees and almost everyone is looking for and talks about other options everyday. Some secretly, some openly, but we shared a mutual disdain for the VPs and the founders.

4. The company's image in the startup ecosystem is good because they are postioned as such with the database, and the seed fund money they have, but it is weak inside."
423,Tracxn,Not the place for an enthusiastic software developer.,2016-07-26,1.0,Software Engineer,"Tracxn sets the best example of how the tech team of a 3 year old startup should not be functioning. Please join to experience the worst coding, managing and general workplace practises in the software industry. 
Easy interviews, so it should not be difficult for people to get in.","Their bar for interviews is very low so that more people join and obviously they end up hiring sub-par people who get fired. They fire people without a notice period and without any kind of compensation. The HRs are also very unethical.
    Freshers are expected to pick up new frameworks in a couple of days without any kind of mentorship and push things to production within very very strict timelines, which is of course very naive on the part of the VP and which also leads to people writing bad buggy code (fixing all the pending bugs is the major part of developer's job at Tracxn) and doesn't add to any kind of learning.
    You will be expected to spend at least 10 hours in office (10:30am to 8:30pm) and all your actions will be closely studied during that time. Starts feeling claustrophobic pretty soon. They will say that saturdays are off but you will still be expected to come to office for some time and work, otherwise you are not in the management's good books. 
     The office space is really cramped up and you have your laptop's width of space to squeeze in and sit, elbow to elbow with your co-workers .... and keep sitting there for 10 hours ... everyday, until the day you get some sense and decide to quit or they fire you. 
    There is absolutely zero learning here except for one, that you will find any kind of job after here truly satisfying and amazing. If you are one of those developers who want to learn about what startup culture is, please do not even think of experimenting here, it will lead to you getting really depressed and might even make you contemplate another line of career options."

Myth 2: I will get to meet VCs/PEs/Investment Bankers
Reality: No you won't. You ""may"" communicate with them while you provide them with some help related to work. The food delivery guy isn't exactly your ""contact"" is he? No offense to those awesome people though.
