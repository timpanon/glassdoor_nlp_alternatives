29,TravelClick,My Worst Experience,2019-09-14,1.0,Business Analyst,"I have very little positive things to offer about this company. I was there over a year and was berated and harassed in front of my peers after my third week of employment. I eventually went to HR only to be out in probation since the person who was harassing me said I could perform my duties.  There were witnesses who came forth to confirm my experience but I was the one being punished. After 30 days of me proving my abilities I was take off probation. The manager was removed from my department and relocated to a different state. She did not leave our office for another 3 months. There was no admission of guilt, and no apology.","After several months of working I was asked to be a mentor for new employees. My supervisors manager suggested this after seeing how well I was training our new employees. At this time my sister had already been battling cancer for almost two years. The week they offered me the new role was the week we found out she will probably have to go to hospice. My sister was only 49 years of age at this time. This news was hard to deal with seeing as we lived together and were best friends. Needless to say I took this very hard. I messed up on two cases, nothing that cost the company money, but they put me on probabtiom again. They were aware of my sisters condition. They told me I had to separate work and home. Which this is a lot easier said then done when dealing with a dying family member.  For the sake of my job and me being the only income I did. I performed my job the way I was before. I got praised from the upper management for doing a great job in this troubling time. The last week I was on probation she came they brought me in the office and fired me. I made no mistakes.. I did what was asked of me. They did not care.. with no emotion they just fired me. At this point my sister was in ICU. She passed away two weeks after I was fired on the same day they were telling us we were getting a raise. I wouldn’t recommend their services or open positions to anyone I know or happens to meet. This was the worst experience I have dealt with in my professional career."

Flexible hours, depending on your relationship with your manager.","Everything else. 
Employee turnover is huge as people аre unhappy with the overall conditions. 
Few people stay and they get to higher positions only due to their time serving the company, but not actual competence.
Product management team overworked, exhausted and almost burnt out. 
Project planning is nonexistent, motto is just react, not be pro-acting! This leads to times with working almost 24/7 at some times and then long idle times in-between, which affects many teams. 
Clients complaints not taken seriously.   
Amadeus benefits for people in Barcelona are not transparent and not the same as the ones for employees in Madrid - and everyone knows it.
In one of the Barcelona buildings people have no drinking water, which is ridiculous. 
Each coffee from the office coffee machine costs 30 cents.

There is no replacement hire, if someone resigns, their jobs falls into your hands, you end up doing 2 - 3 people’s job.

The management blocks you from scheduling anything with the HR."
37,TravelClick,Toxic Culture,2019-06-22,1.0,Manager,"Not many Pros at TravelClick, though I did forge relationships that will last for a long time.","SLT is in over their heads and doesn’t know how to run the company. This starts with the CEO and his fear mongering tactics, that is the example for his direct reports. Ultimately the company is a place of fear from above, rampant lying, finger pointing and politics at every turn. 

The most egregious aspect of TraveClick is the non-existent Human Resources organization. From the top of that org the mantra of “nothing we can do for you” is spread. In the end the toxic culture and daily threats from management are allowed to continue with no regard for the volume of complaints that have been made. 

I have never been so happy to leave a company."

-Expectations here are EXTREMELY high. Don't expect to have a lovely grace period for when you first start, and also don't expect to be trained extensively. They'll throw some training videos at your during the first week which are painfully boring and teach almost nothing, and you're then expected to know about the entire product line (which is extensive).

57,TravelClick,The company is run like a high school social club,2018-12-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you are reminiscent of the social aspects of your high school years, Travelclick could be a great place to work.

For example, you'll have a never ending supply of..

- Ice cream socials
- Yearbook photo opportunities
- After hours bar crawls

The salary is just ok, it's under industry standards but the bonus package is pretty good.  The benefits package is mediocre at best, and costs nearly two times what you would expect when compared to other companies in the area.","There are so many, where to begin?

- HR at Travelclick is especially bad, they only seem to care to socialize with each other.  Expect to fight with them about everything because they've either done it wrong or you're just not important enough for them to lift a finger on your behalf.

- The other reviewers that mentioned management demeaning employees are completely accurate.  You can expect to be belittled, yelled at, or chastised by people who generally don't have any concept of how to do their jobs but it helps them feel important none the less.  It could be an email that's bold and all upper case text sent to 40 people, or maybe you're yelled at on a call because you did something that your management asked you to do but then forgot about.

- There is no respect for your time off whether it is scheduled PTO, or just after work.  You are always expected to answer the phone, and you are always expected to be ready to work.  Flex time means you're flexible to their demands.

- Training is completely non-existent.  Learning at Travelclick consists of asking your neighbors for everything from how to do your timesheet to how to do your job.  On the positive side, you'll meet a lot of people, unfortunately that also means everyone does things differently.  Don't expect any guidance from management as they all seem to be allergic to documentation and training.   Communication is equally non-existent, it's laughable actually.

To reiterate what another reviewer stated about the survey results, we were told that if we weren't happy we should find other jobs as an outcome of the annual employee survey.  Well, that has worked for me so far.  I'm earning more money, have better benefits, and I'm much happier elsewhere."

I should have gotten a hint when within 6 months of starting the team lost half of its employees. Extra work was pushed onto the remaining employees, mandatory OT was implemented. workload expectation remained high even after new hires were trained.

Unfortunately I also felt some bullying behavior from my supervisor. Due to the social environment at this place felt very cliquey, I was never comfortable bringing this up to the supervisor, management or HR for fear it would come back to haunt me. I chose instead to leave the position. 

They will say you’re part of the TC family but truthfully supervisors and management will gossip about you. They generally lack respect and professionalism, calling each other names, social shunning, etc.

I also noticed that loyal employees who had been there 5+ years were passed up for advancement opportunities for employees who had been there less than 1 year.

New hires which came after me confided that their training was horrible and they didn’t learn anything in training."

Your day to day activities will be full of repetitive tasks. Working in this company can really make you feel dumb .

Hiring criteria is wily nily - some people get hired without college degrees. 
Management recently conducted an employee feedback survey. When they got bad feedback, they told in townhall meetings that such employees that give them negative feedback should quit, instead of taking feedback to change. Why conduct the survey then ?
And as for those recent reviews that are 4 star and above, take them with a grain of salt. Read the language. They look fake from either HR or management."

In here forget about being recognized for your hard work, promoted, getting a raise, getting a title change in the first 4 years or discussing the inexistent benefits that they cover up with yoga classes that they make their employees teach for free. People hate each other, be ready to be friends with your closest co-workers and barely interacting with the rest of the teams. No career advancement plan.

good work/life balance",Can be a bit stressful at crunch time but that's part of the job and no fault of the company
77,TravelClick,A place to avoid,2018-07-30,1.0,Senior Software Developer,"* Travelclick is well establish in the market, it products work (for the most part).
*  As in every job, there is some valuable people.","* By joining this place you will holding a job that will follow you to your lunches,  nights, weekends, holidays, sick days and vacations. Upper management does not have any boundaries, they expect you to be available all the time to join never ending conference calls that 80% of the time are plain useless. No Work life balance.
* The core of the products work reasonably well, but the bells and whistles are plagued by issues. You will be dealing with frustrated customers and fires on a daily (even hourly) basis.
* Abrasive upper management, a way too much yelling, people get reprimanded in front of everybody. A culture of micromanagement and distrust is prevalent.
* Lack of transparency, many parallel conversations with very different messages over the same matter.
* No training, no guidance, unachievable goals.
*Most employees are underpaid and are constantly leaving the place.
*Only revenue counts. Deals are routinely made based on nonexistent features, developers are then pushed to deliver them on unreasonably timelines and then blamed for the low quality of the rushed solutions.
* All depts are understaffed, everybody is underwater as a result everything is done poorly.
 *The overall  infrastructure (servers/workstations/net equipment) is a joke."

They are probably ready to ge bought out. Very outdated equipments, desks, PC's, it is very sad to see how a company with a great product has not vision or even intention to jump in the tech world culture."

Occasional food brought in by people.","No breaks, lunch 30 minutes but you have to wait, no sympathy for any health concerns you are expected to be a robot, people call from different numbers to reach you but you have to call the correct number for it to count as a call in. Schedules are not flexible even though YOU tell them what you prefer- they go on about work life balance but then they are not flexible if you need to make a change. Training was pretty basic.  I wish I read the reviews because they are pretty spot on- everyone seems so into themselves. Not a lot of smiles or hellos.  You never really know until you work some place."
81,TravelClick,Tough but rewarding,2018-06-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you've got an entrepreneurial side and want to spread your wings, this is the place. They basically let you be yourself and if one solution grows on you, you can transition into a specialist role. Tons of opportunity to learn and grow. They really understand the future of hospitality technology.  Don't expect to be micromanaged or led around by the hand. People are very direct here, and that can come across negatively if someone is sensitive or is a people pleaser. But those are great lessons in life and business and if you can accept them, this is a tremendous environment for personal and professional growth.","With so many entrepreneurial minded people running around, it is easy to miss passing on shared learnings with one another. You're on your own a lot when it comes to figuring out who to go to for what. But once you get it, it's liberating. Make sure your expectations are realistic. The learning curve here can be a year. Almost everyone they hire are overachievers and that can be tough for them to handle. If you have patience with yourself, it will pay off."

I feel they ""almost"" understand the market.","The company is young and unexperienced in the handling of increased pressure form other needs in the market place. Management is inexperienced and ignorant in the challenges that demanded in the workplace. A competitor can easily take advantage of this, by curtailing there offering, bring a more polished team to aid the clients, and treat employees and potential new employees better.

I remember my first days at the job- there was no organization, no where to park, no offer for food on-site, no real training on product solutions, and very closed minded ideals of management. The would-be bigger, higher ranked employees are based in NY, they get a little more attention than most, but they as personal are no better than anyone else. I have seen potential age related issues, where this could be a potential problem, as it is not ethical.

 If you are interiviewing, and wish for a career- put your energies elsewhere- it simply is a waste of energy and effort for TravelClick."

They get together because they share the same pain working in and for the company.,"Hungry for power, keeps adding new products or new promises to features of existing products just to win the sale, which never get delivered after the sale because there is simply no bandwidth from the ground staff.  Imbalance allocation of responsibilities across teams -  some team are so stretched they might as well reside in the office, while others stroll in to the office at 10am, go for morning break, 2 hours lunch, tea break, and then left by 4pm.  So you are looking to join make sure you join the right product/ team.  Also, this place is for FT (think remmuneration package)."
92,TravelClick,TravelClick is for strong capable high-performing people who can take critique and improve.,2018-04-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"TravelClick is challenging, intellectually stimulating, and tough.  And all in a very good way.  I am shocked at how this company strengthened me, at how much fun it is to do well at a hard task.  And I appreciate how rigorous the whole team is in pursuing high standards, improving both the hospitality industry and themselves: at every step self-critically confronting their own shortcomings.  I also loved winning over the trust and affection of similarly-minded individuals who don't mind rolling up their sleeves and working extremely hard.  I had a wonderful time for a significant part of my life at TravelClick, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge and is up to the task.","This place is not for the faint of heart - not for people who can't take critique and definitely not for people who need hand-holding or a lot of encouragement. This is a place where it is easy to mistake seriousness for harshness, or professionalism for emotional distance.  The real negative here comes from your expectations - were you hoping for a fraternity or college experience? This isn't it. Were you hoping to be gently led, because that simply won't happen... But if you were quietly suspecting that you are up to a difficult challenge, if you thought, maybe, that it is time to spread your wings and see how capable you really are... then this might be the place for you."

I don’t have to work on weekends.,"Where do I start? The base pay is an insult, management sucks, certain departments are not held accountable to do their jobs. The common theme is work harder for less pay each year, yet certain people in leadership make considerably more in commission and don’t do enough work.  Little to no room for career growth. Pay is not commensurate with scope of responsibility. Management is disconnected from what the people do and many people in management have no leadership skills (pathetic)"

When the company hired Larry Kutscher, the Americas HQ was moved to NYC. Larry has some values that he put out to the company, but very few in upper management abide by them. As well, many big sweeping changes happened that were out of touch with employees in the Chicago area office.

If you are a female, unless hired at the VP level, you probably will not get a promotion past a Director level since the upper management is a good ol' boys club.

Many people who work for this company began as customer service representatives (including senior management). If you know the right people, you can move up here.

Just realize, you will outgrow this company quickly, be prepared to move on.","* Intensely stressful work conditions
* Heavy resistance to change or improvement
* Tech talent is mostly novice-level with minimal senior staff.
* Stagnated company-wide sales

The senior tech talent that are hired here (due to most of the existing senior talent leaving) rarely last longer than 6 months. If there is a wrong way to do something, this place is going to do it, and stand by those terrible decisions vehemently. You will constantly be bombarded with meaningless ridiculous requests. If you try to explain why something won't work or why it's a bad idea, you will be ignored and then berated when their impossible ill-conceived task/project/whatever fails (whether it's actually your fault or not).

In my experience working with TravelClick it was a great place for learning, both social learning as well as picking up industry skills that could be transferable. Social learning for me rested with navigating an environment of implicit bias, lack of support for specific staff, and ultimately undermining practices employed by mid and upper level leadership",Key leadership exhibited lack of social intelligence or any genuine understanding of social dynamics that exists among functional/service teams.

There is no transparency when issues arise.  Many are not reported (and in fact, staff are directly told NOT to report them).

Outdated technology, legacy code and poor integration lead to outages that are blamed on everyone but the SLT - they made the decisions to defer expenses and are now paying the price.

Till now teams cannot manage projects. Process discussions never end. People keep throwing more work at others when it is not our job to do those tasks. HR isn't in all locations making it hard to deal with issues especially when it involves senior management. Taking our deserved 2 weeks vacation at once is a fight.

In a nutshell I regret coming here and wasting my time. Skills have not grown but stress level has. As a new hire we are expected to deliver results fast. Lot of overtime hours. Calls start early morning and go until late night many times. No comp time is given for extra hours. There is no on boarding, documentation or knowledge sharing, no one has time to assist, stress levels are high with everyone. To get one answer I have to chase 10 people down and no one wants to help. New team members are hired then suddenly vanish (did they get fired? quit? transferred?). Huge support gaps. We are expected to fill in with no idea what we are supporting on top of our existing work with no extra compensation. Sometimes words cannot describe how poor a work environment can be. This is an example of one."

Having flaws at the top means poor decisions keep rolling down through the hierarchy crushing people below giving rise to many issues:

- People quit or are removed regularly,
- Employee investment is nonexistent,
- Open non-management positions are not filled in a timely manner,
- New hires (managerial and non-managerial) show up without being interviewed or approved by their immediate team causing below par hires to come on board and thus team conflicts,
- Department leaders are ineffective and poorly rated by their teams. They boss around pushing work from top to down while juniors do the strategizing and heavy lifting getting no incentive in return, 
- Salary and raises are on the lower end, 
- There are constant changes with leadership, teams and processes then each person wants to run the show their way so changes keep happening which are not beneficial,
- There is quite a bit of cross-teams politics, blaming and disrespect (people think because they are in senior or leadership positions they own you with the language and tone they use. They also do not care about your time and team processes, they will try to force work on you as urgent which if you push back against then gets escalated),
- Every request is considered urgent so expect unplanned work, long hours and unhappy peers,
- Inconsistent work remote policy (some people get way more than others, some are mostly remote, some get none. It is a lottery depending on the leader you get).

Quitting was the only escape."

170,TravelClick,You'll be sorry you came here,2016-12-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's a job to pay bills. They needed a contractor, but offered me a full time position instead.","Where do I begin? Interview process was a complete joke, HR couldn't even get a background check or university degree verification right! Multiple interviews with people that had no bearing on the position at all. One interviewer canceled twice.  Asking HR any questions were often times unanswered and if you got an answer it was DAYS afterwards. When I was let go, I was called into some woman's office I didn't know and wasn't even in HR, just someone with an office that had a door so she was privy to HR information. New employee orientation didn't happen until the day I was let go.  On a call with upper management, discussing ""what they're about"" the CTO was completely unprofessional and swore like a truck driver. They made an offer to a very experience candidate and rescinded their offer on his start date because they couldn't get his background check back in a timely manner instead of simply postponing his start date. Supposedly health benefits start your first day, yet no info or medical cards were provided.  Only allow 6% contribution and no employer match. You are let go and don't give severance. You accrue vacation time and it's not paid out on your last paycheck & basically told 'tough luck.'

My manager had barely been there for 6 months and knew very little. The team I worked with was AWFUL...a bunch of catty, backstabbing females. In fact, one barely spoke to me and when she did, she was rude and condescending. She was more interested in calling her husband & kids throughout the day when she was there, which was rare. Knowing the team was short staffed, she constantly took time off or ""worked"" from home (questionable since she never answered her Skype messages and was always on ""away"" status), making it extremely difficult to learn anything from her or get assistance. The other woman on the team couldn't train a mouse to eat cheese and was horrible at it.  Yet, my manager expected flawless support while left on my own after barely 2 weeks on the job. The group was supposedly well meshed but I found that to me the opposite. In fact, it was far from what you'd call a TEAM. 

The poor IT guy was left to support the entire company and had no help because they let the other IT guy go. He worked from 6am to 8pm almost everyday. Talk about working the poor guy to death!!

They had a Christmas party last week, of which, I was not invited. Great way to welcome a new employee.

Management expects employees to wear multiple hats and only be paid for one and sacrifice time with your family. There is NO work/life balance at all. No opportunities to advance within the company, no one speaks to you or even introduces themselves. It's a open ""cubical"" atmosphere...meaning no actual walls...and everyone is so loud you can't focus or hear anything on a phone call. When asked if they could keep it down, I received dirty looks and heard one whisper nasty things & mock me. What kind of person does that? Made a complaint and nothing was done.

Stay away from this company like the plague. You DO NOT want to work there, trust me."

Every single employee, regardless of their tenure, skill level, engagement with the company, demonstrated loyalty to the company for years on end, etc, will be tossed aside if something cheaper steps in.  If it sounds like I'm bitter it's because I AM.  

I and quite a few others sacrificed time with their friends, their families, their own free time, hours of needless stress to continually pump out the highest quality work with ZERO compromises, and I, along with EVERYONE else in my team was let go, without warning, without notice, without so much as a hint that I may want to polish up my resume.  I worked with this company for 6+ years and was given nothing but a lesson in economics for my time.  Loyalty means nothing to this company, don't forget that.

Now, to be clear here, this was a while back, the climate MAY be different now, however I severely doubt it considering that it never changed once the entire time I was there."

Many times we were left in training for hours alone while our trainer was performing other tasks for management, which led me to believe they really didn't respect or appreciate me as a new hire.

Members in the team however are UNDERVALUED from SLT and is always getting the ""shorter end of the stick"" from the disparaging culture of the CEO and his leadership team. They pride themselves about employee engagement but when there are clear signs of what can be improved, they turn the other way. Business casual work environment which is great.  The benefits are mediocare at best (no maternity leave). Flexible hours without the micro-managing time in or time out. Overall great people to work with and grow a lasting relationship with within the Media team. I would recommend ONLY if you use this opporutnity as a stepping stone to your career and onto the next employer. 

- Great exposure; resume & experience addition
- Talented and socially friendly team members
- Work environment in the media team is awesome. ""Work hard, play hard"" mentailty.  
- Free water & milk & coffee","Turnover Rate is insanely high, which leads to the lack of training when hired. SLT just doesn't seem to want to invest in an onboarding/training team. You're thrown into a position and expected to figure out what to do at times with all eyes secretly watching you. With that said, there is obvious a lack of organization and training from SLT. Please start investing in the employees opinions which are clearly stated and stop ""cold shouldering"" everything thats not reveune generating. 

Media Team gets insulted by the CEO/SLT all the time - Media needs to sell more, needs to generate more (it's like a sweat shop). There isn't any rewards/ incentives for the team after the upsell. CEO doesn't even bother to visit the team and try to understand what it is we do. CEO doesn't do anything about concerns the lower level people point out even after the survey has been presented and questions asked. Pay is NOT competitive at all. Stop dodging questions with answers that don't answer the question. Technology (laptops) needs to be updated ASAP. Once again, no sense of investment in the work we do. 

- Very high turnover rate
- Pay is NOT that great
- Benefits NOT that great (no maternity leave)
- Overworked (due to all the open positions needed to be fulled), underpaid, undervalued.

The outside sales team (DOS) and account management team hold it all together.  If it not for them, the cancellations would pour in.  EBIIDTA is the only thing that matters to the CEO and SLT team that has equity as they prepare to sell the company (AGAIN).

Your job description would be pretty simple, but you will be doing super repetitive job for different hotels all around the world. In 2 weeks you will feel like you reached the maximum knowledge that you could gain from your job and you would be probably right. I felt as if I were a chicken in a metal cage just laying the same eggs over and over. 
The company is not interested in your personal growth or area of interest. They just need people to do the job, so that the revenue could double (and you will not get any benefits by making the business grow) or triple. 
TC is not a global company - it may have offices in many different locations and serve clients from all around the world, but the mindset is certainly not global. It is a company around one man called Larry and that is the most important figure and mission and vision of the company.

You're put on the spot among your team regarding your numbers when some specifics should be spoken to as a 1 on 1.  You spend too much time auditing your territory to ensure you are getting credit for accounts in your territory when most of this should be handled by another department to ensure the territory is set up appropriately.  Some of the product teams only think ""product"" and are not as supportive as they should be to help you be a consultant to customers.  High intense stressful sales environment.

- Although far and few, there is an ability to learn more tasks.
- ""Business casual"" work environment; even though most people are seen wearing blue jeans, tennis shoes and shirts without a collar.
- The parking garage, to protect your car from the winter and rainy elements.
- No one notices when you take 40-minute breaks away from your desk because your manager and director are face deep in their own work, or have the door closed. So that's neat.","- Absolutely zero perks to the job for the amount of time you'll be putting in:
.. The 401Ks have been downgraded (now only matching X% depending on how well the company does)
.. a summer bbq and holiday party in the winter that aren't by any means spectacular.
.. Media Department isn't allowed to work from home, because the director said she ""doesn't work well from home due to distractions"", so the entire department doesn't receive this opportunity.
.. they allowed us to buy stock in the company, with a *minimum of $10K buy-in*. This came off as elitist and super out of touch as a majority of the office is in their 20-30s.
.. you can receive up to 10% of your salary as a yearly bonus, depending on how you, your department and the company does overall.. This sounds great, but the rating scales and payouts are severely inconsistent and the extra thousands post-taxes is hardly enough for the effort put in.

- The overall culture is bad; there is a high turnover rate in most departments, with the extra work falling upon other members of your team who are already maxed to capacity. 
.. Managers and directors are stressed and often come off frantic, which trickle down to those who they manage.
.. Most people are talking about leaving, if not already transitioning to a new career.

- You'll work hard and won't receive any additional recognition. As well, the ones who aren't working hard and skating by won't be bothered - you'll both be viewed as the same.
- Little to no motivation, inspiration or dream from the CEO or your managers.
- CEO has made it abundantly apparent he has no desire to invest in resources and tools for employees to do their jobs properly (this would cut into the company profit)
- The company is more worried about the bottom line and their ability to resell for profit than paying to keep, reward and/or recognize great talent.
- No room for personal growth; they have just now haphazardly created some sort of ""growth band chart"" that remains confusing and unclear like much of the company - as if this was processed to hush the masses, rather than promote growth.
- The laptop you receive is awful, most requiring 15 minute restarts every morning because they have been refurbished to oblivion. Instead of supplying future workers with laptops, they are enacting a ""voucher"" program to buy your own and will pay a portion - because who doesn't want to have their work and personal laptop on one?
-Very little reward for employees that sacrifice way more than they should."

For some, this kind of environment is stressful, but I find it enforces a strong mutual respect and friendship. 
Besides an exceptional community culture, I definitely can see a personal improvement in my skill set, as well as new knowledge gained, which I can apply for future roles. This is due to team members and managing directors taking the time to patiently teach me new material.

276,TravelClick,Worst Company Ever - Avoid Like the Plague,2014-06-28,1.0,Media Strategist,Media and web team colleagues are really competent,"- DoS have very high sales targets and don't know anything about the solutions that they provide (so does senior management.) As a consequence they will sell all types of solutions to clients, over promising results. If/when results don't happen, they will then blame other teams like media or web.
- The company doesn't care about providing the best solutions to their clients, they are only interested in short term revenue.
- Very old school mentality, a lot of senior managers and DoS are arrogant and bullies.
- No work-life balance whatsoever.
- No career progression path in place."

My position changed several times while with the company as well as my supervisor.  They rarely promote from within and many of the managers are pompous but I'm not sure why because half the time they know less than you.  There are some really socially awkward people there, like seriously awkward... Like I can't really express through words how awkward.  The job will essentially be a sales job down the line.  They are constantly looking for ways to screw you out of your bonus.  And they lay people off who perform great for no good reason and keep people who are underperforming because they are cooler with managers.  Other departments are much more cohesive."

The most positive part is working with generally good people that respect their job, equipment and people they interact with.","Solutions for problems are not recognized as achievements, You tend to get push back from management trying get tasks assigned to you complete. You are forced to cut corners in order to keep up with metrics so many jobs are half done and would need to be revisited. There is no program for formal training of employees looking to become more proficient using new technology. I think a lot that I have seen has been penny wise and dollar stupid."

Working hours can be flexible, depending on your department and your circumstances.

Salaries are fair. Not spectacular, but not near exploiting people.

Christmas parties, summer parties, random parties in the terrace are the norm.

It's very easy to change departments if you run out of gas in your current position.

Constantly growing. New people almost every other week.

Generally there's no micro-management. You are free to take breaks, do your own little projects, just as long as you do your work on time, good and as much as required.","The company's values, though reminded and reinforced often, are not taught by example.

The HR team should improve a lot. There's no career plan.

Key decisions and advancements apparently ""must"" be made from the US headquarters, even though there's a better idea, and better operational talent and bandwidth in other offices (happens to us in the Barcelona office all the time).

The company is big, so it has to be bureaucratic; but definitely not this much.

They will let a team go understaffed for a good while, just to see how much the team really needs another person. Must be good for profits, but puts a lot of stress on the ones coping with all the work.

Almost everyone has a sales goal, if you ever interact with customer. You'll probably have a sales goal."

Quality of work output from the ""field marketing"" team is dismal at best and filled with errors.

337,TravelClick,Worst Job Ever,2012-08-29,1.0,Inside Sales,Nothing good to say about this company.,"Low commission rates, they take micro management to a whole new level, Director in Orlando is the most disrespectful person I have ever encountered, Iron fisted, don't care about their employees or their customer's, biggest mess of a company that I have ever worked for."
338,TravelClick,Worst Company to Work For!  Do Yourself a Favor and Stay Away!,2012-08-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"None, other than a paycheck.","Senior management spews ""values"" that they don't practice themselves.  It means nothing.  Horrible organization, poor culture and work environment, low employee morale.  They discriminate and have no moral compass.  Best described as hell on earth and a ""Hitler"" organization.  Terrible place to work.  There's nothing good to say about this company."

Strong learning curve
High potential of career evolution
Very attractive industry
Powerful and bright management - shame they all come from the same company though, limits variety","No cross training function - good way to increase employee's satisfaction
Little visibility in company's evolution - all decisions are taken from HQ
Very reduced HR team - why working for hotels if not even hotel perks available?
Disadvantages of a multinational and a startup"

Where do I start :) :) First and foremost the higher management needs to get some lessons in being a human being. Then learn to speak in a good manner, professionally. Then they can start capitalizing."
341,TravelClick,Ok if you don't want to grow your career,2012-06-25,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working from home
Average salary
Some cool benefits such as airfare discounts","No room for growth

Disorganized
Other departments can affect your performance"
342,TravelClick,Worst possible place to work,2012-06-15,1.0,Director,Great products for hotels to better understand the complex nature of their business.  They have a diverse portfolio of products that when utilized correctly can be a one stop shop for hotels.,"The new management has eviscerated the company.  All of the people with industry knowledge are being pushed out of the company and replaced with people who have no hospitality experience.  There is no work life balance for anyone who is not on the senior management team.  If you don't agree with them then you are labeled a trouble maker.  It is really a shame because this company was once one of the leaders in the hospitality industry.  Now, it is an also ran that has ruined its reputation and now creates second rate products that are vastly overpriced."
343,TravelClick,Sucks you in the interview process....It's like advertising that hell is the place to be!,2012-05-14,1.0,Director Level,"Benefits are just ok, my salary ok and you learn a different side to the hospitality industry. They do a great job of selling the company to new people pre-interview/hire.","Company is lead by non-industry people who don't know what they are doing; everyone is micro-managed and spends 8-10 hours a day on conference calls telling the ""experts"" what to do. In their world, they assume ""everyone is an idiot and don't know"" so you tell them. You also have to be available 24 hrs a day for the leadership but they are not available for you. The HR department is the worst I've seen in my 20+ years of working.  A number of people were promoted and 9 months later have yet to receive their promotional increases. Bonuses were paid out and anyone under the ""old Travelclick"" weren't eligible but all new people hired  were eligible."

345,TravelClick,Not a promising place to work,2012-05-04,1.0,Product Support,Overall decent products and services,Leadership has tunnel vision and looks out for themselves. The CEO is more focused on growth than quality of the current product. The right hand NEVER knows what the left hand is doing. Too many titles that do nothing to promote the business. Little to no growth potential...management nor HR have a mentoring program in place to promote employee growth.
346,TravelClick,Disorganized company in identity crisis,2012-04-30,2.0,Account Manager,"If you are looking to learn A LOT about the hospitality industry as it relates to all things online marketing and distribution, then this would be a good place to get that knowledge.  With so many products, you won't be bored learning about everything, which will look really nice on your resume.","Senior Management completely disorganized, doesn't understand Account Management function or best way to engage with clients.  Too many hands in the cookie jar with clients - they didn't understand who at Travelclick was supposed to support them with what product. 

Customer service was difficult to deal with and always ran behind on servicing client's needs, which made my job harder.

Too many technical problems with products and no support.  

While the company is growing VERY FAST and has lots of open positions, they are growing TOO fast without thinking processes out (and thus, the employees have to take the heat from clients).  I had the impression that if you are good at your job, management didn't want to help you develop into other roles because they would rather keep you in the current then let you try and move on or up."

All are Temp, and it takes very long to become permanent, if you get to that point. The employees are seldom friendly. the hours are very long and there is little flexibility for lunch and personal time."
