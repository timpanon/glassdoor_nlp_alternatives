Free lunch, outings, remote work, work hour flexibility, off-the-record PTO, travel allowance. Many of these were stopped due to COVID. I grew a lot in this company and loved it but I entered when it was in the startup phase. Nowadays it's basically big corporate and the culture has changed drastically. There are many challenges and you have the flexibility to move internally. It is very junior friendly though promotion is an extraordinary challenge these days. Workload varies depending on your role and team but for me it was great.","Completely opaque leadership and extensive micromanagement. Career path tapers off unless you want to move to management. Internal politics cause unhealthy competition within the company which resulted in the departure of multiple CTOs. Was laid off due to COVID but wasn't told what metrics were used, leading to anxiety among remaining employees and eventually mass exodus. There also used to be performance bonuses and company-wide outings but they're all gone since last June and pay has been frozen since then unless you're promoted.

In 2020, they didn't give bonus(variable pay) to any employee, saying company is not doing good, although company was doing good before Covid-19. This happened because they didn't get Investment. A company should be self sustainable.

They fired almost 50 employees from Bangalore office, without any proper criteria.

They have some internal framework which they call ""Backend Infra"", they will ask you to work on this internal framework, Here, if you talk to anybody about open source framework like Spring , Spring-boot or Hibernate, they are not even aware of it.

Jakarta counterpart people are very egoistic, if you have different opinion with them on some design discussion, they will write bad about you in your performance review."

- Highly political and centralised around Jakarta HQ. It made life miserable.

- Business fragmented into business units which don't talk to nor trust each other. This creates gigantic inefficiencies that affect the financial bottom line of the company.

- The CEO is absent from discourse, culture, and employee communications. He does not speak to the staff to communicate his vision (e.g. town hall). The more far reaching the consequences of decisions, the less you hear from him.

- The CEO maintains a circle of old buddies around him that function as ""yes men"" and are never replaced no matter how financially devastating their failures.

- The company pursues helpless and nonsensical efforts to somehow start growing."

The CEO doesn't show the basic responsibility of talking to the employees during hard times. They spend money in all the wrong places but when an employee really needs something to perform the job better, they don't have any budget. Last year they spent all their money on price-war against competitors and now discovered that they don't have much more runway. Now they found COVID as an excuse and firing people in the 1-day notice. Some people got fired within a day or week of joining.

The engineering leaders are totally incompetent. They don't guide the lower level to improve the stack and but it's the juniors who gets fired first. The product managers have no clue what they are doing, makes a terrible decision without researching properly.

HR's are the most pathetic bunch. They never take action on people's feedback,  they have one standard template ""We are looking into it"".

There is no transparency and I dont even recollect how many times in my tenure with  Traveloka did the CEO sent any communication to its employee about what the Company vision and targets for next Q's or H's. They have most of the market share in Indonesia and that is the reason they could surive despite having dreadful strategy and no vision. Decisions are just made randomly as if its not a Billion dollar enterprise but a hawker center shop at Lau Pat Sat. There is mistrust and complete gap between Jakarta and other offices outside Indonesia. 
The mid level managers also seem to balancing between their incapabilities and the bullshits received by them by the C' levels. The planning and execution is so poor that on a day almost all SG staff is asked to leave despite considering other options to offer a pay cut or thinking long term once the pandemic gets over. For the strong hearts - A couple of folks leave their previously well off jobs to join fresh on April 6, have their onboarding session and next day on 7th April are being fired.

By cutting everyone’s bonus, how much more runway do you get? 1-1.5 months more?

And what’s the consequence? Low morale + people quitting will cost you much much more than that bonus cost. Your high performers are not rewarded so they will quit.

Look at the management too. What’s all these CTOs doing? They are not technically strong, nor do they manage well. They delegate their job downwards and don’t solve some of the most problematic cultural issues - secrecy / poor product - engineering collaboration, etc. When staff at the lower ranks report problems to their managers, what do these managers do?

- Your basic salary might be higher than your fresh grad peers in other companies, but even if you are lucky to have a good manager who provides a clear career path, do not expect a big bonus or increment in your performance review
- Not really a con, but if you are planning to apply, please expect a long and high competitive recruitment process.
