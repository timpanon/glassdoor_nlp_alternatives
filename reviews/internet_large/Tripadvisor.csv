Does not value employee growth. All words, no action, no follow ups. When you leave, you don't even know if you're getting your last paycheck which is unprofessional. I wouldn't recommend this company to my network."

3,Tripadvisor,Great place to work and learn,2022-04-04,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,Awesome place to work with difficult challenges and teams that can help you accomplish amazing things.,The amount of time you spend working is 55+hrs a week.
4,Tripadvisor,You cannot work from abroad,2022-03-31,1.0,Customer Service,"International environment, colleagues, nice job","If you work in the Customer Service organisation (which includes, Fraud, Moderation, and other teams), you are only allowed to work from abroad for a maximum of 2 weeks. The Uk law allows you to work up to 3 months from abroad but your manager will refuse it. Many other companies are adapting to a new flexible world but Tripadvisor is not. (Which is curious since it’s a travel company and they should encourage travelling)."
5,Tripadvisor,Steer clear,2022-03-24,1.0,Customer Service Representative,The only pro about this job is the perks!,There is no communication at all with or between upper management and customer service. You are micromanaged! Your job is always on the line because you are not appreciated or valued

8,Tripadvisor,not worth anymore,2022-03-15,1.0,Fraud Analyst,"people, made lots of friends.","It's not what it used to be anymore. They say the pandemic would made us better..the contrary was said for Tripadvisor and their policies. First they refused to let employee within the kingdom of customer service's Vice presidents, to work from anywhere in Europe even for few days, creating disparities between departments. The sales team can go and come back as they please. Second they are refusing me to pay my annual bonus because I gave formal notice on the 8th of March and having the 30th of March as my last day, after it was discussed in a formal conversation withe the managers and already processed. They say it's company policy to be employed the day in which the bonus will be paid, I've asked HR and payroll where I could find this info as it should be accessible to everyone and they didn't reply...joke of a company..is this the way you treat your employees after 10 years of service?
Not to mention that in the time I've been there, I have been trough at least 10 changes in the reorg, because the previous ones didn't work..I've always been flexible and happy to do it, and this is how they repay you.."

The ambiguity, the constant reshuffles of teams, changing their business model, changing changing changing. You are basically treated like a ping pong ball. Job is very target based.

Unfortunately the pandemic impacted a lot several people from the mental health point of view.

The way the leadership dealt with the problem was quite embarrassing. There were people crying and not performing because they were asking a bit of flexibility in terms of working from their native country in order to spend some time with family. The answer was always to check first if there were all the legal requirements met. If those were met, it was up to the high management. The answer, for a long time, was no “because XX said no”.
Now, one of the main quality you should have in customer service is to show empathy; it seems that the pandemic had the power to let people forget about it.
So you can imagine seen people from other departments asking to work from X country for months, having their request accepted and then others asking to work in the same countries( so same rules) for few weeks being denied . Tripadvisor A and Tripadvisor B. 
And we are still talking about people stuck working from home and not yet in the office. So what’s the problem working from Spain or the UK for few weeks/ months if everything was met from the law, taxes, legal entity point of view?"

We work with speed to build great products in a collaborative way. It's a really good culture and fun place to work. We also get lots of vacation time and we have the option to work remotely (at least for now).,The leadership strategy is missing and we don't have a chief product officer (at least for now...) Hoping the new leadership team will bring great strategy in 2022.

Managers said we were lucky to “still have a job” and reminded us that we were “part owners” even though TripAdvisor only gives $5k in stock that doesn’t vest for 4 years.

Obsessed with optimization and minor tweaking of the experience rather than true innovation. Pretend to focus on the customer but really operate based on the whims of the C suite - who are intense micromanagers. They then expect other 'leaders' to be micromanagers. So really there is no vision and leadership. Just a ton of tactical swinging from one thing to the next and everyone playing with data to try to justify their actions/opinions.

Management is terrible. HR knows a lot of things but their hands are always tied for a reason or another. No career progression whatsoever even they tell you otherwise. The customer service can do almost nothing compared to other departments. 

There’re many other things I’d like to write to leave a genuine and real feedback but I’d limit myself to give some advise for potential new hires.
If this is your first working experience in the uk and you don’t mind working almost every single weekend with a great difficult in seeing your holiday approved, then go for it.

95,Tripadvisor,"Hopefully, Product actually do Product now",2021-07-08,2.0,Product Manager,"- Some really smart people to work with, and learn from.","Product craft was severely lacking, with three things sticking out for me.

- The ""speed wins"" mantra meant that velocity and volume of output was the main criteria of success, which created a bias towards optimisations, and hampered innovation or transformative growth.

- The experimentation culture was a double edged sword - it yielded some great wins, but with no real structure around setting hypotheses, it was very much the 'throw spaghetti at a wall, and see what sticks.' This meant that even when a variant won, nobody could confidently say *why* it had won.

- Very little speaking to end users. A lot of the use cases and customer pain points were compiled in meetings made up of identikit 30-something white, uni graduates, who were in no way representative of the user base,

Also, the then-President (or whatever his title was....the boss, anyway) of vacation rentals had a very condescending and bullying style. The Tuesday afternoon meetings would invariably end with someone being grilled, while everyone else had their head down, exchanging furtive, sympathetic glances.

From competitive compensation, to work flexibility, to acknowledge and working on issues like Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, to the charitable work that the company does through the TripAdvisor Foundation...

Well... More inspiring and charismatic. Sometimes I feel like they are robots reading off a script when talking to us, whether in town halls or smaller meetings.

2020 has been a tough year for everyone, but I have been comforted by our group effort to get through this and come out the other side better and stronger and importantly together. 
A great example of this was the Alumni network launched in response to layoffs made earlier in the year, this was excellent and just reinforced how hard a decision this was and how much our leadership team cared.",It's been tough seeing so many talented colleagues leave in 2020 in response to a global pandemic and changes to our business structure.

Beautiful offices but DISGUSTING MICROMANAGEMENT with a real plastic environment. Most of the colleagues i had worked with have been fired since ive left. Seeing how google was taking over the rentals business I can imagine Coronavirus has got the director’s out the same door. They let you in with a smile asking you to give, be inspired and work hard, then they look at a graph and realise they’ve placed money in wrong areas and mess with people’s lives and expectations. It’s all I saw my time there. I couldn’t put up with it so i looked elsewhere early but really sad to see people that have been working effortlessly, committed and honest get the boot like that.

Good Travel perks","Management is lazy
Losing a lot of the perks

Tripadvisor was an awesome company when I first started. The people are awesome, the job was cool, free lunch, beer, dogs in the office. On site Gym. 
Quotas were always big, hardly attainable. But the other perks made up for it.

Once covid hit, travel was impacted more than most. Tripadvisor decided to cap the sales team's commission at 30 and 40%. This has been going on for 9 months now. On top of capping commissions at 1/3 of what they should be, they raised quota by 1200%(that's not a typo). 

The company breed's managers to sit back and do nothing while reaping all the benefits from the reps being overworked. It is nearly impossible to get a manager to actually help you when you need it.
With everyone working from home, the cool perks are all gone. No more gym, lunch, after work drinks with coworkers, and they won't be coming back when we do return to the office.

My peers are great. If it weren't for them I probable would have left sooner.
This is (or was) a pretty good start for someone brand new to sales. This is not an ideal place for a seasoned AE."

The company and its employees are well-regarded, particularly in the Boston area.

The company is late to the game when it comes to capitalizing on their massive amounts of review and user preference data to build a better experience for travelers. As a result, site traffic and revenue have declined. Tripadvisor blames Google for its declining traffic, and while Google has certainly had an impact, the truth is, Tripadvisor has failed innovate and create a compelling reason for travelers to use the site. Instead of focusing on features that would add value for the traveler, the company has doubled down on building more advertising into the site. This isn't a strategy for growth. This is a strategy for milking ever cent out of a declining audience that will eventually slow to a trickle."

One incompetent hire after the next, very little innovation, increasingly confused direction, internal processes that worked well were scrapped  and new process that bogged down communications were put in place.  It became an us (long term TAMG employees) vs. them (Conde employees).  Nepotism was out of control - CM brought in friends from Condé, awarded them big titles with vague responsibilities (since they didn’t know what they were doing I suppose that was for the best) and tenured employees were demeaned and ultimately let go (COVID being a great excuse for them to clean house).

 - Beautiful office space in Needham
 - Still one of the biggest B2C web properties on the east coast; opportunity to impact billions of users
 - Pockets of truly great people across the company","For many years TripAdvisor was a hub of really strong tech talent in the greater Boston area. A well-managed MBA rotational program kept the PM organization staffed with young, bright minds who frequently matured into competent managers. The VP and Director levels were stacked with sharp, experienced operators. During this time, Trip was a well-oiled machine, but in 2015 the platform and business started hitting a ceiling. After a failed attempt to pivot to a booking platform there was quite a bit of turnover of the ""old guard."" This wasn't an inherently bad thing; there were some new leaders emerging with compelling plans to modernize the site and revitalize the UGC flywheel. Well-developed talent at the mid and junior levels were able to step into management roles, and teams executed at a high level, but competitive headwinds continued to impede growth.

After a significant redesign in 2018 failed to immediately move the engagement needle, there was another shake-up at the leadership level. This time the board bet on talent sourced from the NYC media industry. Over the course of 2019 there was a noticeable shift in corporate culture. Suddenly there was a tremendous amount of negativity from the top down but no real guidance or strategic vision. A ""Devil Wears Prada"" management style prevailed. Former NYC colleagues were hired and given vague titles and job responsibilities, and an insular bubble quickly formed (hence the ""Mean Girls"" references in other reviews). Leadership was seldom in the office and 3rd party design agencies were hired to re-think the core business and product strategy, with dubious results. The situation devolved to the point where annual planning sessions literally did not take place in 2019 - an unprecedented display of absentee leadership. This bizarre radio silence left many feeling alienated and seriously concerned about the trajectory of the company. 

In 2020 Trip's market position continued to weaken in the absence of any coherent strategy and continued pressure from competitors. Multiple rounds of layoffs have delivered a major blow to team morale."
239,Tripadvisor,One of my best professional experiences,2020-07-02,4.0,Senior Manager,"Excellent working conditions, clear targets and good level of trust with direct managers. I enjoyed the weekly catch-up with my boss to review progress and set objectives. No micro-management and lots of empowerment.",Highly difficult to move horizontally within the company.

240,Tripadvisor,Sad State of Affairs at a Once Great Place to Work,2020-07-01,2.0,Sales,"Great benefits, perks, generous severance packages","I loved working at Tripadvisor until the last 1.5 years. After a major reorg that should have been positive, everything took a turn for the worse. Almost all new hires came from Conde Nast, bringing with them an immediate negative impact on culture. It quickly became an ""Us"" versus ""Them"" environment; you were either in the clique or you weren't. Long time talented employees who were successful in their roles were pushed aside or out all together. The company also quietly laid off over 200 people in February due to it's own business mismanagement. Then weeks later COVID-19 hits, another 900 people are let go, and the PR machine was in full effect blaming it on the pandemic alone. It's sad to see what the place has become. The downward spiral appears to continue. I hope they can right the ship for the sake of the employees left behind and for what was once a most beloved brand, but it might be too far gone."

242,Tripadvisor,Company values have changed,2020-06-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Tripadvisor used to be a big family of skilled, respected and respectful people. It was a friendly and enjoyable environment with some great benefits. Then, things have changed.","In 2019, new top-level leaders arrived in the US who soon started restructuring globally some teams without having a clear understanding of how the business worked. Additionally, they brought their own people and some of their own values. These top leaders lack empathy and they have an arrogant and self-righteous approach which is cleverly hidden by their good verbal communication skill. They caused a lot of frustration as they implemented several changes which made processes slower and less effective. They definitely built many walls and not enough bridges by creating a toxic environment. They lack experience and, over the months, to hide their own mistakes, they tried to reverse the bad strategy by changing the processes again. 

Micromanagement is their rule. They filled teams with several unnecessary positions while others were overloaded. Nepotism is widespread and it is not difficult to understand the logic behind some career advancements. They say they believe in transparency but better not to share your opinion if you don't want to be in trouble. And they also used Covid-19 as an excuse to 'clear' the teams they previously created by removing some of the most experienced and highly paid staff.

I will always have fond memories of what Tripadvisor used to be, and it is deeply sad to watch how the company has changed.
I have always believed Steve Kaufer to be a great CEO and I simply do not understand why he is letting all this to happen."

259,Tripadvisor,"We believe in ""transparency""",2020-06-05,1.0,Customer Success Representative,"Health Insurance, well being benefit reimbursement","“We believe in transparency” is one of their core value. This is what transparency means for Tripadvisor:

Targets constantly changing and never explained to reps, people who have been working there for years still don’t know how their targets are calculated. 

I had 2 quarters where my target and pay-outs were not calculated correctly, still waiting for an answer and my money. 

Constantly changing and reshuffle of teams, people leaving or letting go without going through a proper process. The turnover is massive. 

Product is obsolete, no improvements or new products for the clients. Massively overpricing their products with no reason. Moreover, Hoteliers see their subscription price increased by 25% every year. 

In all the time I have worked there, what I saw is ambiguity. Nothing was clear or transparent. Be careful at some of the senior people there who are ready to do the trick in order to get a better bonus at your expenses. 

Zero jobs security. This company has gone through several massive workforce reductions over the last few years. Every year they close or reduce their business units letting people go. Their redundancy process is shocking. I have seen them treating people like garbage. Zero compassion towards their employers, letting go pregnant women and people on sick leave. 

During the last large cutting of staff Senior Management said everyone would take a 20% pay cut to help balance the books. After almost 1000 members of the staff were cut they reversed this decision and kept their salary at 100%. Nicely done. 

The company is going down. The CEO has no intention on investing to innovate, his priority is keeping the business running as a revenue machine as long as it lasts. Very old mind set and business structure from the Senior Management.
Managers and Team Leader, please remember your working with humans, not numbers. 

Bye Bye Tripadvisor, hope you are going to really believe in transparency one day...."

Used to be some fantastic people to work with. Every day was a joy to come to work. Sadly that all changed in 2019.","Every member of the team hired from Conde Nast is incompetent, lacking basic knowledge of internet fundamentals, territorial to a level that goes so far beyond toxic, and most of all are just mean, spiteful people. And yet they all awarded themselves big titles despite clear lack of talent or experience. You were either part of 'the Conde Nast clique' or you were out. Every day became like living through junior high school all over again. 

The immediate effects on our business and morale were shocking. They would fudge sales numbers, rebrand existing products as something new that they'd invented, disparage other people's good work, refuse to ever listen to suggestions, use our sales calls to shame people publicly, and so much more.

I heard one coworker say 'their only real talent is creating roadblocks' and it is just so true. We saw an executive assistant hired in NYC quit in less than two weeks because he was being made to do their laundry and write their Tinder profiles. 

I heard the same stories from my coworkers all over the country and so many of us had talks with human resources, but nothing was ever done and they used the recent COVID-19 layoffs to get rid of even more great people who dared question them, including me and most of my team.

How Steve Kaufer let all of this happen I do not know, but it was a relief when I was let get go as after this nightmare experience I need time with my family to recover. It is a sad day as I will always have wonderful memories of what Tripadvisor once was and the good people I worked with there, but on to bigger and better things."

The engineering team is top notch. They have a modern stack with some very talented engineers. Trip follows a lot of industry best practices and really drives engineers to be better.

People - at least engineers - are generally empowered to succeed. Most colleagues are very friendly and it is a great environment to learn. The office culture is incredibly friendly and social.

Teams are tight knit and strive to operate effectively and efficiently. Expect frequent retrospectives and improvements to the product development cycle.","Lack of transparency. You may work with managers who hold information back from you or members of the team, or managers who aren't entirely forthcoming. 

Lack of strong product direction or commitment to products. Some engineers worked on projects for months only to A/B test and be considered failures. The product direction constantly pivots, resulting in teams being frequently rearranged.

Micromanagement. If you're an engineer, there's a decent chance your manager will be up in your space.

Because Trip is a publicly traded company, the product priorities may shift considerably if the company needs to focus in certain areas. Don't fall in love with your projects too much."

* Friday lunch.","Yes, Viator Sydney used to be a great place till Vacation Rentals stepped in. Tripadvisor Experiences( Viator) got a new CEO from Vacation Rentals and he brought his team with his. Obvious isn’t it. Quite a few higher management relocated to Sydney and took powers into their hands. From then, its all favourism and politics.

Favourism over Skill:

Managers would never give a chance to the deserving team or the individual, rather they will give it to their favourites. Always, the favourites will get a chance to work on the greenfield projects and to move around new projects and the tech stack. While others need to fix their defects and support the legacy systems.

Lack of Trust:

Difference in opinion is not at all acceptable. Even if you have it, it’s better not to raise it. You will get into their bad books. Forget about quality or maintenance, release it ASAP, if you say no, you will be tagged as a slow performer. 

Culture of looking at how many commits you have done in a day/month, how much time you take to deliver a feature at the back of your shoulder. This data could have been used constructively, rather they used it to create an unsafe work culture. You have to be an exhibitionist to thrive. But, the team work was getting destroyed with this culture. Had multiple discussions with the management regarding this, but the efforts were futile.

Time spent on pool and table tennis table will be monitored(not officially though). They would ask us to limit our play time, when the US counterparts visits. (Earlier glassdoor review on the same was removed :))

Lack of Freedom:

Top management has strong choice of the tech stack to be used in the project across the company. No question of right tool for the right job. For Instance, Spring framework is not favoured, because some team /team members didn’t understand them :). Why on earth, you will write their own transaction management and maintain it??? You need to fight hard to justify that the tool you chose is the right one, end of the day it will be rejected and you would be tagged as rebel."

Everyone seems genuinely excited to be there and working on what they are working on.  Things move pretty quickly when it is a priority, and there is a strong desire among both the business units and the engineers for mobility and flexibility when addressing new issues.","Ultimately, the travel industry in general and Trip specifically are in for some rough times.  Google's monopolistic practices, regardless of what you think of them, are here to stay, and there may be a limit to how well Trip can compensate performing employees, etc, with that on the horizon, even after the Covid-19 issues sort themselves out."

Managers do not get appointed based on merit, but simply based on how long they have been in the company or who they are friends with.  Really bad decisions from the executive team which resulted in revenue losses and ultimately in huge cuts and job losses. The job itself progressively got worse as well, and what was once an exciting brand to work for, it has turned into a boring, repetitive series of tasks which are imposed from management, where everything you do is tracked in the system and leaves you with almost no room for doing anything outside of what is imposed(which is also a huge waste of time for the team, as it is a tedious admin work of reporting everything into the system)"

I've visited Google, Facebook, Amazon, Airbnb and all of these other big companies and I truly believe TA has one of the best office and food perks there is.","Management in my team was combative to each other and its employees. There was no transparency and meetings often tend to end up in a shouting match. Ironically, higher ups are very positive and optimistic in the wrong direction, often downplaying losses and headwinds. 

Also, for a company that is supposed to be all about travel, there is no clear passion for travel. People treat work as what it is: just work. It shows in the product: outdated, uninspiring and the metrics show it. Google will eat this industry up and the company is not doing enough to combat that."

They paid me well relative to other offers I got in the greater Boston area.

There are some truly great software engineers there, and a friendly slack server with scope for getting work done as well as general shenaniganry.

For a while I was working on an interesting and diverse set of projects which let me have a non-trivial impact on the performance of the site.","At the c-level and above, the idea of leadership is to either outsource things or personally nitpick everything.  There is no vision for what tripadvisor should become and no feeling of building towards something cohesive.  Despite this we still get hours of content-free all-hands type meetings where the high ups pat each other on the back.

The size of the company means that there are many non-good people working there, both in the engineering org and elsewhere.  This manifests in the form of many engineers essentially just punching the clock and not willing to question obviously pointless projects which now come down from an excessively huge PM organization which acts as a game of telephone between the ceo and engineering.

In the team I was on, there was a drive to report ""wins"" on A/B experiments -- the implication being that this would affect bonus / promotion etc.  This incentivized some of the worst statistical analysis that I have seen -- at this point the so-called analysts have basically adopted their own language for reporting results which justifies ignoring the p-values (e.g. , ""revenue is directionally up with 80% confidence"" as opposed to ""revenue did not change significantly"").  This combined with the overall shoddy state of logging at TA and the use of a pot-pourri of team-specific vanity metrics make it hard to believe any of the analysis.   This kind of a pro and a con since you can evidently get ahead by adopting these techniques, you just cant take yourself seriously as a statistician anymore."

I believe those people will always be attracted to Tripadvisor brand, despite the frequent chaos, fragmentation, in-fighting, human churn, etc. – great humans will always be a part of this company's culture mix.","Sadly, our CEO, Steve Kaufer, subscribes to your everyday run of the mill failing corporate culture. It's a feat to cultivate a decaying environment with a brand that has such wonderful and energetic natural momentum as Tripadvisor. During my 4 years at the company I reserved judgment of our CEO until now. Even though I witnessed an absurd level of micromanagement; the do-it-instantly and for $0 fires; and worse, the eyebrow-raising and inhuman approach to his customers and his people internally. There are so many great people here, and we're in it together, aware of the situation. Even though it stifles our innovation and career ambitions, we hold out hope. Maybe soon the board will decide there is a suitable replacement leader? One that can bring vision, inspiration, empathy, equity and diversity, and focus on our customers, which have been putting absurdly high $ into Steve Kaufer's pocket over the years. He showed us quite clearly with the January layoffs of 200+ people that his numbers were more important than his people. Of course it was obvious for us all along. Our greedy approach to our customers was backward and would be our downfall. Now, on the precipice of company contraction due to the global coronavirus, his $-first-people-last tactics are in full force."

When people ask me, “do you like working there” I can’t help but smile. While it’s a job and it is work, it’s a privilege to work here and I get to realize that again and again each time I talk to someone about Trip. Even just explaining what he culture and benefits are like here people are always blown away. Sometimes it feels like an embarrassment of riches as I explain it to people, they get more and more shocked as I rattle off the perks. Whether it’s the free lunch or the feeling of community across teams and levels, I find myself being just as impressed by my words as those I am speaking to. 

If I had to pick, the biggest pros about working here are our philanthropic efforts and the normalcy of volunteering amongst the employees here and the transparency from management. Our global volunteer days we have each year during the summer highlight something that is present all year round at Tripadvisor: volunteering and giving back is not only encouraged here, it’s expected. I am humbled to be a part of a company who highly values giving back to the world that it aims to help us explore. The transparency is self-explanatory. We are seldom left in the dark and are quickly informed of any moving parts or changes in the company.

Zero strategic direction and constant changes by senior management make it impossible for employees to achieve success. Rather than taking ownership, senior management blames lower-level employees and lays off hundreds.  

Poor decisions on major projects: the ""New"" TripAdvisor failed, as did Instant Booking. And have you seen the new logo? Ugly and a waste of time, money and effort.

Unlike most companies Trip actually cares about people being happy. They actively find ways to make the day better and your work environment the best it can be. It's something you notice every day you are there. 

The food is almost too good and the office has a very comfy / vibrant feel. The snack game is strong and constantly has new stuff. Everywhere in the office has a feeling like it was built to make you smile and not to cram as much productivity per square inch as possible like many other companies.

You are always working on stuff that people will see. No matter what team you are on it's easy to see your impact in the product. Similarly everywhere you go you will see Tripadvisor stickers, which is super cool. People really do love the Trip brand.

The CEO has an actual heart. Many times when not so great things have happened in the world he has stood up to say what's right. He doesn't hide behind what he thinks will have minimal shareholder impact but is maybe the right thing. He consistently takes a stand that I'm proud of.","Trip has a rough road ahead. Google has been pushing into the market and that has a massive impact on what the company can do going forward. They need to make some big choices to deal with that and those won't be easy. 

There's a ton of aging code and UIs that are difficult to work with. Obviously there are projects to deal with that but they are slow and you'll have to deal with some pretty old stuff. Projects can easily spend more time dealing with old cruft then actually writing the new stuff. 

Similarly there's way to many people working in oversized, unwieldy codebases. You never know when something will change out from under you or another team could break your code. That's supposed to be balanced by a group ""design review"" system but I've never had much faith in design-by-committee. At best people are impartial and at worst you end up with nit picking. Most of the time it's a smooth process but there's not really enough buy in from people to make it worth it. 

Almost all the work is  either reactionary or focused on bottom line impact. Projects are always focused on short term goals and rarely think of the longer term impact, market positioning, or brand value. If it raises profits by more than x% we ship it. Everything is an a/b feature test which get's piled into the code. As a result nothing is ever done with strong intent to get it right. 

Get ready for changes. Your working team will change every couple months. People are constantly shifted into new squads, team structures, re-orgs, etc. I can't think of a quarter where there wasn't some major change in who I worked with."

The benefits (health insurance, catered lunches, occasional swag) are strong when compared to other Boston based companies.

If you live in Boston, working out of the office next to TD Garden is great.  There are 2 floors that contain a few business units (primarily Viator and Bokun) and 2 kitchens.  Both kitchens have coffee/beer on tap, and can be a nice place to hang out with coworkers. Work- Life-Balance is also decent.

This is a cool company to work at if you're straight out of college, particularly if you work at HQ, since there are more employees/business units to network with.","Boston office location is rough when you need to commute to HQ in Needham, which they even have you do on your first day. The shuttle to HQ  takes an hour and the shuttle back to the Boston office takes 90 minutes, which is due to the multiple stops it makes along the way, directly through the city. This is brutal

Bokun specific, no matter your role, you will be tasked with a new goal every month. There is zero room for career growth, and skill development is minimal.  Compensation is significantly below that of most tech companies in Boston. Furthermore, the product isn't intuitive and is difficult to learn.  Half of your day-to-day is spent assisting with support tickets.

Individual contributors have a lot of previous experience, but that is ignored by leadership.  You're expected to  keep your head down and obey orders. If you can do this and like doing this, you're set."

- Dublin Office: it's becoming central for the company, not anymore just another office far from the HQ.","- Changes: this is a CONS if you are not ready for that. I've personally changed 4 roles during my career and you need to be aware changes are happening literally every second day in processes, products, organization, roles, tasks. This is not a relaxed place.
- Grey Areas: because of their constant changes, you might have uncomfortable situations where nobody knows how to move. Frustrating, but again it's an opportunity.
- (not) Working from home: this is not part to the benefits at the moment and can be a minus for those who have families living far or kids who get sick and need to stay at home.
- Unclear career path: this is gonna change soon, but in the past few years it was not clear how to move in order to progress in your career."

333,Tripadvisor,'Speed wins' does not guarantee you success for long term,2019-11-14,2.0,Software Engineer,"- Good benefits 
- There was one time when company was well known for traveling but now any  hotel/restaurant I talked to, all over Europe or anywhere in the world, everybody hates company.","Since the time they started booking on their website without any advertisement/marketing, the company has gone down really low that they started charging for everything on hotel/restaurant which they were not charging before. The result that People started hating company and move to different to different booking sites.

- Very high expectations to each employee. The reason is above. You will be given 4 days work to finish in 2 days without considerations of any meetings/reporting/monitoring tasks. So you end up working during the nights/weekends. And there is no appreciation of it as it is expected from you. 
  
- No work life balance. You work in Dublin hours but you might also need to end up working with US hours too. The engineering team in Dublin reduced to 8-10 from 35 in numbers. Now you can imagine Why?

- Poor management in Dublin and specially in US. The management from US put blames on you for even small things in front of whole team in the meeting and your manager from Dublin will keep quite and not even represent you.

- No appreciation of hard work. No matter how hard you work, they said ""This is expected from you""

- Every Friday,  Manager will have meeting to talk about your weekly performance which is like a torture no matter how hard you work. It ruins your weekend. Though you end up working on weekend to mitigate that. 

- There is just one person in the name of Human resource management which will only listen to you and ignore. No action is taken, no matter how much you try to explain.  The end reason people leave. 

- Last but not least, Speed not always wins if you want to run your business for long terms."

i started out as a contractor and i was nervous that being a huge company i would be met with arrogance or know-it - all attitude but I felt so welcome from day 1.
Every one in general was welcoming, helpful and now I am so blessed to have become full time and what an amazing team i am part of and all the other teams that i collaborate with.
I feel extremely supported in all ways - resources to do my job, opportunities to learn and a clear path to career growth.

I initially thought top management would  be inaccessible but they are open arms... Steve is very down to earth and has an open door policy where you can stop by in his office and engage with him or say hello!  I thought that was very humbling...  Management encourages to communicate anything that can improve us the employees and the company as  a whole without fear of intimidation.

In addition to the incredible free lunch, snacks and coffees, the benefits are also amazing , their vision of charitable work is greatly encouraged, the office setting is relaxed where by you can work from anywhere in the building or outside when the weather allows.

The  culinary staff and cleaning crews are very incredibly efficient. 

All in all i could go on and on but there is too much to say...So far I have had a wonderful and amazing experience working at Trip and I am VERY VERY HAPPY here..

The problem is, that people are treated without respect of identity, creativity, professionalism and innovation. Management does not listen to top talents, rather judges their ability to innovate and improve processes. What is worse, such talents will be penalized for driving success and innovation and seen as the black sheep, ultimately leading for them to leave. I have never seen something like this in any other company. It feels frustrating, and I can't understand what the reason is, but it feels as if the pressure is to high to cope with, and as a result leadership is not seeing what could potentially solve the problem. 

There is also a problem with compensation and top talents rarely get what they initially thought due to constant changes to comp plans even after a quarter closed."

373,Tripadvisor,Waste of time,2019-04-18,1.0,CSM,"- standard Dublin perks: health, lunch 3 days pw, snacks, 
- central office location
- some very talented colleagues","This company’s first and only priority is revenue, by all means, any mean, period, as they have struggled for years to innovate and monetize their traffic, which by now purely constitutional (IE: read reviews) 
Everything else comes after: product, employees’ satisfaction and retention, reputation, carrier progression, work experience, credibility and so on. 

Every single activity, initiative and change is aimed at either increasing revenue or reduce costs and payouts.
Here are some of the weaknesses in my personal view: 

-lack of real human values
-lack of long term vision 
-targets designed not to be paid out, nor understood by reps
-incorrect payouts
-unequal target settings between reps
-incorrect cpc retribution
-unresolved payout mistakes
-penalization of high performing reps
-lack of interest for anything that does not generate revenue

I could go on and on, having lived that toxic environment for long time, but the biggest disappointment was in relation to how they treat their staff: employees are simply workers, individual contributors,  just a number. If one leaves, the next one comes without any concerns.

When 80% of your staff has been in the company for less than 12 months, you'd expect someone to raise the point. But in TA nobody cares about the elephant in the room, everybody is too busy telling Stephen Kaufer how much of a great leader he is, bringing home their own salaries and pretend everything is awesome, you got it! And if you mention anything, you will be addressed as negative, a bad influence, toxic, the reason why staff turnover is so high!

This inability, or unwillingness, to take their responsibilities and push the blame back on the individuals is what makes this place a sad place. You are great when you are first employed, if you decide to leave you are a nobody, worth losing.
As a results sales people are sad and disillusioned after 3 months.

Personally, I would NOT recommend Tripadvisor to anyone: the name might look good on your CV but you could be learning and growing professionally elsewhere, being valued and made feel special, and actually enjoying the whole process."

* Best of both worlds: Better benefits than any small company I've ever worked for (lots of vacation time, flexible hours, mentorship opportunities, good health/dental/vision) as well as the great pay of a larger company.
* Willing to spend money to get employees what they need to do their job (as long as you don't abuse it) which can't be said for every company.
* The gym on-site is more than just some machines: they have people come in and teach group classes, have an incredibly smart trainer (shoutout to Andrew!) who will take the time to make a personalized workout plan for you free of charge, have deals with companies to help with meal planning and diets, they are currently running a series of classes on meditation and helping manage stress.
* More than any company, they do seem to truly care about their employees as people.
*** Very big culture of inclusiveness. Something that can be hard to find in the software world and that I am a huge fan of.
* This isn't really a huge pro, just something I like a lot: There is a volunteer day where everyone in the company goes and volunteers for the day to help give back to your community, as well as you can volunteer on your own time and TA will donate money to charity based on how many hours you volunteered (like getting paid to volunteer, but your paycheck goes to the charity).","Nothing that is unique to TA.

Witnessed so many different changes in management. But the values of the company don't change.
To them, you are just a number. A lemon to squeeze until there is nothing left and all your enthusiasm and passion is gone together with your ambitions.

They say speed wins and then take years to release a new product. Their price strategy is another joke, and clients are noticing it so they know they can renew their subscription at a much lower price just by canceling and then waiting a few months.
They are very good at copying their competitors but useless at innovating.
Here you don't think, you say yes and become a part of the flock, after a while, you don't even think anymore as they don't like people who come up with different ideas. 

This is inside sales for you at TripAdvisor.

In Oxford, our office is about to close because they are about to move the main office to Dublin.
It has been made clear to us in more than one way to look for a new job. But nothing is official, everything is always behind closed doors. We live in fear, when are they going to close the office? Some people have mortgages to pay, kids, etc ... but who cares?
Morale is at the lowest. We feel betrayed. We lost trust.

Another value of this company is transparency which has become our joke. But really it is deeply sad. Tripadvisor is playing with people lives.

Loads of perks (Free lunch, snacks, Health and well-being  benefit, Insurance options, Shares)

Generous salary, compensation plan and kickers (bonuses for over achieving!) - With the move to quarterly commission pay outs you have the added flexibility of time to hit your targets! Hard work is definitely rewarded! 

Plenty of training and personal development - With so much exciting change comes plenty of open discussion and training. TripAdvisor is all about transparency so the 'why' question is always explained whenever change happens.

Very approachable senior management - Both immediate and head of sales are always open to meet and discuss any issues or concerns you have. Managements success it measured on the success of their team, so they are always willing and able to help your get the results. I found everyone really personable and friendly.

Fast passed environment - TripAdvisor are on a warpath to further dominate the travel and tourism space through continued innovative development of various product solutions. As such, things are continually evolving in the company in order to maintain their competitive edge and market dominance.  Be willing to adapt quickly!

Nice to receive different types of healthy snacks each day of the week. Colleagues are generally a group of kind travel loving people. Insurance coverage is too good to be true that it can not be compared to any company.,"Unsure if the ‘manager’ is an actual job or just a job title on the email salutation... lack of product knowledge and support from hierarchy is the most heartbreaking thing one could encounter at work. I mean benefits are great, but in the end of the day we wake up in the morning to commit to our work in hopes that what we do make a difference to someone out there. You could see favoritism and covering of one another across the department and many intelligent talents had no choice but to leave as anyone who’s tried to voice out for change were shut down each time. Not a healthy organization... if your ‘in’ that’s great, but if your not... then all the best to you. No career development, no genuine appreciation, communication are not transparent from top down. Their policies and guidelines simply does not care about the owners and members. It’s just so sad to see that they’ve closed ears to new suggestions. The website bugs will take FOREVER to fix as well. If they don’t change, I’m not sure if they could keep up with this growing online industry. One of the company motto “speed wins” truly describes it all. Just do it fast and do it more, no one cares about the quality (but of course they say they do)."

413,Tripadvisor,Things are deteriorating,2018-10-28,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Employees are smart 
Engineer cares about work and quality","Been with Tripadvisor since it was at Needham.  It was a very positive experience the first couple of years, but since then, things have been deteriorating.  It could be because of stock falling, from high above $100 down to $30 some at some point, Tripadvisor has become more tense and cautious.  The motto the last few years have been 'cutting overhead'.  That so-called 'overhead' leads to following effects:  team downsized to half (many lefts but not many new fillings) but double up the works, snacks got cut down (even got rid of the paper cup on all of the upper floors), a handful of reorgs. 
When I started working at my current position, I realized the culture at Tripadvisor has not been better either.    For one,  Tripadvisor doesn't invest much in the employee.  There weren't much of the training.  For example, unless it's directly applied to the individual existing works, request for attending conference most likely will get turned down.  Over the last 6 years, I haven't got to attend one single conference.   Transparency at Trip hasn't been at it's best compared to other companies.  For instance, employees have submitted questions but never get answered.  At townhall, there is generally only a few minutes for addressing a few questions.  But one thing that has gone the wrong way above all is the management.  I've literally witnessed company letting the good employee go instead of working to keep them.  If management wants you to go, they will make things difficult for you so you can quit yourself.  If management thinks a team does not add value to their own agenda, they let the team slowly dying on its own instead.  There are good management, so it depends on which you joined, but CoreX eng management is not one"

Central Location
Some great work colleagues","I should have known by the stock price and the previous Glassdoor reviews where this company was heading but I was naive and deliberately overlooked the obvious.

Tripadvisor might have been a good company 10 years ago, now its long-term ongoing financial difficulties dictate the strategy. This company has been in recovery mode for years,  rather than invest mode and everything reflects that.

The global strategy is""survive this quarter and hopefully live till the next"".
I have been in similar situations before and the warning signs are always the same: increased targets and workloads, micromanagement, lower payouts and desperate revenue generating ""ideas"".

These ideas consist in re-branding an existing product, trebling the price and the relevant product managers prancing around like they discovered the theory of gravity. Meanwhile the client base is squeezed with unjustified constant price increases, sales reps are blamed for not achieving on their impossible targets and managers praise each others while the stocks sink, employees flee for their lives and and the company's global perception in the travel industry plummets.

Lastly, Kaufer is directly responsible for all of the above. This CEO failed numerous times to innovate when needed, launched the wrong products at the wrong time and most importantly failed to recover form a steady share price drop since 2014. All while holding tight to his chair and inflating revenue by gambling on non financially sustainable revenue models and products.

The lack of medium and long term strategy and self righteous vision makes working for this company a waste of time and energy for anyone who strives to ""feel good"" about what they do."
424,Tripadvisor,Poor planning poor performance,2018-09-24,2.0,Sales Engineer,The culture they TRY to create is an awesome idea. Top down leadership is poor and thus it fails before it can even get started.,"Classic corporate organization struggling to figure out who they are. They are very quick to say the people of the company are the ones most important but then top down leadership is so bad no one wants to work for their managers. Sales they don’t pay bonuses and commissions, engineers they treat like a bunch of replaceable nerds. Steve is smimy and it reflects in his management team. They don’t have a clue about sustainability lending fear to creep into every employees head. The hr department routinely lies and looks after the TA brand over principle and justice. Too bad as it could be such a great company, but hasn’t been since 2011."

I worked so many hours I wasn't able to go on vacation or take advantage of other benefits like the gym, yoga and meditation classes, etc.

433,Tripadvisor,A plague - avoid at all costs,2018-08-03,1.0,Manager,Free lunch isn't always free,"Steve Kaufer is a bully, who will pick on individuals until they reach their breaking point and walk out the door. Because he micromanages the entire business, TripAdvisor can never do two things at once. This leaves efforts that can be great successes (like Instant Book) as failures. 

In the last six months, we've lost all female executive leadership outside of HR (head of marketing, head of sales) as well as the male head of product. Steve has told us that he's going to hire two replacement presidents for this bloodbath at the leadership ranks. However, its been eight months and no hire has been made. 

The lack of ability to hire either these presidents over six months speaks to the fact that Steve spends his time filing bugs, calling out individual sales reps, engineers and marketers, and not executing on critical CEO tasks like strategy, hiring, culture, organization. Or potentially - just that the word on the executive street is that you should never work for Steve Kaufer.

TripAdvisor may promise you a nice stock based signing bonus - but you'll never realize it while Steve is the CEO."

- Great place to network with engineers. Lots of startups in the area are founded by ex-TripAdvisor employees.","- Little opportunity for advancement, and company badly attempts to hide this by promising more opportunities 'if you work hard.'
- Vague guidelines for how to properly utilize engineering rotation.
- Extremely poor management of technical debt.
- Outdated technological stack and senior management resistant to change.
- Tolerance of management/groups that are uncommunicative and insular.
- HR department is behind the times.
- Very little standardization of technology between groups or even employees. Having employees configure their own dev boxes is a prime example that cost enormous amounts of productivity for minimal learning gains.
- Code base is collapsing under its own weight. To their credit, they hired a senior engineer solely to mitigate this issue. 

When I left the company, morale was quite low.  Not only are there very few senior roles available, it is not attractive to take a senior role because the technologies and design philosophy are falling behind industry standards, hobbling ability to jump to other companies or even to change position within the company."
446,Tripadvisor,A few good things that make it hard to leave,2018-06-01,3.0,Product Management,"First of all, most of the people at TripAdvisor are great. I've never worked somewhere before where I genuinely felt like I had so many friends, not just colleagues. They are smart, interesting, thoughtful people who care about the community-- the TripAdvisor community and the larger community around. 

The perks aren't bad, although they are getting worse as the company starts to pinch pennies. Benefits are pretty good, as are the equity awards as long as you're in the right group. 

Work/ life balance is great-- people feel free to take care of their families first and work second as long as the work gets done. It's intense and you work hard, but having a life isn't incompatible with working at TripAdvisor.","Unless you are someone's pet, it's impossible to get promoted. You change managers so often it's hard to develop the relationship to get your manager to go to bat for you and really help develop your career.

Leadership is one to none. You can really experience a well thought strategy in terms of product and target settings. They are extremly talented at recording fantastic motivational videos that everyone loves watching. Truly inspirational. 
You will get really nice pay checks because compensation package is fantastic. Forget about uncertenty when it comes to targets, they will always put employees first.

generally, if you're fresh out of college, it's a great place to start your career. But if you get tired of doing the same thing without new challenges and want to grow your career, this is not the place for you. Basically it's just a great (read: easy and fun) stepping stone on your resume to help get you to the next bigger and better thing.","- no such thing as transparency, even though it's everyone's favorite buzzword. everyone has their own agenda and the sales reps pay the price

- no opportunities to grow; they rather you leave and learn elsewhere then hope you come back instead of investing in the growth of their current talented employees

- horribly unfair and uneven pay structures. people doing the same job are not being paid the same no matter how long you've been there. It's like someone is button mashing to get goals and salaries - no rhyme or reason

- management is a mess and judges people on entirely unjustified reasons that have nothing to do with job performance, then senior leadership practically bullies people out of their jobs (in hopes of bringing in cheaper college grads most likely)

- goals are entirely random and make no sense. every single person has a different goal and nobody understands why

- decisions are made by those who don't understand how humans act, they only look at numbers and data. no empathy for the little guys, even if that's half the business. they also don't understand as sales people, we can't keep asking for more money on a product that keeps performing worse year over year. 

- if you're not a ""senior"" person, they basically set you up for failure by giving you all the worst accounts that are ready to cancel, and leave your goal on par with good quality leads. leads should be qualified - not everyone needs this product and instead sales people are stuck trying to save garbage accounts that never should have signed up in the first place"

457,Tripadvisor,Great place to work... sort of,2018-05-14,3.0,Product Manager,"First and foremost... the people are incredible. Smart, fun, fairly diverse, and generally great at what they do.

It's fun to work for a company that has such a strong reputation, for a few reasons: (1) I don't have to explain what my employer does; (2) It's nice to get that ""Oooh, you work for TripAdvisor! Cool!"" response; and (3) Recruiters LOVE to poach from Trip, especially for engineers and product folks, so there's a near-constant stream of inbound interest if you're thinking about looking elsewhere.

The HQ building is really excellent - a top perk, with the on-site gym and locker rooms, the cafeteria, the outdoor space, the desks. It's easy to forget you're at work.

Benefits and perks are outstanding and include: excellent and cheap (or free) health plan plus dental and vision; 401K matching (up to 3% of your salary); free lunch with many diverse choices (salad, soup, sandwiches, pizza, multiple hot options, healthy choices, dessert, fruit, and more); unlimited snacks and drinks; the aforementioned gym; an annual personal travel reimbursement; significant charity donation matching;  annual fitness benefit which can be spent on many things including sports leagues; and much more.

Work-life balance is a priority (for most teams), meaning you can work 10am-7pm, 8am-4pm, or another set of hours if you choose, and can come and go as you please as long as your work is getting done. 

Best of all, you cannot help but learn a tremendous amount just by being part of such amazing teams.","I could have been at TripAdvisor a lot longer - I had no need to leave just to go elsewhere, but there were many factors that contributed to pushing me out the door. As a point of information, I left for a role at another company, so I do not feel like I was fleeing TripAdvisor - but I also don't feel like I was ""retained"" very well, either.  

More importantly, these criticisms come from a large number of conversations with current and former employees across the company - so while you should take them with some salt, also know they are not merely the ramlings of one person.

My criticism falls into two major categories: Management and Consistency

Management 
-----------------
There appears to be no focus on ""people management"" as a high-value skill set, particularly among those who have direct reports. In four years at the company, I had six managers - only one of whom seemed to focus in any way on helping his/her direct reports succeed in their careers. In fact, a number of these managers seemed far more incentivized NOT to promote their direct reports than to move them up the chain. In particular, most of the managers in the product management group appear less interested in managing people than in managing products.

One possible reason for this lack of strong management is that individual contributors are promoted to positions in which they manage other people without any regard for whether they (a) want to or (b) should be. Not only does this make for a really poor work experience for their direct reports, it also diminishes the experience for the manager. Other than engineers, no functions have a career path beyond (senior) individual contributor that does not involve people management - so even those who are not inclined to accept those responsibilities have an incentive to take them on in order to move ahead.

Because management are hired for technical competencies instead of a specific management skill set, there is a distinct lack of empathy - it simply doesn't seem to be promoted as a required trait or skill among those who are responsible for the careers of others. For example: on being told that my 4th quarter performance wasn't where it had been the rest of the year, I asked when my manager had noticed this change; he said ""a few weeks into the quarter."" I asked why he didn't bring it up (or even ask me if everything was alright), and instead waited until 2+ months later; his response was, ""Oh yeah, I guess I could have done that."" That's just one example, but it's fairly illustrative of the value (or lack thereof) placed on treating direct reports with compassion as fellow human beings.

Consistency
---------------
There doesn't seem to be any consistency between the company's stated ""values"" and management's actions. For example, ""We're always learning"" does not seem to be reflected in a desire to have managers learning how to be better at their jobs - apparently it's for the rank-and-file only. No matter how much upper management (particularly HR) want people to act according to the company's values, there must be incentives in place for each level to do so - otherwise the whole chain falls apart. Of course, this is not a surprise since middle management isn't chosen for their ability to lead but rather for their ability to perform as individual contributors.

Having worked in multiple groups within the company, I would also point out inconsistent promotion schedules and criteria as another issue. In particular, a ""Competencies Matrix"" was released for product managers - and was subsequently used in different ways to avoid promotions. Even after a representative from HR stated outright in a group, ""You do not have to be performing at the next level in all of these criteria in order to move up,"" at the next review my manager said, ""I didn't hear that"" - and nobody up the chain was willing to correct him.

Although a company of this size is due to have reorganizations on a fairly regular basis, the two groups in which I have worked over my time at TripAdvisor were subject to no fewer than 6 in less than 4 years, ranging from a simple, ""We're changing the reporting structure"" to a full-on ""We're being absorbed into a different group."" This has a massive impact on employee morale and was very poorly managed and communicated, resulting in an even larger negative outcome. Due to these changes, I went from reporting to a Vice President to being three layers below the same position in the span of 16 months.

Finally, in many cases pay is not commensurate with experience. Product Managers with 5-10 years of work experience are paid at or below market value, while members of the post-MBA product rotation program are paid 20-30% more from the start. Yes, we are attempting to compete for talent with other companies, but the toll that this revelation takes on the psyches of PMs who aren't in that program (particularly those who have MBAs) cannot be underestimated."

Sales quota change half way through the month if payouts are high, targets are increased on a regular basis and designed to reduce bonuses, new products are rushed and current products overpriced. The Dublin office is moving towards an outsourcing call centre setup, as directed by management. Employees churn is ridiculously high and management do not care the slightest. The company difficulty to monetize their traffic has led to adopt extreme measures that negatively affect the jobs quality, quantity and retribution. In essence, the only value is revenue, no transparency, recognition or growth opportunities, unless you are willing to say only yes."

Despite this I was very upbeat about the company and tried to recruit well qualified people I knew to work there (but HR rarely even responded to the emails and applications). The second year a new boss was hired who seemed very positive at first. Then we were given a lot of really poorly-created online learning modules to study so we could learn new tasks. The boss didn't care and couldn't fix problems when we had trouble hearing the content or following it. The job changed from moderating content to much more technical stuff very quickly. Then we were required  to work (remotely) specific hours and to be online for chatting throughout the day although our boss wouldn't say that it was a change in our job descriptions (it was). Then they outsourced our jobs overseas. My job ended. I've been in touch with former coworkers and only one or two of the original unit is still working there.

Decisions are driven out of Needham with little strategic consideration for the international offices or the territories in which we have a presence.  There are a few senior leaders who have ""global"" responsibilities in their title that rarely travel to offices outside of Needham. 
- There is so much pivoting that we are all dizzy from doing a 180 based on the latest change of direction.  We are a global company in the digital space that has to be nimble and flexible for the marketplace, but there has to be some discipline in how we think about product and marketing or you start heading to the land of inertia.   It is no wonder the company is struggling for the past few years.  The CEO often talks about playing the long game but we don't stay focused on a strategy, there is no real roadmap (it changes every week) and the words ""strategic planning"" don't exist. The process and hoops you have to jump through to do the right thing and drive the business is numbing.
- Speed wins is the company motto but the CEO and key executives do not embrace ""speed wins"" when it comes to the HR process, performance reviews, merit increases or bonus payouts.   It is an archaic, bureaucratic, political -- and from what I have seen something of a capricious and arbitrary process that does not value the employees who have allowed TripAdvisor to thrive.  Perhaps management only receives their compensation rewards and merit increases after the employee review process is completed and the employees have received theirs.
- Promotions are difficult to achieve for talented employees as management can be opaque on promotions and the process for promotions.  
- Turnover is rampant across most areas but especially in marketing.  The organization at large does not seem to understand or value marketing or publicity - other companies that do value marketing and PR such as Priceline, Expedia, Trivago and Google are eating our lunch in a space where we should be dominating across the board.   There are some brilliant marketing and PR professionals at TA who have been hamstrung by an organization who naively thinks that consumer behavior can be changed if you put a home page pop up message telling the consumer what TripAdvisor thinks it should do."

Old ways of doing things, hard to change culture or streamline processes.

Way too many meetings.

""Spec"" process and constant back and forth on approvals takes entirely too long.

The ""speed wins"" mentality is antiquated and honestly I never felt like anyone I worked with believed in it. If it mattered, we wouldn't have had so many meetings or rounds of approvals.

It took weeks and weeks of calls, meetings, and a lot of ineffiencies to even ship ONE small feature.

Layers and layers of reporting structures.

I oftentimes found myself in meetings with people wondering why they were even there. 20+ invitees and four people are talking while everyone else buried in their laptops trying to get work done.

Some folks have been there too long and stuck in their ways. Clean house.

Some poor work life balance at times. Some peers were working 16 hour days during crunch time on projects that never materialized. Emails being sent over the weekend.

Lack of career development & empowerment. Joined the team with the relevant experience, met my sales targets but my direct superior has no sales nor travel background yet set unrealistic KPIs as a result of senior management. We were not empowered to make decisions & the superiors with their lack of experience were neither mentors nor were they able to make good business decisions. Felt frustrated with the lack of opportunities to grow as an individual, yet people with less experience were given a pay raise & same title after restructuring.

Poor middle management: There was a lot of unnecessary politicking going on during my years in the team with the various changes. While things did almost change for the better during my last year, it took a dive when the wrong people were chosen to be the middle management. Felt a lack of communication between senior management to the people on the ground, mostly due to the poor choice of middle management who did not translate the correct message downwards. Middle management were just busy trying to keep their jobs & meet KPIs instead of doing what is good & necessary for the business.

Lack of soul & positive culture within the team: the culture of ""keep your job by hitting KPI"" translates to people who just do what was necessary to survive instead of what is necessary for the business to grow further. The sales floor was a frat party and sellers were just concerned about numbers than the customers. They did what was necessary to survive with unethical sales practices. The sales machine just lack soul and it became toxic to stick around anymore.

Lack of synergy between departments: each department work independently from one another though talking to the same customer. One department's decision can affect another but that was not taken into consideration. Unfair system that resulted into poor customer experience."

However once you are placed in a team, you are dead.

People:
In the whole year we have only one team lunch(no outing at all), all my manager knows is to stand behind people and asking how's it going. Those nerds in my team never know how to have a life. All they talk about is go home and watch cartoon. and they are pool on communucation with others, all cynic. 
When I ask how to find sth or can you give me a demo, they would say go google. 

Technology:

They never know how old their technology is . Java for websites, not willing to use new stuffs. You cannot find spark/ nosql/ redis/ docker/ whatever is industrial standard now. 

They use SOAP, HTML, Spring, all kinds of dead limbo stuffs.

Managers generally come for 3 years then leave. No one cars about long term profit.

Stocks:

Company miss market for 3 times now it is only $50, the revenue is even lower than 2014. I cannot think of any future.

Promotion:

Great people leaves. My best body at the team not at google and I am at another big company. When we reunion and talked, we both agree that manager does not know how to promote right people. Salary raise cannot even counter inflation. People's title does not even change after 3 years.

Benefits are way above average, vacation time is standard, sick time is very generous, the office in Needham is comfortable, free lunch is nice, lots of garage parking, they have a great system if you have questions/need help with office matters.  The recruiting process for Needham positions is way above average - fantastic recruiters and good, honest, timely feedback.","Listen to your gut.

584,Tripadvisor,The best place I've ever worked,2016-10-17,5.0,Head of Sales,"Well its taken me some 25 years but I think TripAdvisor might just be the closest any company can get to the perfect working environment. 3 things they get right above all else:
1. I work in CPM sales but we're never pushed towards a hard sell - its always with the long term view in mind.
2. The product and the audience. Development is always done with this in mind, never is the product's integrity sacrificed for the benefit of short term sales gains.
3. Company culture  - they genuinely have their employees best interests at heart and also have numerous company perks that make you really love working here.","Sales is a competitive environment and increasing targets every year despite a downturn in global events can become challenging - however no one ever said sales was meant to be easy!

The TripAdvisor group is expanding, particularly quickly in Dublin. It is a good time to come on board.

We get some great benefits and the office management in Dublin are always looking to take our ideas to make it a great place to work.

Summer outings/Christmas parties
High quality catered lunches 3 days a week
Team building events/competitions
Quarterly Sales/Engineering parties
Gym fees covered
Contributions to personal travel
Football team with fees covered for astro park rental
High quality lunches
Free snacks (all the latest health foods) HR will change food/drink to your needs
About half a dozen Nespresso machines with free coffee
Free beer/wine
Tech desks/Large monitors
Laptops that are responsive and modern OS
Medical/Dental/Health checks/Flu shots
Free clothing, towels, bags, tech books etc.
Working in an up and coming area of Dublin
Opportunity to travel/work at other offices if you wish

I have benefited from working alongside some very talented people
You can have input into quarterly goals. Ideas can flow up and down hierarchy
Management allow flexibility, if something comes up outside of work you can work around it.
Management are technical enough to understand contributions from engineers
Using great technologies","I found the first couple of months challenging as there was a lot to learn and it the place was too fast moving for people to be able to help you.

TripAdvisor has its HQ in Boston so the day really gets going around 3pm GMT which can make it difficult to cram in meetings before you go home but late starts are ok.

Buses to Docklands aren't great yet as it's a developing area and it is difficult to get accommodation in Dublin city centre at the moment."

-My work is challenging - sometimes too challenging but that is better than the alternative.  I genuinely like what I do every day which is not always true at every company. 
-I am a female in a Director level role.  I've been promoted 2x in the past 4 years, the first of which I was on maternity leave when it happened and prior to receiving the second promotion I had clearly expressed to my (male) boss that I was planning to expand my family again.

And let's be realistic: 35 hour weeks are what's actually happening.","Management can be pretty curmudgeonly in the face of new stuff, plus there's a def preference for older people in more senior roles. I get that soft skills (management, etc) do develop with age, so the same  young employees doing outstanding technical work may not be fit to advance into the existing (more management oriented) roles. That just means they need to figure out ways to use these people, because as it stands they leave."

It's an incredibly quickly expanding startup, so this may have something to do with it.

If you are lazy and don't have very good career prospects elsewhere this may very well be a company you join and cruise without putting in much effort for a long long time. 
Some great people who will likely all soon leave.","This is a company that has been able to survive a lot longer than it should because of the competitive advantage of the content. The company operates sort of like a family business. A lot of the very senior people exhibit zero skills in their area but seem to have lasted in the company so long because the CEO likes them. The management so out of touch with consumer needs (particularly in Asia) and seem hell bent on alienating every client and partner we've ever worked with. Teams are given tasks that mean they compete with each other or worse, do the same things as another team! The lack of career progression prospects particularly for middle managers is shocking. Anyone who is even mildly ambitious and good at their jobs are bound to leave in the next 6 months after realizing they have absolutely zero chance at a promotion. Stay away from this company. It is on a downward trajectory for sure."

I regret my decision so much because the benefits TA offers are only for the engineers and every other department. In my department we are seriously micromanaged and we have the most ignorant manager one can ever have. He doesn't know anything, every time we ask him a question he tells us to ask someone else. He is just sitting there and looking at numbers and gets paid a lot of money. He doesn't know how to talk to people despite all the training TA supposedly offers to their managers. There is no work life balance. I felt so motivated when I started but they easily rub happiness off your face when you find out that everything your recruiter said was mostly a sales pitch. I never felt more unhappy at a company. I drag coming in everyday and honestly I can't wait to leave, this place, better to say my department is giving me depression.

627,Tripadvisor,A Short Term Company,2016-04-29,2.0,Analyst,"I work for the tripadvisor brand under the tripadvisor umbrella...

Company moves quickly to changes, whether operational or big projects. (Speed Wins).

The business pushes staff to measure results - quantitatively. and qualitatively, on a regular basis which creates goals and projects to strive towards. 
Low level of politics due to a staff shortage. 
Regular company meetings with senior leaders Q&A.

Free fruit, cereal, snacks, beers and wine in the London office. 

The company is looking to re-build their HR / culture and values through a new leader so things may improve for the better.

A recognized global brand in travel.","Speed Wins: the term is used loosely by the CEO (Steve) as an attempt for staff to push to get things done really quickly but not perfectly. 
- This is really being lost in translation with management ; managers can push their delegates to get things done, be it the weekend or late nights; some managers have no concept of personal time and push to get things done in a speed wins manner at ridiculous times of the day (after hours) against conflicting priorities and against a lack of bandwidth. 
- Some large restructures are being put in place without scoping out many answers , which is leaving many people in 'limbo' creating uncertainty
- Some managers want things done perfectly in a speed wins environment
- I have a feeling that ""speed wins"" could be a strong cause of staff turnover within the business affecting some teams more than others
- you can prioritize the speed wins projects but if every large project every day is at a speed wins level, you'll probably burn out
- Speed wins created a humiliating and bad TV instant book campaign wasting millions

Leadership
- feels like many of the junior staff working at trip do not have any sense of leadership or entrepreneurial skills (this could be a recruitment trait which could be associated to hires not challenging leadership (?).
- Many senior staff are afraid of Steve K and his mannerism. He doesn't sound approachable or friendly.

Resources
- Feels like there is real shortage of people resources at the tripadvisor (Sales / Product) brand disproportionately to the wider org or compared to the Viator brand. 

Compared to other places I've worked, the culture and pace seems too overwhelming and I really don't foresee this as a long-term opportunity."

653,Tripadvisor,Sinking (shiny) Ship,2016-02-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free lunch. Honestly, everyone lists the free lunch as one of the few things good about TripAdvisor.  Consider how meaningless a ""pro"" this is.","TripAdvisor benefits from an advantage of having more content than it's competitors. Not only will this advantage not last forever, but the company risks having it's lunch eaten by another player using TripAdvisor's own API to display it's content in a more useful, relevant manner. The executives at TripAdvisor are more interested in muddling feature on top of feature, than they are in settting a reasonable and innovative strategy and improving their existing product. But culture eats strategy for breakfast, and the culture at TripAdvisor is breathtakingly saccharine, selfish, and void of anything approaching professional development or learning. ""Speed wins"" at TripAdvisor, which means any opportunity to learn, to grow, to succeed in something other than a wildly thrown together mess, loses. Speed wins so much that the code base is a mess, left to engineering to deal with (or run away from), and that sales can't even keep up with the new functionality. And that new functionality roadmap?  Doesn't come from the users. TripAdvisor could not possibly be any less user-centered. Product Managers rule the roost here, and their idea of engaging user feedback is a/b testing, and only a/b testing. Meanwhile, customer service is fielding thousands of complaints, but are put in the impossible position of either not being familiar with the (often new and fleeting) functionality, or having to just file a bug with existing functionality that has little hope of ever getting fixed. The supposed quality control of the PMs is ""Product Review,"" in which 30 people glued to their laptops, sit around a table, only to momentarily perk up 2 hours into the meeting when their spec is presented.

It is very easy for a Product Manager to insist that something be done over the weekend when they aren't the ones that have to do the actually engineering work. Not all product managers are at the same caliber either with makes the work even more frustrating.
- There is too much politicking. People have become territorial instead of cooperative which makes every day a slog.

TripAdvisor and the various companies they have acquired are all merging cultures, technology and processes.

671,Tripadvisor,Great place to work with very smart energetic people all around,2015-12-06,5.0,Many,"The People, The People, The People...to start with.  Great attitudes all around, in all of the departments i worked with.  There is a culture of hiring people not only for their intelligence and acumen, also that they are a good fit for the company, which leads to a very fun, yet demanding experience.   There is so much to learn from this type of a culture, and that is exactly what happened with me over the years.

Being part of the TripAdvisor family is also a great plus and I'm not talking about all of the bells and whistles that any established Boston company, or well funded start up has, but it leads to all sorts of possibilities for horizontal and vertical movement, which does, contrary to other reviews, very much exist.  You may start of in customer service and wind up in your dream job doing something completely different.  You may work on SOA engineering problems, but want to transition to mobile, those types of conversations are welcomed and encouraged.  Grated  you need to earn it, but once you have, they want to keep you happy.  

The office is great and well located, but that is just another ones of those perks of an established company.  There is flexibility, to a point, in your work days, which personally i enjoy.  The goal is to be available during core business hours for easy communication, but life happens, and you need to work from home on occasion, or leave early and catch up later, all of which are understood. 

Lastly, FlipKey has become part of the Vacation Rentals arm of TA, which has expanded the number of good people to work with, solving different problems and gaining experience in different technologies.  (yes i was an engineer there).  And as a former reviewer already stated, my soul is very much in tact.","There is a steep learning curve, and many things have changed over time, as is the case when you go from startup to successful business to being part of a larger organization, but with that comes opportunity, so it is up to you.  You need to be able to lead your own charge sometimes on assignments.  If that is scary to you, it may be difficult, if you're a self-starter, this could be a pro.

A more succinct direction from management the start of the year or the quarter would be great and does not always exist.  Not increase revenue by N%, but we're going to tackle X, Y Z projects b/c they help the company in a defined way.  The vacation rental landscape is evolving, so not always simple, but should always continue to be a goal."

What used to be a big company with small-company mindset of getting things done without red tape is now a corporate ""not-it"" culture with committees formed to discuss the upcoming subcommittee's committees over the course of unhelpful and contentious meetings where nothing gets accomplished.  
Decisions are often made politically rather than what makes sense - something that's evolved here recently - and half-baked products are launched and iterated after the fact (if there are any engineers that haven't (speed wins!) moved on to a new project already) at the expense of customer experience.  Engineers and experienced staff are leaving in droves and being replaced by the new influx of future management here - SALES.  It seems that making money has finally replaced the need for solid development teams to maintain quality products and features.
It's a real disappointment - and people aren't nice to you here either.  Good luck!"

Multi- cultural environment.,"When I joined Tripadvisor it was a great place to work. Since 2015 everything changed. The prices for the Business Listing rocketed sky-high. So called ROI selling was introduced, which is great but nobody knew if the numbers provided were real. And in many cases it was proven not to be the fact. Besides that paying up to € 36,000 to get your contact details listed is in itself a complete laugh. If the sales team dared to question this it was waved away by higher management. Nothing was wrong with the product offering, it was the sales team which wasn't good enough. Just before Christmas Steve Kaufer personally came down to Oxford ( because another senior manager was sacked) and said, during my next visit 50% of all of you will be gone "" and have a nice Christmas"". Due to this change Top performers starting to drop down ( and not reaching 80% of your target in 3 months means OUT). People felt demotivated, didn't reach their targets and therefore were left with little bonuses and started to leave. Including managers. The staff turnover is ridiculous. 65% of the Sales Executives left in just a couple of months. From most of team leaders you don't have to expect any help. The just sit theire and are watching, You Tube and Facebook. With Tripadvisor moving to Instant Booking probably the whole office is gone within 1 Year anyhow.

Not being able to have career progression when you deserve it, I had my promotion finally after 2 years of hard work and being a star in sales but there were others who deserved also to get their chance while some others had it and they never deserved it. The main issue with TripAdvisor is that the brains of the company and I mean the top management don't know exactly what is the value of Business Listing as our main product in our department so pricing kept changing for at least 5 times in the past 2 years trying to ""milk""the hotels by every mean, so today for example the sub fees are $499, then it's $1500 then another month $12,000 then back to $4,000! A hotelier would wonder where do we get our prices from and why we keep changing; the answer is the magic ROI! We estimate the hotels profits and therefor we gave ourselves the right to share their imaginary non-guaranteed profits with real expensive upfront sub fees instead of our old pricing sheets where it was fair to hoteliers and to sales people as well. Because of this unrealistic pricing and targets as well everyone now is jumping ship, thanks TripAdvisor for the lovely time and experience we gained but you have just lost your assets which are US THE SALES PEOPLE to other companies who will benefit from us and invest in us too. I am not happy I had to seek another job, me and the old and the fresh employees as well, when someone leaves now we say ""Congratulations"", and I advise anyone now who's applying to work for TripAdvisor in Oxford to have a quick look at the call center on his way to the interview room, what indication do you get when you see half of the desks are empty? 
It means only one thing; people leaving are more than people coming.  I would add more cons about working at TripAdvisor but I put the main one as this is what would interest someone applying now and wants to know the reality about this company."

I see a lot of the reviews form earlier here, and they seem to be from people who worked here when it was a startup and the atmosphere was super relaxed. We have moved on to a large international business, and the culture is different. We still have all the start up perks (Beer, Games, Summer Fridays, Outing, etc.), but we are also focused on growing a business in a competitive environment FAST.

You are told to manage your own career and there are resources available to you, but when you try and use those resources or have career conversations with your managers you get nowhere. Open roles are often not ""opened"" at all but instead people are hand selected to move into them based on preferences from upper management. A lot of decisions are made based on who upper management likes and you have to be constantly worried about getting on someone's bad side and blacklisting yourself at the company. The pay is not at all competitive and there's no transparency into what the range for any role should be. The raises are minimal each year and if you received a spot bonus or a promotion within the last year or two it will be used against you to make your annual raise that much lower. Overall there's no focus on retaining the people they have, which is why so many people are leaving."
719,Tripadvisor,Good company that has grown to an unfairness & unacceptable dimension.,2015-05-26,3.0,BL Sales,"I was part of the small team that contributed and saw the Oxford office successfully grow to become what it is today. I woke up each day happy to go to work. I loved my job and customers. I can proudly say I had a very low rate of cancellation of completed sales/orders. 

All around great atmosphere, great managers (to a certain degree only!). These sales managers are flexible with you only if you perform well. So this was at my advantage and I made most of it.

Coworkers are generally good although lots of moaning about everything. Don't listen or just pretend to follow but don't follow. At the end of the day if you're a positive person, no coworker's negative mind can bring you down.  

Fresh office, everybody is generally cool. I laugh and joke a lot and I've always tried to give everybody that vibe and energy. Can't work with sad and ungrateful people.
My daily thinking was: ""We've to spend the next 10 hours together... yeah..let's rock it!""","Low salary: But you can top it up by exceeding your given targets...

Sometimes salaries & bonuses were not paid on time. Imagine if you have bills to pay...

High percentage of unfairness: I would not put race into this as I believe this has nothing to do with this. But after working for this company for more than 3 years, ALWAYS exceeding their sales targets & focusing on total customer satisfaction and maintaining the lowest cancellation percentage as possible (tracked!), still I was never promoted. 
One of the team-lead purposely leaked the name of the person she wanted in her team. It was not me but a person who performed less than me and was at the company less time than me. 
The thing that I never understood is ""Why create an internal job advert when you know your preferences?"". 

No clear or possible career growth within the company: You've got to be a ""friend of"" to get promoted.

They like sending ""fake"" internal roles and take from outside. When they have a clear idea of who they want in a particular team, others are lured to believe in the next opportunity.

Strange and unhelpful HR team: A coworker expressed her concerns to HR, this person was sacked like a dog. 

Continuous and unexpected changes: Could be good or bad. But I was happy with this.

instability: People come and go continuously, even at senior managerial level. Not a good sign for a stable company.  

While working as a talent supplier my point of contact was miss xxx this person made my job harder. She clearly did not want me to work with her or for the best interests of the company as she made everything hostile for me. She would set up appointments/interviews with my candidates and not call them. She did not care...
But because I loved TripAdvisor so much, I would cover up and take the blame so candidates would not know. 
She clearly did not like me, It took her 3 months to send me the contract, and only after my ex-manager's push! 
When asked why she was treating me this way, she could not even give a proper answer. Poor ex-managers could not help on this occasion.  Because of her, this time around I had no other chance but to turn the TripAdvisor page for good. 
This girl acted like it was her dad's company. Sad!

The communication from upper management ceased as did the incentive to give extra effort.  New management made no attempt to get to know any of the employees.  We began to more closely imitate our competitors when building new features and it always felt like we were a few steps behind.

Direct manager is pretty opened to work from home if needed","Where to begin. This is not a rant it is fact of what happened to me and others.  They are very disingenuous during the hiring process.  you are offered all these promises in the offer letter if you meet the goals.  Your director and direct manager gives you a rave review and tells you that you are an exemplary employee and you have met and exceeded your goals and you are set for full bonus and salary increase this year.  Then comes to actual salary increase of 0% and a tenth of the bonus promised in your offer letter.   I was told this happens to everyone their first year, I had to ask, did I hear that right???  yes I did.  very disappointing when one leaves a very good job to come to TripAdvisor in hopes of bettering them selves and then they are lied to during the interview process and in the offer letter. the praise does not justify the raise (or lack of) In good conscience I could not recommend this company for employment.  There is a very high turn over here as the work life experience isn't great and the treatment of workers in-regards to compensation.  I worked weeks away from my family and 15 to 17 hour days building this company out, and there was no thanks.  My direct manager and Director were great but at the VP level i believe they are out of touch and don't allow the lower management to have any intercourse in the compensation benefits other than rating their subordinates. Also it is hard to get anything done as the upper management in my group manages by intimidation, everyone has their management style but in this case it makes lower management overly nervous to take acceptable risk in doing the job.   Some may say that this is my experience only but, please read other reviews, I am absolutely sure you will find others just like this, along with some good reviews.  For a college hire this may be a good fit and jumping block but for a highly skilled professional like me it was literally a slap in the face and insult.

You are not allowed to be creative or create your own customer base, you will have to work on the list they provide. Very unprofessional and no career growth. Have seen 8 people leave in 2 weeks.

Compensation could be higher.  The bottom line is that when a company transitions from an independent start-up into an alliance with one of the industry leaders and ""corporate"" changes are made, there are going to be a lot of adjustments, with many of them being extremely challenging and not necessarily suitable for everyone.

Bright, experienced, talented and motivated colleagues
Usually there is good work-life balance, interrupted by bursty but fairly regular insane stretches","An obsession with measurement leads to missing the bigger point all too often and driving perverse incentives as well as a silo'd, unhelpful org structure. A few examples - a product team wants to experiment with a promising new feature, and suspects it would drive more user engagement. But if that metric has not been previously identified as important or is difficult for someone in sr management to understand, then either the project will get killed or won't be applauded. Meanwhile a minor turn of the screw on a revenue-generating feature will require an all-hands on deck effort ironically without any holistic analysis of the ROI of that effort. In other words, hooray that we raised revenue on that feature by .5% but at what cost (direct cost and opportunity cost)? No one knows, because no one measured it. Further, you have sales or BD teams feverishly optimizing around their singular metric and potentially squandering a customer or partner opportunity for a value trade that is sub-optimal. If teams had better alignment and communication, TA could figure out the best first home for a customer and partner and work out the most logical order to grow that customer and mutual value. Sr management rarely cares about nor addresses this conflicts, it takes a few employees who care about the bigger picture - at direct personal cost to their own short-term success - to effectively do the right thing.

Lots of hiring but without any evident positive effect on the process and products. One eng group has grown 2-3x over the past year, and the release process is totally chaotic and broken. Honestly things worked better when we had a few great engineers vs this mess of people all stepping on each other.

The company constantly says that it is metrics-driven and a meritocracy, but when a team or an individual delivers on and *exceeds* stated goals (in some instances by 50%-300%), there is still unbelievably wide latitude given to management with annual reviews, awarding bonuses, and advancing employees -- coupled with the most opaque system I have ever witnessed. Zero transparency on the review, comp and bonus process. People should not be shocked during their annual reviews, especially when they over-deliver; they should be thanked and properly compensated. And - it should go without saying - employees should have expectations properly set by managers well ahead of the annual review. Much more training is needed here, and it needs to be pushed aggressively as a cultural norm to have open and host feedback with regularity.

Majority of the focus in on a few small teams to eke out teeny tiny improvements to optimize revenue

The weekly reports and product reviews talk about +.3% wins and similar micro-steps, which on the one hand makes sense for this relatively mature company, but also is about as dull as dirt in terms of interesting projects for smart people to work on longer term career objectives

Promotions are virtually nonexistent, but the company is happy to ask already-busy people to take on additional roles during times of turn over.

A lack of interest in retention has led to high turnover by really talented people up and down the seniority spectrum.

There has not been a head of HR in well over a year, which speaks volumes about where the priorities and values rest. 

Lack of any organized effort to integrate acquisitions - teams, products, assets, etc.

New opportunities (revenue, tech, partner) have no logical evaluation process or home / team. You could take a promising oppty to 3 different teams without any commitment or next steps from them. As a result, Trip misses out all of the time on being early to market in new areas and then turns around and blames people internally for not being part of the ""cool new thing."" Also very US-centric sr mgmt team POV. If they have heard of the company or technology personally, then they (sometimes) rally behind it, but if it's huge in a foreign market, good luck getting anyone's attention until it's way too late to structure a substantive agreement."

The free lunch 3-4 times a week is good plus the unlimited snacks and drinks. A nitpick here is that they tend to restock the drinks nobody likes and cycle out the ones that I like and are gone. 

Developing is fast paced and changes can be shown to others very quickly after completion. This is a full stack development which allows for all engineers make their own design decisions for the implementation. There is good communication with the product managers which allows the engineer to give a fair amount of input. 

The people at the company are awesome. The culture tends to be laid back in the teams and the environment promotes asking other engineers for help on difficult sections. 

There are a bunch of training classes for spoken languages and other trainings. However they are not easily accessible or I never felt that they were easy to seek out. It would be better if fewer were offered at a time and have a visible place to access and sign up.  There is some support for this but it could be better. 

There are plenty of things to do at the office, including video games, board games and a foosball table. But aside from the foosball table, these get rarely used if at all.","Mobility within the company is difficult. In order to switch teams or offices you need to be excellent at your current position. The culture for this is one of blame. Bugs you introduce are tracked and remembered indefinitely. These all detract from the excellent rating. This is a serious problem, if you are placed on a product that doesn't interest you, it is difficult to excel and switch to another part. 

Work life balance is not the greatest. Engineers are advised that 40 hours is the minimum, and working beyond that is a good way to show their exceptional work. 

The code base is not in the best state. Code is often copied and pasted which leads to errors or outdated code permeating the entire website. Encapsulation is not very well achieved because of this. Similarily the opposite can occur, where several different ways of doing the same thing are implemented as part of different projects which introduces inconsistencies.

754,Tripadvisor,Make sure you know what you're getting into,2014-12-12,1.0,,"Very friendly people, with the exception of a few individuals at the senior management level
Good soft benefits","Micromanagement - some individuals at the senior management have a tendency to manage by treating employees as robots, and dictating how they should do technical aspects of their job - an area that they know very little or nothing about. Senior management needs to understand when and why employees become unhappy, and how this leads to lower work efficiency. Nobody will think lesser of you if you understand your competencies and stick to them instead of preaching to others how they should be doing work and managing their time. 

No real direction - During my time at FlipKey, the ideas used to improve the website all had a neutral outlook at best (if not bad for the business). Seems like most of the changes made are either through trial and error or by copying competitors. If the business stays reactive to the market, then there is really no reason that the firm should grow. The only reason the firm is still doing alright is because they are riding the ""Vacation Rental"" market wave. Once this space becomes saturated, I do hope that good innovations have been made so that they can still command a share in the market - for the sake of its employees.

Not caring about the end customers - most of the 'impactful' decisions made were to nickel-and-dime the home owners and the travelers. If this is the best that the firm can think of to improve revenue, then there is a serious problem with long term planning or understanding of value and what customers appreciate. Its tough to work for a company when you have little to no faith in the value of the product or its potential to grow anymore. 

Employee attrition - most of the employees that understood the business well (founders, people who were very close to the Vaction Home Rental industry) have left, and many other employees left the company in hordes because of senior management. Everyone who has left felt unappreciated, which is somewhat of an understatement. This is primarily due to the employees that have populated the ranks since the TripAdvisor takeover. The company still has a flat structure from its startup days, but is anything but startup-like anymore."

Nice people","When I interviewed for my role, every person I talked to emphasized that we're a ""speed wins"" culture.  Now that I'm in the company, I realize it's just words.  You can't actually do anything without approval from the CEO.  Every request for new headcount requires his approval, and in some cases takes month to finalize.  He often pushes back on headcount requests for reasons such as ""don't agree with years of experience"" or ""role should be a level J, not a K"".  I haven't been able to figure out if he's a micro-manager or if he doesn't trust his leadership team (or both).  Additionally, I believe the company is grossly inefficient.  Many acquisitions have been made, and it doesn't appear as though there are any plans to integrate the companies.  I understand sometimes that is done for strategic reasons, but I don't see how the company will scale with so many engineering teams, so many marketing teams, so many distinct sales organizations, etc.  Sadly, everyone I've talked to who has joined TripAdvisor from larger, more established companies seems to feel the same way.  The company has such a strong employment brand, but then you join and can't wrap your head around how the company has been able to be successful at all.  I suspect TripAdvisor is trying to hold on to the ""small company, start-up type"" culture, but sometimes a company needs to accept that they're not small anymore (almost 3k people now) and needs to start acting like a larger company."
767,Tripadvisor,Good place for a starting engineer,2014-10-19,2.0,Software Engineer,"--Development--
For engineers who are just entering the workforce, TripAdvisor is an awesome place to start a career.  The mandate of full-stack development allows engineers to gain crucial experience on many common, though somewhat antiquated, coding frameworks.  At TripAdvisor, there are plenty of examples of winning strategies and failing strategies.  Observant engineers will learn as much about what not to do in software development as they will about what to do, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Experience in both frontend and backend development, along with guidance from talented fellow engineers, will set engineers up well for their next employment jump.

--Benefits--
TripAdvisor employees get a $250 once per year personal travel bonus to help compensate a hotel stay or plane ride.  The medical package is good for single employees and decent for employees with families.  There is free lunch on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.

--Culture--
There are a lot of very smart people, engineering and otherwise, who are social, friendly, and inviting of newcomers.","--Environment --
TripAdvisor prides itself on moving quickly, our motto is ""Speed Wins"".  Sadly, that motto is more often used to justify making poor design decisions to quickly finish small projects than on identifying new trends within the industry and acting on them.  As a result, many sections of the codebase are in disrepair.  Poor code from previous projects often hinders developers' ability to achieve the goals of their current projects and are frustrating to encounter on a deadline.  Upper-management is also reluctant to spend money and man-power fixing problems that slow down development.

--Compensation--
TripAdvisor is a good place to start a career, but it is not a good place to continue one.  Hard work is rarely rewarded and the pay raises are relatively flat.  Last year's bonus cycle brought modest pay raises that were about on-par with cost of living increases.  The realization that new hires are compensated on par with or better than employees who have been around and know the codebase creates morale problems.  Many engineers here take this is a signal from management that unseasoned engineers are worth as much as current engineers and that career advancement is limited.

--Benefits--
Although the company has offices around the world, engineers are discouraged from visiting them.  It isn't that the benefits here are bad, it's that there is nothing that really stands out."
768,Tripadvisor,So much potential but unhealthy work environment,2014-10-09,2.0,Anonymous,"Fun subject matter, consumer recognized brand","Poor talent management, micro-management from the top leads to lack of empowerment, limited career growth opportunities, lack of integrity and honesty throughout management, very poor recruitment.   

Generally - the company is laughably out of touch with current employees and culture - just one read of all the HR responses on Glassdoor touting access to the CEO and that Trip still operates nimbly and like a start up highlights this complete lack of understanding ...It's NOT a start up anymore - it's a 1500+ person company, and the CEOs door is NOT open - and nor should it be. That's the whole POINT of management in large companies, something that Trip now is. 

Trip was once a great company but unfortunately, it has not scaled well. First step in solving this is to stop pretending that all 1500+ employees have access to the CEO to give feedback and stop implying that it's the employees fault the company is poorly run.

These “pros” may sound inviting at first glance, but the snacks/dress code is now standard across tech companies/startups, so this is nothing to be wowed over.","Where to start… TripAdvisor fully bought us out at the end of 2013, and I can’t stress enough how awful this place has become.

1.     Management: The complete management change from the TripAdvisor buy out is really what has driven this place into the ground. To start, nearly all of the original FlipKey management has either been forced out, or quit on their own, which has resulted in TripAdvisor robots filling all of the open management roles (as there is zero opportunity for growth and advancement from within). Rather than being judged on the quality of our work and the happiness/satisfaction of our clients, we are only graded on metrics. The only thing that matters is how many emails we send per day, how many cases we close, how many calls we make, etc. My hours are 9 am – 6 pm, but we are looked down upon if we don’t come in early and stay late (although we don’t get paid overtime). My manager requires me to be at my desk at all hours of the day, aside from lunch. If I step out to make a phone call or run to CVS across the street, I have to let her know. She reads through my emails to clients and will proceed to make corrections, and send me her updated versions to point out what I need to improve on, or how I could have phrased something better. Weekly check-ins have recently been implemented to go over every hour of my day, and to figure out how I can improve/how I can accomplish more. It doesn’t matter how hard I work or how well I do, I’ve never received praise or compliments, only told (in a rude, condescending, negative tone or email) I need to work harder and longer. Additionally, the clients are frustrated and unhappy with the TripAdvisor management change, so any client facing roles here at FlipKey are brutal as the clients are frustrated, upset, and downright mad.

2.     Culture: Yes, there are snacks, kegs, and a ping pong table, but these “startup environment perks” do not make up for the terrible morale and high turnover rate. The far and few existing FlipKey employees are really the only good people left.

3.     Pay: the pay is HORRIBLE – equally as horrible as management. Pay is significantly lower than similar roles at other companies, and annual raises barely exist, resulting in lack of future earning ability as well.

4.     Room for growth and advancement: none whatsoever, in any department. FlipKey has zero interest in helping their current employees grow and develop (especially since the TripAdvisor takeover) and instead, hires externally for nearly all open positions. I’ve tried multiple times over the past 3 years to take on new projects and learn more about various fields of the business, but I have been denied with every attempt. The worst part about this is that management is well aware that this is a major issue, but chooses to do nothing about it. The only way to survive here is to keep your head down and do exactly as you’re told."

The company will give you some cool swag every now and then and some fun work outings to keep you happy.  The benefits are also very good.,"Sales is a complete disaster due to extraordinarily poor management.  It's pretty bad when 50% of a sales team leaves in one month (and more to go soon) because of 2 people.  A complete mass exodus is going on here!  The majority of the junior and senior team are trying to move internally or leave the company all together.  Goals are extremely inflated so that it is impossible to collect monthly commission.  The big heads simply do not want to share revenue with the little people.  Work goes unappreciated.  

The structure of the account model is a mess.  Territories were taking away...moving to an automated system which has been broken since January.  The Speed Wins culture is a joke...it only means that they launch systems without thoroughly checking...resulting in larger messes and more fires to put out that before.  

Managers have a closed-door policy.  They only know your name when you are making money.  The second you have a bad month...don't expect a hello in the hallway.  

There is zero upward mobility based on merit.  If you suck up to the managers then you will be ok...but if that isn't your style then you are out of luck.  You can be a top performer but if the boss doesn't like you for whatever reason than you will rot on your desk for years to come.  

So to recap - no organization, terrible leadership, no upward mobility, no commission...and some of the worst base salaries compared to other tech companies from within the industry.  It's a great name on the resume but honestly not worth the headache and depression you will get. Also to put the cherry on the top - HR is corrupt and in cahoots with management, so if you every have a serious problem with your manager...don't bother going to HR."

Sales Agents and Account Executives have to find out on their own (or by customer complain) about changes made to site, prices or CRM messaging.
Employees are always asked for feedback, but in the end it always goes the other way round and their opinion is not counting at all.
No internal communication between different departments.
Management not qualified to lead a multi billion dollar company"
794,Tripadvisor,"Great Work/Life Balance in a ""Speed Wins"" Environment",2014-05-11,5.0,Senior Content Specialist,"The work environment is very collaborative and enjoyable.  The company truly cares about their employees and offers great benefits.  Everyone at this company is incredibly smart and you will learn something new from your peers every day.  Things move very fast at TripAdvisor as the company still tries to keep its ""start-up like feel"" even though it is well beyond that point.  Despite the ""Speed Wins"" Motto, this company promotes a great work-life balance and encourages its employees to travel and have fun.","If you are looking to grow laterally or switch tracks within the company it can be harder to do than at other companies.  They offer classes in other areas to encourage their employees to grow, but in terms of making an actual title/role switch it seems hard to do."
795,Tripadvisor,"Amazing people, incredible benefits, terrible job.",2014-05-09,2.0,Customer Care Associate,"The people are amazing. I wouldn't have stayed for as long as I did if it weren't for the friends I made at this company. Seriously, they're smart, funny, and incredibly fun. The culture took a big hit when the company was bought out by TripAdvisor and management was replaced, but it's still an inviting and energetic culture. And the benefits are crazy unbeatable.","Underpaid, overworked, and absolutely no opportunity for growth. Some of this was just the nature of the job and the growth of the company. The user base of the company got bigger and TripAdvisor wanted to make up for the sale, so what resulted was an understaffed department getting demoted to nightly and weekend shifts, *suggested* overtime (with a lack of fair compensation), and general commiseration. But like I said, this is customer service, so you're already dealing with unpleasant people--and don't kid yourself, these are unpleasant people on the phone. Lost my faith in humanity on multiple occasions because of these people screaming into my ear all hours of the day. 

The biggest con though was the lack of opportunity. This was supposed to be a foot in the door type of job, and the people I worked with were also all overqualified. But because of the shift in the company's direction, everyone got stuck there, and will likely remain stuck until they up and leave. They'll give you ""projects"" and you'll feel like you're contributing for a while, and you'll get some recognition for the great work you do, but then you'll realize you're just taking on extra work and not getting paid for it because raises are a laugh and bonuses are a joke."
796,Tripadvisor,The great stuff is fantastic and the not so great stuff is not so great.,2014-05-02,3.0,Support Function,"There are some wonderful people across all the departments; very smart, engaging, passionate about their work.  I genuinely looked forward to seeing my co-workers every day. Their benefits are amazing and they do a really great job of staying on top of what the competition is doing in order to attract and keep talent. They feed you great food several times a week and the snack options are free and have everything from fruit to fritos.  They are incredibly generous about trying to keep their employees happy with ""stuff"".  The CEO is incredibly generous when it comes to supporting a variety of charitable organizations.","With the exception of one or two folks, the executive team seems completely uninterested in what the ""worker bees"" on their teams are doing. I think in the time I was there the exec for my group spoke to me a total of 10 minutes and that was because I approached her. I never saw her walk around and check in with folks -- I recognize they are extremely busy, but how hard is it to take 15 minutes a few times a month to walk around their departments, talk to people and make them feel like having them there makes a difference? The company is not THAT big and if you are still selling yourself as a start-up then you should know the folks on your teams.
If you want to be promoted WHO you know is far more important than WHAT you know. Being a SME in your field and working hard is great, but it probably won't get you promoted, it will just get you more work.
I will still refer friends to certain departments or teams, but I would make sure they know the good, the bad and the ugly and let them decide for themselves whether or not they want to pursue a career at Trip."

Young, fast moving culture and a great office space, moving to an even bigger office in the future. Great product, trusted source of travel reviews, company is making money.","Turnover! It seems like most of the groups are being impacted by turnover, a lot of employees have left the company for greener pastures, the performance rating process and raise %'s being very low for a company that is very profitable, seems to be the common thread. The HR team is non-existent, adds no value to the employees or senior management, and has had more turnover than any other group at Trip, even the most senior leader of HR left along with the leader of compensation. Not sure Senior Mgt knows how bad the turnover problem actually is."

He didn't and never respected others' ideas and efforts and hard work. I am so so glad that I made the decision to leave there because I felt that I wouldn't have any career advancement if I stayed for 1 more day/month/year.

It was so funny that my team went through a series of org change and the managers are new to the team. Since they took over, people kept leaving. What they did accordingly was to hide as much as possible the news of people leaving, instead of clearly and openly talking to current employees. And once i told that i wanted to quit, the vice president of the team stopped talking to me, pretending that i was not in existence any more.

It continues to innovate and diversify it's products and has placed itself in a position to continue to do well.

Compensation and benefits/perks can be very good.","It can be a very political environment, you need to have relationships with the right people to succeed in the long term.  Often management is not concerned with how things are done, just that they get done.  This trickles down the chain and employees are often viewed as resources to achieve a goal regardless of the impact to them.  In many groups you either sink or swim and if you sink you can get thrown under the bus and can become the scape goat for a unsuccessful project or initiative.

I also agree with a previous reviewer that noted that TripAdvisor is keenly aware of glassdoor reviews and strongly encourages current successful employees (those that just got promoted, had a good experience, etc) to write positive reviews on working at Trip. While there may be nothing technically wrong with this, the approach seems odd for a company based on unbiased reviews."

Also I want to note that in the time I've been here, the company has been growing quite a bit, and some of us had started getting concerned about losing some important parts of our culture, but upper management took this issue very seriously.  The CEO himself set aside a lot of time to chat with us in a small group setting about specific aspects of the culture that we felt were important to maintain.  I'm not sure exactly how much an hour of his time is worth in company dollars, but it absolutely solidified my company spirit.

Management keep hiring new sales person even the market is bad and saturated.

No career growth in the company, you will be doing the same thing for years and many years.

Commission pay-out always delayed and happened many times, and they don't see the urgency and importance to pay commission in time. what a joke, this is sales organization, every sales person are rely on commission on their living!

You can learn faster and you know that everything going out the door is quality work. The benefits package is excellent. I loved the recreational travel reimbursement.,"The only con would be that there is no longer a dedicated UI team. Each engineer is responsible for their own UI with varying results.

861,Tripadvisor,Top-notch engineering group in the Boston area,2013-01-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"TripAdvisor treats its engineers really well, with top-of-the-line MacBooks, 30-inch monitors, and frequent opportunities for hackathons & book groups. If you are having trouble, it certainly won't be due to lack of hardware. Everyone is super-intelligent, and even as the company has grown, it has maintained its culture of encouraging frequent face-to-face communication between product managers, designers, and engineers. Work/life balance is encouraged, but employees have a high level of passion about their work, and it never feels like anyone is just there from 9-5.

The company is very data-driven in its methodology, with frequent tests to see which site changes have the most impact. This approach means that small, incremental projects are often favored over large, 6-month initiatives.

TripAdvisor is very popular with users and it is always a thrill when friends and family use the site to plan their vacations.

Lastly, TripAdvisor is a place where any software engineer can build a large network, whether they are a new college grad or have been in industry for a long time. The level of cross-department communication is much higher here than at other companies.","A few areas could be improved. Historically, the company has not had cutting-edge UX design in its DNA, but clearly a continued focus on UX design will help the site improve. All of the engineers are smart, but also extremely opinionated, which makes design & code reviews somewhat more of an arduous process than they need to be."

874,Tripadvisor,Disappointing,2012-09-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Started when part of Expedia. I loved the benefits and perks.  We lost some perks when spinning off from Expedia. When I started, the company was smaller, teams were about 1/3 of the size they are now and I felt as though the treated their employees like gold....with mediocre pay but awesome bonus structure. Snacks, lunches, outings etc are great...but not enough to create career satisfaction.","Very poor management and very top heavy.  ""Lead by example"" is not something practiced here.  Nothing is confidential with your manager or HR.  Teams are heavily micro-managed.  Individuals who are successful in their positions are encouraged to stay in their position.  Management is incredibly short sighted thinking you're best for the company at status quo instead of grooming you for greater things. They have lost many talented people due to this practice.  Poor performers are consistently promoted due to ""friendships"" they have with senior management.  That being said, promotion from within is incredibly limited especially when considering upward mobility within your own team.  Morale is incredibly low. Annual raises are below industry standards and below cost of living adjustments."

The benefits (other than vacation time) are the best around and the people working here are genuinely nice and smart.  Truly the best working environment I have ever been in.  I may have gained 10 pounds though due to the amazing free lunches and the unlimited ""snack"" wall.","As I mentioned above, they could be better about vacation time, especially for a travel company.  You start with 3 weeks vacation, no personal days.  They give ""Summer Fridays"" but you end up having to put in 40 hours during the week that you take a summer Friday so it doesn't really feel like a perk.

Also, there are a lot of layers of management that probably do not need to exist.  TA could save some money by eliminating a few layers.  They can get a lot more productivity out of the staff they currently have."
879,Tripadvisor,An opportunity to work with extraordinarily talented people in a flexible environment,2012-07-18,5.0,Director,"Unlike their peer tech companies (Amazon, Google, Facebook...), TripAdvisor has the flexibility to allow people to move into new roles.  If you don't like what you're doing, you can talk to folks and try out a new role.  Engineers are regularly encouraged to rotate through other teams to get new perspectives and ways to work.  In some cases, the movement is through to non-engineering departments.  Again, unlike most places, TripAdvisor works to prevent the ""round hole/square peg"" problem.","It is a little intimidating to work with this many smart folks.  You have to play at the top of your game.  I would also prefer the office to be in a cooler location.  Then again, we're outgrowing this space, so perhaps we will move."

some travel benefits","as many others say, tripadvisor is not a company that takes risks. that leads towards a lot of complacence as well as frustrated/hindered talent. probably a primary reason that many have left, as i did.

marketing team runs amok with inflated egos. sales team seems to be a complete joke (leadership is epitome of wheelers and dealers who couldn't sell a product that required any calculated or strategic thought whatsoever, much less have the professionalism, innovation or foresight to keep themselves relevant for that much longer). product and engineering teams (just hire more actual engineers, and less ops folks) look ok, though seem to lose someone important once a quarter 

senior management is fooling themselves thinking this is a start-up. you're far from being a lean organization, my friends. deal with the growing pains. reward employees that deserve to be rewarded. communicate proposed changes and request as much feedback as possible. put more things up to vote. take a hard look at your middle mgt because you have redundant and irrelevant folks holding up the contributions of direct reports. and finally: take a darn risk with a product once in awhile. the facelift for the site last year was ok but it's time to give people something to really talk about with your UX and interface."

Honestly some of the most unfriendly/hostile management I've ever encountered.  The HR people who should be the nicest are some of the worst!

And the free lunches are almost too good.","Although Trip strives to keep a small company atmosphere, it's far too big for everyone to know everyone else, and I feel like the informal communications network has been stretched to its limit.

We were given a full week free just to work on hacks of our own design and present them at the end.

Great place to become really good at web development and make good money while you're at it.

The recruiters at the other big tech companies know about TripAdvisor and their engineering standards.","Your experience can differ a fair deal depending on which team you intern with.

Travel time to and from Newton can cut into your free time if you live in the city. The shuttles to and from Cambridge help a lot, though.

Using a 30"" monitor all day makes your computer monitor at home feel small."
898,Tripadvisor,"Lots of smart people, but you'll probably get bored after a year or two",2011-09-12,3.0,Software Engineer,"Everyone in engineering is extremely sharp and capable.  This is a great place to get some hands on web development experience on a large and complex site.  You will be writing server-side code that must scale to handle millions of requests, not just CSS/javascript when I say web development.  The engineering philosophy is to encourage all engineers to handle all layers in the stack so you will be writing CSS and javascript though, in addition to backend code.  This cuts both ways.  It's really interesting when you're starting out because you will learn a lot and feel a great sense of ownership over the entire project you're working on, but after a while you might decide there are parts of the stack that you'd prefer not to work on...

My compensation was pretty good when I started and I got a nice merit raise after a year.

Your engineering co-workers will be fun to work with and more than willing to pull their weight.  I didn't encounter any dead weight while I was working there.  The hiring process seems to do a good job filtering out under-qualified and under-performing candidates.","The interviewing process is very heavy on algorithms and data structures questions which might make you believe that those are the kind of problems you'll be encountering on a daily basis.  This really isn't the case.  Trip needs to hire really smart people because there is a very large, 10+ year old codebase and often times a project will require making changes/additions to parts of this complex web of interconnected classes.  Basically, it helps to be a genius if you want to read the code and understand it.

The interviewing process also serves as an excellent weeding out mechanism, but many of the recent grad hires don't really have any real coding experience so the maintainability of the code they write leaves something to be desired.

The reality of working here as an engineer is that because they want you to work on the entire stack for every project, you will be writing a non-trivial amount of CSS and javascript.  At first, if you're like me and really never did that kind of work before, you'll learn a lot, but after a while you might get tired of trying to a page element around the page and making the styles look correct in IE6.  There are some projects that are heavier on this than others and your mileage may vary based on the group you're on.  After a while if you realize there are parts of the stack you'd like to avoid, it becomes difficult to avoid them.  Changing groups is something that is discussed as a viable option, but it's pretty difficult from what I saw.  Your manager might try to take these preferences into account, but you will not be able to escape IE6 display bugs if you're in a group work on any user-facing code. If you're completely opposed to doing any client-side work don't work here, or make sure you're being hired into a group that never does live site work.  

The management hierarchy is flat (but growing taller), which means that your chances for advancement aren't super-promising.  You can see some people being groomed, shaking the right hands and playing the politics correctly to be promoted into the lower management layer.  I wasn't striving to be a middle-manager in a 100+ person engineering dept. and if you want to stay on the coding side of the fence there aren't really many places to go.  They hire startup-minded people so churn is inevitable.

If you're smart (and you are if you get hired here), you'll probably be intellectually challenged for a year or two, learn a lot, and write code that millions of people will use daily, but after that you will probably get bored and want to move on.  The nature of the skills they help you develop makes you well-suited to work at a startup because you've worked on all parts of the web development stack and you're now familiar with lots of the non-engineering aspects of creating and maintaining a profitable web site."
